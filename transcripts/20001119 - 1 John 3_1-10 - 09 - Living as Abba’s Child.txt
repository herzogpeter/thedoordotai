1 John chapter 3 as we pick our study up in the third chapter, the first verse. Before I read the text, maybe while you're kind of looking for the text, I'd like to just remind you that last week, John's teaching indicated that it is our simple and pure love for Christ that serves as a great protection against the many deceivers, deniers, so-called knowers and liars who can at times be so confusing and intimidating that even authentic believers may begin to wonder, am I missing the boat? Have I gotten it wrong? Am I even in the faith? Remember and remain, therefore, John said last week in what you've known from the beginning. In other words, when things get complicated and confusing, come back to what is simple, Come back to what you know. And what these original readers of this epistle had known from the beginning, from day one in their walk of faith, was simply this, that Jesus was the sweetest name they knew. Well, today as we enter into chapter 3, John takes all of that and pushes it a step further, saying fundamentally this, it's not just your love for Him that protects you from the deceivers and the deniers. It is also His love for you that provides this protection. Indeed, part of what we need to remember and remain in is that before we ever loved Him, He ever loved us. John says exactly that in chapter 4, verse 10 of this epistle, when he says this, Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us first and sent His Son. Well, in chapter 3, verse 1, John says all of that this way. Behold, what manner of love the Father has given unto us that we should be called the children of God, and such we are. For this reason, the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are the children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we shall be. But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him just as He is. And everyone who has this hope fixed on him purifies himself just as he is pure. Now as we come to verse 4, we're entering into a section that some people have a hard time even seeing as connected with the three verses I just read. If you don't understand them in context, they can be kind of disturbing. The truth is, I don't think you can understand these verses I'm about to read without holding them to the first three verses. They are as follows. Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. And you know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him sins. No one who sins has seen him or knows him. Little children, let no one deceive you. The one who practices righteousness, and that's the key. The key word there is practices. Works really hard to get good at righteousness, is righteous, just as he is righteous. And the one who practices sin or works really hard to get good at sin is of the devil. For the devil is sin from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose that he might destroy the works of the devil. No one who was born of God works really hard to get good at sin, practices sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God. By this, the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious. Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, the one who does not love, nor the one who does not love his brother. I've entitled this talk this morning, simply this, Living as Abba's Child. What did you think about that? Abba's child, where did that come from? Let me explain that. The name or names we use for God, how we personally address Him, reveals a lot about what we think of God and how we relate to God. In the Scriptures, we see many names for God. Adonai is a name which makes reference to Him as Lord. Elohim recognizes Him as the God of hosts. El Shaddai recognizes Him as the God Almighty. Jehovah Jireh, he is God our provider. Jehovah Rapha, he is the God who heals. In the Old Testament, many of you know that the people of God, out of reverence and awe for God, thought it not fitting even to say the name of God. And they came up with a kind of hybrid name for God, removing all the consonants, leaving only four Hebrew letters. Y-H-W-H. It became the most sacred name for God, Yahweh. But it was this name you couldn't almost say. but one day someone came along and used a name for God that no one had ever dreamed might apply to him it was an old word very common and very simple so simple in fact that even a child could speak it infants in the nursery could babble it it was often the first word that little babies would learn often muttering it without recognizing what they were saying or doing, saying it by accident the word was simply this Abba. Abba. A word that translates from the Hebrew into English as Daddy, Papa. A term that speaks obviously of intimacy, familiarity, accessibility, a hundred miles away from this Yahweh perception that we couldn't even say his name. Now we're calling him Papa? What's going on here? See, 2,000 some years ago, Jesus of Nazareth, a man who most knew to be at the time nothing more than a carpenter's son, was talking to God one day when he called him Abba. As far as his know, no one had ever thought of or dared to speak to God that way before. But what really needs to be noticed about this reference to God as Abba from Christ is that it speaks to more than Jesus simply calling God by a new name. For it speaks to the fact that Jesus was living his life in an entirely new way. He was living as Abba's child. And the best part of that reality for us is this, that not only did Jesus live as Abba's child, but he invites us to do the same. Indeed, he came to make that possible. Indeed, he came to show us how to live as Abba's children. Paul in Romans 8.15 is arguing for the fact that yes, you can enjoy this kind of relationship with God. And he's arguing it with people who are struggling with that because that's not how they're used to relating to God. Hear him speak these words. Romans 8.15, for we have not received the spirit of slavery leading to fear again. Why would he say that? Because these people to whom he's speaking were used to a relationship with God that was kind of based on fear. And everything they were doing or not doing was being done or not done out of fear, hoping I don't get hit. Maybe I'll get rewarded somehow. But, Paul says, because of Christ's gift, we have received a whole different spirit, a spirit of adoption as sons and daughters of God, by which we can now refer to the immortal, invisible, sovereign creator of the universe as Abba. I'm going to tell you, people who were afraid to say his name had a hard time warming up to that. But the message of the gospel, among other things, was this. We can live a whole new way. We can live as Abba's child. John says in this epistle, all of that this way. Behold what manner of love the Father has given unto us, that we should be called the children of God. And such we are. Beloved, behold, now we are the children of God, which means that we can live a whole new way. We can live as Abba's child. Some years ago, a book was published entitled The All Better Book. In it, the author interviewed children, which is always an interesting thing to do. And what he did was ask them what they thought might be the solutions to some of the world's great problems that adults had no idea how to fix. Well, let's ask the children. Well, one of the questions in this book that he asked was this. You know, kids, with the billions of people that are all around, and even in this gymnasium right now, just people, shoulder to shoulder, all over the place, people are still lonely. Isn't that strange? That with people all over, people are still lonely. What do you suggest? That was his question. Well, as you might guess, these little children came up with answers that were predictably funny, sometimes, however, painfully poignant. One little girl said, well, I think people should just find lonely people. We should go find lonely people, ask them their name and address, and then find people who aren't lonely and ask them their name and address and just get them together. That would just fix it. Another little boy named Matt said, I think we should get people a pet or a husband or a wife and take them places. That would work too. I like this one. A little boy said, well, I think we should make food that talks to you when you eat. The kid's lonely. He would say, how are you doing this morning? And what did you do yesterday at school? Is there anything bothering you that you would like to talk about, kids six years old? I was particularly drawn to that one because this is a true story. when I was a little kid, about eight years old, six years old, somewhere in there, I had my serial talk and I talked to it. But it wasn't like, how you doing? It was more like, I'm going to kill you. And the serial was, it was. And the serial was begging for mercy. No, please, no, please. It's true. That's true. That's absolutely true. And my parents, when they would look at me, they'd go, he's going to be a pastor. I just know it. Anyway. Another little boy, Brian, seven years old. What do you think we should do with people being lonely? He said this, I think they could sing a song, stomp their feet, read a book. Sometimes when I feel like no one loves me, I do one of those. Let me ask you a question. What does the human heart do when it doesn't feel loved? Sing a song, stomp your feet, read a book. Get lost in work. Maybe drink lots of beer. maybe get real religious maybe go buy lots of stuff when the human heart doesn't feel loved what does it do? maybe it goes from one lover to another lover secretly searching for someone who maybe would cherish me and not just use me what does the human heart do when it doesn't feel loved? sometimes we decide that maybe if we make enough money or acquire enough things impress enough people we can prove that we're worth loving and so we set about our life's agenda to make enough money, to acquire enough things, to impress enough people. Sometimes when the human heart doesn't feel loved, it sinks deeply into despair. Sometimes when the human heart doesn't feel loved, it rises up strongly in rage. But John in this epistle, as a father to his children, says gently but firmly this, beloved, there is another way. There is something else that you can do. You can live as Abba's child. Well, in the time we have left this morning, I want to talk about what that means to live as Abba's child. I want to talk about what that involves. The text reveals at least three things that it involves, and this is not exhaustive. I'm not going to tell you everything this morning that it means, that it's involved in living as Abba's child, but I'm going to tell you pretty much everything that this text reveals, And the text reveals three pretty important things. First of all, it says this, that living as Abba's child means embracing a new identity. Secondly, that living as Abba's child means understanding a guaranteed destiny. And third, it means entering into a highly motivated, thoroughly joyful kind of purity. If you're really just trying to get a real quick handle on it, three words, identity, destiny, purity, Abba's child, marked by those three things. Let's look first of all at this identity thing. You are his child. Now, what I want you to get here on the front end is that the idea that we could be called the children of God is to John stunning at first. Maybe some of you could ho-hum this, but not John. You need to understand that John is coming from the background. He grew up in the proverbial home, as it were, that viewed God as the one who was distant. Yes, he is awesome. Yes, he is reverent. And that is very, very good. but we can't hardly say his name. And now I'm being called into the relationship where we're being called his children. He says it this way at the beginning, verse 1, Behold, that is a term of astonishment. Behold, what manner of love is this? That little phrase, what manner is this? It's very interesting in the Greek. It's only one word. Patapain is the Greek word, and in classical Greek it means from what country, race, or tribe is this? In other words, John is saying this, what kind of foreign love is this? What kind of love that I have never heard of growing up in church ever heard of? What kind of love is this? What planet did this kind of love come from? Because though I have felt loved in certain areas, I have never seen, I have never seen this kind of love because this kind of love coming from God, who I've pretty much been afraid of my whole life, is declaring me to be not just forgiven, not even just redeemed. He is not just claiming me to be a slave of his, though quite frankly, I would be willing to be a slave of his. Paul said that. I declare myself a bond slave of Christ. But God's perspective toward me, says John, is he's not just saying I'm a slave. He's not just saying I'm exonerated. He's not just saying I'm even allowed to live. You're a dirty, rotten sinner. God is a holy God. You should burn in hell. Okay, I'll let you live. I'd be grateful for that, but that's not what this is saying. What's causing astonishment to John is this otherworldly love that goes way beyond, you're just forgiven. This kind of love is calling me his child. And that just sends my mind and heart on tilt, says John. What it means is I belong in the house. I'm not just a guest. I'm not even just a welcome guest. And that feels good. Doesn't it feel good? Some of you are going to go to lunch somewhere, maybe this afternoon, to a friend's house, and you feel very, very much at home. and you feel welcome and that feels good. But there's a difference between being a welcome guest in someone's home and feeling like you can put your feet up and feeling like this is your home. This is where I live. John is saying this is where I live. God is trying to tell me that I can sit at the table with him and I'm the object of his affection and watchful care. I am my father's son. You are your father's daughter, and in this relationship, there is no condemnation ever. Correction? Yeah. Discipline? Sure. Condemnation? That scowl of scorn that says, what kind of idiot are you? Never. That kind of scowl that some of you have received from your physical father and mother that makes it very difficult, even now as I'm preaching, to embrace the wonder of you being the child of your Abba in any positive way. You need to know that your father God's perspective toward you as his child involves no condemnation. Correction, yes. Discipline, yes. Condemnation, never. In fact, nothing can separate you from the love of God, your Abba. Life can't do it. Your own sense of shame can't do it. Now, your own sense of shame and life can separate you from the feelings you have of being loved. But none of these things can separate you from the love of God, his perspective toward you. principalities can't do it, powers, things present, things to come, nothing high and mighty, nothing low, down and dirty, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, our Abba, which is in Christ Jesus. This little phrase, that we should be called the children of God, that we should be called, another one of those things you kind of slide over, but it has some significant meaning in the original languages and just with some history, it refers to that very special moment when your child is given a name. Some of you have ever had children, you know that to be a significant time. Some of you, if you're pregnant right now and preparing for that, or you remember one of the things that parents invariably do when they're preparing for their little baby to be born is they get these name books, these books of names, you know, scouring the name and looking for which is the best one. You often use biblical names as we would anticipate the possibility of the character of this biblical name being on this child that we are bringing into the world. Sometimes we name our children after someone that we love or care about, and the same principle is involved. Part of the naming of a child after someone we love is that we really admire this person, but we would hope in some way the character of this person would be on this new precious person. Sometimes we name children, and even here there would be some great thought in this, but we just kind of like the way it sounds. And I don't know, it kind of depends on where you are as a parent. I remember Bonnie and I got married pretty young, and we had our first child of 23, and then we had four children. And near the end of this process, we were, you know, I mean, our last, our fourth child was Christopher. Christopher, which means one who was like Christ. The one before him was Caleb, and that's the faithful one, the one who was one of those spies who went out and everybody else saw a negative thing, and he saw something more, and I wanted that spirit on Caleb, and I wanted that spirit of Christ on Chris. And Erica Joy is our second one. And Joy was what we wanted for her. And Joy is all over that kid. And Andrea just sounded good. That's all. Watch that. Just sounded good to us. We're 23. What do we know? Anyway, it just sounds good. I say a little word about Andrea. I just found out recently that Andrea, what Andrea means is strong woman. In Hebrew, it means woman of God. See, it didn't happen in any of the others. That was her sister that was laughing. Like, Andrea is a strong woman. She sucks the air out of the room wherever she is. That was the laughter. Thank you very much for ruining my sermon. I don't even know where I am anymore. And I'm saying all this to make a whole different point. Come back to me now. See, in John's day, giving a child a name meant everything I just said, but it meant more than that as well. It was the claiming of relationship. The best example of this is in Matthew 1, verse 25, when Joseph named the baby Jesus. You remember the circumstances. Mary, his betrothed, not his wife, was pregnant. Not from him. From the Holy Spirit. Okay. And he had trouble with that. And he struggled with that. And then he came to believe because God spoke to him as well. But he had to make a decision. Is this child going to be mine? The fact that Joseph named him is significant. you see beyond just giving him a name what Joseph was doing was claiming him as his own saying this you will not be an orphan you will have a physical father you will be my son and I will be your father you're mine you're mine behold what manner of love is this that we should be called by God his children hear God say to you you're mine you're mine to live as Abba's children therefore means that my life is no longer grounded in or dependent upon how I look, what I wear, how much money I make, how popular I am, what status I achieve, what neighborhood I live in, how many people like me or don't. I might care about those things and be sad if I don't have some of those things, but the fullness of my identity now as a child of God is rooted and grounded in that fact that I am Abba's child. But here's what I know about me, and I know it also So about you. It is sometimes hard to live in that place where I am myself, embracing that identity as being who I truly am. So here's my question. It's the question that pressed itself upon my spirit even this week. Am I living as Abba's child? Are you? Well, I just kind of let that question hang there. Let me press this thing a little further, go further through the outline. Living as Abish child means, first of all, embracing a new identity. It means understanding a guaranteed, that you have a guaranteed destiny. And your guaranteed destiny is this. I love this. That you're going to grow up. That's your guaranteed destiny. As a child of God, using this analogy of a child, you're going to grow up. That's your guaranteed destiny. And you're going to grow up to be just like your dad. It's in verse 2. Beloved, now we are the children of God, and it has not yet appeared what we shall be, what we will fully be in our mature state. But we know, we have this promise. When he appears, we will be like our Father. We will be like our Abba. Because we will see him as he is. Now, back off this analogy. I really want you to see this. It's very rich and important. You know, one of the analogies you know that I love to land on all the time that speaks to our relationship with God is that of bride and groom. That we are the bride and he is the groom. And that calls to things in us. Sometimes it's pretty uncomfortable. calls to a level of intimacy that we struggle with in our relationship with God. And I love to land on that. Well, this whole epistle is not dealing with the bride-groom analogy. This whole epistle, 1 John, is dealing with the child-parent thing. And that one doesn't call so much out of us the issue of intimacy as it calls out of us the issue of maturity. And the promise is here you're going to grow up. Now, here's the analogy as a kid. You know, when I was a kid, a toddler, My dad was the biggest guy on earth. I mean, he was a big, he's huge. Why? He wasn't that huge, but to me, he was huge. And he would walk through the snow, and he'd put his feet where he put his feet. And as a toddler, I was right behind him, going, trying to put my feet there, and I couldn't reach. I couldn't do it. I was trying. I wanted to be just like my dad. I wanted to walk where he walked, not because he was even special in my eyes at those days. This is just what toddlers do. They want to walk, but I couldn't do it. I couldn't keep up. And I would stumble and fall, and I'm never going to, I'm never going to. My dad, a good father, a good father you know you can't keep up but you know what you will you will now now a father who who isn't a loving father would turn around and see the toddler not keep it up and turn around and go you idiot kid when are you gonna learn and just damage damage oh my i'm trying dad i'm trying no the loving father just goes picks that kid up and goes you know i'm glad you're trying you will one day your legs are gonna grow you know you get in the kitchen with your mom or your dad and some little boy or girl is trying to help with the meal you know what i promise you i promise you you're not helping much. You're not helping much. And there's flour everywhere, and you probably break a pan, and the parents, we lose our patience, and we look, you goofy kid, get out of here, just get out of here. No, no, no. The loving parent just goes, you know what, you're really not making a very good meal right now, but you will. You will. So stay here in the kitchen with me. So keep trying to follow me here. See, you keep, and your legs are going to stretch, and you're going to get stretched. You get out in the garage, and you start working on the car, and you're not much help. You're not. In fact, you pick up the tool, you drop it, it makes a dent in the car. You stupid kid, get out of here. Which is what I would say. No, a loving father would say, you know what, you're not much help. But pick up that tool and give it to me. I'm going to give you something you can handle, and someday you're going to be able to fix this car. Here's the promise. It's written. It's right in that verse. It's right in that verse. You will grow up. You will grow up. And some of you are at a stage in your own spiritual development where you're a toddler, and these things move you and they stir you, and you're trying to put your feet where God the Father puts his feet, and every once in a while you get it on the first one after church. You know, after church, I got it there. And then Monday you start to take another one and it's nowhere near. And you go, I'm never going to grow up. Yes, you are. Keep on putting your feet where God puts his feet. Keep on desiring to say what he said. And then you turn into this adolescent. Physically, we turn into that. And spiritually, we become adolescents. And you're gawky and awkward and every once in a while it comes out and it just shines and you look like your father and you look like your mother. And it just looks incredible. and then the next thing you fall flat on your face, and sometimes you just want to get angry and walk it all away, and your father in love says, yeah, you are an idiot right now. But I love you, and one day you're going to be a man. One day you're going to be a woman. You're going to grow into this. Don't quit trying. It's going to happen. The promise of verse 2 is it's going to happen. Notice the phrase at the end of verse 1. It says, for this reason, what reason? We shall be called the children of God reason. the world does not know us because it didn't know him. That's one of those phrases we could easily skip over and it wouldn't probably bother you if I didn't deal with it, but it's a wonderful phrase. What does it mean? Let me tell you. First of all, in order to understand it, I want to identify the world that doesn't know us because it didn't know him. We met the world a few weeks ago in 1 John 2, verse 16, when we discovered what John means by the world. We found that what he meant was that it is a system dominated by Satan that's driven by three things. Remember what they are? The lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life. Now hang with me here. The logic will flow, hopefully. Because the world system is driven by those three things, lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, boast of pride of life, it is only on the basis of those three things that this world system will ever see anything as valuable, lovable, or desirable. In other words, what the world will recognize, or using the word of the text, what the world will know as being desirable, beautiful, or valuable will be the things that appeal directly to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life. So if you are involved in the world system, if that's where you live and breathe, how you look, what you wear, where you live, how you perform will be what they notice and value about you. That will be what they know, as it were, about you. And that will be the basis upon which they determine whether to them you have any value. Abba's child is what you are? Well, as long as you look good and perform well, I suppose it's okay if you're Abba's child. But if you're part of the world system, the people in that system won't care about that. That's not what they'll see about you. That's not what they'll be drawn to in you. That's not what they'll care about in you. As long as you look good, perform well, then they'll like you. Be Abba's child if you want. But that's kind of over there, totally irrelevant as to whether I care about you or value you as a human being, as a person. So if you don't happen to look good, and if you don't happen to perform well, This world system will not know you at all. What does that word know mean? It means they won't value you. That part of you is not something they'll care about. Back to the verse. They didn't know him. They didn't care about those things in Jesus. Well, when he was doing miracles and feeding everybody, they liked that. But the true authentic identity of who Jesus was when he consistently tried to reveal, they didn't care. They couldn't see that. They didn't know him, and they don't know you either. They're not looking for that. Peace. By the way, this speaks to the church and why John was so adamant a couple weeks ago when in chapter 2 he was saying to the church, love not the world system, neither the things that are in the world system or the things that drive the world system, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the bolts of pride of life. Because even if you're a believer, you can sometimes get caught up in that system and begin to value people even in the body based on things that appeal to. The lust of the flesh, blessedly eyes and the boastful pride of life, and you won't any longer see, even within the context of the body, the value of men and women among us as being Abba's children. We will value them on how they look, how they perform, what they can do for us. And it destroys people, and it destroys the body of Christ. But here's the good news, verse 2. Again, now my paraphrase of verse 2. While it is not yet apparent, especially to those who are kind of wrapped up in seeing things the way the world sees them, while it is not yet apparent to them who we are, Abba's child, or who it is we're growing up to be, just like our father, rest assured of this one thing, Abba's children, that when he does appear, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. When he came the first time, his glory and beauty was veiled. When he comes the second time, the glory and beauty of who he really is will be unveiled. When he came the first time, some people were able to see the glory and to discern who he really was. But the world system was blind, didn't know him, didn't know him. One day everyone, every knee will bow, every tongue will confess to the glory of the Father that Jesus is the Christ. We will see him as he is. as he really is, beautiful, powerful, valuable. Verse goes on then and says, and we will also be revealed as we really are too. Even though the world right now doesn't see you this way, as Abba's child, beautiful, lovable, valuable. Abba's children, just like him. Colossians 3, 4 says exactly the same thing, a different way. When Christ, who is our life, is revealed in his full glory, then we also will be revealed with him in our full glory. What that means is Abba's children will be revealed as having the kind of beauty and value that the world system never noticed, never wanted, never offered, never had. This little section here is speaking of what we've referred to in the past as the great reverse. The great reverse is this. The first shall be last. and the last shall be first. And those that the world system driven by the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life discern to be weak and insignificant one day will be revealed as having real strength. And they had the strength the whole time. It's just that the world system could never see it, never valued it. One day it will be made clear. For in that day this world system driven by the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life will look as empty, ugly, and worthless as it really is and always has been. Brennan Manning in his book, Abba's Child, that I've referred to several times in the past, tells a story, a story that I've told you in the past several years ago. It's a story of a kind of dream that Brennan had or a vision, some thought in his mind about two people. And these two people represented two different ways of life to Brennan. And they were embodied in two imaginary characters. One was named Carlton, the other Moe. Let me read you the story. Carlton Hayes, a magnificently chiseled athlete in his early 20s, 6'3", 185 pounds, bounces on a trampoline, flashing his irresistible smile. The crowd is gathered. He switches to skipping rope, a dazzling display of coordination, agility, and grace. The onlookers cheer. Praise the Lord, shouts the athlete. Meanwhile, Mo, one of Carlton's team attendants, approaches with a glass of Gatorade for Carlton. Mo was in his early 50s, 5'4 and paunchy. He wears a rumpled shirt, open it to collar, tie askew. Mo has a thinning sliver of matted hair extending from his temples to the back of his head where it disappears in a clump of gray-black hair. The little attendant is unshaven. His bulbous jowls and one glass eye caused the spectator's eyes to dart away. Pathetic little twerp, one man says. Just an obsequious star-struck hanger on, another says. But what they don't know, what they can't see, is that Moe is none of that. For Moe's heart is buried with Christ in the Father's love. He moves unselfconsciously through the crowd and extends the Gatorade gracefully to the hero. He is as comfortable as a hand in a glove with his servant role, for that is how Jesus first revealed himself to Moe and ravished his heart. Moe feels safe with himself. Stop right there. Can you say that? Moe, this twerpy guy, feels safe with himself, even in the middle of people who don't regard him. The story goes on. That night, Carlton Hayes will deliver the main address at the banquet of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes who are attending from all 50 states. He will also be honored with a Waterford Crystal Cup as the first eight-time Olympic gold medalist. 5,000 people gather at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Glitterati from the worlds of politics, sports, and show business are scattered throughout the room. As Hayes steps to the podium, the crowd is just finishing the sumptuous meal. The speaker's address abounds with references to the power of Christ, an unabashed gratitude to God. Hearts are touched, men and women weep unashamedly, then give a standing ovation. Behind the glossy delivery, however, Carlton's vacant stare reveals that his words do not inhabit his soul. Stardom has eroded his presence with Jesus. Intimacy with God has faded into the distance. The whispering of the spirit has been drowned out by deafening applause. Buoyed by success, however, in the roar of the crowd, the Olympic hero moves easily from table to table. He ingratiates himself with everyone from the waiters to the movie stars. Back at the Red Roof Inn, Mo eats his frozen TV dinner alone. He's not invited to the banquet at the Ritz-Carlton because, quite honestly, he just wouldn't fit in. Surely it wouldn't be fitting for a pot-bellied, glass-eyed, twerpy attendant to pull up a chair with the likes of these celebrities. Mo sits down at the table in his room and closes his eyes. The love of the crucified Christ surges within him. His eyes fill with tears. Thank you, Jesus, he whispers as he peels the plastic top off his microwave lasagna. He flips to Psalm 33 in his Bible. Now, according to verse 1, the world does not know or value Mo or people like Mo. Why? Here's why. Because in a system that is driven by and drawn to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life, the kingdom qualities that people like Mo possess are not desirable. They are not valuable. They are not even visible. They are not knowable. now the world system might look at Moe's from time to time and come to pity him poor guy they might even do a human interest story some really innovative camera person or some reporter would notice Moe oh you know we should do a human interest story on that guy and kind of just even agree that he's the one with the virtue but they would never desire to be like him why? well think Think of on this as being a possible example of why. Because he had no form or majesty that we should look at him. He had no appearance that we should be drawn to him. Who am I talking about now? That's Isaiah 53. He had no majesty. That was Jesus. They couldn't see. He had majesty. They just couldn't see it. Moe had it too. They just couldn't see it. They don't know you because they didn't know him. They didn't know what to look for. The world never does. but one day when he appears we the whole world will see him Jesus as he really is and he will be revealed in all his glory beauty and splendor the glory beauty and splendor that the world couldn't see and didn't know and when he is revealed we will be revealed as well as his children as having grown up to look just like our Father. The point is this, that the world, driven by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life, has absolutely no idea how to measure and even to see true greatness. They didn't know Jesus, and they don't know Mo. Jesus said, blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst. Today he might be in our pulpit and say it this way. Blessed are the twerpy glass-eyed attendants. Why? Because it's really virtuous to be a twerpy glass-eyed attendant? No. But because the world has got it wrong. And that is the point Jesus is trying to drive home. You see, this world system thinks blessed are the rich, blessed are the successful, the attractive, and the strong only. They are the blessed ones. But Jesus says, life in my Father's kingdom is now available to all human beings. Is that good news to you? It is available to all human beings. Blessed are the poor and the weak and the shy and the timid and the awkward and the lonely. And of course, blessed also are the rich and the successful and the attractive and the strong if they get it. If they get it, what do they have to get? Here's what they have to get. They need to realize that greatness in God's kingdom is not measured the same way as this world system measures it. And if they give up trying to prove their worth or if we give up trying to prove our worth by earning and acquiring and accomplishing, and simply come to our Abba like a child. We will enter his kingdom. Blessed is anyone, strong or weak, rich or poor. Blessed is anyone who hungers and thirsts for the righteousness that is part of his kingdom, for you are his child. And it does not yet appear what you shall one day look like because you're still a child. And maybe sometimes they'll look at you, I'll look at you and I'll come, you're never going to grow up. You ever look at your kids that way? They're never going to grow up. Yes, you will. Yes, you will. See, I promise you, one day you will be full grown, fully formed, and you will be just like the Abba whose child you are. And in that day, get this, in that day, Mo and all the people like him who just loved Jesus from the heart and sought to serve him and wanted to be just like him and tried to put their feet where their father put his feet, all those people will be revealed. And all who see, who thought these people were insignificant and didn't matter and just kind of shoved them off to the side, All who will see these people will gasp and say, I had no idea. I just had no idea that's who you were. You're Abba's child. How do you know? Well, you look just like your father. You're Abba's daughter. You're Abba's son. How do you know? Well, the resemblance to the father is just remarkable. And last week after the service, I don't remember which one, I walked down and I was talking to a few people. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a young guy kind of waiting around. It was obvious he was waiting to talk. So I was done with my conversation, and I turned and started moving toward him. It was just the strangest experience. It wasn't that I couldn't see him. My eyes were fine. But as I came to him, toward him, it was almost like the focus came, and I recognized him. I go, it's Jesse. I haven't seen Jesse since he was this big. and he looked just like his father they had moved away and hadn't seen him for a long long time and I remember with Jesse in the boat and I remember him fishing and I remember him swimming and he's a kid and he's a kid he's never going to grow up and when I saw him now he was a man and he was fully formed he looked just like his dad and when I saw how big and strong he was I was really glad I was nice to him I think that's funny but do you hear the point I'm making there do you hear the point I'm making there Do you know who you're messing with? When you treat the little children like, I mean spiritually, who you decide to despise, they may be obvious children. You know what? They're going to grow up. And they may be stumbling right now, and they may just be irritating the day outside of you, and they may be gawky like an adolescent in their spiritual development. I'm not saying you don't discipline them. I'm not saying any of that. I'm saying your spirit toward other believers who are obvious children, you better be really careful. And I'm not saying when they grow up they're going to be chipped either. I'm just working with the analogy here. speaks to a lot of relationships. Are you connecting the dots? You know, sometimes even as believers, we could get caught up. And again, I already mentioned this, but this is why John appealed to believers, don't get caught up in the world, don't love this world system that appeals to the lust of the flesh because you're going to start evaluating people even in the body that way. It speaks profoundly to how we relate to each other. You know, I thought of this this week in relationship to my wife. The truth for me is that one of the things that I enjoy is just that I've loved my wife since I was like 17. I gave my heart away, and I never got it back. That's been a good thing. But there's this developing of intimacy over years that you keep on kind of moving and trying to figure it out. And she was kind of irritating at times, you know, so I got to work on that. It was supposed to be a joke. I'm really the irritating one, and I'm going to hear about that later. I mean, I want to tell you seriously something that affected me profoundly. A few years ago, as I was in my own spiritual journey, beginning to ask God about how I needed to look at her, and one of the things that dawned on me, and it brought me to a whole different place, was this. David, she's not just your wife. She's my child. She's not just Harley's child. Harley is her dad. She's not just her. She's my child. She's Abba's child. So you be careful, boy. You be careful. Does that speak a word to any marriages here? You're married to Abba's child. You know, I think it even speaks to how some of you date. You know, you're not going out with somebody's daughter. You're going out with Abba's daughter. You're going out with Abba's child, Abba's son. I had a woman come up to me after the service last night, and she was sharing with me some of the things that this sermon stirred for her, and it was partly the difficulty she has relating to Abba in a good way because her father was so abusive and hurtful. And we kind of talked about that and the healing she has received around that and how it's becoming easier and how she's found people who affirm in her her Abba identity, her identity as Abba's child, and those kinds of things. And then she said sadly, she goes, you know, one of the sad things, though, is that even in the church, sometimes when I date, I have a hard time finding men who see me as Abba's child, and they want to use me just like everybody else. I just want to say something about that. You be really careful. you be really careful that you don't, even as you date, even in your marriages, even as you relate to your children and do what you have to do, that every once in a while you do really well to step back and go, this is not my girlfriend, boyfriend, this is not my wife, my husband, this is not my kid, this is Abba's child. And I'm telling you, you live in that a little bit and it might just affect how you treasure them. How you speak truth to them, how you decide whether you're going to use them. It leads to the third thing that living as Abba's child involves. It involves embracing a new identity. It involves understanding a guaranteed destiny. It involves entering into a highly motivated, thoroughly joyful kind of purity. Verse 3, everyone who has this whole fix on him purifies himself just as he is pure. What I want you to notice about that verse on the front end is that that verse is not coming as a command. You better purify yourself. It's coming as a statement of fact. If you fix your hope on what I've just described, you will purify yourself. It's a statement of fact. It goes like this. If you have begun to accept and embrace the fact that you are the treasured child of Abba, and if you have begun to get a glimpse of the fact that you're going to grow up to be just like him, it's going to happen. I know you're stumbling now, but it's going to happen. Here's the result. You will quite naturally, enthusiastically, and energetically begin looking for ways to be just like him now. You will with great energy look for ways to say what he said. I just want to do what he did. I want to go where he went. I want to walk in a manner even as he walked. And like a child, you will fail. Just like the toddler trying to get your feet where they put their feet. You won't keep up sometimes and you'll fall down. But you are changing. Into the image of a son. verses 4 through 10 we come to this crazy place where he says all these difficult things I don't have time to spend time I just got to wrap it up what John is doing here in his holy epistle in verses 4 through 10 he's exposing these false teachers these Gnostics Ducetists these Serentians who said you guys it doesn't matter who you are or what you do it's what you know John says don't let these deceivers deniers or so called knowers and liars confuse you. People who practice lawlessness are not lawless. People who are working hard to get good at lawlessness are doing that because they're lawless. People who are working hard to get good at righteousness are doing it because they're righteous. Sabbath's children are not that hard to spot. They are trying to put their feet where their father put his feet. And they may be stumbling, but that's what they're practicing. Let me close this whole thing with a story that wonderfully, I think, illustrates how all of this works. Again, from Manning's book, Abba's Child, he tells about a friend of his, a priest from Detroit named Edward Farrell, who went to Ireland to trace his family tree. He could only find one relative living, an 80-year-old uncle named Uncle Seamus. He'd been there for a while. It was just a few days before he had to go home, and it happened to be Uncle Seamus' birthday the next day. Uncle Seamus said, I'd like to get up early in the morning before the sun and sit on the lake. Would you come with me? They decided to do that early in the morning before the sun came up. They walked in silence to Lake Killarney. where they sat on the shore and waited for the sunrise. As the sun began to rise, Pharaoh not only noticed the glory of the sun, but how it looked on his 80-year-old uncle's face. His uncle was beaming. Then, still without saying a word, this 80-year-old man got up and began to skip like a child, waving his arms down the shore of Lake Killarney. Watching this, Pharaoh didn't know if his uncle Seamus was happy or nuts. So when he caught up with him, he said, and his uncle Seamus had calmed down, he asked him, Uncle, what's going on? I mean, you must really like the sun. You kind of give a whole new meaning to the idea of being a morning person. And Uncle Seamus said this, no, it's not the sun and it's not the morning, though I love them both. It's this, that my Abba, he is very fond of me. And living in the light of that, this old 80-year-old man went skipping down the beach like a little what? Child. And I'm here to tell you that everyone who has that hope fixed in him purifies themselves. Here's the deal. The most motivating, sanctifying power in your life is the love of God your Abba, is your identity as his treasured child, is your guaranteed promise that you will be just like him. You're going to grow up. You may be stumbling now, but every effort you make to be like your father, I promise you, it's going to pay off. You see, this child being described here is not a child desperately trying to earn the affection of a cold-hearted, hard-to-please dad. See, it's possible that if you had a cold-hearted, hard-to-please dad, you would purify yourself, but the reason would be to somehow win his affection. Now, this child here, Abba's child, is a child that is dancing and singing in the smile of their Abba with room to stumble and fall, with room to get up and grow, till one day this child, this little son, this little daughter is just like the father who gave them life. behold what kind of foreign love is this that we should be called Abba's child well such we are and all God's people said amen let's stand and be dismissed Father I thank you for this incredible picture I pray especially for those among us who may be still struggling with and relating to you with a perception of you that you are more like the cold hard-hearted father and all of the things they're doing in God's name even pure kinds of things and good things they think are really designed to try to win your affection and win your attention and win your approval and all that leads to is awful legalism and death I pray, Father, that we by your Spirit would be healed and we by your Spirit would be free to walk in the smile of our Abba and in that confidence be a people who are ever purifying themselves just because we want to put our feet where our dad put his feet and we want to be able to live the way he lived. By your Spirit, empower our holy efforts to be like you In Jesus' name, amen.
