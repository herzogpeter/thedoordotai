When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned. For prior to the coming of certain men from James, from the Jerusalem church, he used to eat with the Gentiles. He was used to eating with the Gentiles. He did it on a regular basis. But when they came, he began to withdraw and hold himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy with the result that even Barnabas, Even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy. But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas, in the presence of all, if you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like the Jews? I'm going to ask you as we begin this study, as I do every Sunday, to lift me up before the throne of grace. we do care about the word of god and i do deeply and i need your prayer support in that i want you to pray for my liberation in my thinking i'm feeling a real sense of bondage in my thinking and i want you to pray for me concerning that and i want you to bring your own heart to the lord and ask him to open you up to the things that we have to learn this morning let's pray together dear jesus i thank you for the power of your word i thank you for its ability to change us and to convict us i thank you for the things it teaches us give us father the sensitivity in our spirits to to genuinely open ourselves to do the things that we hear you calling us to do bless by your holy spirit this time in jesus name amen one of the constant calls laid at the feet of the believer is the call to unity you have heard it many times and you know it well jesus prayer for the church was simply this that they may be one that they may be one ephesians chapter 4 says be diligent to preserve the unity in the bond of peace and so it is that we are constantly urged from the pulpit among one another to love one another and forgive one another and bear with one another and and we call upon each other in the body to just come together and set aside those things that may divide us and cause strife and things that would cause fragmentation of the true body of Christ. And we spoke of this fact last week that some things just aren't worth fighting for and we need to lay them aside. But the other thing we discovered last week was this, that there are some things that are worth fighting for. It became very clear that while we are called as believers to a ministry of unity, a ministry that brings us together in love that very often lets little petty things slide by. They just aren't worth arguing about. At the same time we are called to that ministry, we are called to another ministry and that is a ministry of division that we need to divide, not between brother and brother, but we want to be very active dividing between what is real and what is not, what is hypocritical and what is pure. We need to be active, doing everything we can to divide the sheep from the goats. And last week we asked a question, how is it that you do that? We need to be very, very careful in that. And we heard a scriptural injunction that said you need to be very, very careful doing that, because as you look across the field and you see that there are wheat and there are tares, there are those who are real in Jesus and there are those who look very much like they're real in Jesus, but all they have is a cloak of decency. It isn't something internal. That if you move among that field and try to tear everything up, you're going to be in trouble because you very well may pull something up that's real. What do we do about the wheat and the tares? What do we do about the fact that there is hypocrisy in the church? Well, one of the things that's going to happen is this, that at the judgment, Jesus is going to make that separation. And he is going to separate those who are real in Jesus, who have an internal relationship with Christ, and those who have nothing but external show. And he is going to take those who have nothing but external show, bind them together, and burn them. There will be judgment. But my heart aches about that because I look at the church of Christ, and I look at our own congregation, and across the land, and I think, is that all there is? Do we just keep our mouths shut and never confront the issue? The answer to that is no. We do confront hypocrisy. And one way we do it, we spoke of it last week, the one thing we know we can do to confront hypocrisy, what is not real, is we can preach about it. And that is one way. And that's something that I've committed my life to. And I believe that is something that God has called me to. But I do not believe that that is all we do either. I believe that this text very clearly teaches that if the church is going to be the true church, it must expose hypocrisy and identify false brethren. And in order to do that, it is going to take more than sermons about hypocrisy and false brethren. I believe it is going to take a body of believers who are actively involved, please hear this, who are actively involved in a loving, caring, compassionate ministry of confrontation and discipline. I want so much to have what I'm saying Come through the grid of love But we have to say this This is so important In chapter 2 verses 1 through 10 Paul preaches a sermon And he's preaching a sermon To the Galatians about someone else He's preaching to the Galatians About the Judaizers And for the Galatians benefit He identifies those Judaizers And again those of you who have been with us Week after week I just don't have time to fill in all the blanks here. But he identifies those Judaizers, those legalistic people, those people who had an external show of very spiritual piety. He identifies them as who they are. They are not real Christians. They are sham Christians, false brethren. They are not being used of the Holy Spirit to straighten things out in the church. They are, in fact, being used as pawns of Satan. This is all, by the way, in chapter 2, verse 4. They are pawns of Satan, and they are here to spy out our liberty and bring you believers who have been set free by God's grace back into bondage. He brings a message to the Galatians about someone else. But you know what? He does more than preach a sermon to them about somebody else. The next thing we see Paul doing is looking Peter right in the eye and saying, Peter, I'm talking about you. You are doing the things that I'm accusing the Judaizers of doing as well. Confrontation face to face. and then you know what else he does you know what he's doing though he's still talking second person isn't he he's still talking to the galatians about another incident he's talking to the galatians about the incident that he had with peter and then in chapter three we're not there yet we're going to be here in a couple weeks we're going to see something else he does in chapter three verse one after talking about the judaizers after talking about a face-to-face confrontation that he had with peter he then looks the galatians themselves right in the eye and says you are the ones i'm talking about as well. Confrontation face-to-face. Discipline. Don't you just love it? Don't you love a confrontation? Have you ever had anybody come up to you and say, hey, Dave, come here, kind of pull you aside and say, I need to talk to you about something. There's something that you're doing. There's something that you're saying, and it's really troubling me. It's really bothering me. Don't you just love that? I just adore that. I love it. People grab me by the arm, call me up, say, hey, I need to talk to you. What's it about? Well, I'll tell you when I get there. Oh, no. Oh no, it's going to be a rough one. Confrontation. Confrontation. So often, so good. So important. You know one of the reasons confrontation is important for me? It's so important for you to confront me when you see me doing things or saying things that aren't appropriate. You know why it's so important? Because sometimes I don't see what I'm doing. And sometimes I don't even understand that what I'm doing could offend in some way and we wouldn't want to do that and I need to be confronted and so do you. And in those kinds of contexts, confrontation can be a building, loving thing that builds a relationship and causes someone to grow. In fact, we know, we're going to get into this when we get into Galatians 6, that the purpose of church discipline is not to blast somebody and blow them up. The purpose of church discipline is to restore that brother and the way we do that is in a spirit of gentleness and tenderness, looking to yourself because you may be the guy who's going to be confronted tomorrow. And so, beloved, when we move into a concept of confrontation, we want to be so gentle, and we want to have in view the concept of restoration. What I want to do in bringing this issue to this dear beloved friend is I want them to see what they're doing so that they can change and be restored. But I have to give you some hard truth this morning as well, and that is this, that discipline and confrontation does not always result in building and restoration. You see, the purpose of discipline sometimes is to divide and to expose. The purpose of church discipline sometimes is to take the sheepskin off the wolf. And I want to tell you something. When you go and you confront a real brother in Jesus, and it's done in love, and it's done in gentleness, that's saying, hey, I just want you to see something I don't think you see. You know what? The real brother, the one who is real in Jesus grows from that. But if you take the sheepskin off a wolf, don't you expect a smile. You're going to get snarled at and you're going to get bit. But the purpose of discipline is very often to expose that which is false. This is a tough one. We've got much to learn. Let's get right to the text. right to the text. The issue being confronted in this chapter, the issue being confronted in this text is the issue of legalism. Legalism. The problem with legalism, we said this last week, is that what legalism does is it gives people a false sense of security. Rather than having a broken heart before God, all I've got to do is learn the little spiritual tricks. All I've got to do is learn the language. All I've got to do is carry my Bible. And if I do all the little evangelical things that have been prescribed to me by my parents, my pastor, and everyone else down the line, I must be safe. David knew the problem in that one. He said, God, if what you wanted from me was sacrifices and sacrifices and burnt offerings, I would do that. That's the easy part. Coming to church and looking churchy is the easy part. But the sacrifices to God are a broken and contrite heart. And I don't want to be broken. You know what brokenness is? It's something going on inside. And legalism is an enemy of the gospel because it allows people to look at the external rather than focus on the heart. The people being confronted are the Judaizers, and they have already been identified as phony Christians, people who have nothing but external. What do you think? And then Paul confronted them, calling them sham Christians, pawns of Satan. What do you think was the result of that confrontation? Do you think Paul said, I'm going to confront these Judaizers, and I know the reason I'm confronting them is because they're going to come back into the fold. That would have been nice, and I'm sure that would have been Paul's deepest desire, that they would see their falseness and turn around, accept Jesus Christ. That was not necessarily the result of that at all. Does that mean you don't confront? No, that means you confront anyway, because sometimes the purpose of a church discipline, sometimes the purpose of a confrontation is to expose. And when Judaizers, people who are wrapped up in externals rather than internals, move into the church, they need to be exposed. Not only to themselves, but they need to be exposed publicly to the church. You need to know that what is not real is not real. And now we look at Peter. This confrontation is incredible. So many reasons that it's incredible. I'm sure your own mind, if you were able to picture the scene, would just be able to recreate incredible tension. First of all, you've got a guy blown into town, Paul. Nobody knows him. He comes into town, confronts the big shot in the church, Peter, and tells him, you stand condemned, confronts him to his face in front of everybody. You remember the accusation against the apostle Paul when this whole thing began that Paul was a people pleaser? I don't think so. I don't think so. He took such a risk when he confronted Peter in front of everyone. It's unbelievable. I can't give you all the little thoughts I have on trying to recreate that scene. Let's just get right to the text. There's three dimensions of this text I want you to see. First of all, we're just going to break it down. There is the clash in verse 11 and verse 14. There is the cause in verse 12. And there is the consequences in verse 13. Breaks down real nice. First of all, the clash, verse 11 and 14. But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned. And then verse 14. When I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas, in the presence of all. There's two phrases I want you to get. Kind of fill out the meaning a little bit here in that 13th verse. The first phrase I want you to see is that he opposed him. Just that little phrase, opposed him. I opposed him. It means literally this, I withstood him. Literally, it means this, to set oneself against. This is important because this word is a defensive word. And it implies that the original point of attack did not come from the Apostle Paul. The original point of attack came from the Apostle Peter. Now you may think, what's the big deal about that? I think that's a big deal. The one who does the behavior is the transgressor, not the one who does the confronting. Please understand that. When confrontation of sin begins to move through the church, and the elders really begin to do that, and as our body begins to look people in the eye and confront them in their sin, and in their hypocrisy, one of the things that's going to happen invariably is that we're going to begin to think that the one who's doing the confronting is the bad guy. That is not the case. The one who does the behavior is the bad guy. The term withstood conveys that very clearly. We need to understand that. Paul did not move against Peter. Paul simply stood in his way. The one who was doing the evil work was Peter. Important to understand that. Peter is the instigator. The other phrase I want you to look at and just understand and get a little flavor for is the fact that Peter stood condemned. Again, it carries the meaning that Peter was the one who was responsible for his action, and Peter is the one who brought the confrontation on himself. Paul is not the bad guy in this. He condemned himself, and in the Greek, what it does is it conveys the meaning that he condemned himself. A man's actions condemn himself. Do you got that? My actions condemn myself. When I say that I'm a Christian, and when I say I love the Lord, but I hate my brother, what I do condemns me. It eradicates what I say. If I go to a symphony, and that symphony is a masterpiece, and it has been regarded by those who know music as being a masterpiece, and I go, this goofy guy from Chicago goes to the symphony, and I sit and I listen, and I listen, and I listen, and then I leave and somebody says, what did you think? I says, ah, it was stupid. That was stupid. That was stupid music. That was lousy. Who stands condemned? Me or the music? Who's stupid? You condemn yourself by your activity You condemn yourself by what you say By what you do That's exactly where Peter was at The transgressor in this whole thing Was Peter, Paul just stood firm against him I want to add something else here This is just by way of principles That we want to pick up as we go through this Had Paul not stood against him He would have been the transgressor We are not doing any service By letting hypocrisy go on We are in sin ourselves When we see sin in the church when we see things that are not right and we just keep silent. The other thing I want you to catch is this, that he did it to his face. He did it to his face. And then verse 14, the one that makes my skin crawl in the presence of all. Whoa. Dave, what does this mean? Does this mean that when we make a confrontation, that our confrontation should be like on a Sunday morning and in front of the whole congregation, I just single you out and say, Bonnie, you've got a problem? Bam, you're in trouble. Everybody knows. That will really straighten it out. No. No, I think it's pretty clear, and we would have to be very sensitive here. This whole issue of confrontation, I just want to appeal to your hearts because it's so important that we be gentle, and it's so important that everything we do be laced with love. But if there is obviously a personal issue between you and I, we handle that between you and I, and we do everything we can to protect that person's dignity, and their standing in the church, we do that kind of thing. and we even have instructions from the word of God when we see someone in sin we go to them personally and then if they don't respond and they don't repent we bring someone else with and we deal with that in an elder issue and if there's still no repentance then very definitely it becomes a public issue first of all so the pressure is applied to that person to repent not only that though so that the church knows you discipline sin but I've got a principle for you in this when we see Paul confronting Peter to the face in the presence of all. You might ask, why didn't he just go over to his house? Why didn't he go over to his house and just kind of talk to him there instead of doing this in front of everybody? I'll tell you why, and here's the principle. Because you don't deal with a public sin in secret. Please remember that. Write it down, put it in our bylaws. You don't deal with a public sin in secret. There are some very important reasons why you don't. If that situation is a situation that people know about, then it is a situation that those people who know about it need to see confronted. It needs to get out. The reason that is important is twofold. One, it needs to be exposed publicly so that people are not allowed to draw their own faulty conclusions about what really happened. They have a right to know the truth. The second reason is this, that when we deal with a public sin in a public way before everyone, one like Peter's hypocrisy that everybody saw, and I identify Peter's behavior in front of everyone who saw it as being hypocrisy, that disciplines the whole church. You know that? Because as we discipline hypocrisy in one, everyone else has to look at themselves and say, I'm doing just what he's doing. I need to deal with that. It serves as an example. It serves as an example, and it says loud and clear to our whole church congregation, We will deal with sin. The fact that we would deal with sin and discipline and confront in the body does two things, I believe. I believe it builds confidence. And those who really care about the truth, it builds confidence that we are not going to be goofing around. We are not going to be fooling around. We mean business about what God says. And the other thing it does is it warns. It warns people that you're not going to get away with hypocrisy. You're not going to get away with an external show. That's very clearly biblical. You know, in 1 Timothy 5, it has some real clear instructions about what happens when an elder sins. It says in verse 1, don't sharply rebuke an elder. And you might say, well, what if he deserves it? Sometimes our elders do. Sometimes I do. What do you do if they deserve it? Verse 19 goes on and says this, do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses. Why is that? Why don't you just go and nail them? Why don't we just have a big discipline? The reason is very clear. It's because people who are in positions of spiritual leadership are targets for criticism. That's just the way it is. It goes with the territory. Therefore, when an accusation comes against an elder, you need to be very sure that that accusation is true before you make it an issue. But when that is proven to be true and there is hypocrisy there and we need to deal with it, you know what it says then? Then it says this, rebuke him before all. Why? So that others may fear. Doesn't that sound rough? Remember Ananias and Sapphira? Remember Ananias and Sapphira? What was their sin? They went to movies. No. No, their sin was hypocrisy. Their sin was hypocrisy. No one told them that they had to sell that land. Do you know that? No one told them that they had to sell that land There was no law There was no legalistic structure that said If you're really a good Christian Ananias and Sapphira You'll go and sell all your land And then you'll be in the evening service and the morning service Their sin was that they lied Their sin was that they pretended they were spiritual But they had no inner life You know what happened? They got struck dead You know where? In front of everyone You know why? So that others may fear We mean business We mean business I go again with my voice One of these days it'll change and that's true you know the word went out in jerusalem none dare join themselves with them the word that went out was simply this you don't join that group i'll tell you one false move and you're dead disciplining sin now one of the things that we fear when we begin to talk about this oh boy talk about it nothing's going to happen if all we do is talk about it nothing's going to happen if all we do is sermons about church discipline don't change a thing sermons about church discipline don't take the masks off of anybody it's when the body begins to do it it's when the paul start looking at the peters and saying you stand condemned i see you saying one thing i see you doing another but you know what our fear is is that if we start doing that we'll lose people. You know what? If we take the mask off and we reveal a wolf, we got to know that. I want to know that. If there are people here who are just inconsistent and they're playing a game, but they really are true believers, there can be help and there can be hope and there can be strength and there can be growth. But if there are sheep who are not really sheep and they're wolves underneath and we take off that mask. We need to do that kind of exposing. That kind of confrontation may cause people to leave, but that's part of the dividing between that which is real and that which is false, and I believe we must be committed to that kind of ministry. It's only the hypocrite that needs to fear. Do you know that? It's only the hypocrite that needs to fear. And by the way, he's the one who's going to get the most defensive when you confront him. absolutely he's got the most to protect he's the one who knows more than anybody else in the whole congregation in the whole body of christ that he's playing a game and when somebody comes close to that he's going to get like this he's got you know the act has been so good for so long man alive when you confront a sheep a wolf in sheep's clothing you're going to get bit but the other things that are true also and i've already mentioned when you confront publicly people know then that you really believe what you say you believe without doing that kind of thing we lose credibility again remember i just said a moment ago that that preaching sermons about confrontation don't doesn't change anything and if we just keep preaching sermons on confrontation and church discipline and never see church discipline never see paul's going to peter's and saying and confronting, we just lose credibility. Everybody just gets used to hearing Dave spout off. Big deal. Nothing happens. We know that. You do that with your kids. Tell your kid, don't do that, don't do that, don't do that. And I'll tell you what, if you don't, if you do that, here's what's going to happen. They do it and you never do anything. After a while, they know you're whiffing you. They know you're whiffing them. Just faking them out. Nothing's going to happen. You know, another principle that we draw from that very first verse is simply this. No one is outside the discipline of the body. No one is outside the discipline of the body. Not Peter. Not me. Not an elder. Not you. Not the guy who gives the most money in the church. Not the one who's been here the longest. Beloved, we need to know something, that this word is infallible, but God's people aren't. God's people aren't. Second, the cause. We've seen the clash face-to-face, confrontation in front of all, Always with love, always with a view to restore, but always knowing, too, that that person may not be restored. If I expose what is false, he may leave. You've got to take that chance. That's not a good enough reason not to confront. Second thing, the cause. The cause, verse 12. The cause was simply this, hypocrisy. I've already mentioned that. For prior to the coming of certain men from James, Paul, Peter, you used to eat with the Gentiles, but when they came, you became aloof and withdrew yourself and became aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision. Hypocrisy. Saying one thing and doing another. Pretending you're a Christian, but really only having a cloak of decency. Every once in a while, somebody comes to me and asks this question. And sometimes I'm the one who's asking the question. It's this. Why is it that in the church we see so much hypocrisy? You've heard that question. You've asked it yourself. You've had people ask it to you. The reason I don't go to church is because there's so much hypocrisy. Why is that? Usually that's asked of me to shut me up and kind of put me down so I don't try to push Christianity anymore, Adam anymore, because that's the thing that gets them off the track. My answer to that right now is this. Why should that surprise us, that hypocrisy would be in the church? I believe that the church, very often, has become the place that breeds hypocrisy. Why is that? whenever you set up a structure, whenever you set up a system, that even subtly begins to drift away from the need of an internal change, the life of God in me, and begins even subtly to focus on external things as being the thing that verifies my love and faith in Jesus Christ. And people start performing very subtly. People begin to pick up the impression, unless the message is clear and consistent, That what really matters in being a Christian is wearing the right suit, wearing the right kind of hairdo, bringing the right kind of Bible, saying the right kind of words, learning what words not to say, learning what words to say, and all of a sudden the whole Christian life is nothing but an external show. And I'm sure that you can kind of pick up how that could just begin to happen. How very often the ones who are most susceptible to that kind of false faith can just be bred in the church. unless the message is continually driving that message internal internal you need a change of heart you need a change of attitude the life of god has got to be born in you that will produce the change the way you bring the change the way you confront that though is it's like moving into a swamp that's full of alligators somewhere along the line you got to pull the plug pulling the plug is confronting the hypocrisy, saying we've got to get rid of this stuff. We've got to find out what's real. You know what Peter did? It's real interesting. Those of you who are fighting with this whole kind of thing, and I know many of you are, fighting with a legalistic background and how do you handle it? Legalists are very intimidating people. Do you know that? Oh, they sure are. They intimidated Peter right out of fellowship with the Gentiles. He was sitting there loving his freedom, enjoying his fellowship, he realized that what you eat and all those kinds of little insignificant things just did not matter. All the little cultural do's and don'ts we get wrapped up in that do not matter had just gone by the boards for Peter. And he was enjoying this wonderful fellowship with him. And then all of a sudden, it was as if he was sitting there with the Gentiles, enjoying this fellowship. And out of the corner of his eye, he sees this group of people going like this. Legalists, you know? And they're just got their act perfect. They have their big Bible underneath and they're scowling a little bit and they're looking at them. And Peter, you know, the word says withdrew. The Greek indicates that it was kind of a sneaking away. He's sitting there enjoying his freedom. He gets a scowl from a legalist. Peter goes like this. Doesn't want the Gentiles to know because he knows what he's doing is wrong. But he doesn't want the legalist to see him with these people. Doesn't want the legalist to see him enjoying his freedom at all. He snuck away. you know the word withdrew means literally this he retreated to a safe position he retreated to a safe position why why did he do it says right there in the text because he was afraid of the party of the circumcision that old killer, peer pressure, afraid of what people think, afraid of what people say, afraid of not being liked, afraid of losing his reputation. You know what I think? I think Peter, for a moment, just for a moment, forgot about his value in Christ. I believe that for a moment, just for a moment, his sense of security was not being drawn from his relationship to Christ anymore. That even just for a moment, his sense of security was no longer in Christ. It was now in those people's approval. Guess what that produces? Bondage to them. And I changed my behavior because they're putting pressure on me. No longer freedom in Christ. None. Not for Peter. And the ultimate irony, the ultimate irony is here's this apostle of God's grace who has come to set people free, who is yielding to legalists who Paul identifies as on their way straight to hell. He wasn't even yielding to weaker brethren. He was yielding to sham Christians. They weren't real Christians. I want to tell you something. If it hadn't been, I don't know where this was going. This is a real bold statement. But Peter is very definitely right on the road to apostasy if he would have maintained that position. We dealt with that all through the book of Hebrews. Moving back to a works salvation. Let's look finally at the consequences of what Peter did. Verse 13, the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy. That's brutal. With the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy. Peter's double message. I like that word, double message. I grew up on that. I grew up on hearing that. The double message. Always being warned about the double message. The double message is simply this. You're saved by grace through faith plus double message. Plus you better perform. You better keep it up. You better learn the rules. And all of a sudden instead of just focusing on the internal life of God in me and letting him give him freedom to work through me any way he will in obedience and love, all my service being because of love, instead of that I begin to focus on this and I begin to strive and I begin to do and I lose all the joy, the double message destroyed it. The point of this, however, is this, that his double message had an impact on the body. And you know what? That introduces me into another principle for why we have to confront that kind of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is simply people who name the name but don't live it. People who name the name but don't live it have an impact on the body. It is always negative. if we do not confront people in our congregation who claim to have a walk with God but hate their brother, we are sending a message to our whole congregation that that's what real Christianity is. And you know what? Somewhere along the line, somebody's got to blow the whistle and say, no, it isn't. No, it isn't. If we do not confront that kind of stuff, we are sending a message to young people and old people alike that shallowness is okay. No, it isn't. Adultery is okay. it's no big thing. No, it isn't. Externals are really what matters. Start working on the externals. No, they don't matter. Bitterness and gossip and slander are things you shouldn't do, but they really don't matter. Yes, they do. And the church at Sardis was the church that tolerated sin, maybe under the guise of love, saying, oh, we can't confront that. They say they're a Christian. They talk, they've been here for years. Oh, my goodness. They give money. they're new to our church they're new if you know being new like this if we just kind of deal with this now and try to drive it internal man we'll just lose them right away they're new they're old they've been here a little bit they've been here a long time they got a lot of money they don't have any money at all all sorts of reasons not to do anything none of them good enough what happened to the church in Sardis was this you have a name that you are alive but you're dead quite a warning quite a warning you know what I want to do I just want to close with four quick principles I'm going to read them and you write them down from this text. Four quick principles. First principle is this. Even great ministers of the gospel make mistakes. Principle number one. Why is that an important principle to remember? The principle is this. Don't follow men. I don't care who they are. I don't care if it's me. I don't care if it's one of our elders. I don't care if it's a district superintendent. Don't follow men. People make mistakes. the point of this however is that Peter did see his sin and he recovered but I want to tell you just drive this home again I've been saying it all morning drive this home again he had to be confronted though to see his sin he had to be confronted Paul was his best friend looks like a big enemy doesn't it Paul was his best friend when he did it the second principle is this it is not enough to believe the gospel unless you're willing to obey it it is not enough to believe the gospel unless you are willing to obey it please get this Peter's sin was not in his creed he believed right just like many of us Peter's sin was not in his doctrine he was taught right just like many of us Peter's sin was in his behavior what he did negated what he said that's what we confront see that's another reason we just back off and don't confront but I know he doesn't believe that. He believes this, and oh yeah, he's a saved. How do you know he's saved? He said so. His behavior negates what you say. Her behavior negates what she says. To say you love the Lord and hate your brother makes you a liar. Hypocrite. Third principle. Third principle. This is vital. That we draw from this is this. Speaking the truth is more important than keeping the peace. You believe that? I do. Absolutely. Absolutely. And you know what? I think we're going to pay a price for that too. Somewhere along the line, I believe that. Absolutely. Speaking the truth is more important than keeping the peace. Paul withstood him to his face in the presence of all. You know what? That isn't good PR. At all. Beloved, I know a pastor, a friend of mine, went to seminary. He was a little ahead of me. And there was this one of these, you know, these times, it's like council when you get together, only it wasn't council. It was connected with Bethel. That's not to be a thing on Bethel. But he came to me and we were talking about an issue he was having in his church and he said this, you know, we just, with tears in his eyes, he says, we have this terrible issue in our church and it's not going away. But I'm not going to say anything and I'm going to stay out of it. And I asked him a real profound question. why? isn't that a great question? why? why aren't you going to say anything and why are you going to stay out of it? I don't understand that and he said this oh Dave I just love the people and I want to stay I want to keep the peace and I don't want to mess things up and if I go into this it's just going to stir all sorts of things up that I don't want to mess with and I just want everybody to love each other and I think that if I keep quiet about it it'll pass on by and everybody will just love each other rule of thumb rule of thumb if we maintain peace at the expense of telling the truth we have neither peace nor truth write it down write it down put it in the bylaws if we maintain peace at the expense of telling the truth we have neither peace nor truth what you have is not peace you'll have compromise mushy, gooey, yucky compromise you know what else you'll have? You won't have truth, you'll have pretense. You won't have truth, you'll have pretense. You'll have hypocrisy. Church in Thyatira, what were they called? Mushy, gooey, compromising church. Neither hot nor cold. You know what I do with them? Spit them out of my mouth. Compromise. Speaking the truth is more important than keeping the peace. Last one. We must openly oppose those who deny the gospel. no matter who no matter who we must openly oppose those who denied the gospel here's the hitch here's the hitch whether they denied in creed or in practice whether they denied in creed or in practice there are not many among us who would deny it in creed peter's creed was flawless his problem was he didn't live in accordance with what he said he believed and for that reason paul confronted him to his face we'll lose people if we do that paul took the risk paul took the risk and peter was real in jesus and you know what didn't lose peter didn't lose peter peter got his act together straightened out and became one of the most powerful preachers of the gospel that ever lived but there are some who are hypocrites and being unmasked they will be unmasked has to happen. Beloved, I will just close with this word. I do not believe that we can be what God wants us to be unless we are willing to do what God calls us to do. I do not believe that we as a church can be what God wants us to be unless we are willing to do what God wants us to do. And when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned of hypocrisy. Next week, it's going to be a lot more pleasant. Let's pray. Lord, teach us these things. Teach us to be defenders of grace. Teach us to be those who desire purity in the church. Teach us to, with love and compassion and concern, be about the business of dividing between what is real and what is false. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
