Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. It's the fifth Beatitudes we find in Matthew 5, and I want to use that Beatitude today to prepare our hearts for our coming to the table this morning that is the Lord's. The cyclical dynamic of this Beatitude is interesting, that if you give mercy, it says you will get mercy. And if you get mercy, I think there's an assumption in that there you'll probably be more prone to give mercy. Most of us, I think, have some sense of its meaning, what mercy means. It comes from the Greek word elemenos, and at its most basic level, it speaks simply to some kindness shown to someone in need. But in particular, it's a kindness shown to someone in need who can't help themselves. It's an important distinction there. Someone who, for whatever reason, they're in no position to do that, to help themselves. We speak of being at someone's mercy. We throw ourselves on the mercy of the court. To be at someone's mercy. A pretty vulnerable place to be. The place of vulnerability, the place of need, where you're at the mercy of someone. Could be a physical need, could be a financial need, could be spiritual need, a sense of vulnerability. Last week, as a matter of fact, we heard a parable Jesus told in Luke 18 of a Pharisee and a tax collector. The tax collector was unwilling, remember this, to even lift up his eyes toward heaven, but beating his breast said, God, be merciful to me, a sinner. He was at God's mercy. He had nothing to commend himself to God. His only hope was mercy. His place of need and vulnerability was spiritual. I'm at your mercy, God. In a story Jesus told of the Good Samaritan, you remember the story, I'm sure, quite well, the person who was beaten, robbed, and left for dead at the side of the road was at the mercy of whoever would stop for him to help. He couldn't help himself. There was nothing in him that would commend himself to those who were passing by, somehow make him worthy of their mercy, of their help. He was at their mercy. His point of need was physical. So to be at the mercy of someone is a pretty vulnerable place to be. I think a scary place to be because for you to get the mercy you need, be it physical, financial, or spiritual, someone else has to have the mercy and give it to you because you're at their mercy. Now, I think all of us would agree that mercy is a good thing, a noble thing, something we should probably be more of, we should be more merciful. But it's not quite that simple, actually. Because just telling people to be merciful and maybe even all agreeing that we should be more merciful doesn't produce mercy in people. Indeed, some, if you think about it, in terms of how you actually think and the way we actually live, some actually would see mercy as a sign of weakness in certain contexts. The Romans, for instance, in Jesus' day were merciless because mercy kept you from doing some really hard things you had to do. So mercilessness to a Roman was actually a virtue. To be merciless was virtuous. Stoics actually saw mercy as a disease of the soul because it made you soft and indecisive. Others see mercy, I think, as nice but naive. Because if you show mercy, it'll come back to bite you. You'll get run over. Because for every story there is of the good Samaritan, I'll tell you a story where the guy who was trying to help, the person who was trying to show mercy, got ripped off themselves. So mercy is nice. Tell it to your kids. Talk about it in church. But out there in the real world, it doesn't work. It isn't practical. Still others, and this is a group, I almost kind of have to laugh at them because this group is in a real double bind around this kind of mercy thing because they know they're supposed to be merciful. So there's kind of a pressure they feel, but they aren't merciful at all. In fact, they can't be merciful because there's no mercy in them, but they live with this sense they're supposed to be. So in this double bind, classic example, of this group is our favorite whipping boys. They come up all the time in the scriptures, especially in this discussion of Jesus as a rabbi and a teacher, the scribes and the Pharisees. Classic example of some people who knew they were supposed to be merciful, but they weren't. Scribes and Pharisees who were far more familiar than we are with the texts that I read last week from the prophet Isaiah. Remember that? The prophet Isaiah, particularly in Isaiah 58, who spoke unequivocally of our responsibility as God's people to, among other things, clothe the naked, to have mercy on the naked, on those who financially can't help themselves, to bring the homeless poor into the house, to give ourselves to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, all of which speaks to people who need mercy. The poor, the hungry, the naked. All of those are people who are at the mercy of merciful people. But the scribes and the Pharisees were so busy being religious, tithing dill and mint and cumin, that they didn't even notice things like justice, mercy, faithfulness. And while they were probably capable of merciful acts from time to time, like the Roman Empire would every once in a while go, let them live, they weren't merciful people. Why? Well, here's my theory on that, that the people through whom mercy freely flows are generally people to whom mercy has freely come. Let me say it a little more clearly than that. The degree to which you see yourself in need of mercy and then have tasted the sweetness of it is the degree to which generally you will freely give mercy. I'll give you some examples of that. I'm not sure about this, but I think that maybe, at least part of the reason, that the Samaritan, who's called the Good Samaritan, and by the way, that's just an interesting phrase, and I grew up in Sunday school, so he was just called the Good Samaritan, that's an oxymoron. In Jesus' day, that would have been, what's a good Samaritan? There's no such thing as a good Samaritan. But in the story, that was the shock of the whole thing. And my theory is that just maybe part of the reason he showed mercy to the beat-up guy on the side of the road when the priest and the Levite walked right on by was because just maybe the Samaritan might have known what it felt like to need that kind of help, to need that kind of mercy. Because my theory is that the people through whom mercy flows are generally people to whom mercy's come. They've tasted it. They knew they needed it. And when they got it, they were so grateful they gave it away. You know, when I was in college, I used to pick up hitchhikers. And part of the reason I did that was because I knew what it felt like to need that kind of help, to need that kind of mercy because I was a hitchhiker. In college, there are many things you have and many things you don't have. One of the things you don't have when you're in college is money. Two years of my college life, I had a car, but I didn't have money to put gas in the car. So I would hitchhike a lot of places. I think I even told you the story at the time. I hitchhiked home. And home was Chicago. I was going to school up here. But see, I heard a rumor that Bonnie, who I eventually married, she was my girlfriend at the time, was dating this guy and was about to dump me. So I hitchhiked to Chicago. And actually, it wasn't that so much to protect my relational investment. It was like, if she was going to dump me, I thought she lost her mind. She needs to be committed. Help her. Anyway. Thank you for laughing at that. They didn't laugh at all last night. You know, it was just, you're my favorite crowd. I don't pick hitchhikers up anymore because I forgot what it feels like to sit out on an exit ramp or an entrance ramp of a highway watching 50 cars go by. I forgot what that feels like to need that kind of help, to need that kind of mercy. Some of you are involved in prison ministry here at Open Door. And some of you who are involved in our prison ministry were in prison. Yourself. Because you remember what it feels like to need that kind of help. Some of you, I just love how people in our church flock when we talk about we need tutors here, we need tutors there. And so many of you go, and some of you go, just you have a good heart, but some of you go because you remember what it felt like to not be able to read well and do your math well. You remember. And you got some help, and now you want to give it away. Some of you work with our kids, and you work for a variety of reasons. You love God, you love kids. Those are all good reasons. But some of you, when you work with the kids, one of the things you notice about yourself is you're always drawn to the kid who looks left out. You know why? Because you remember what it felt like to need a little help, to need a little mercy. And because you remember, and because you tasted it, you give it. So here's my thesis, that the people through whom mercy generally flows are generally the people to whom mercy has freely come. They remember. But Jesus tells this parable in Matthew 18 that kind of messes my whole theory up, actually. It's about a guy who was actually a slave who owes a certain king 10,000 talents. Now, 10,000 anything is a lot. We kind of, maybe, you know, translate it in your own mind, he owed $10,000. It's not $10,000. What he owed was an enormous amount. Let me give you some perspective so you understand the debt he has. The total tax revenue for Judea, Samaria, and Galilee combined was 900 talents. This guy owed 10,000 talents. The tabernacle in Exodus 38 cost 29 talents to build. The temple overlaid with gold cost 3,000 talents. So the fact that this guy owes 10,000 talents means he had a debt he couldn't pay. In a thousand lifetimes, he had a debt he couldn't pay. All he could hope for was mercy. It's weird in the text, though. And this is a little clue about some things relative to his response. He didn't ask for mercy. He begs the king for patience. And then he says, I promise to repay you everything. He's an idiot. He's not asking for mercy. And I just have this thing about wondering, I wonder if when people still don't know they need mercy, even though mercy is their only hope, but they haven't dialed into how desperately needy of mercy they are, when they get it, they're not grateful. Well, he does get mercy, actually, even though he just asked for patience, It's verse 27. And the lord of that slave felt compassion, released him, and forgave him the debts, which, if my theory is right, would make him merciful because having received, he would give. He would remember that he got mercy. But in the very next verse, verse 28, when this guy discovered that someone owed him 100 denarii, which is a pittance, particularly compared to the amount he owed, he had no mercy at all. and so he seized him began to choke him the text says saying pay me back everything you owe what's up with that blows my theory because he should have been merciful well i do have some theories about this guy i kind of already touched on him that he didn't even ask for mercy he was asking for patience and so when mercy came he wasn't grateful therefore he wasn't um merciful the text doesn't say any of that. The text just says he's a wicked slave. But when it happens to us, we don't show mercy, and it does happen to us. I'm not always sure it's rank wickedness, as much as it sometimes is simple forgetfulness. Because here's the deal. If we forget, even for a little while, that we had a debt we couldn't pay, in the blink of an eye, we can come to believe that we weren't forgiven of all that much after all. And with that goes your gratitude. And with your gratitude goes your mercy. And in the blink of an eye, we can become like the Pharisee we talked about last week in Luke 18, who prayed thus to himself, I thank you, God, I'm not like other people, like those kind of people, swindlers, the unjust, and adulterers, for whom he had no mercy, only contempt. The slave owed 10,000 talents in Matthew 18, 26. Again, I'll pay back everything. Could he have not known he had a debt he couldn't possibly pay? So what's the safeguard? What's the cure? I don't know, but I wonder, is it as simple, is it too simple to suggest that the safeguard and the cure for us is to remember and to do it right now? To do it, to prepare yourself to come to this table, to remember that you, that I, that we, had a debt we couldn't pay. That we, every single one of us, were separate from Christ, Ephesians chapter 2, excluded from the commonwealth, strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God, But now, through Christ, we who were formerly far off have been brought near to remember that we weren't just separate. We were dead in our trespasses and in our sins, but God being rich in what? Mercy. Because of the great love with which he loved us has made us alive. together with Christ, for by grace we have been saved, and that not of yourselves, you were at the mercy. So as we come to the table this morning, I think it would be really good to get quiet right now. In your spirit, get quiet and remember. I had a debt I couldn't pay. But God, being rich in mercy, guess what? Here's the mercy right here at this table. It's in the bread and it's in the cup. So come and eat and drink and come to receive again the mercy and the grace you need in order to become merciful yourself. Because blessed are the merciful. Steve. We remember the night that Jesus shared a meal with 12 of his closest friends at a table that was much lower than this one. It was near the floor, and with their elbows they reclined around it, and with their hands they dipped bread. And with their eyes they looked at each other, and with their mouths they spoke. Until Jesus, with his mouth, spoke, and with his hands raised up bread and said, This is my body, which was broken for you. Take and eat. And then he raised a cup of wine and he said, This cup is the new covenant in my blood. And whenever you drink it, remember me. Remember me. And with their hands, they received that bread. And with their mouths, they drank that cup. Even the one, the one called Judas, who was to betray him later on that night. and with his feet Judas turned from that table and went and received in his hands 30 pieces of silver and he betrayed Jesus. And after he did that, we learned that he looked down in his hands and saw those 30 pieces of silver which had replaced the bread of life and he threw them down at the feet of the people who gave it to him and he, with his feet, ran away. And with his hands he took his own life because he, even though he realized he had a debt he could not pay, he did not have the courage to go to the one who would have given him mercy. Contrast that with Peter who betrayed Jesus himself. And the next time that Peter saw Jesus after he had risen from the dead, we read that he was in a boat and Jesus was on shore. And with his feet, he leapt into the water because he couldn't wait for the boat to get to shore. And Jesus put a piece of fish and a piece of bread in Peter's hands and forgave him. That's mercy. And when we come to the table, when we come to the feast of Jesus, we remember that even though our debt could not be paid by ourselves, with our feet we run to the table because that debt has been paid. Amen. That debt has been paid. And so we realize that in this bread and in this cup are symbolized the body and the blood that bring us life and salvation. I want to invite the communion stewards to come down. And as they do that, getting ready to serve you, I want to explain what's going to happen if you've never been here. What happens is three things all at the same time as we take communion. The first thing that'll happen is that we're gonna sing songs, songs of worship to our merciful King. And that's gonna happen all throughout this time. The second thing that'll happen is the cross is available for you. If you need to come down and just commune with Jesus and focus your eyes on Jesus, even bow and kneel and just be with Jesus, the cross is available for you. and then the third thing is that you can come down and from these stewards receive communion and there will be a basket of crackers and you'll be given one and a word of blessing will be spoken over you and you'll take that cracker and dip it into the cup and some more words will be spoken of blessing to you and if you have a small child that's up there with you and you feel like your child is too young you can just tell the steward that and they will pray a blessing over your child. Now, if you're up in the balcony, there will be servers up there. The same with the viewing rooms, the same in the gathering area. So just go to the server that is closest to you. Let's pray. Jesus, for your life, we thank you. And with our feet, we run to you. We run to you for mercy. And the blood of salvation that now flows through our veins gives us redemption. And for that we thank you. And so with our hands we receive that. And also give us the courage after we've received to with our feet go toward people and with our hands extend mercy to them. Give us the courage to do that. Amen. Amen.
