All right, how does God bless us? How does God bless us? Let's get really practical with this. How does God bless us in the midst of the work of his kingdom? Okay? The very first thing that God blesses us with is his companionship. His companionship. John chapter 5. I'm assuming many of you have gone through Henry Black and Be's study experiencing God. Great study. If you haven't done it, I would encourage it. One of the key passages that he refers to in that study is John chapter 5, where Jesus heals a man who has been lame for 38 years. He's been sick 38 years. Jesus heals him. Well, you would think that was a good thing, but in this particular case, it was a bad thing, according to the religious leaders, because Jesus did it on the Sabbath. And you don't do those things on the Sabbath, according to the rules and regulations, what Jesus did. And so they come and they confront him. And Jesus says to them, but my father is working until now, and I myself am working. In other words, this is not, my father said, today let's heal this man. After all, as he said in another passage, The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. You've got it backwards. So anyway, when he says, my father is working until now, they were really upset because now he was calling God his own father. That's blasphemy. And so they were seeking to kill him. And Jesus responds and says to them, truly, truly, I say to you, the son can do nothing of himself unless it is something he sees the father doing. For whatever the father does, these things the son also does in like manner. and Blackby makes a point in his study that it's not our job or our place to dream great dreams for God or to establish our plans and ask God to join us, but rather it's our job to seek God, see where he's working, and then align our lives with where he's going. Well, that's what Jesus is saying in that verse. I do nothing on my own. I see what the Father is doing and then I adjust my life to join him. Now, when I went through that study and I was sitting at my dining room table that morning, I asked myself a couple of questions. First of all, Are you telling me that God the Father could not have healed that man that day unless Jesus showed up? Nope, I think God the Father could have healed that man without Jesus showing up that day. Are you telling me that Jesus couldn't have healed that man unless the Father allowed him to do it? Everything I learned from Bible school was that Jesus is completely God. Therefore, Jesus in and of himself could have healed that man. But yet Jesus says in that passage, that's not the way we work. Question, why? Why? Well, for the Father loves the Son and shows him all these things that he himself is doing, and greater works than these will show him that you may marvel. The reason why the Father and Son work like that, and the reason why Jesus was saying, I can do nothing on my own, is not because he technically couldn't. It's because that's not the nature of the way in which they work. Why not? Because the Father and the Son love each other and they do life together. You see, they are the first community, small group, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Godhead operates in a context of community. They do life together. God says, I can reach your neighbor without you, but I would rather do it with you because I want to do life with you. I can send encouragement to the person who's despairing in the hospital, but I would like to go with you because I want to do life with you. I can feed the hungry without you. I can drop manna from heaven. When the nation of Israel, you know, I had birds literally fly into camp and say, here we are. I can do that sort of thing. But I would rather use you because I want to do life with you. I don't need you. I want you. And I invite you to my work so that you and I can do life together. This was reinforced by Jesus who said in John 15, I am the vine, you are the branches. Abide in me. You abide in me, you bear much fruit. For apart from me, you can do nothing. God not only said, I want to do life with you. What he said is, I got you in a bind because, you know what, you can't bear fruit apart from me. How do you like that? you got to do life with me. If I said to every wife here, okay, every wife here, ask you the question, okay, your husband needs you or he wants you, which would you prefer? Now ladies, would that take you a long time to think that through? Let me see, I want to be needed, I want to be wanted. Well, ladies, what would you prefer? Boy, that was really difficult. God says, I don't need your help. I want your help because I want you. And I invite you to my work because through my work you and I get to do life together. God's after companionship. He wants you. Wants to do life with you. If he just said, oh yeah, you go about your day and I'll go about my day. I'll save the world and you just go sell insurance. No, no, no, no, no. God says, I'm going with you to the insurance agency so you and I can work there together. I'm going to the auto dealership so you and I can sell cars here today together I'm going down to clean homes with you today so you and I can do life together because you see I want to hang with you isn't it amazing God of the universe wants to hang with you and he invites you and I to his work so that we can do life together you know for many years I operated under the assumption in the back of my mind subtly that God invited me into a relationship with himself so that he could put me to work I now understand that God has invited me to his work so that he and I can have a greater relationship. God brings you into a relationship with himself invites you to join his work so that you can create a relationship. Because what do you know to be true about your relationships with the people with whom you work? What happens to those relationships? They grow, don't they? They grow. Because you're doing life together. Well, God says, join my work so that you and I can do life together. That's one of the ways God blesses us, with his companionship. Second thing God does to bless us is with the companionship of brothers and sisters in Christ. The companionship of brothers and sisters in Christ. 1 Corinthians 12, we don't need to read it. It's all about the body of Christ. Paul talks about the body of Christ and how we operate as a body. Luke chapter 10, the 70 were sent out two by two. Now you would think if Jesus owned a business and he was trying to build a ministry business, he could have covered twice the ground had he sent them out as individuals. But he doesn't, does he? He sends them out by twos. Because you see, one of the great blessings and benefits of being engaged in the work is that we do it with the companionship of brothers and sisters in Christ. When you take this to its logical implications for everyday life, what this means is nobody in the kingdom should ever do anything alone. People with the gift of hospitality, people with the gift of helps, like to work behind the scenes. My brother here who does the sound, he probably doesn't want to speak. He'd just as soon be behind the curtain there, do the sound thing. People who do the hospitality thing and set up refreshments and all that. If you go to them, often, often this happens, you go to them and you say to them something like, do you need any help? What do they say? Nope. What's their next sentence? I have it handled. And God sits on his throne and he says, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're not getting it. There is no such thing in my kingdom as I have it handled. We don't do I things. We don't do I things. I don't even do an I thing Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and if you look at Genesis 1 we were all involved right? Jesus wasn't sitting in the back saying well you know wake me up when it's my time to you know come down do the Mary thing you know be born in a manger let me know when my time comes the Holy Spirit says yeah when you get done with your three and a half years and Acts chapter 2 is ready to unfold let me know and I'll show up no Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were all involved going back all the way to creation Genesis chapter 1. God says we do it together. And he says when I put my work in place, the first thing is you got to do it with me, but the second thing is you got to do it with each other. And one of the great blessings of being involved in my work is that I'm going to force you to do life with each other. And by the way, when you go back to the two great commandments, aren't those reinforced? Love the Lord your God with all your heart, so mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus says that about gets it. So friends, when we're engaged in the work, the great blessings, number one and number two is, we do it with him and we do it with each other. God has given us his work as an excuse to hang out with him and to hang out with each other. We don't hang out with each other and with him to do his work. He gave us the work so that we can hang out with him and each other. Now, friends, that is a total shift of the paradigm. But it makes a huge difference because, you see, you're not a means to an end. You're an end in yourself. God doesn't have his work in your means to getting it done. God uses his work as a means to get you done. Three. Three and four go together, so I'll say them together. A life filled with meaning and purpose. A life filled with meaning and purpose is a blessing of being involved in the work. And four, we also receive an affirmation of personal worth and value. Ephesians 2.10 is one of the great verses of the entire Bible. Not that any are greater than any others. They're all great. But Ephesians 2.10 happens to be one of my pet favorites. Ephesians 2.10 says, For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. you know if every believer understood the first five words of Ephesians 2.10 no believer would ever have a self-esteem problem for we are his workmanship now self-esteem is a big issue if you don't believe me you just go down to your local Barnes and Noble or whatever the other bookstore is and just ask them for the self-esteem section say do you have any books on self-esteem yes we have that wall what part of the wall the whole wall because self-esteem is such a major issue. No believer should have a self-esteem issue because we are his workmanship. Let me explain what I mean. About 15 years ago, my wife and I went to Paris. My wife's been a flight attendant for United Airlines. And one of the benefits of being a flight attendant is you can fly for free when there's a seat available on the plane. So we at that time had one child, and my in-laws were going to watch him for a few days, so we said, well, let's get on a plane, we'll go to Paris. So when you go to Paris, you feel somewhat obligated to go see the famous sights. Right? Okay. And so they have this thing over there called the Louvre. It's a little art gallery. Now, for me personally, I didn't have any real desire to go to the Louvre. We have a great art gallery in Chicago. I grew up in Chicago. I've never been to it. Don't ever plan to go. Haven't missed it. We go to Paris. My wife says, let me go to the Louvre. I says, well, you know, probably should. I mean, after all, you know, Mona Lisa, you know, you know, David, and, you know, in the buff, and all those sorts of things. They're there. We probably ought to go see them. Okay? So, we go to the Louvre. Went through the Louvre in 45 minutes. Now, if I hadn't had my wife along, I could have done it in 15. I really could have. Oh, dear. Now, I've been to the Baseball Hall of Fame four times. The first time I was there, I was there for eight hours. Okay? Room by room by room. And I stood in front of Babe Ruth's locker and looked at his uniform. Even at this moment, it moves me just thinking about being there. Seeing Ty Cobb's spikes and looking where they really sharpened. The Louvre. So I'm walking around the Louvre. Oh yeah, there's a nice wall-sized painting. And yeah, that's a nice sculpture. And yeah, Michelangelo. Whatever. Move on, move on. We get to the room with the Mona Lisa. How many of you have been to Louvre? Oh, if you've been to Louvre. Okay. So you go in the room with the Mona Lisa. So here in this, you know, really a good-sized room, and on one wall you have this literally wall-sized painting. On the back wall, this wall-sized painting. On the back wall, this wall-sized painting. And on this wall, the Mona Lisa. And it's about, you know, this big. You know, it's not very big. Okay? And they've got this red kind of a, what do they call it, like a rope, okay, that goes around the front, so you can't walk into that area. I've got a couple of guards standing there. And so people are kind of standing there just looking at the Mona Lisa. And I'm standing in the back of the room thinking, well, there she is. What is the big deal? I mean, she's really not all that attractive. Really, I think the paintings and these other walls are much more spectacular than that. And so being the art person that I am, I asked myself the question, what makes that so valuable? In fact, I wonder what that's worth. So I asked, how much is that worth? So that's priceless. Priceless. No price tag associated with it. You can't put a price, in other words, can't even value its worth. It's beyond any estimation of value. I wasn't going to take it or anything. I was just wondering. Okay? You took it. You couldn't even sell it. it's priceless couldn't even sell it it's priceless what makes it so valuable again I've been through the whole museum and I'm being to the naked eye there are a lot of other paintings that I thought were a lot more impressive I think the reason it's priceless is because of who painted it who painted the Mona Lisa Leonardo da Vinci and because Leonardo da Vinci was who Leonardo da Vinci was what he painted is priceless so get this now a man who's been dead 500 years he's now dust painted something that today hangs on a wall it is an inanimate object it does nothing but hang on the wall in fact my guess is it's there right now hanging on the wall. Not doing a thing. That's priceless. And you read in Ephesians 2.10, for we are his workmanship. If an inanimate object painted by a man who's been dead 500 years is priceless, then what is a living, breathing human being indwelt with the Spirit of God created by the living God, what is such a person worth in comparison? do you realize you are his workmanship you are God's painting on display to the world feel any better about yourself now God says that's the theoretical truth that is the theory you are my workmanship you are my painting on display to the world. I am crafting you. That's what you're worth. Way beyond priceless. But you know what? A lot of us read that, you hear me use that in a little analogy and you say, okay, I get the concept, I understand, I do. But I don't feel like I'm worth all that much. Anybody there? Okay, now I get the theory. I got it in my head. You got me your illustration. I'll never forget that one. You got me. But I don't feel like I'm worth that much. And God says, I understand that. And you know what? I want you to feel like you're worth that much. So you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to put a whole bunch of good works in your path before you every single day. And as you walk through your day, if you have me as your companion, as you're walking through the day, I'm going to whisper in your ear, and I'm going to say, oh, there's an opportunity for good work. There's an opportunity for good work. There's an opportunity for good work. There's an opportunity for good work. You see, God is not simply a God of theory. God is a God of practical application. God says, not only are you worth something, I'm going to create opportunities in life for you to experience your worth. And so, you know, my friend, when he writes a check for that foundation, and he sees that check go to help feed hungry kids or build a community center to reach inner-city kids in Chicago or to buy computers so that they can have tutoring stations so that kids who are in eighth grade who have never learned to read can learn to read. And he knows that his check, the check that he wrote, participated in helping to make that sort of thing happen, how do you think he and his wife feel about themselves? You know, frankly, it's a lot more satisfying than going out and buying one more Porsche. It really is. The thrill of buying a Porsche lasts for a week or two. But when you see the lives of kids change because God used you to participate in some way, that has a lasting sense of meaning and purpose. And God says, do you understand? I am going to place the opportunity for good works in your path beforehand, and all you have to do is walk into them and not miss them. Now, what is required in order not to miss them? You have to be what? In relationship with him so that when you come across it, you notice because he says, Aha! There's a guy who's lame. Jesus, let's heal him. And Jesus, that day, walking along, sees the man. The father whispers to him and says, Hey, Jesus, my power's available. Let's heal him. And Jesus says, That's great, Dad. Let's do it. Friends, through the course of your day, today, your heavenly father has put the potential for good works in your path. And he wants to relate to you in such a way that as you're walking through the day, you have the ability to hear his voice, recognize those good works, And step in and do something about it. So that when you lay your head on the pillow tonight, you look back upon your day and you say, you know what, I had a chance to live Saturday, November 23rd, one time in my life, and my life made a difference in the world today, to the glory of God. Friends, that ought to be the case every day for us as believers. That's why God calls us to his work. To bless us with a sense of meaning and purpose and an affirmation of our value and our worth that we are in fact his workmanship. His paintings on display. Fifth, blessing of being engaged in his work is the inner working of the Holy Spirit. The inner working of the Holy Spirit. Philippians chapter 2.13 says, For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work, for his good pleasure. For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work, for his good pleasure. I have three children. My two oldest are boys. And then over the years, as they've grown up, I have done as much coaching of their athletic involvements as possible. Thankfully, God has made them to enjoy athletics, which is a good thing for me as a dad because that was my background. That's what I know. That's what I understand. That's my world. You probably couldn't tell that from my illustration about the Hall of Fame. in case you missed it. That's kind of my thing, is sports, okay, on the side. So my boys, you know, starting at young, started coaching them in soccer, you know, which I had to give up about the age of eight or nine because, you know, then, like, you had to know what you were talking about. And most of us my age don't know anything we're talking about when it comes to soccer other than, you know, like, go get the ball, kick it, stop them, you know, whatever, knock them down, you know, whatever, trip them. Not really. But I coached baseball, I coached football, I coached basketball, all these different things. And the reason I've done that over the years has really been threefold. Number one, I enjoy it. Before going into ministry, I'd planned to go into coaching as a career. I was going to one day stand on the sidelines of a major college university and be coaching one of those major sports until God led otherwise. So I enjoy it. But if I didn't have my own kids involved, in all honesty, I don't enjoy it enough right now to where I'd be doing it. The second reason I do it is really where it kicks in, And that is, you see, it gives me an opportunity to hang with my kids. I figure, why should I take my kids over to the park and let them hang with another dad for two hours? I only have my kids for so long. I'm going to spend as much time with them as I possibly can. So I coached my son's eighth grade football team this past fall. Gave me an opportunity every afternoon to spend two hours with my son and his friends. Companionship. The third reason I do it is because I know enough about athletics to know that the athletic arena is a place where character is forged. And life lessons are learned. You learn about winning. You learn about losing. You learn about handling winning. You learn about handling losing. You learn about personal discipline. You learn about perseverance. You learn about injustice. You learn about dealing with unfairness. You learn about dealing with people who are more talented than you. You learn to deal with people who are less talented than you. You learn to deal with people who have no talent but are trying hard. You learn the deal with people who have a lot of talent but aren't trying at all. You learn to work in the context of team. You learn to deal with people who are quiet. You learn to deal with people who are noisy. You learn to come under the authority of coaches, some who are good, some who are not so good. You learn to deal với referees. You learn to deal with opposition. You learn how to relate to people in competitive situations and yet walk away being friends. There's a lot of lessons for life and a lot of character that gets forwarded on the athletic field. And I look at it and say, you know what? Football is the game we're playing. But what this is really about is using football to teach the principles of life to young boys. And at the top of the list is my own sons. So as a dad, I say, okay, well, I enjoy it. But more importantly than that, it gives me an opportunity to hang with my kids. And it gives me an opportunity to teach life's lessons. So, for example, through the course of the year with the football team, one of the principles I taught them, tried to teach them, was Galatians 6-7, which says, Do not be deceived, God is not mocked. For whatever man sows, this he will also reap. And the way I paraphrase that is, when you make good decisions in life, usually good things happen. And when you make bad decisions, usually bad things happen. So I've talked to the kids, you know, through the course of the football season about, to the boys, you know, guys, when you make good decisions in life, let's talk about good decisions. What are good decisions? And we talk about good decisions. What are bad decisions, guys? Well, you know, coach doing drugs, you know, smoking, drinking, you know, not treating girls the right way, you know, immorality sexually, you know, looking at pornography. Those are all bad decisions, guys, right? Bad decisions? Well, guys, you need to understand something. God is not mocked. God is not deceived. If you get engaged in making those bad decisions, a bad thing is going to happen in your life. You got that? So I went to speak at a chapel last week at the school. At a point in time, I referred to that briefly, and I said, okay, football players, when you make good decisions, and then they all say, good things happen. And when you make bad decisions, bad things. So you see, the athletic arena becomes a place where a father teaches a son lessons for life and helps forge character. What God says is, my work is my field of play where I teach you about life and where I forge your character and where I get to spend time with you. So get on my field of play. So I say to people, believers who are not involved in the work of the kingdom in any tangible way. They don't see themselves being engaged in the work of the kingdom. I say, you're missing out because God is inviting you and it's not about what you can do for him. It's about what he intends to do in you. I've been involved in ministry, career ministry, for the better part of the last 26 years. And I can tell you that no matter how many messages I've ever given, how much truth has ever been disseminated, how many ministries I've helped put together, no one has benefited from the ministry I've been involved in more than who? Me. The truth I teach you today, no one has benefited from this truth more than me. This is why the person who teaches in the children's ministry and puts their lesson together to teach kids, when it's all said and done, you know who's learned the most? The teacher. And the leader who has had to forge through difficulty and resolve conflict. And at the end of it says, boy, you know, that was really a difficult process. And you say, okay, well, what was born out of your life in this? And all of a sudden, when they start to list it off, they say, you know what? I was blessed by walking through that situation. Friends, God calls us to his playing field for the purpose of doing his work in us. And he does his work in us. through it. Sixth blessing of being involved in his work is, we already talked about this, his joy. That we live with his joy. Such that the end result of living a blessed life, this is the way I'd summarize it, the nature and the attributes of God are put on display for his glory. you know if I said to you today hey this afternoon before you come to the service tonight if you come tonight there's going to be an art exhibit out here in the you know in the lobby area okay there's a there's a there's an artist by the name of Bill Smith and he's a 75 year old man and what we're going to do is we're going to take all the major works of his life and we're going to put them out in the lobby tonight. Okay? So when you come, just like it as him. Now, you say, well, I don't even know who he is. You say, that's right, come and look at his works. Well, if you came and looked at his works, okay, and let's say you spent 15, 20 minutes just walking from painting to painting to painting to painting to painting, and when you get all done, I ask you the question, tell me what you know about the artist. Would you be able to? Of course you would. You say, well, I really think he likes people. Why do you say that? Well, every painting he has is filled with people. Well, I think he likes nature. How do you know that? Well, every painting behind the people is nature. He doesn't seem to have any affinity for animals because in no painting does he have any animals. He seems to like color, although these three paintings over here, if they were painted in a certain season, maybe that was a season when he was kind of down because the colors are very drab and the expressions on people's faces are very sad. So maybe during that era when he was painting those, maybe that's the way he was feeling. You learn a lot about the artist by looking at his works. You know what God says, friends? You are my paintings. Do you understand that? God says, you are my paintings. And people are drawing conclusions about who I am based on what they see in you. so if they deal with you and they find like the fruit of the spirit love and joy if that's what they see then they conclude that that must be the God whom you worship but if you if you're not displaying that then God people are getting a different impression and how many times have you heard people say well I don't go to church because of what the church is just filled with hypocrites. In other words, what they're saying is, you know, I've hung around Christians and I've just found that, to put in the terminology I've been using, they're just a bunch of bad paintings. Ouch. Ouch. This is why it is so important that every Christian businessman and woman operate with integrity. Because it's not about your integrity. It's about God's integrity. It's not about your profitability. It's about God's integrity. It's why it's so important if you're waitressing or waitering in a restaurant why you deal with people in kindness even when they're rude to you. Because it's not about your tip. It's about the kindness and the goodness of God in the midst of injustice or rudeness. It's why it's so important when we talk to neighbors that we deal with them in love and in truth because it reflects on God. Friends, we reflect on God. We are his paintings. And so what does God do so we can be the best paintings? He puts his grace in our lives. He gives us spiritual gifts. He gives us the Holy Spirit. He gives us companionship. He gives a companionship of brothers and sisters in Christ. He fills our lives with meaning and purpose. He gives us a sense of value and worth. He has his Holy Spirit working within us. He fills us with his joy. He blesses us with all that. So that then we can go out and be a painting that blesses the world in which he's called us to live. Now, when you add all six of these things together, do you begin to understand how you and I get blessed by being involved in the work of the kingdom. To such a degree that I just look at people who aren't engaged in the work of the kingdom, who are so busy in their own agendas, and so busy in their own purposes, and trying to build their own kingdom, and trying to get so wealthy so that they can buy the next car, or the second house, or the third house, or whatever it is down the road. You just say, no, no, you're missing it. You're missing it. You're missing it. You're settling for crumbs when the God of the universe wants to give you a feast. You're gaining the whole world and losing your soul. Because in the scope of eternity, this life we live on earth, friends, is like a two-week vacation. And there are so many believers walking around who are building a life as though this is it. And friends, this isn't it. This is the pregame for what really matters. The end result of living a best life is that the nature and the attributes of God are put on display for the world to see. Jesus said, if you knew me, John 8, 19, if you knew me, you would know the Father. John 12, 45, he who beholds me, beholds the one who sent me. True for all of us. We have a general calling and we have a specific calling. The general calling we've already talked about, Ephesians 2, 10, Acts 10, 38. We need to go through life. Every place we go through the course of the world, Every place we go, everything we do, every interaction we have, the general calling is to be engaged in good works and work to take back from the devil that which rightfully belongs to God. And friends, it doesn't have to be major things. It can be little things. I try and make a point when I travel quite a bit and I walk through a lot of airports. And when I walk through airports, I will often, because I've just gotten off a plane and stopped in a restroom, And I often see people in a restroom at an airport cleaning it. And I think to myself, what is a lower job than cleaning an airport restroom? I mean, what kind of an education does this person have? What are they getting paid? What joy is there in doing this? Imagine, you know, getting up in the morning and saying, well, here we go. And I'm going to, you know, push my cart around. I'm going to go in and clean up places that people just make a mess of. So what I've tried to do is make a little point, and I picked this up from somebody else who shared it with me. I've tried to make a point that when I see people doing that, to simply stop and turn to them and say in a moment, you know what, I travel a lot. I come into a lot of restrooms and airports, and I really appreciate when they're clean, and so I just want to thank you for what you're doing here today. Do a good job. Have a great day. Now, what do you think that does for them? Think they're going to clean differently the rest of the day? they'll probably go another year never have anybody ever say that again unless they run into one of you and when I walk out of the restroom how do you think I feel about myself see just in a little way took me how long 15 seconds made a difference in someone's world when you stop to think about it if Jesus were to enter the restroom who do you think what do you think he would say how do you think Jesus would deal with people such as that. Well, I think in the Gospels we know how Jesus would deal with them. Well, friends, we need to walk in his footsteps and do what he would do. That's the general calling on our lives. Right? But in addition to a general calling, he has for us a specific calling. And that specific calling is where he wants us to be a laser beam for his purposes. And every single one of us has a specific calling. That was something which God has called you to do utilizing that which he has given you. What has he given you? Well, number one, you need to identify your spiritual gifts. You see the four passages that talk in the New Testament about spiritual gifts. God has given every single one of us at least one gift, probably two or three, minimum. Spiritual endowments, enablements, abilities that enable us to do things with the power of God that other people who don't hold those gifts can't do with the same degree of fruitfulness. I told you in the very beginning that we had this group of kids who were coming in from Palatine every day to 30 minutes into Park Ridge to our youth ministry. Mike Bourbon had grown up in a Catholic background that had meant nothing to him growing up and he early in high school had done the alcohol thing and had done the drug thing and had had somebody share the gospel with him and he came to know Jesus and his life was changed. dramatically. So Dave Hombel, our music guy, I told you about, ran into Mike and we needed a drummer and Mike happened to be a drummer and they happened to cross paths. And so Dave invited Mike to come play drums for our little youth group music ministry. Well, Mike had a gift of evangelism. And so he came into our youth ministry, and as it began to reach out to more and more kids on the outside, Mike, just because of his gift of evangelism, began to share his faith. So pretty soon he was bringing in a band full of kids from Palatine into Park Ridge. Every single week, 30 minutes, he'd bring them in. Pretty soon one band wasn't enough, so one of the other kids would bring their car, and they would drive in, and pretty soon it became three or four cars. and if I say, you know, this is kind of dangerous and maybe someone's going to get in an accident, it's kind of hard to do this caravan thing, let's pool our money and rent a bus. So Mike and his friends rented a school bus. Eventually one bus wasn't enough, they rented two buses. Two buses wasn't enough, they rented three buses. Three buses wasn't enough, they rented four buses. Every single Wednesday night, four busloads of kids would be to Palpatine High School. They would load up the buses and they would travel 30 minutes into Park Ridge, go through the evening, get back on the buses and go back home. It was all the fruit of Mike Bourbon and the gift of evangelism which God had given him. I mean, if you were a non-Christian and you spent five minutes with Mike, you were going to hear about Jesus. You were going to hear about Jesus. That's just the way the guy was. He kept telling us, someday God's going to do something great in Palatine. And we said, yeah, sure he is, Mike. Right. Yeah, well, as soon as we get some people out there, you know, and put down the farms and things, yeah, they probably will. In 1975, in October, Willow Creek Community Church started in Palatine with the group of kids that Mike led to Christ, for the most part. Friends, he had a gift. He had a supernatural ability. We had another man in the early years of the church by the name of Dick Slutman, now lives in Florida. He's 78 years old. He works on the staff of Youth for Christ. He has a gift of mercy, just pouring out of every fiber of his being. And he deals specifically now with prison ministry. He goes and visits kids. in young men who are in prison. Shares the gospel with them, encourages them, disciples them, does studies with them. He called last week, and I could hear his voice cracking on the other end. He was so moved. He said, I was able to get a bunch of the young men from the prison down, freed for an evening, and we went to a Youth for Christ rally. And as he's sharing this, I could literally hear his voice cracking on the other end. He was so moved. And what's being moved in him is his gift of mercy. He's got this incredible gift of mercy. I would, in the early years of Willow Creek, go visit people in the hospital with Dick once in a while. And sometimes I would just find myself in those situations, you know, kind of slipping to the back of the room as I would watch Dick interact with this person. I would think to myself, you know, I could say exactly what he's saying, but it just wouldn't sound the same. Why? Because he has this gift of mercy. And God just comes through that gift. If you've ever been in a small group with a person who's got the gift of teaching, you know you also do a certain passage in and uh... you know someone your leaders as well you know we these verses and tell us what you got to see you reading you reading you reading i got something i i got something out of it i can show it feel good about this until you share the one nugget of truth that you think is going to revolutionize everybody's life as you go on the room all of a sudden you come to somebody they have the gift of teaching and outlined the entire passage and they've got an illustration for every point in every verse and And you say, what Bible do you have? I've got to get that one. Is that the teacher's edition? What edition do you have? No, they don't have the teacher's edition. They've got the gift of teaching. So when they read the Word, God, because of the Holy Spirit at work in them, brings certain things, illuminates certain things to them that other people without the gift of teaching, they don't get. You have a spiritual gift. Do you know what it is, and how are you using it? If you don't, then you're robbing your brothers and sisters in Christ of God's power in your life. Do you know your gift and are you using it? That's the place in which God wants to make you a laser beam for Him. Second thing is you need to identify a place for passion-filled expression. Identify a place for passion-filled expression. 1 Corinthians 13 is a chapter all about love. It is sandwiched between 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, which are about gifts. The body of Christ, chapter 12. The body of Christ and how it operates, chapter 14. Now, love is in the middle. Well, you think to yourself, well, Paul finished chapter 12 and said, well, that's all I want to say about gifts. I'm going to change the subject now, talk about love. And then at the end of the love chapter, he says, you know what, I've got some more things I'm going to say, and so I'm going to then go back to that subject. Huh? no friends the Holy Spirit wasn't confused about how he was leading Paul to write what he was saying is in the midst of the gifts being expressed and how the body of Christ operates there's one dominant expression of God's presence that must come through and that presence is love it must come through God's passion I was trying to make this point clear to a bunch of leaders at Willow Creek a number of years ago and talking about passion and what that is and what that looks like and I spoke of it this way. I said, there are some of you here today who are involved in children's ministry and the reason you're involved in children's ministry is you think it's the most important ministry in the church. You think and you really believe that if we just did kids the right way, we could get rid of a whole bunch of other ministries because we could get people started off on the right track in life and that would set them on the right course and we wouldn't have to do a bunch of these other things that we're doing to try to recover from the fact that as kids, they didn't get the right stuff. You think children's ministry is the most important ministry in the church. Now others of you are sitting here and you're saying, well, children's ministry is good, but it's too young. Junior high is where it's really at. It's when they're, you know, 12, 13, 14 years old and they're just beginning to be independent. Boy, if you can keep them involved in the church then. Boy, that's the key juncture in life. I mean, a 10-year-old doesn't have much choice, but a 13, 14-year-old? So you say junior high is where it's really at. And then someone else comes along and says, nah, it's not junior high, that's still a little bit too young. It's high school. Boy, that's when peer pressure escalates, and then, you know, you get a car, and you've got some freedom, and you're hanging with your friends more than you're hanging with your parents. And boy, it's high school. And I say, after all, 85% of all those who come to Christ do so before the age of 18. You heard that? Okay. Now let me ask you, whoever took a poll of the world to find that out? Somebody polled the world. So if you came to Christ, you know, at whatever age, put it down and found out that 85% of all the world came to Christ before the age of 18. Friends, no one ever took that poll. That is a rumor that was started by a youth pastor years ago. And it caught on. Now, Billy Graham comes along and he says, the most important ministry of the church is what? Evangelism. The loss. That's what it's about. I don't care about the children, the junior high and all that. they're all going to hell, we need to get them on the track to heaven. And Jim Dodson says, well that's just great, Billy, you keep doing your crusade, I just want to get moms and dads, being moms and dads and husbands and wives the way they need to, because if the family operated the way they need to, we wouldn't need to worry about the children's ministry or the senior high, or any of these things, because families would be what they're supposed to be. And then someone else comes along, the worship leader, and he says, well, I don't know about your Bible, but my Bible says whether you eat or drink, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. I think it's about worship, isn't it? And then someone else comes along and says, well, friends, you can make up all these different things and find verses, but let me just speak from Jesus. Okay? Jesus tells us what's most important. Are you ready? My house shall be called a house of... The prayer ministry is the most important thing in the life of the church. I rest my case. And someone else says, Well, that was just one verse. But when you take Jesus in a greater context, okay, like when he came into the temple for the first time as a young man, and he opened up the law, and it was sovereignly chosen for him, this particular passage was the one he would read. It wasn't by accident. This was sovereignly decided upon. He read Isaiah chapter 61. So let me just read it to you. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Because he has anointed me to bring good news to the afflicted. He sent me to bind up the broken heart, proclaim liberty to captives and freedom to prisoners. Are you beginning to get the flavor? God's greatest heart is for those who are living in places of injustice and suffering and the oppressed and the captives. And so missions and solving world hunger and going to places where Christians are being persecuted for their faith, this is the thing closest to the heart of God. Someone else is supposed to pour. And then someone else stands up, like David Johnson, and he says, well, that's all fine and dandy, but how would you know what God thinks about any of this if you didn't have what? Teaching of the Lord. I rest my case. Teaching of the Lord is the most important thing. Well, when I got through doing this with all the different leaders, and I went through all the ministries of the church, by the time I'm getting done, they're beginning to cheer when I come to their section. They're beginning to applaud and things. And I say, well, friends, for once and for all, I want to just tell you what is the most important thing. And that is the ministry that serves to bring all of this together so that it operates in unity. So it all looks like a finely-tuned machine is the most important ministry in the church. And that's why what I do is the most important. Now you say, okay, as you run through all that, what is really on the heart of God? Say everything. Which of us has a great enough capacity to be about all of that? So, here's what God says. God says, I'm going to give you this piece of my heart. And I'm going to give you this piece of my heart. And I'm going to give you this piece of my heart. I'm going to give you this piece of my heart. I'm going to give you this piece of my heart. You see, through your spiritual gift, you bring God's power to the church. When you come to a place of passion, you bring God's presence to the church. And friends, it's in that place of your spiritual gift and in the place of your God-given passion where you become a laser beam for the purposes of God. I'm deeply impassioned about leaders. You know, I come from a place of, you know, speed of the leader, speed of the king. What the pastors of America, if all the pastors of America, if all the spiritual leaders in America, in that matter of the world, and if all the lay leaders that are in the body of Christ, if all of them were leading the way they were supposed to be, then a whole bunch of ministries would happen the right way. I feel deeply about that. So what do I do in the kingdom in terms of my work? Guess who I work with? Leaders. Leaders. Now, do I think it's important to feed the poor? Yeah, I really do. Do I support some of that personally? Yes, I do. But it's not the driving passion of my heart. Rather, the driving passion of my heart is to raise up leaders who are passionate to feed the poor. And friends, all that's by God's design. And God will reach the world through his people if we will simply understand what God has given us to reach the world. He's given each of us gifts. He's given each of us a piece of his heart. And he says, I want you to be a reflection of my gifts in my heart. My power and my presence. Thank you.
