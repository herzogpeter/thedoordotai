And we pray it in the name of Jesus. Amen. Well, last week in our dealing with the parable of Lazarus and a rich man as found in Luke 16. We talked about, among other things, the fact that there is a kind of blindness of the eye, particularly as it relates to seeing the Lazaruses among us, a kind of hardness of the heart that cannot be cured with more information, with more sermons and preaching, with all the law and the prophets, or even with great revelation. Because if you haven't listened to and responded to Moses and the prophets, says Jesus in Luke 16, 31, which was the final verse, it was kind of the punchline of the parable last week. If you haven't listened to Moses and the prophets, then neither will you be persuaded by great revelation, information and revelation. If someone rises from the dead, you still won't respond. And last week, I kind of concluded my talk by saying that the last thing that some people need, actually, and this clearly applied to the Pharisees, to whom Jesus was telling this parable, that the last thing they needed was another sermon, more information, another small group Bible study, because if at some points we don't act on what we know, actively respond to the things that we've heard, move towards the light that we have seen, we can actually become blind to, incapable of responding to the lights we've seen, the truth we've heard, the things that we know, and what the Pharisees knew was the law and the prophets. They knew the Bible, which is a great thing to know and to love, but in their knowing but not doing, they were blind to the Lazaruses, to actually what Moses and the prophets were actually saying. Here's kind of the deal. As a general observation, and this is kind of an obvious thing, that those things that we continually do, we get better and better at doing. So if the general pattern of our lives is to act, even in small ways, on the things that we know, to respond to the things that we have heard, to begin to move, and then maybe just baby steps at first, toward the light that we have, then we will quite naturally get better and better at acting on what we know and responding to what we've heard and moving toward the light we've gotten. Indeed, as we do that, again, it doesn't take big steps, just little steps all along the way. As you move toward the light you've gotten, you actually get more light. But if we constantly shut it off, fend it off, explain it away, we can get better and better at that, too, until we actually can't see the light, lose our capacity even to respond to the light, all the while believing that we're in the light, which is why people like the Apostle James, in the epistle that bears his name, picks up this very same theme. He kind of gets the idea that maybe James knew something about the teachings of Jesus in James 1.22. He exhorts the people to whom he is writing there to prove yourselves. I mean, there's almost like a challenge. I want you to prove yourselves, demonstrate yourselves to be doers of the word and not hearers only who delude themselves, who delude themselves into believing that because they have heard it, known it, agree with it, maybe even memorize all the law and the prophets. They've got the word. They love the word. They delude themselves into believing that just because they know it and have heard it, that they've done the law and the prophets, that they've acted on them, been changed and transformed by them. The apostle Paul picks up the same theme. Again, you get this impression that they've listened to. They know the teachings of Jesus because Paul in the book of Philippians says exactly the same thing a different way in Philippians 4 verse 9 when he exhorts the people to whom he is writing to take the things that you've learned and received and heard and seen in me and what I want you to do is practice them. Don't just watch me do what I do, he says. Don't just listen. Practice these things because it's only in the doing of what we've learned and heard and unseen, that any real change takes place, that transformation can occur. Indeed, around here at Open Door, several years ago when we were going through the book of Philippians, you may remember, we kind of had this little phrase, and it was like this, and it was very important, that it isn't until we put our hand to, and what our heart prompts, that we put our hands, and we act upon those things that our head knows, that the catalytic power of transformation is released, that real change takes place. And the more you do it, the more you practice these things that you have heard and seen, even again in little ways, the better you get at doing them, but the more you shut it down, fend it off, fail to act on what you've heard and seen and known, the better you get at shutting it down until one day you're able to go to church. And always going to church, you're able actually to hear it, but you don't hear it, you're deaf. And you're able to see it, but you don't see it, you're blind. Particularly if you stick with the parable to the Lazaruses among us, you're blind to the things that Moses and the prophets are actually calling us to do. All of which brings me to the words this morning. And the word is this, be a little bit afraid of that. In other words, be a little bit afraid of getting to the point where we can hear without hearing, where we can see without seeing because we never acted on, responded to, or learned to practice the things we've seen and heard and learned. So if you have your Bibles with you this morning, I'd like you to take them and open them to the book of Philippians. The book of Philippians. To a text that, quite frankly, I didn't expect to go to this week. In fact, it wasn't even until Thursday that I kind of decided on this, because like a fly buzzing around my head, it just wouldn't go away. As I thought more and more about this issue, Philippians 2, verses 12 to 15, kept coming to mind, because it kind of underlines, it underlines what I'm trying to say here, and what the parable, I think, introduced us to last weekend. Philippians 2 also brings with it a sense of urgency that Jesus clearly had in Luke 16. Philippians chapter 2, beginning in the 12th verse, the Apostle Paul to his beloved friends in Philippi says this, So then, my beloved. I love it that he starts that way. It kind of sets the tone for everything. Just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more even in my absence. Here's what I want you to do while I'm gone. We're in a situation now where you won't be able to see me or hear me. here's what I want you to do in my absence work out your salvation with fear and trembling be a little bit afraid for it is God who is at work in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure do everything you do without grumbling or disputing that you may prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you appear as lights in the world Now, there's some interesting language in that text And what I want to do with it this morning is kind of two things First of all, I want to give you a paraphrase of that Which means just to kind of say all of that a different way And bring into it some meaning And then I want to kind of break it down into some individual parts And examine some of them So as to really hear what Paul is saying here First of all, my paraphrase is this Paul, speaking to these people that he dearly loves, says this Here's what I want you to focus on, beloved friends. In my absence, he says in verse 12, that you work out into your living where people can see the salvation that you have, the life of God that you have. In other words, he says it a different way, same thing later on. I want you to practice. I want you to act upon the things that you've learned and heard and seen in me. And I want you to do it with a sense of fear. Which is kind of weird. Indeed, I want you to be a little bit afraid of not doing, of not working out into your living where people can see the life of God you have. Why? Two reasons. Number one, here's why, because we're not playing church, says Paul in verse 13. This is a God thing, you guys, that we are involved in, for it is God who is at work in you. It is God who is at work in this great mission of the kingdom of God. Second reason, I want you to be a little bit afraid of not entering into authentically this life. Verse 15, it's because in a crooked and perverse generation, people who are actually doing these things, they actually are practicing the things they've heard and learned and seen. People like that appear as lights. in the world. They provide some hope, actually, in the world that maybe, and the hope is this that they provide, that maybe this God thing that so many people are talking about. If people in this crooked and perverse generation actually saw some people who were working that life out in a way that you could see it, it would provide for those people hope that God is real and that it isn't all just talk and sometimes very angry talk. So stop. He says, verse 14, all the grumbling and complaining. There'll be a lot of reasons to stop grumbling and complaining, but in the flow of this text, it's almost like I hear his heart say this. We don't have time. We don't have time for the petty stuff. The stakes are just way too high. Because in a crooked and perverse generation, people who are authentically living this are that generation's only possible hope. Well, there's my paraphrase. If you can repeat that, you're doing good. Let me kind of take some little pieces of this text, however, and break it down a little bit into individual pieces. There's two phrases I want to explain a little further because they raise some questions around which I'm going to build the rest of my thoughts this morning. The phrases both in verse 1 are these, that you, number one, work out your salvation, and number two, that you do it with fear and trembling. And those two phrases for me raise four questions. The four questions are these, number one, what does it mean to work out your salvation? And while I've kind of already hinted at what it means, I think, in my paraphrase, I want to make it clear what it doesn't mean. Because it doesn't mean work for your salvation. Because you've been saved by grace. Ephesians 2, 8 and 9. For by grace you have been saved, no doubt about it, through faith. And that not of yourselves was a gift from God, not of works, lest any man should boast. You don't work for your salvation. This exhortation is to work it out. as I said in my paraphrase, to work out into your living where people can actually see this salvation. You say you have this life that you have. Second question, why is that so important? Third question, how does verse 12, which seems to say, work this out yourself, work it out, it's in the imperative. How does that fit with verse 13, which clearly says that it's God who is at work in you? question, therefore, is which? Is it? Is it God doing the work, or is it me doing the work? Fourth question, how can fear and trembling ever be a good thing? How can fear and trembling ever be a positive force? Jesus said, fear not. Well, let's start with the fear thing first, because fear is generally regarded by most of us as a negative thing. Its effect most often is to weaken us. You know the feeling to debilitate, sometimes even paralyze us. The fact is that all of us, every single one of us, at one time or another, in one way or another, have been by fear hindered, in some cases prevented from acting, from doing the things you've heard and wanted to do. And the reason you didn't act and the reason you didn't do was you were just too afraid. So you didn't even try. The book of Hebrews speaks of people who, because of fear, shrink back from faith even, from the journey that they had been on in faith, continuing to follow God. So when you think about fear, never would you call people to fear. We would pray against fear as an enemy, never as a friend. indeed, the same Paul, and this is where it gets kind of confusing, who wrote in Philippians, to work out your salvation with fear and trembling. That same guy also wrote 2 Timothy 1.7, where he says that God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and discipline. So in that context, whatever fear is and wherever it comes from, it's not from God. 1 John 4.18 says perfect love casts out fear, and in that context, obviously, fear is a bad thing. needs to be cast out. But I submit that there is a kind of fear that is not a bad thing, and there's almost this line, we kind of maybe cross back and forth into it, because there is a kind of fear that far from weakening you and debilitating you actually quickens you, awakens you, and energizes you, and it's experienced by people, most often, who dare to do something that's a little bit, maybe a lot, beyond themselves, where the stakes are high, where the outcome matters. You're not sure of how it's going to go. Again, you're a little bit beyond yourself. And in those critical moments of our lives where something really matters, there is a fear that can come to us that shuts us down, that keeps us from acting. We don't even try, but there's another fear, and it's kind of close, because the word still is fear. Instead of shutting you down, it wakes you up. This requires all of my capacity, all of my energy and creativity. Why? Because the stakes are high. This really matters. In the business world, you've experienced this. You've been working on a project for six months, and Monday you present to the people who decide. And in that context, if it's really important, you know there's a kind of fear on that. There's an anxiety. There's a thing. And then sometimes the fear can be so strong it shuts you down. So you stumble and you bumble. You don't do it. Well, there's another fear around this that wakes you up. And it doesn't shut you down. It energizes you because this one really matters. I've got to be awake for this one. I've got to be aware. I might want to think this thing through really well and maybe even lose some sleep to do this right. We've experienced it in relationships. When you walk across the room to break the ice, just to meet that girl or that guy you want to meet, you just want to meet him. Maybe ask him for the first date. There's a fear on that. Shut you down. That's why some of you have never met her or him. better yet think about this day the day you decide to ask love of your life to marry you well there's a fear kind of fear that out one hand could shut you down so you never ask there's another kind of fear that wakes you up quickens your senses releases creativity so before you know it you're not just asking her to marry you you're arranging the event you never do that you're thinking it so you never do that either you're planning what to say wanting to get it right you're down on one knee acting like a jerk you're hiding the ring in the desert your face is all of a sudden on the jumbotron in the seventh inning of the twins game i love you you're jumping out of an airplane with a sign that says will you marry me you're doing things you would never do normally why because the stakes are high because the outcome matters. And I'm not real sure how it's going to go. So this time you pull out all the stops just so maybe she can reject you on national TV. There's your fear. There's your fear. So is that going to shut you down or is that going to wake you up? Happens routinely in the athletic arena. Anybody who's ever played sports at a competitive level will tell you there's a kind of fear that shuts you down. You can sometimes see it in your opponent's eyes. I got him. He's afraid. Sometimes you can feel it yourself, and there's another kind of fear that doesn't weaken you. It wakens you. It quickens and energizes you because this time you realize the stakes are high. The outcome matters. It makes a difference. Indeed, it's a kind of fear that realizes that this will require all of my energy and all of my capacities and all of my creativities and all of my attention, eyes wide, nostrils flared, awake, aware, alert. This game counts. It ain't the preseason. It's time to pull out all the stops. Now, with all of that in your mind, hear again the words of Paul in Philippians 2. My beloved Philippians, well, I'm gone and you can't hear me anymore. I want you to work out into your living where people can see this life of God you have. And I want you to practice these things that you've learned with that kind of urgency, with that kind of energy, with that kind of fear, if you will. In fact, I want you to be a little bit afraid of having it all just be words. Second question, why? Why does that matter? Why is it important to treat it like that? Two reasons. I already gave them to you. You want to unpack them a little bit more? Here's why. Because verse 13, it's God who's at work in you both to will and to work. And what that means, among other things, is this. We are not playing church. This is not spiritual patty cake time. Hebrews 10.31 says that it is a frightening thing to fall into the hands of a living God. Of a living God. But if he is not a living God, if he is not real, if he is not alive, if all of this stuff is just a Santa Claus joke at Christmas and a cute little Easter bunny at Easter, then don't give this stuff another thought. If this isn't real, if God isn't living, then don't give this word to work out into our living, the life of God we have. Don't give it any more energy than what it takes to sit in the seat. Right? Now, don't lose any sleep. Don't ever pace the floor in the middle of the night. Don't ever wonder how. Don't ever care. Don't ever serve. Don't ever give. Don't ever agonize in prayer. Don't ever intercede on behalf of a brother or a sister or a church or a people, ever. But if it's true that the God of the universe by his Spirit is a living God, and that living God lives in you and me, Then open your eyes and open your ears and quicken your senses. Awake, aware, alert. You might want to practice these things you've heard and seen and learned. Why? Because it's God. It's the living God who is at work. And you were not playing spiritual patty cake. This ain't the preseason. This game counts. Second reason. You might be a little bit afraid of not doing this is because in the midst of a perverse and crooked generation, we appear as lies. In other words, in a crooked and perverse generation, men and women of faith, who with a sense of urgency are working into their living the life of God they have and are earnestly trying to, by the strength and capacity that the Spirit of God provides to them to put into practice the things they've learned and heard and seen people like that appear as lights. Indeed, people who authentically have that light and that life in them, flowing from them, in the middle of a crooked and perverse generation, as I said a few moments ago, are that generation's only hope. Quick question. Do you think that we live in, is there any evidence for the fact that we live in a crooked and perverse generation? Think? Part of what is interesting to me about that is, yeah, the answer is yes. We'd all say yes. But when I read those words from Paul, there's nothing new. It's always been that way. It's just the way it is. The next question is, what do we do? As people of faith in a crooked and perverse generation, what should we do? Well, there's a number of options. We could yell at it, which is something we're kind of known for. We could stand on street corners and yell at, You are a crooked and perverse generation. You know the drill on that, and it's really helpful. And so insightful, too. I mean, to be able to spot that there's something wrong. Brilliant. Or we could do another thing that many religious people do, have a tendency to do. We could do what the parable that we talked about last week was all about. We could build a gate. We could build a wall to keep the Lazaruses of the world out, like the rich man did in Luke 16 and the Pharisees did and the Essenes did and some of us do as well. Or we could just kind of change the focus. And we could begin to focus on something that we actually could do. Because every one of us can do it. You just start with small things. We could begin to focus on something that actually might help. We could actually begin to practice the things we've learned and heard and seen. Believing that that would produce light. And that that would make a difference. I wonder if we believe that. What if we became the kind of people who practiced the Sermon on the Mount? And this is an interesting thing to bring up because if you're at Open Door, I mean, we spent, I think, about a year in the Sermon on the Mount going through Matthew 5 through 7, about a year hearing. And we were doing. I mean, we were, it was always interactive. But in a parable, in a metaphor, just hearing and hearing and hearing and hearing and hearing, and the vision always has been, and it's yours too and mine as well, well, that we would be a people who were hearing it and doing it. And so when Jesus came and talked to those young guys and sat on the side of the mountain, remember, he didn't talk about religion, he talked about life. Guys, let's talk about lust. And they didn't have any trouble with that, so he moved on. And what if we became the kind of people who were dealing with that kind of stuff honestly and even ruthlessly? And he talked about their anger, and then he talked about love and your neighbor and even loving your enemy and what if we became a kind of people who were who were doing those things? It would make any difference. And you know in some ways if we really were and many of us are and it's our kind of vision for the church and for us being the kind of people who do this kind of thing and are becoming this kind of people but it actually relieves some pressure because I don't feel so much pressure to sell people. I was thinking about this this week and I had a I had a memory this was years ago I just came to open door Bonnie and I had just moved into Brooklyn Park um little house there and kind of getting to know our neighbors and talking to a few and you know that is where you're drawing a couple guys and there's this couple of a few houses down who who one day asked us over for dinner and I was I was thrilled I was going wow that's cool they like us I I just love this and I was really kind of pumped about about going but there was a little bit of a weird thing because they didn't know us that well, and there was a why. You know, I had a question. Well, why? Okay, big deal. Just go and enjoy it. They like you. And we got done with dinner, and we were sitting around with coffee, and it was really nice, and they pulled out the Amway stuff. It was... Jeez. And I remember, I still can reproduce the feeling. I'm trapped. How do I get out of here? If I buy something, will they let me leave? But the other thing that occurred to me, and it's like I'm too adult to have my feelings hurt. They didn't like me. They didn't. They wanted to sell me. And I don't know if that works for you, but sometimes I wonder if we try to do the Jesus thing that way. People smell it. They can smell it. I'm going to be nice to you. I have something to sell you. What if you actually, what if we actually loved them? They might actually buy what you're selling. Don't. What if the focus wasn't closing the deal? What if it was a people who were actually a little bit afraid of not being the real deal? See, here's the thing. people who are working out into their living the actual life of God in them in the midst of a perverse and crooked generation, people like that appear as lights. You have more effect than you even know. Just by being who you are, full of God, you can't repress that light. So husbands, love your wives. And do it with fear and trembling. Be a little bit afraid of not loving your wife well. Why? Because the stakes are high. This ain't the preseason, and this game counts. Wives, love your husbands with fear and trembling. Parents, hang on to your kids with fear. Be a little bit afraid of just letting it slide. Because the stakes are high, the outcome matters. this game counts and quit pretending that you're not addicted and get yourself into that Alcoholics Anonymous group and do it now in fact be a little bit afraid of where the trajectory of your life is going if you don't do it now because the stakes are high for you the outcome matters this game counts and repent there's an old fashioned word and start to practice, start actually doing what you already know, those things that you've learned and heard and seen and start with something simple because the stakes are high, the outcome matters. This game counts. It ain't the preseason. Third question I've already answered, I think, but I want to add just a little piece, kind of nuance, what it means to work out your salvation because in addition to how I've already explained that, it speaks to fulfillment. It speaks to coming to fruit of having full usage of your salvation. As Paul said it this way in Philippians 3 verse 12, I want to lay hold of that which has laid hold of me. What has laid hold of me is God's grace. God sees me, and Paul is saying, I know that God sees me, but I want to seize him. I want to lay hold of and fully experience this life that God seized me with. It speaks to fulfillments. And really grasping, experiencing. Most of you who know me know that I love cars. I've had a love affair with cars since I was a little kid. Really hot cars. A fantasy for me would be to own a car so hot that it would actually be scary to drive. That would be my dream. And I remember, this is true, years ago I was invited. My wife and I, Bonnie and I, went to the house of this guy who collected cars. And they were really hot cars. A big pole barn full of cars. About 15, I think, of them. But what was weird? I'm looking at all these incredible cars. He didn't drive any of them. Ever. He just looked at them. It was like a museum type of thing. And he waxed them. And he read about them. And he kind of read the statistics on what they could do. I remember the last car we looked at, it was the Shelby Cobra. Mustang Shelby Cobra. I mean, amazing car. It was on this platform that just went in a slow circle. So you could stand in one place, and it would just turn around for you, and you could look at the whole thing. And it had 10 miles on it. Because he got it, he drove it to his place, he put another thing in there, he's just like, look at that. And that would drive me crazy. I remember thinking at the time, that would drive me crazy, because after a while, it wouldn't be enough to simply know that this car can go from 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds. I would want to feel that. I would want to drive that car. See, here's the deal. It's just not enough to go to a Bible study and to hear and even to know that God will do exceeding abundance beyond everything you could ask or think because at some point I want to drive the car. I want to experience the power of resurrection I want to enter into the fellowship The sufferings And hang on to God Even when I'm feeling totally lost And know this is a piece of what you suffered Jesus I want to feel that And I want to experience the filling of the spirit I don't want it to be just a Bible study And the gifts of his spirit all of which leads to the fourth question, how does this fulfillment get fulfilled? How does it get worked out? Because verse 13 says it's God who's at work in you, so it's God who does this fulfilling. But verse 12 says just work it out. And it's in the imperative, so you do it. So which is it? Is it God or is it me? I think you know. I think you know it's both because as you and I in small ways at first put our hand to what our heart prompts and what our head knows to be right and good and true something beloved is ignited in the realm of the spirit in the realm of your spirit as God begins to partner with you and me in bringing to fulfillment, this salvation, this life that you have. So work out into your living the life of God you have and do it with fear and trembling. Be a little bit afraid of not doing it. Why? Because we're not playing church. This is a God thing. We're involved. And because in a crooked and perverse generation, people who are doing that are that generation's only hope. Let me close with a benediction. This morning, would you stand with me? It's a benediction that just kind of speaks and says a different way. We've heard it from Jesus. We've heard it from James. We've heard it from Paul. Let's hear it from Peter. He says it this way, 2 Peter 2, verse 2. Grace and peace be multiplied to you. In the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord, seeing that his divine power has granted to us everything we need pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence. For by these he has granted to us his precious and magnificent promises in order that by them you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lusts now. For this very reason, also applying all diligence in your faith, supply also moral excellence. And in your moral excellence, add knowledge. And to your knowledge, self-control. And in your self-control, perseverance. And in your perseverance, godliness. And in your godliness, kindness. And in your brotherly kindness, love. why? why bother? because in a crooked and perverse generation people who bother with stuff like that are that generation's only hope you appear as lights let's pray as we close Father give us the capacity by the power of your spirit to do to act upon the things we've heard and learned and seen. And we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. you
