But a man named Ananias, with his wife, Safaree, sold a piece of property and kept back some of the price for himself with his wife's full knowledge. And bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles' feet. But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this And Peter responded to her, such and such a price. And she said, Yes, that was the price. And then Peter said to her, Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out as well. And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her last. And the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. And the great fear came over the whole church and over all who heard all these things. And at the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders were taking place among the people, and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porticle. But none of them rest dared to associate with them. However, the people held them at high esteem, In all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women were constantly added to their number. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Thanks be to God for that story. Really. Your thanks be to God was a little less energetic than normal. because a great fear came upon the whole church, and everyone who heard of these things was filled with fear, whatever happened to the face of God revealed in Jesus. We've worked so hard to make it clear it's a face of grace and love and mercy. What to do with this story here. Let's pray as we move into this. God, I pray that you would indeed by your Spirit reveal to us the life that's in this story. And the fear that actually can lead to that life so confusing at certain levels, fascinating and life-giving at others, give us hearts to hear, even quicken our minds to think. But Father, by your Spirit, we pray for gifts of your Spirit to literally have the courage to turn things that are dead, even as dead as Ananias and Sapphira to life by your power and our cooperating with your power. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Annie Dillard in her book Teaching a Stone to Talk makes what I think is an interesting, fascinating actually observation in light of the story we're dealing with this morning when she wonders aloud this, why people in churches, she wonders, seem like, this is her quote, brainless tourists on a packaged tour of the absolute, thus raising this question for her, does anyone take any of this seriously at all? Indeed, does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power on Sunday mornings we so casually invoke? Or as I suspect, does no one actually believe any of it, even a word of it? Because churches, she says, in her are like children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to pass the time on a Sunday morning. It's madness, she says, to wear ladies hats to church. We should all be wearing crash helmets. Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares. They should lash us to our pews, for the sleeping God may wake one day and take offense. Well, in Acts chapter 5, the sleeping God seems to be, I don't know, awake, and quite active too in a variety of ways, some of which are quite disturbing. Ananias and Sapphira are dead, which may be why Dillard, in this quote as it continues, concludes in this quote, this is why we actually prefer, she says, the illusion of a safer deity, one with more manageable proportions. Proportions, she says, that in the end demand very little of us, but stir very little in us. but that's not the kind of deity we see in Acts 5 where it says in verse 5 that a great fear came upon them all then again in verse 11 a great fear this great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who had heard of these things prompting many who had heard these things to run, to stay away to keep their distance from this growing group of people fascinating group of people they were. Everyone in Jerusalem would have admitted it. I mean, it was the kind of hottest thing in town at the time, but I don't know about this. Now this group that was beginning to look like a crazy group of people that was meeting at Solomon's portico with ever-increasing numbers till now, and they were all with one accord. They were together, but now, now numbers of them were being scared off. It says in verse 13, because the rest of them dared not, these who were being scared off, dared not to even associate with them. I'm not going anywhere near that Solomon's portico place where they have church, which can't be good news, actually, for this fledgling young group who, though they were growing in numbers at the time, were still quite fragile as a movement. They hadn't rooted themselves in anything that looked like it might last. They weren't established in the community as something that would be here, you know, in a year. It was kind of the flavor of the month, kind of good stuff, but we're not sure. But this thing here is going to hurt attendance, which you just can't let happen if you hope to survive as a church. But it wasn't because they were boring. It wasn't because church was boring that people were leaving, which is often the problem we're trying to solve in our day and age when people start leaving because church, as some of you know, I think all of you know, can be, not always, but can be painfully dull. So we fixed that some years ago by getting hip and cool. Contemporary and fun, I'm all of that, and so is Steve. Even more than me, we're going in the right direction, and all that's fine. But here's the problem with the text. It wasn't because church was boring that people were leaving in Acts chapter 5. It wasn't because church was boring that people were daring not even associate with them. It's because church was dangerous. It was scary. I mean, one false move, you're dead. Ananias and Sapphira, proof of that, laying right there. Well, they dragged him out, though, so we couldn't see him anymore. However, it says, and that however, it was weird in the middle of the week when I was getting into this text, that word, however, just kind of, whoa, got as big as the whole page, because it's like the turning point on which everything turns, and it kind of makes some curiosity rise. However, it says in verse 13, while many were in fact scared off by that Ananias and Sapphira thing, others, unbelievably, were in fact drawn into this community. Indeed, it's the strangest thing because verse 14 says this. While all of this stuff was going on, some people were leaving at the same time, all the more, it says in verse 14. People were believing in the Lord. Multitudes, in fact, of men and women were constantly added to their number. In fact, that's many more as a reference to many more than Pentecost. 3,000 at Pentecost, many more than that. And 5,000 were saved when Peter preached the second sermon, many more than that multitude. It's weird what's going on in this passage, which suddenly on that however thing turns this story and the fear that comes with it from a story that is a disturbing one into a story that continues to be a disturbing one, but it is also now a fascinating one. Because while some were running from this thing, being repelled by this thing, others, incredibly, were running toward this thing, being drawn into this thing all the more, which is, in my mind, a fascinating thing for a number of reasons. Indeed, early in the week when kind of the picture was coming together for me relative to what's going on here, And the fact that people were leaving, and you don't want that as a pastor. I actually started thinking of early days in the ministry, particularly early days when I was in seminary, which was years ago, many a long time ago. In seminary in particular, and this continued in the ministry context as well, but in seminary especially, the hot topic we were always seeming to talk about was church growth. So how do you get your church to grow? And we're all a bunch of young men and women, and we're all ready to do and change the world and change the church. But the big deal was, well, you just wanted your church to grow, because that was obviously a reflection on whether you were an idiot or not in it and stuff like that. So we're always interested in that. So the questions were questions like this. How do we make the message more compelling, more palatable, more popular, more accessible? How do we make people, not everybody was asking this question, but some people were, how do we make people more, you know, comfortable? It's uncomfortable. And we just make them, how do we do that? And we came up with answers to that. And, you know, there's always some smart Alex in the group who would say things like this. I know how we can make churches grow. How about this? Let's ask the Holy Spirit to come. And everybody goes, yes, of course. Everybody wants the Holy Spirit. We want Acts chapter 1 through 4. No, no, no. What if we ask the Holy Spirit to come like the way he did in Acts chapter 5? I'll get a little more serious because what I mean by that is this to ask the Holy Spirit to come the way he did in Acts chapter 5 and create an environment where his presence is so thick and his power is so real that an environment is created where even the slightest bit of I don't know a baloney I'll call it baloney Blowing smoke B.S. Which would be blowing smoke Where the slightest bit of that Fakery Pretense Slipperiness You ever been in a church Have you ever when You felt like someone who was talking You were kind of slippery or shifty What I really mean You ever been in a church like that What if an environment was created Because the presence of the spirit Was so thick And the power was so real That at the first sight of Fakery Pretense Slipperiness Shiftiness lying. We call it spin. What if the presence and power of God among his people was so sick and real that when people even began to think about posing, pretending, posturing, slippery and shifty he just blew it up immediately like on the spot. You know how tell your kids when you go on vacation, I know you all do this. We certainly do this, did this with our children, and now we do it, we pass this tradition on to our grandchildren, because we do it with them as well. When they're in a pool, and you tell them, you know, there's a chemical in this pool that if you, you know, do your stuff, it's going to turn blue. Which is a lie, But it's okay. We'll all know, Caleb, Chris, and all the grandkids. We will know immediately. We'll tell the kids. So don't be pretending it's Chris or Caleb or me. Quit acting all innocent and pointing your finger at everybody else. You're busted immediately because the water turned blue. How embarrassing. Let me ask you a question. This is a weird question. Would you go to a church like that? Where the presence and the power of God was so real and so thick that even the slightest bit of fakery, pretense, posturing and pretending, shiftiness, slipperiness, lying, what we call spin, Got exposed. Pow! Immediately. It turned the water blue. Whoa, it's you. I didn't look at anybody there. Whoa, everybody? It's right there. It got blown up immediately. Are you kidding? And the kidding part of that is this. Are we serious? Are we really talking about this? Because here's the deal. We'd all be dead. We'd all be embarrassed that the water turned blue because of us. Because we all turn the water blue every day. I mean, who doesn't spin it a little bit? I mean, you know, really, me too. Who doesn't fake it? Who doesn't posture and pose, get a little shifty and slippery? Who doesn't, I don't know, lie? And so it is, with the prospect of the water turning blue, you know, a great fear fell over the whole church and upon all who had heard these things, prompting many to run, to get away, to keep their distance from this growing group of people who are beginning more and more to look like a growing group of crazy people who, according to verse 12, had begun to gather at Solomon's portico in ever-increasing numbers, but now they were being scared off such that none of them who were being scared off, it says in verse 13, dared even to associate with them. I'm not going anywhere near that place. But it was just the strangest thing because the very same fear that was driving some people off was drawing other people in, Indeed, all the more. Verse 14. We're believing in the Lord multitudes, in fact, of men and women who are constantly being added to their number, and it kind of makes you wonder why. And it kind of makes you wonder what. Seriously, what is it that they saw, that they sensed? What is it that those who were drawn to this actually feared? That drove some of them away, that drew some of them in, because they were all looking at the same thing. Ananias and Sapphira, dead. But while some looked at that and could see nothing but death and fear, generating fear, Others looked at that and somehow, I don't know, weird, saw life generating not fear, but hope. Hope that maybe, I don't know, just maybe, there actually is a community of people, like, oh, maybe like a family or a church, like the one that's meeting strange people at the portico of Solomon or even a marriage that there maybe even is a marriage where the people in the marriage, family, church, tell, you know, the truth. And if they don't tell the truth, the water turns blue and everybody's okay with that because when it turns blue, they'll go, yeah, that was me. Yeah, that was me. Yeah, and then there's grace, and everybody feels safe because they know. No hiding or deceiving, no posing or pretending, no shifting of the feet, no pointing of the finger. Not me, it's over there. No winking of the eye, no wondering what they really mean. There's something underneath that. Well, with all of that spinning in your head, come back with me now to the text. But not just to Ananias and Sapphira and that story. I want to invite you back into the whole story that we've been in, in the book of Acts, because it creates context for the story that is in Acts chapter 5, because it all began, as all of you know, if you've been with us since the beginning of Acts, in Acts chapter 2, is where it began, when the clothing with power that Jesus referred to It was the promise of the Father had arrived in the form of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, it was a baptism of the Holy Spirit, an immersion into the fullness of the Spirit, so that now, under the influence of the Spirit, being filled with the Spirit, ordinary people like you and like me and like Peter and like John began to experience the manifestations of the Spirit, the gifts of the Spirit, Gifts like healing and tongues in Acts chapter 2 and Acts chapter 3, prophetic utterance as well. There was power to preach in ways that pierced the hearts of the men and women who were listening. Because with great power, it says in Acts 4.33, look at it on the screen. I love this verse. With great power, the apostles were giving witness to the resurrection of the Lord and abundant grace. Abundant grace was upon them all. So this is one happening place to be. And lots of people were getting on board, especially at the beginning of this story. Indeed, it says in verse 32 of chapter 4 that the whole congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were in common to them. such that there was not a needy person among them, which is, in fact, another. Please get this. That generosity, no one having need, is another supernatural manifestation of the Holy Spirit. It's another result, if you will, of being filled with the Spirit under the influence of the Spirit, this generous Spirit. You know, we talk about, I don't know if you've been in environments like this to talk about filling of the Spirit, the baptism of the Spirit. Are you a Spirit-filled Christian? Have you received the baptism? That kind of stuff. And a lot of times it's like, what are the signs of that? Well, that's a good question. What are the signs? And often the signs we identify, our tongues, and maybe being slain in the Spirit. And I think those are all legitimate signs of baptism and immersion into and things like that. Hardly ever do I hear about people talking about one of the primary manifestations that you have been immersed into. The Holy Spirit is a freedom with your stuff. I love that. Spirit of generosity. And this generous spirit was embodied in this guy that Steve Weans introduced us to a couple weeks ago, named Joseph. Verse 36 of chapter 4. Joseph, verse 36. Look at it on the screen. A Levite of Cyprian birth, whose nickname was Barnabas, affectionately known as the son of encouragement, who according to verse 37 owned a tract of land and sold it. Didn't have to, just did. This spirit of generosity came on him, born of the Holy Spirit, and then he brought all the money. Didn't have to do that either, but he brought all the money and he laid it at the apostles' feet. It was, get this, important, a spirit-born act of generosity. It was a manifestation of the Spirit, of the filling of the Spirit, every bit as much as the apostolic preaching of Peter, the healing of the lame man by the gate of the temple, as any prophetic utterance or word of knowledge or word of wisdom was this Spirit-born generosity. And into all of that, that's the context, and it's important. Into all of that, enter now, Acts 5, verse 1, Ananias and Sapphira, who also had a nickname. You didn't probably know. It's not widely known. In fact, it's not known at all, because I gave it to them this week as I was studying. Joseph, who was called Barnabas, affectionately known as the son of encouragement, Ananias and Sapphira, affectionately known, maybe not so affectionately known as Dumb and Dumber. That's what I think about this, because they didn't have to sell their property to begin with, and they didn't have to give all the proceeds. Once they had sold the property, they could have given some. They could have given none. As Peter, by the way, makes abundantly clear in the text we just read in verse 4 when Peter says essentially this, and this is my paraphrase of what he said in verse 4, when it was yours, it was yours. To do with what you wanted. And when you sold it, it was still yours to do with what you wanted. So why did you start playing this game? And what filled your heart to do it? Remember he asked that question? What's filled your heart a couple times? That comes in the context of other people who are being filled with the Holy Spirit. They were still under the influence of the Holy Spirit. What are you under the influence of right now? What are you full of? I don't get this. It doesn't fit the picture of everything else that's going on right now among us. Because I'm pretty sure it's not the Holy Spirit that you're full of. Right now, you're full of something else. Because the problem that they had, the trouble they were in, it was not at all about how much they gave. Which is a fascinating thing, even in the context of our life together, because it's conceivable. We don't know. There was no value on what they gave. Even though they held some back, they might have given a lot. Maybe they gave more than Barnabas. I don't know. Their problem wasn't that the amount they gave. And it wasn't about not giving at all. They were in trouble because they didn't give at all like Barnabas gave at all. Their problem was they pretended that they did give it all. They were pretenders. They were posers. They were polishing, as it were, the outside of the cup and of the bowl in order to, hoping to, appear to be something that they weren't. because they weren't generous. They just wanted to appear generous. Oh my, this is getting close to home now. Like so many people who go to church who want to appear to be loving. They aren't loving, it's like looking like it. They wanted to appear holy. They wanted to look righteous and caring and good, so they held some back. It says in verse 2, which means, among other things, in the holding back and saying that they didn't, they were hiding and denying and pretending. So they shifted their feet and they winked the eye. They pointed the finger. That's in the Proverbs. It talks about people who point the finger, and it's all about misdirection. And we do this. It's over there. Look over there. Yeah, everybody. They spun it. They faked it. They lied. Now, if you've ever been around anybody like that, just use your imagination. Go wild. Think real deep. If you've ever been around anybody who's like that slippery and shifty and shady. James actually speaks of people who in James 1 verse 7 create shifting shadows. Fascinating picture of a shifting shadow because you're looking at it and you go, oh, and then it moves. Oh, you're not sure. You're never sure what you're dealing with, who that is. It's a shifting shadow. If you've ever been around people like that, then you know that the dynamic there is more than irritating. It's dangerous. because you never know. That's what makes it dangerous. You're never sure that what they're saying is what they mean. Do they love me? They say they do. Do they care? They say they do. But I don't know. I don't know. How can you tell? It's pretty scary. So this is not just irritating. This is dangerous because it's dangerous. It's scary to be, I don't know, married to someone like that. And some of you are. I'm sad to say you're married to someone like that. You never, no, you're not quite sure. It's scary to have a friend like that, to have a boss. Some of you have a boss. I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't know what he thinks she thinks to have an employee like that. I just don't know if I trust her, him. Have a pastor like that would not be good. Run, I mean it, for your life. But in Acts chapter 5, that kind of song and dance, slipperiness, isn't just irritating. It isn't just damaging. It's deadly. In Acts chapter 5, verse 5 and verse 10, they breathed their last, stirring up a great fear in the whole church And upon all who had heard of these things, prompting many to run, to stay away, to keep their distance from this crazy group of people, had begun to gather at Solomon's portico such that none of them who were being scared off by this dared even to associate with them. I ain't going anywhere near that place. So it's just the strangest thing when this very same fear that drove many people away, drew many others in, indeed, all the more people were believing in the Lord. Verse 14, multitudes of men and women were constantly being added to their number. and what they were drawn to was among other things this, I think, a community of people who were afraid. They were drawn to a community of people who actually had some fear, but not of God, because what they feared, and this was the draw, what they feared was ever becoming the kind of people who actually could pretend and could hide and deny and point the finger and posture, who actually could learn to polish the outside without ever doing the inside. They feared that because they knew that every time you do the hiding thing and in the doing of it, think you're getting away with it, you don't get away with it. Because every time you do, even if you don't physically fall down and die something dies in you. Just as sure as Ananias and Sapphira died something inside you and me as you learn to get slippery and then you get better at being slippery something inside begins to die and as we do not only die on the inside but get slipperier and slipperier and shiftier and shiftier something more begins to die like character you're still walking around alive but inside there's this erosion of integrity and transparency and authenticity and when that dies took a while didn't turn the water blue right away Wish it had. Because when that dies, people's ability to trust us dies. And when that dies, relationships die and marriages explode and families split and churches blow up. They breathe their last. So be afraid. Not kidding. Be very afraid. afraid of getting good at this, hiding, denying, pretending, because you probably won't die like Ananias and Sapphira did. It'll be worse. You'll probably physically live, but inside you will die, kind of end up a spiritual zombie. You're moving, you're breathing, No life. Be afraid. Jeremiah 5 tells a fascinating story. Frightening, I think, as well. It illustrates all of this, where God is looking for someone in Israel at the time. According to verse 1 in Jeremiah 5, does justice and seeks truth. Just one. I just need to find one person who does justice, seeks truth. And if you can find this one person, then we'll pardon Israel and pardon Jerusalem. But all Jeremiah could find was verse 2. When he was looking around, all he could find was people. Look at verse 2. Who although they say, as the Lord lives, in other words, I swear to God, which by the way is another way to lie. This is really good. This works in church. They're all walking around going, as the Lord lives. Now, there was some interesting study there, but just kind of consider that what we often experience from religious people. Religious talk, as the Lord lives, God is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All this religious God talk, which is another way to hide. Because if I have the right language, you kind of believe I'm the real thing on the inside, too. So here's the problem with these people. They walk around using all sorts of God talk, as the Lord lives, but they, in fact, swear falsely. They lie. They're full of something else, not God. So Jeremiah, almost in despair, says this in verse 3. This is my paraphrase of verse 3. I don't know how to find that kind of person because, though, look at verse 3, though you've smitten them, they have not weakened. So they've had some consequences for their baloney. People have called them on it. Though you've consumed them, they haven't taken correction. In other words, again, they've experienced some consequences for this pretense life they have. It's cost them, but it didn't matter that it cost them. They didn't stop lying, pretending, hiding, denying. They haven't taken correction. Indeed, and at the end of this verse is the point of this whole thing, their faces have become harder than rock. which paints a fascinating picture but a frightening one as well of someone whose face you can no longer read because it's harder than a rock. They become good at pretending and hiding and denying and calling what they said a different thing and calling what they did a different thing which speaks to skill. They became good at this, which is something that people who want to hide are glad about, but the truth is if you get good at this, it's a very scary thing. You want some fear? Be afraid of that. Particularly scary for the people you live with. Again, just imagine being married to someone who has gotten good at this. whose face is harder than rock, or being in business with someone, or having a friend, or having one of your kids whose face is harder than rock. I used to be able to read him or her. I know when they were lying, and it was good. They didn't like being caught, but now I can't tell. That's a scary thing. Because you have a face like rock means no one, again, can read you. You don't blush anymore when you're doing the baloney thing. You don't blink. You don't look away. You know how you say, look me in the eye. We say, look me in the eye. Because we're pretty sure that if you look me in the eye, you know, window to the soul stuff. Well, this person who's gotten good at it, you could look him in the eye and they'd lie to your face. And you wouldn't know, which is frightening, for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it makes a relationship of any kind impossible. Because eventually, if you're the one who's gotten good at this, let me just tell you something. No one, no one will trust you. So marriages die. Families explode. Relationships crumble. Jobs are lost. and something in your soul dies. Because while you might like the fact that you developed a face like rock so you could get away with all your song and dance, whatever, to actually have a face like rock means you're dead. Because rock has no life. Ananias and Sapphira were dead. It was a horrible story. Oh, guys. Lucky them. They just physically died. There's different ways to die that are worse, and we experience it, I don't know, every day. So be afraid. So weird. In all my years, I don't know if I ever gave a sermon that was like, here's the word. Be afraid. I would like to have fear released among myself. Be afraid of getting good at this. So much so that your face is like rock and you can't even tell anymore. Your face becomes like rock so you can't even tell anymore that you're hiding because you've done it so long you don't even know you're doing it anymore. Be afraid of getting so good at this that your face becomes like rock so you can't even tell that you're denying and posturing and pointing, that you're slippery and scary. So in Acts chapter 5, it says, A great fear came upon the whole church, and all who had heard of these things, it was in fact a very good thing. It was in fact a God thing. It was in fact a manifestation of the Spirit thing, designed in the end not to bring death, but life. Because it was just the strangest thing. But the very same fear that was driving some people off was drawing other people near, people who had tasted the Spirit and now had begun to dream about a community of people, maybe even a family. or a church or a marriage where the people in it would tell the truth even if it was ugly. No hiding, no denying, no poisoning or pretending, no shifting of the feet, no pointing of the fingers because in an environment like that people don't die like Ananias and Sapphira. They come to life. and so we pray. Yeah, right here, right now. Holy Spirit, come. Give to us the courage to tell the truth about what we're hiding and denying. Don't even know we're hiding and denying and the reason we need courage is because if we've been hiding, bringing out into the light what we've been hiding in the dark, it feels like you're going to die. If I say that, I will die, but you won't, you'll come to life. So we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Give us the courage to quit denying and quit hiding and quit pointing and posing. for the kind of power we pray that can make a stone face come to life. Would you stand with me as we close? It's almost all one color now, but I got to keep, I would have to go. I think I'm going to go. Whoa, the last time you're going to see this shirt. Wow. Yeah. Hey, let's pray, okay? Father, I'm so grateful. My heart is so full. I just... Thank you for the story. Thank you that I'm around a lot of people who have this kind of godly fear that just says we can't do this. We cannot pretend. I don't care how ugly it is. And we've seen so many times your grace come, your mercy, your life come to that. May that courage, born of your spirit, to quit hiding and denying, pretending ever grow among us so that life may grow and eternal life may come to our families and our church and our churches. And all God's people said, you
