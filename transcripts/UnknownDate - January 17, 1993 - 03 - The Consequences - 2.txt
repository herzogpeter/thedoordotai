The basis of our study the last several weeks has been Acts chapter 15, verse 20. The focus of our study this morning is going to be 1 Corinthians chapter 6, verses 15 to 20. I think you're aware of the fact that over these last weeks, in the course of going through the book of Acts as we have been doing, we came to chapter 15, landed on verse 20, and heard a word delivered at the conclusion of the Jerusalem Council where the Apostle James instructed the Gentile believers in Adioch, Syria to abstain from, among other things, fornication. The Greek word porneia. Now we have been broadly defining porneia as sexual relations between a man and a woman outside the context of marriage, including, but not limited to, premarital and extramarital sex. The Greek word porneia has as its root porne, which means literally harlot for hire. The male version of that term is pornos, which means a male harlot for hire. But the Greeks took that concept of porneia and rounded it out, if you will, to kind of apply to every vice, including adultery, incest, rape, sodomy, bestiality, and all forms of promiscuity. But these same Greeks also were among those who considered sexuality and the physical expression of sexuality as being nothing more than a biological urge, a physical function, a genital physical expression, no different than eating, no different than sleeping or exercise. All it involves is physical expression, skin to skin. Last week, I called that a lie. Not only did I call that a lie, I called it a demonically empowered lie that all our sexuality involves is physical expression. It is a lie that in my opinion, as I indicated last week, has behind it the help of hell. It is a lie that I have identified as a stronghold in the spirit realm, fitting into the category of principalities and powers and spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Those things, I believe, are behind that lie. It is a lie that cannot be broken with a sermon about it. All a sermon can do is expose that it is a lie. Say that it is a lie. It requires the empowerment of the Spirit of God to break the power of the lie in our lives. Though we do walk according to the flesh, we do not do our warfare according to the flesh. but they are divinely powerful through the bringing down of strongholds. Strongholds are brought down by divine power. Last week as we went into confronting this lie, I indicated that I wanted people to pray because the power of this lie and the way it has defiled and destroyed many of us needs to be brought down by the power of the Spirit, and many of you did pray. But where we began last week in dealing with this lie was to try to, in its face, throw some truth. And the truth I brought last week was basically this, that our sexuality in its expression is indeed physical, biological, and genital. But what we need to know is this, that our sexuality in its essence, at its core, is spiritual. What that means is this. when I engage my sexuality through physical expression, more is involved than physical entities. More is being touched than skin to skin. That somewhere along the line, in the context of physical sexuality, something also in my spirit is being activated, something in my soul is being touched, something at the very core of my humanity is involved. And if I am right about that, just maybe that helps us get a glimpse of and begin to understand the depths of the pain of porneia and understand why the consequences for porneia are so high. For if it is more than a biological thing, a physical expression, but has spiritual implications, then it helps me understand a little bit why rape, incest, adultery is harder to recover from than just getting shot with a gun. Because something beyond the physical has been touched in our sexual expressions. Lie number one last week, all our sexuality involves is physical expression. Lie number two this week is this. That my sexuality involves nobody but me. That what I do with my sexuality, that where I go with it and how I express it has no effect on anybody but me. That is a lie. But we have been affected by that lie and we have come to believe, blindly I'm afraid, that we live in a vacuum. That we are islands unto ourselves, free to do as we will. It's really nobody's business but my own. It is my body. It is my choice. I will do what I want. And if there are consequences to be experienced for my pornea, then I will experience them. It's really nobody's business but mine. Clearly, that is American doctrine. The secular prophets of our day preach a message that honors the virtue and the value of individualism. It is individualism. It is the man or woman by himself who rises to the top that we adore. It's the American thing. And with that comes some good stuff. But we also need to know that with that message has come profound isolation, separation, and inability in many ways to see a sense of community, a sense of interconnectedness in a secular sense, and that same spirit has invaded the church. We talk about being a body. It's a wonderful theological concept, but the reality of being interconnected is lost on most of us. What I do, where I go, how I express is my business. It doesn't affect anybody but me. And I suppose if our sexuality was only a physical expression, a biological thing, that may be true. But it is not. Here, 1 Corinthians 6, verse 15, move into the teeth of, it doesn't affect anybody but me. Do you not know, says the Apostle Paul, have you forgotten that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I, shall we, then take away the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot, engage them in porneia? Because that is what you're doing. May it never be. Or don't you know that the one who joins himself to a harlot is one body with her? For he says the two will become one flesh, but the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with him. Flee immorality. Same Greek word, pornea. Why? Well, every other sin that a man or woman commits is outside the body, but the immoral man or woman sins against his or her own body. Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body. Last week, I used that text to illustrate that sexuality is more than a physical expression. It is a spiritual union. That's clearly seen in those verses. This week, I want to use the same text to illustrate that because it is a spiritual union, there are therefore spiritual and relational consequences that do indeed go beyond me. That in fact, I do not live in a vacuum, and neither do you. That in fact, I am not an island unto myself, and neither are you. And that my pornea, and that your pornea, does touch people besides me. And this text reveals three ways in which that is true. Number one, my pornea, your pornea, involves the body of Christ. We are connected. Number two, my pornea, your pornea, injures the body of marriage. And number three, my pornea, your pornea, incapacitates the body for ministry. Let's look at first this. Pornea involves the body of Christ. And look closely and see something that I had never seen before I exegeted this. Do you not know that your body... Stop right there. The word body is there, importantly, is in the plural. It is not your singular body. Your body's, plural, collectively, corporately, Our members, plural word again, our members corporately, collectively, of Christ, singular. Picture here, your bodies are members of Christ. The body of Christ. Shall then I take away the members, plural, of Christ, singular, and make them, plural, members, plural, of a harlot. Or engage in porneia, bringing the whole body with. The most simple way I can say this is this. Those of us who are in Christ are by virtue of that union with Christ, which verse 17 speaks of, one's spirit with Christ, are by virtue of that relationship made part of the body of Christ. By the way, I need to stop right here. Little, little nuance. I'm aware of the fact that in this series I've been doing on fornication and abstain from such behavior, many of the things that I have been saying would apply to people as it relates to consequences, whether they are redeemed or not. Some of what I'm going to talk about today will apply to people redeemed or not, consequences paid. But as we are dealing with 1 Corinthians 6 today, I want to let it enter your mind and spirit that these are consequences that specifically come into the household of the redeemed. Indeed, the consequences for porneia, for us who are redeemed, is higher even than for others. Because of our union with Christ, therefore, we are united with one another as well. Now, you may be a hand in the body of Christ, or the foot, or the eye, or the mouth, or some inner organ that nobody sees, and you may be going to, who am I, to try to figure out what part of the body you are, and that's a good thing to do. Whatever it is that you are, wherever it is that you fit, the fact is this, you are part of the body of Christ. And what that means is this, if I, if you, as part of the body, would join yourself to engage yourself in porneia, in some sense, horrifying truth, I have brought you into it, you have brought me into it. Verse 15, Shall I take away the members of Christ? You have taken away the members of Christ and brought them into it. I thought I was alone. It was just me and him or me and her. No, you weren't alone. By virtue of your union with Christ, interacted. connectedness with the body, you brought the body in. I cannot disconnect myself from that reality. We are interrelated. I cannot, in the body of Christ, any more than I can with my physical body, take my mouth off, let it do its thing over there. It is connected. It is here. Therefore, what goes on with my mouth, even though my foot's just sitting there, it is affected. It is connected. My foot is over here, it's doing a little thing. All my hand is sitting there doing nothing. If my foot decides to go there, somewhere along the line, there is a connectedness between us. It all affects everything else. I might not understand that. I might not like that. I might not, even having heard it, acknowledge it. I think it's a bunch of baloney. None of that changes the fact that according to the Word of God, We are an interconnected by the Spirit of God people. Therefore, what I do in my body involves you. What you do in your body involves me. By the way, this little sword here has a two-edged reality to it. if I would engage in pornea, this text clearly reveals I'm bringing the body with me. If you do it, you're bringing me with you. The other edge of that sword is this. If pornea is perpetrated against me, I am therefore a victim of pornea, rape, incest, sexual abuse. If we are as interconnected as I believe we are, this text is revealing, then applied to that as well is this truth that not only are you being abused and you being defiled, but as you're connected with the body, we have been defiled, we have been abused. You are not alone. Question. How do you respond to this? How do you feel about all this? Well, I don't know for sure. I could never presume to know how people are responding. But I would expect that there would be some energy, at least on the front end, to push this away. But if you begin to let it in, if you begin to let yourself consider the possibility that it really is true that if you've moved into porneia, you brought the body with you, What do you feel? Well, I'm pretty sure that some, if they would begin to feel the enormity of this, would, in light of that, feel despair. Absolutely overwhelmed. Dave, I really did have a sense that the porneia I entered into was a big thing, and what you're saying now makes it feel bigger than ever. And I'm overwhelmed by it. And it's crushing me. In fact, the truth is I would run for the door right now if I could. In fact, if this is true, David, that my pornea has brought the whole body into the pornea, maybe this body would be better off without me. I'm not trying to be a smart aleck. That's really how I feel. I need to get out of here if that is true. And maybe even if you're a victim of pornea and you have been defiled by it, it could be your reaction is the same. You feel so much shame for what happened to you when you were 5 or 25. Even though you were a victim, if you are getting in touch with this connectedness, you're going, oh man, if I am bringing to this whole body the stuff I feel inside me, it would be better for this body if I wasn't even here. One response to this word would for people to be running for the door. Another response, I believe that would be looking on the surface like a safe place to go would be denial. Oh, Dave, you're making this whole thing way bigger than it really is. Back off, settle down. It's not that big a deal. Others wouldn't be able to do denial. They would indeed embrace that porneia involves the whole body. And so rather than even running for the door, you would just sit in silence. And what I'm going to do with this truth, Dave, is go back in the proverbial closet and just be quiet because if I am bringing this kind of stuff to the body, I don't want anybody to know, and I will never, ever say out loud what's really going on in my life relative to porneia, either the pain that has come to me or the pain that I've given away. I'm never going to say it out loud. And in that silence and in that denial, Satan just begins, doesn't begin, continues to have His way in defiling us and wounding us and keeping us in chains. Blessed are those who mourn and begin to get out here, what's really going on in here. But words like this make us want to run and shrink back. Some might hear this word and quite frankly get angry. And maybe you're thinking, well, who would get angry at a word like this, that we're all interconnected? The anger I'm talking about is the anger of the spouse. The anger of the husband who has been faithful and finds out now that his wife has been unfaithful. She moved into porneia and I didn't do a thing, but because you moved into it, I have been brought with. It's the anger of the wife who has been faithful and true, given her heart and hold to her husband. And her husband has not been faithful and he has found himself in porneia with someone else. And I am being affected, pulled right into it because of you. There's an anger that comes. It is the anger of the spouse. It is the anger of the children who have been brought into it, who didn't do anything. They were brought into it. Because what we do has effect on other people. It is the anger of the church that gets pulled into the body of Christ, that gets pulled into its members pornea. It's the anger of the family who wants to know, why did you drag me into this? I didn't do anything. I kept myself pure. But what you have done has pulled me in and I am affected. So anger is sometimes a response to this kind of interconnected truth. You know what? I think there is a time as it relates to pornea, the way it has wounded people, the way we have been affected by it in ways that we didn't do, but because we're part of the body we got dragged into it, ways in which it has wounded people through things like incest and rape and spiritual sexual abuse. There is a time about those things to be angry. There is also, I think, a time about those things to feel a measure of despair. I'm not sure despair is the right word, but I'm going to let it stand. What I mean by it is this. There is a time for us to feel the full weight of what it is we have done. There is a time for that. And there is something appropriate about allowing people to feel the pain of their pornea that they've moved into, and yes, you did pull me into. And if I did it, I would have pulled you in. And I've got to feel that somewhere. I hope somebody's hanging on to me when I do, but I've got to feel that. Because we are interconnected, and I can't just blow that off. But my question is this, is there ever a time, is there ever, ever, ever a time when we get past the anger and we get past the despair? Is there ever, ever a time when we, even as God's people, begin to weep and we begin to mourn? Is there ever a time when we just begin to repent and forgive and heal and reclaim and restore. And that part of this call to God in mourning and repentance and calling on Him to come and reclaim and heal us is this awareness of our interconnectedness. And here is how it would sound. God, it is finally beginning to dawn on me. It is finally beginning to dawn on us that as it relates to porneia, it is not just Him and Him and her and her, but because of Him and Him, we have been dragged in. What that means is it is not just His and His, it's ours. It's mine. And that young woman and that young man who have, when they were five, been defiled sexually, it's not just Him. We see them come forward. Sometimes we hear about the letters they write and the help they get here at this church. But somewhere along the line, our interconnectedness has got to kick in on this issue. of porneia both in perpetration and in victimization and realize that it is not just him and him and her and her. It's us. It's ours. And we, as a body, begin to feel not only the pain of porneia that we've been dragged into, but begin to feel the glory of mourning together as we move out into healing. Is there ever a time when we, in the spirit of Joel 2, verse 15 and following, blow a trumpet in Zion is there ever a time when we stand before the people and say it is time to consecrate a fast to proclaim a solemn assembly it is time now to gather the people it is time now to sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders let the priests and the Lord's ministers weep between the porch and the altar and as we come together the reason we're coming together is that it's finally dawned on us as it relates to Porne, it's not just him and him and her and her. It's us. It's not just his and his and hers and hers. It's ours. So we come to God. And when we come, we say, let the Lord spare His people. Lord, heal your people. Reclaim, restore, renew us. God, it is we who mourn. It is we who repent. Give us back, dear God, what we have lost. that give us back what has been taken away and give us back, Father, what some of us have given away. It says at the end of that passage, Joel 2, verse 19, when God's people come to Him like that, corporately come to Him like that, then the Lord will be zealous for His land, will have pity on His people, and the Lord will answer and say to His people, I am going to send you grain, new wine and oil, And you will be satisfied in full with them. The issue I'm driving home, in addition to the pain of porneia, is the interconnectedness we have as a body, both in that pain of perpetration, victimization, but also a corporate reality, which is a new thing for most of us, of moving out of that pain into healing and repentance. Corporate mourning, corporate healing, corporate repentance. Odd concept for most of us. I was talking to Jeff this last week. We were kind of wondering aloud about this whole concept. One of the things we threw out was this. Boy, I wonder if this interconnectedness really is the issue. That's the overarching principle of all of these things. And because of interconnectedness, when some of our people, some of the members of our body move into porneia, we are dragged into it. I wonder if it works the other way too. I wonder if ten who committed adultery, let's say, moved into porneia, have affected us. If ten move the other way into repentance, if the repentance brings the body out. Weird concept. Corporate repentance. You know, the Old Testament, the people in the Old Testament had a much better concept of this than most of us do. We understand things of the body of Christ and try to grapple with that. But in experience, Israel knew these things. Corporately they celebrated. Corporately they worshipped. Corporately they mourned. Corporately they repented. We have stories of Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Moses, Jeremiah, who never did the deed of the sins that they found themselves repenting for. Why did they repent for sins they never committed? Because they saw themselves as interconnected with the people, and the people's sin was theirs. And they mourned over it. It was not censorious looking down their nose. They bore it. Because we're connected. Weird, weird talk here. Well, just let it percolate for a bit. Let me go to point number two. This pornea not only involves the body of Christ, it injures the body of marriage. Verse 18, flee immorality. Pornea, good advice. Here's why, at least one reason why. Because every other sin a man commits or a woman commits is outside the body. The immoral man sins against his own body. Now there's a couple of possibilities as to what this verse is referring to, and I think they're both right. The first is this, that this verse is really a parallel to Romans 1.27. When it says, speaking of those who exchange the truth of God for a lie, therefore God gave them over degrading passions, it says this, of them that they will receive in their own persons the due penalty of their error. Pornea is in some sense a self-inflicted wound. Now some of the ways that we will receive in our body the due penalty of our error are obvious. We went over these things in some detail last week. Disease would be one clear way that would manifest itself. I think guilt is another manifestation of receiving in your body. It's a sin against you. You wounded yourself. Another ironic thing, as I put it in juxtaposition to guilt, is when you feel no guilt at all. What do you mean by that? There comes a point when having been given over to a depraved mind, there is no sense of sin whatsoever anymore. And people like that fall into the category of verse 32 of Romans 1, who not only practice porneia, but give hearty approval to those who do. They are literally recruiting people to enter into their behavior and feel no consequence whatsoever in terms of conscience. That's their consequence. But I think there's a deeper meaning as well. When it speaks of sinning against your own body, I'm affected by verse 16 which says, Hearkening to creation, the two will become one flesh. Speaking of a man and a woman coming together, illustrating that the nature of our sexuality is more than a physical expression, it's a spiritual union. The two become one flesh. Ephesians 5.28 says, Husbands, men, love your wives as your own body. The next verse helps me understand what he meant by as your own body. For this cause, the next verse says, man shall leave his father and mother, cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. What it means for a man to love his wife as his own body is simply this, to recognize that the body you are loving is not just your body, but it is the one flesh relationship between you and your wife. And if you move into porneia, you have brought your wife with you because you are one flesh with her. Wives, if you move into porneia, you have brought your husband. You can't disconnect that one either. abstain from fornication why? last week we heard because it's more than a physical expression it's a spiritual union this week we're hearing because porneia is never done in isolation if I'm a believer, I bring the body in with me, and the body is affected, and if I'm married, I bring my one flesh mate with me, wouldn't it be great if we really all were just little islands unto ourselves? Wouldn't it be great if it just didn't matter? But it does. So what do we do? well we can go out on witch hunt we can find all the fornicators line them up and shoot them you know we could publicly humiliate them we could physically remove them and in the shooting the humiliation and the removal we will then be made pure another option in terms of we could sink into despair we could look at this issue of porneia and not allow ourselves to diminish the impact and the fact that when some do, we all are. When some have been wounded, we all are. Let that in. We're going to get overwhelmed. And some of us, in getting the picture of how deep even the church has been affected by this, will say this, we have gone too far. It is just too much. It's happened too often. We literally are beyond healing. We could easily slip into despair with a word like this. Or we could kick into denial and just say, Dave, you know, you rant and rave. You're making much too big a thing of this. Or somewhere along the line, maybe what we could say is this, Oh God, dear Jesus, it is a big deal. It really is a big deal. This issue of porneia is big. And one of the reasons it is big is because we are connected. But God, on this Sunday, we're going to respond a little differently than maybe we have even in the past. This issue of connectedness means this. That it's not just His sin, and it's not just her sin. It's our sin. And it's my sin, and I have been affected. And God, somewhere along the line, we need to understand that we all together, because we are a body, we have all been affected by this. We, God, need healing in this. We need reclaiming in this. We need restoring and renewing. God, maybe it is time in ways we don't even understand to blow the trumpet in Zion. Maybe it's time to consecrate a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly. Maybe it's time to gather the people, sanctify the congregation, call the elders. And as we come this time, we're going to know the reason we're coming is because it isn't just his and his and hers and hers, it's ours. And we want to come to you and mourn. We just want to mourn, first of all. We just want to feel the weight of what has happened to our body, not just the body that opened door. I hope you get a picture of this body business as the body, the body of Christ. let us say as we come dear God spare your people hear them reclaim restore renew we mourn we repent give us back what we have lost give us back what has been taken from us that is supplying to rape and incest and sexual abuse what has been ripped from us give us back but also God would you give us back what we have given away for free. We just gave some stuff away. We gave it away. The Lord will hear his people. Corporate? Corporate? Weird thought. Think on it some more as I go to the last one. What porneia does is it incapacitates, among other things, the body for ministry. Verse 19, don't you know your body is a temple. Stop right there. I think many of you have heard this and know that it is true that your body physically or individually is a temple. God lives, Jesus lives in you if you're redeemed. The thing you need to understand though here is the word body here again, consistent with this interconnectedness theme of Paul in 1 Corinthians 6, is a plural. So what it means is this, your body corporately your body is the temple of god keep that in mind as i just give you two things of import associated with the temple to a jewish way of thinking but quite frankly even to a pagan in aniac syria coming out of the pagan temple they would have certain things associated with the temple the number one thing would be the that is the dwelling place of the deity if it was a pagan god that's where the pagan would go to worship their pagan god thinking their pagan god was there. If you were of the land of Israel, worshiping Jehovah God, you go to the temple, that is where the presence of God is. That is where the Shekinah glory of God is. The presence of God dwells there. We now, the body of Christ, we are now the temple of God. One of the wonderful things we experience week after week is this, because we know that now the temple is not made with brick and mortar, not made with hands, but we are the temple, the wonder is that we can meet in this ratty old gym, knowing that the temple is not this, it's this. And in this, there is the dwelling place of God. And as we come together and worship, there is in this the Shekinah glory of God. So one thing associated with the temple would be the presence. The second would be the activity or the work of God, the ministry of the Holy Spirit. Where would you expect that? In the temple. and where we expect the ministry of the Spirit is in the temple it is in the context of the community of the redeemed where we experience together corporately the work of the Holy Spirit moving and healing and convicting and advancing His kingdom but even in the Old Testament when the temple was defiled two things happened at least Number one, the glory of God was diminished. The second thing was the work of God was hindered. In light of that, I will say this. To the degree that porneia has invaded our body, the body of Christ, to the degree that we have wounded people here, wounded by porneia, assaulting them, To the degree that we have had perpetrators perpetrating this, to that degree the glory is diminished, to that degree the work has been hindered. Boy, if that is true, what do we do about that? Well, we could go on a witch hunt. We could find all the fornicators, line them up and shoot them, publicly humiliate them, physically remove them. Or we could, and some would, again, if we see how big this is, sink into despair. We have gone too far. This involves too many. It's just too big. Or we could maybe stir up a lot of false, try-hard stuff. Those who haven't, we won't. Those who have, don't anymore, or we'll get rid of you. Okay. But how about this as a response? Blow a trumpet in Zion. Time to consecrate a fast. Time to recognize it is not just him and him and her and her. It's us. It's not just his and his and hers and hers. It's ours. So gather the people. Assemble the elders. Weep between the porch and the altar. And let them say as they come, spare thy people, heal the land. Give us back what we have lost. Give us back what has been taken. Give us back what has been given away, even by us. Last phrase in the passage, verse 20. Therefore, glorify God in your body. Glorify. Would you just let that? Glorify God in your body. The word body there again is what? Guess what? It's plural. So glorify God, not in your body, but in your body. In your body. Let the light of Jesus shine in your body. And in the light of what I'm talking about, porneia, those of us who have perpetrated porneia, those who have been victims of porneia, it looks like porneia is everywhere. How in the world is the glory going to show through that? How about we blow a horn in Zion? How about we gather the people and call the elders and come together recognizing it's not just him and it's not just her. It's us. It's me. It's ours. Corporate sin, corporate mourning, corporate celebration, corporate repentance. Come to God and say, God, if we are going to glorify you, you are going to have to touch us. Because in light of where we are and what's invaded us, your light couldn't possibly shine unless you touch us. I've never done this before. It feels awkward. I feel nervous. I'm not exactly sure how to do it. this was one of those rare weeks where before I even got my sermon, I knew how it was supposed to close because I think God gave me a word. And as awkward and weird as it might feel, today is a day that I want to call the congregation. I want to gather the people. I want to call the elders. It occurs to me, and just kind of let me help you through what might feel a little bit awkward, but it occurs to me that if we are dealing with the pain of pornea and how it is that in an interconnected way those who have moved into pornea have brought us all in that it would be very appropriate to expect conviction to fall on those who have done that and ask those who have done that to come forward and we will pray for those who have moved into pornea and because this is a graceful place I would expect that the body would even come around those who in brokenness have come to confess and get healing and repent and then we would say not only are there perpetrators who have brought us all into this pornea, but there are victims. And you victims, we want you to know that you are not alone either. If you have been victimized, we have too. And we want you to come. And we want to pray over you that God will give back to you what has been stolen from you. And I know God's people would come around that and say, God bless them. But the word today is this. It isn't just him and him and her and her. It's us. It's ours. It's ours. and somewhere along the line it is appropriate to gather the congregation to call the elders to proclaim a solemn assembly and for us who've never even perpetrated porneia or been victims of it for us to come and say on behalf of people with whom I am interconnected we want to come before you God and mourn and weep over the pain that has come to us So what if I did that? What if I called the assembly? What if I called the people? What if I asked the elders to come? Elders, you come. instead of the adulterers being in the front row no this time the elders are going to be in the front row and the people are going to be in the front row and we are coming what if I did that? would you come? you're feeling awkward you ought to feel awkward I feel awkward well Dave what would we do? well here's what we would do in the coming just in the coming And maybe what we would be doing would be allowing ourselves to feel, to feel, just to feel, you know what? We are interconnected. And I can't disassociate myself from that brother or sister's sin. It's not just his. I can't stand up here in my purse and you. No, it became me. And so I'm going to embrace that and carry that. And I'm going to feel that weight. I don't like that, but I'm going to feel that. And those who have been perpetrated against, I'm going to come, and in my coming, I'm going to say, I'm going to, oh man, I am going to allow myself to feel the weight, because when they got abused, I am connected with them, and I got it too. And I allow myself to feel that. Lord, give me that. Give us your heart for this. Because it isn't just him and him and her and her, it's us. And I don't know what we're supposed to do when we come. Some may mourn and some may weep. I would ask you to listen to the Spirit. Maybe we together could ask, God, would you bring your healing? Do you do renewal? Will you reclaim? Bring your glory. If we're going to glorify you, you're going to have to touch us. The fact of the matter is, if I did call the congregation to come, all of you, there isn't room for all of you. So you're off the hook. some of you you can't all come there's just no room but I'm going to tell you something you don't have to be part of this you don't have to come up to be part of this but you know what I am going to do I'm going to ask you to come you know who I want to call first I want to call the elders elders come and feel the weight of your people come feel the weight of this stuff and carry it can't get rid of it let's just feel it and then the congregation all of you perpetrators come victims come people who've never been perpetrated against people who've never perpetrated you come and let's meet with God and let's say to God God renew restore reclaim we mourn we repent give us back what we have lost give us back what has been taken give us back what we have given away for free we just do two things I want you to stand we're going to sing a song I'm going to ask you to come I'm going to pray over you and then we're just going to let ministry happen and be dismissed In our body be glorified, be glorified. In our body be glorified today. In our church, Lord, be glorified, be glorified. In our church, Lord, be glorified today. There are people still coming. You just feel free to come. But I want to just begin this by praying over you. Lord God, Your people have assembled. They aren't all in front. Some are in the bleachers and in the chairs. Some are in front. We are here to meet with You. we have heard many things this morning but what's resonating in my heart most strongly is that we are connected we are interrelated dear father as it relates to this this issue of porneia we have been perpetrators it isn't just him and him and her and her it's us Dear Jesus, we're here to repent. We're here to say we're sorry. We need your cleansing and we need your renewal in this arena. Father, I'm overwhelmingly aware also not only of the perpetration of porneia among us and how it has affected us all, but Father, the victims of porneia who have had porneia thrust upon them. And God, what's in my heart most strong today is that the victims of porneia, that is rape and incest and sexual abuse in some form, that it isn't just him and him and her and her isolated people that we are connected. And if any among us have been affected by this porneia, to them it is our pain. It is ours. I pray in your name that you would give us a taste of carrying that with the body, but we have got to be able to come to You because we can't carry that. Pray in Your name that You would come and bring Your healing. The wind of Your Spirit, I pray, come, Holy Spirit, fall. Holy Spirit, come restore, reclaim, renew. you
