Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, chapter 4. Ephesians chapter 4, verse 25. Continuing in the same section we were in last week, moving only to the 26th verse, but I want to read the text so we see it in whole. Therefore, believer, laying aside falsehood, speak truth, each one of you with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. Be angry, and yet do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity. Let him who steals stop, but rather let him labor, performing with his own hands what is good, in order that he may have something to share with him who has need. Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification, according to the need of the moment, that it may give grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you with all malice, and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. Let's pray. Father, I pray that your spirit would be in control. And I pray, Lord, that the things on my heart would come forth with freedom and clarity and power. I ask these things in your name. Amen. I really do have a lot of things on my heart this morning and I really have a fear that the things on my heart aren't going to be expressed appropriately. So I would just ask that even as I speak, you pray for me that the things that the Spirit would teach us this morning would be received. we introduced this last week and some of the things we talked about were what are the real characteristics of a believer and ever since then some of the words that have been haunting me all week long and i bring them to you now are the words that jesus used when he was looking at a group of people that maybe weren't a whole lot different than you and me a lot of people who were very religious a lot of people who were going to church all the time a lot of people who really felt that they had what it took and all this kind of thing And he turned to that group of people and he said something that kind of sends chills up my spine and has haunted me not just this week but all my life really whenever it's gone through my mind and someone has said it, it's simply this. Not all that come to me in that day saying Lord, Lord are going to enter into the kingdom. And again he was speaking to a group of people to whom that must have been a great shock. How can you say that to us? We are the believers. We are the followers. We are the church members. We are the board members. We teach the classes. We wear the garb. And he began to kind of grab those people, I think, by their hearts and say, listen, the ones who are really belonging to my kingdom are very easy to identify. You know why? Because the ones who belong to my kingdom, the ones who really have new life, live a new life. The ones who are part of my kingdom walk a different walk. You see, they think different and they act different and they have different attitudes and for some strange reason they've got different desires and they've got different motives and different goals. They walk different. We've been talking these last few weeks in verses 25 through 32 of the distinctives of a believer. And we have been calling them signs of life. These characteristics are signs of life. If you have the life that has been talked about in chapters 1 through 3 that Paul has been delineating for us in chapters 1 through 3, if indeed you have that life, then the result is going to be that we are going to see signs of life. And I feel like as I bring that, there's something I need to warn us about, and it's something, again, this is part of the thing I want to share with you from my heart. I fear for some of us that as I see Jesus saying those words to those people 2,000 years ago, that that same Jesus would come into our church and say those same words to us. I fear sometimes that in our moving through life and in our finding this nice building and in our nice clothes and in our nice doctrine, we have very easily and subtly begun to slip into kind of a situation where we really don't even know anymore what the clear definitions are for a believer. I believe with all my heart that the time has come for a real reawakening in our consciousness of what it means to be a believer, what it really means to follow Jesus Christ. And I don't know how to do it. I don't know even how to share with you the things that are on my heart. But I have such a sense of urgency about this, And usually when we talk about a sense of urgency, it's because things are coming to an end and the world is going to blow up. You know, I don't know how well you know me in this regard, but I'm not into that. I don't know when the world is going to end. I don't look at current events and think, ah, the end is near. All I know is that right now I have a tremendous sense of urgency that the church become the church. All I know is that my heart's throb is this, that we don't have time to play church anymore. That we don't have time to come and appease superficiality and pat it on the back and think, well, maybe it'll change. When I see Jesus moving into the temple, and when I see him looking at people and saying, listen, not all who say, Lord, Lord, are going to enter. And when I see him looking at the Pharisees and saying, you hypocrites, it begins to move in me that maybe we're missing something, that maybe we have become superficial, and we need to break out of that if we have. You see, this Christianity is not some sort of system of religion that is kind of designed to just keep people in line, that is designed kind of to just make us feel religious and make us feel okay because I went to church today. There's something far more radical than that coming out of the pages of Ephesians, coming out of the Gospels to me and to all of us. We do not have time to maintain the status quo and just come to church and sit and pay the bills and let things go as they will. The time has come, I believe, with all my heart for we as believers to come together and take off the dead, take off the old and begin to put on the new. Root out that which is dead in our lives and recognize that which is living to be the church, to be the church, that we would see glory in the church because we are His people. And as we are His people, It's something that's different than just a profession that says, I am a Christian, I am a Lyons, I am a Baptist. But a change in life that evidences something that is real, something that is different. In order to do that, in order to root out the dead and bring in the living and recognize the living, and in order for us to really be the church, I think one of the first things we need to do is I believe we need to see a fresh and a new, the radical nature of our faith. That Christianity by definition is more than a list of things I believe. That the very essence of our Christianity is change. That the very essence of our Christianity is being transformed. That the very definition of our Christianity is that I have been recreated. I am a new person. We've heard that so many times. And again, I think in our minds we need to be reminded of these things and then begin to think of the implications of those things. When I transferred my trust from myself and my money and my job and my drugs and my religion and my works to Christ and to Christ alone, when I created a new dependency, that dependency being upon Christ, when I made that commitment of a lie, something happened to me. You know what it was? I was changed. I was changed. That's what we've been spending nine months learning, all through Ephesians 1 through 3. I have been changed. And the change is radical. The change is, it couldn't be more. The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of the change that took place in me when I received Christ as my Savior, when I transferred my trust to Him, was this. I went from death to life. There can't be any more radical change than that. I went from death to life. I went from condemnation to being holy and blameless before God. I went from a condition of being cut off and far off to being brought near. I went from a condition of not knowing God to having the privilege of coming into his very presence and crying, Abba, Father, I've been changed. I'm a new creature. I've got a new life. I've got a new direction, and I've got a new hope, and I've got a new inheritance. I've been redeemed. Ephesians 1 through 3. All the changes that took place in me when I transferred my trust to him. Marvelous truth. Christianity, by definition, is a change. It's a transformation. It's a recreation. It's going from death to life. But I'm afraid that even for we believers, the tension of that, the depth of that, is something that begins to just get stale and we come to church and we play the game and it just gets stale and we begin to lose it. And I'm afraid for some of us and myself included and I want to tell you something as I bring this exhortation, I am including myself. In fact, the struggle was about me. It was about redefining for me and going deeper for me. That I think sometimes, even unawares, we treat our Christianity as if it were nothing more than a belief system. And I introduced our sermon last week with talking about the fact that Christianity is more than a belief system. It is more than things I believe. It is more than just getting you to believe the right things. Satan believes all the right things. He believes in Christ. He believes he died. He believes he died for the sins of the world. He believes he rose again. He even believes in the second coming. That means nothing. There's something more here. But we, without even knowing it, I believe, treat it as if it's nothing more than a system of belief. Like this club I join. And here's the rules, you know. it says this little church here this club I joined and here's the rules what you gotta believe is you gotta believe in the virgin birth you gotta believe in Christ and you gotta believe in this you gotta believe in that and I get you all these things and I see if you believe in them and if you believe in them then okay listen Christianity is something more than a system of belief I want you to think with me here and fight this intellectually I want you to fight with this and wrestle with it if Christianity is nothing more than a system of belief then it is not unique okay If Christianity is nothing more than the system of belief, then Christianity is not unique. All it is is different. If Christianity is just a system of belief, it's not unique. All it is is different. You see, instead of Buddha, we have Jesus. Instead of the Koran, we have the Bible. See? It's not unique. But it's more than the system of belief. The whole essence of Christianity is new life. It's going from death to life. It's being transformed. It's being changed. It's being made alive. It's being a new creature in Christ. Again, I want you to think with me here. As you evaluate your own heart in terms of how you treat your own Christianity. And I think one of the ways we can reveal to ourselves the fact that we treat our Christianity as a system of belief is how we share our faith. And this was something I just bounced off myself and saw about myself. How we share our faith. Think about it. See, basically what I try to do when I try to share my faith with you is I try to convince you that my way is better. See, you've got your system. You're Jewish or you're something else or you're Hindu or you're something. And what I do is I go to you. And before I go to you, I go to pastor and I find all the answers. Right? And I go to that Hindu friend of mine or that Jewish friend of mine. And I come with all the answers and I got them all listed. And what I do is I try to convince them that my system is better than theirs. Right? And I argue with them. I fight with them. It's wonderful. And that's my job, though. My job is to convince you that my system is better than your system. You know, as a kid, I was a whiz. I was a pastor's kid, so I went to Sunday school all the time, and I went to one, and I was getting bombed all the time with all the right stuff. I knew the system. I knew the system inside and out. And I was just a wonderful kid, and I knew that part of the system is that you're supposed to share your faith, so I started sharing my faith. And I remember walking home with this kid, this one incident, I don't know why, it's really not that significant, but it's indelibly written out of my memory, but I remember walking home from school and talking to this kid, And what I was doing was sharing my faith. And I was ready to punch him. Because he wasn't buying what I was selling. He didn't like my system. And I went home thinking, boy, that guy's going to hell after you. You didn't buy my system. And you know, very often, the very fact that we have problems with sharing our faith. And we have this perception that the guy who really knows how to witness is really, basically, all he has is the characteristics of a good salesman. He can talk. He makes sense. He puts it all together so well. And I hear somebody who's really like that, so I bring my friends to hear them. You know? Because it's a system. If I can get somebody to talk them into my system, they'll be saved. And I did that. You know what happened to me, though? Then something happened and I met Jesus. And you know what happened when I met Jesus? I was changed. And the system came alive. I didn't argue anymore. I started saying stupid things like once I was blind and now I see and once I was in darkness but now I'm in the light and once I was cut off but now I've been brought in air and once I was a Baptist now I'm a believer once I was religious now I've been redeemed once I was a professor and now I'm a possessor Possessor. Once I was dead, but I've been made alive. And you know why? I wasn't sharing a system anymore. I was sharing a life. I was sharing something that was alive. I'd been made new. I was changed. Christianity, by definition, is a change. It's a transformation. It's being made new. It's going from death to life. Once I shared a system, now I share the Savior. I was changed. I want to bounce something off you here. We've been going through Ephesians 1 through 3 for 9 months. 10 months. Close to 11. Something in there. And we know by now what happened to me. And what happened to you when you received Christ. You know about the fact that you've gone from death to life. I know that I have become a partaker of the divine nature. And that is a reality. and that's wonderful. But you know what is also so neat? It's so neat that all those things can happen to me. It's so neat that all those changes can take place in me, and I can go from death to life. But I can still have as the characteristic of my life bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and evil speaking. I've got to share with you my struggle. You know what my struggle is? My struggle is this, that I don't see how I can go from death to life. and not have a change in my living. I don't see how it can be. You know, this is not an exhortation to try harder. This is not an exhortation to look at those characteristics and say, okay, okay, I'm going to try harder to let all bitterness... No, it isn't that at all. You know what it is, and you know what the whole thing is? This is like a mirror. It's like being held up to us, and it's like a mirror. and it's saying these are the characteristics of believers. And if your life is a constant flow of bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and slander, those are all signs of death and maybe there's a real possibility. All those who say, Lord, Lord, just because you say the right thing, well, I know that God, yeah. The essence of Christianity, the definition of Christianity is transformation, being changed, being made alive, being made new. a recreation I think there's two reasons why these characteristics might not be seen in our lives one I've already mentioned and this is where I want to do some teaching and grab you here a little bit two reasons why these characteristics might not be seen in our lives one is that we're just not a new creature in Christ that nothing has really happened that that transformation that newness of life never did implant itself and we're just deluded to think it is it has the other is this and this is the fact that there are believers who have these characteristics in their lives and they are believers and very often but this is the reason they've never been taught they came to Christ they accepted a new nature they heard the salvation message but nobody ever took Ephesians and said you know how somebody with a new nature acts this is how they act nobody ever came to us like Paul went to the church in Ephesus and said listen folks this is who you are isn't that wonderful and we go yeah you know what else this is how you live believer you walk in humility and that one with the new nature says oh oh okay meekness oh I didn't know okay and he begins to move and he begins to grow and you know what when I'm talking about a difference in our lives I am not talking about wham bam all of a sudden I become a new creature in Christ and everything is changed I am perfect there is no there is no inkling of that at all the whole thing is when i become a new creature a process begins and i am not changed past tense done i am changing and i want to tell you something now as you're looking at me and i'm your pastor there is a way in which there's a very strong way in which as one who is the leader of the church who is one of the elders just along with all our other elders i am to be an example to you and you know one of the perversions of our christianities for so many years has been the example of this. I stand here and I look real perfect. Okay? So you, I've arrived. And what I do is I talk to you and I say, you know, when you're a God like me, then you'll be okay. And all it does is make people feel discouraged and hate the pastor. You know the example you should follow in me and you know the example I should be setting is this, that I'm changing all the time. That I'm in a process and I'm being stretched and I'm being changed. And Paul said, be imitators of me even as I'm an imitator of Christ. What was it that we were to imitate about Paul? The fact that he was pressing on toward the mark all the time. He never stopped. He never quit growing. He never quit stripping off the old and putting on the new all the time. Whole life changes. But I want to tell you, an indicator of life is that you're going through the changes, is that you're going through the... that you've got a new thirst, that you've got a new desire, and I want to be more like the Lord. The point of this whole thing is that new creations live like new creatures. And that's what Paul is saying, and now we're getting to the text. That was all introduction. And we've been understanding that in chapters 1 through 3, we've been discovering that Paul has said, this is who you are. And then in chapters 4 through 6, he says this, because this is who you are, because that's who you are, this is how you act. And it began to get real specific. This is how one who's got the new nature lives. In verses 17 through 24, he was real general. Remember? He said, the way you live is this. You walk different. Real specific, huh? You just walk different. Again, the stupid illustration I gave you was that if the world is scratching their head, you scratch your tummy. If they're walking crooked, you walk straight. If they're walking straight, you walk crooked. Just walk different. And then he gave a real general exhortation. It was this. Strip off the old, put on the new. Strip off those things that make you look like you're dead and put on things that make you look like you're alive. Because you are alive. and then he got real specific and that was where we kind of ground down to a halt as we were flying through those first few verses all of a sudden we had to take a look at these characteristics as we start putting on new things and we've been calling them signs of life signs of life indicators in my life that I have life the first sign of life was what we discussed last week in verse 25 therefore lay aside falsehood speak truth each one of you with his neighbor. The first thing we see as a sign of life is that we exchange lying for telling the truth. As we read Revelation 21 verse 8, we saw that whatever else we think and whatever else is true, one thing we are certain of, and it's this, that lying, whether that lying be shading the truth, exaggerating the truth, or withholding the truth, that lying is characteristic of those who are going to hell, not heaven, that it is characteristic of those who are dead in their sin, not alive to Christ. And that's why Paul says vehemently, take it off. Why? Because it makes you look like you're dead. We're going to move on. The second sign of life and the life of the believer is found in verse 26. And again, we're not going to go real fast because there's too much here. Be angry and do not sin. He exchanges inappropriate anger for appropriate anger. Be angry and yet do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not give the devil an opportunity. this is a verse that has been an enigma for many of us for years and years and everybody handles it a little bit differently some people choose to ignore it thinking that any anger of any sort of any form could never be something that the believer has and so instead of dealing with their anger they just cram it down and act like that others use it as a license be angry hey it sounds like a miracle i don't want to be angry don't tell me i can't be angry it says right there smack you one It's kind of a license. It gives me liberty to be any way I want to be, to blow up any way I want to blow up. Still others really aren't sure at all, but feeling like we have to come up with an explanation, we say things like this. What this means is it's okay to be angry, but just a little angry. You can be a little angry, but not a lot angry. You can be angry, but don't swear. You know, swearing is the line. If you cross that line, you're out of it. You can be angry, but don't say it. Be angry, but don't sin. That means be angry, but don't tell nobody. Just go home and go smack the pillow. Now, we need to do, we need to study, don't we? We need to find out what this really says. Let's do it. Be angry. Right off the bat, I got a problem with those two words. The problem is simply this, that in the Greek, there's a particular tense that is called the permissive imperative, and that's what this is. It's called the permissive imperative. Now, you know what an imperative is, don't you? That's like when you're supposed to do it. Imperative. It's imperative that you do this. Be angry. This is a permissive imperative that means this, quite literally, that under certain circumstances, that in certain situations, it is not only okay for you to be angry, but it is the appropriate response. That anger in certain situations is the appropriate response. But do not sin. Don't let it turn to sin. Don't give the devil an opportunity. Be angry. But don't sin. in fact we're talking about signs of life one of the signs of life one of the signs that you are one of his one of the signs that you belong in the kingdom one of the signs that you have new life is that certain things are going to make you angry that didn't make you angry before you care about different things sounds like heresy let's take a look it's going to help us a lot in this particular study if we realize right off the bat that there are three Greek words for anger all we ever knew was that there were three greek words for love right you've had that crammed on your throat five million times but there are also three greek words for anger and it really helps me paint a picture and understand just exactly what god is saying to us in this text three greek words they are thumas paragismas and orge and i would encourage you to write them down phonetically if you'd like because i'm going to be referring to them all the time thumas is one paragismas is the other, paragismas, and the other is orgei. Orgei. Let's look at them individually, and it's going to really sort out nicely as we go. Thumas is the first kind of anger that is mentioned in the Word of God. It is not, however, the word that is used in this text. That is significant. Let's look. Thumas is the kind of anger that has to do with a boiling kind of fury. It has to do with explosive kind of anger. This thumas anger is unpredictable. You don't know when it's going to go off. Literally, it means to go up and smoke. Boom! You know, you just, you know this kind of person. It's dangerous stuff. This particular word, beloved, is used in the Word of God only to describe the unregenerate man, and it is also described, used to describe Satan in Revelation 12.12. This kind of anger is never the characteristic of one who has life. It is never the characteristic It is not a sign of life. This kind of explosive, unpredictable kind of anger is an anger that's characteristic of those who don't have that life. Now, obviously, again, there are believers who struggle with this kind of thing, but I'm telling you, when that kind of anger is being evidenced in your life, you don't look like you're alive, you look like you're dead. I don't know how many of you live in a family where dad is this way, or mom is this way, or the kids are this way, but I want to say that it's probably one of the most terrorizing kinds of family situations that there could be. You go home from school, and dad might be pleasant, he might not. You don't know. He might blow up, he might not. You never know what it is that's going to trigger it. It's unpredictable. Thumas. It is not a characteristic of life, it's a characteristic of death. The second kind of anger is paragismas. Paragismas. This kind of anger, again, is not the word that is used in this particular text, and it is an anger that describes an inside seething. Okay? You got the picture in your mind? I mean, immediately when I say that, I know the feeling. Right? An inside seething. It's a fuming. It's kind of a stewing anger. It just boils and it bubbles right here. Generally, paragus mash is quiet. Okay? It doesn't go bam. It just sits there and feels it. It's like that. I want to tell you something, this anger, this lingering resentment, this turning, this kind of anger is so serious that in Matthew 5, Jesus calls it the first step to murder. This again is not the characteristic of one who's got new life. This kind of stewing and boiling is characteristic of one who is in debt. I want you to think about it again, because we're trying to paint verbal pictures as we try to grapple with what this text is teaching us. The first thing I want you to know, and the first thing that comes to me, is I consider paragismas, and those characteristics is that when someone's struggling with this kind of anger, I can see it on their face. Right? Do you know what I mean? You can see it on their face. You can just see them. They just look angry. They're just fuming, and they're seething and turning. The way they deal with their anger is not to deal with it at all, but to fume. And you know what they look like? You know what I look like when I do that? You know what you look like when you do that? You look like you're dead. You look like you're dead. When people enter our church and they're struggling with this kind of anger and just walking around like this, you know, unbelievers come into our church and they look at someone like that and they do exactly what I do. I look at that and I go, where's the life? Where's the life? I don't see it. Where's the joy? What do I want this for? I don't. this is very serious this is very serious if our lives are characterized by a constant flow of explosive anger if our lives are characterized by a constant flow of seething anger we give evidence of having Satan as our source and hell as our destiny now please let me again affirm that we may be believers but we sure don't look like it this is serious and the thought hits me that if I was to share I don't care how much love I would have in my heart if I was to share it with one whose life was characterized by paragasmus or thumas and said, listen, you look like you're dead. If I was to share that and maybe even now as I'm sharing and you're struggling with this, you know the person's response? You know what it'd be? What? What do you mean I look like I'm dead? What do you mean I'm frozen with my anger? Or did it see? Thumas, paragasmus makes you look like you're dead. Verse 31 says, look, let all bitterness and wrath and anger, thumos and paragasmus, be put away from you. I'm going to tell you something else. This ties in with verse 29. I'm not going to go and teach verse 29 because it's right here. You see, it's thumos and paragasmus, those two kinds of anger, that explosive and that seething anger, that turns in to unwholesome communication. Let no unwholesome communication, let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only that which is good for edification according to the need of the moment. This is the end of Side 1. Do not fast-forward the tape. Please turn the cassette over now to continue listening on Side 2. Listen, when the heart is full of thumas and the life is carried... Dumas and paragus mas, like that, turn in to unhealthy communication. Unwholesome communication. Really interesting to study the Greek and understand what it says. It means corrupt communication. It means literally worthless, useless communication, more graphically rotten communication, more graphically still, diseased communication. Listen, when the heart is full of thumas and the life is characterized by paragusmas, it's going to result in a lot of diseased, rotten communication. And you've seen it over and over again in your own life. I know that you and I both have been part of conversations where the language is diseased, where the conversation is rotten. It is sick. It is useless. It is dripping with slander. It is dripping with malice. It is dripping with bitterness. It is born of a heart that's full of thumas, and it is born of a lifestyle of paragismas, seething and explosive anger. And that results in a lot of diseased communication. Listen, you put a tongue in combination with a temper that has no spiritual control, and you have got one of the most lethal weapons known to man. And I believe one of the greatest tools that Satan has in destroying his church is that combination. Thumos and Paragasmos leading into diseased communication, dripping with slander and malice, talking about everyone behind it, on and on and on. There's only one way to deal with it and that's the way we deal with Satan all the time. It's simply this, to confront it, rebuke it, bind it, call it what it is, and give it no room to work here. Give it no room to work here. When we see that kind of thing, it's going to be resisted. But there's another kind of anger, and this is where it gets interesting. So if you've been bored silly so far, take heart. The third kind of anger is orge, and that is the word that is being used in this text. Be orge, be angry, yet do not sin. And this particular anger has to do with a settled kind of conviction anger. You got that? You following me? This anger has to do with a settled conviction kind of anger. In other words, I have certain priorities in my life, I have certain things that I value in my life, I have certain things that I am committed to in my life, and anything in my life that would violate what I value, anything in my life that would violate what I care about, anything in my life that would violate what I'm committed to makes me angry. Okay? Now this kind of anger is absolutely natural. There is no other way for you to be. If what I'm committed to is violated, I'm going to be angry. Listen, that's the way God made you. Okay? Just, that's a fact. It's like, it's like hitting your head, it's like hitting your thumb with a hammer. You know, it's like thinking, oh, I shouldn't feel pain. I don't, you're gonna. You're gonna. If what you're committed to is violated, you're gonna be angry. In this particular text, It says this, be angry, be angry. And so it is in the life of the believer, when certain commitments of mine are being violated, when certain values of mine as a believer are being defiled, that the appropriate response is anger. And if I don't respond in anger, then something's wrong. Then I'm moving into sin. When I sit in silence, when there's sin in the church, then I've moved into sin. When sin and hypocrisy doesn't move me to anger, then I'm in sin. I'll just give you an example. I just got done talking about thumas and paragismas as being evidence of death, not life, as being evidence that its source is Satan. And when I'm talking about that, and even especially when I was studying this, I felt like I was going through transitions, and when I was describing those two words, I felt like I was just dwelling in the pit of hell. It was just dripping with characteristics that Satan would have borne out in our lives. And I'll be real frank with you. Paragasmos and Thumas make me angry. When I see that in our church, when I see people in position to responsibility who have those characteristics, it makes me angry. When I see those characteristics in me, it makes me angry. I react to that. And I want to tell you right now that if those are characteristics that are consistent in your life, you're on a collision course with me. Because I'm going to confront it. and I'm going to deal with it and I'm going to and I'm going to get it and I'm going to kiss you. You know what I just did? I just illustrated to you exactly the exhortation that Paul is dealing with here. He says, you know what? There are some things you ought to be angry about. But you be careful. You be careful. Because that anger, righteous as it is, appropriate as it is, can like that turn into paragus mas and thumas. And I've seen it happen to me over and over and over again. I may be right I may be so right it's just unbelievable and everybody knows I'm right and I go and build a case what do you think about that? yeah you're right yeah I know by the time I get to the person boom you know be angry there are certain things that need to make you angry but don't sin don't give Satan the opportunity when Satan has the opportunity you know what he'll do? he'll turn your healthy anger into seeding anger and then it'll take your seething anger and if he can get your seething anger to hold down long enough, if he can just get you to seethe for a day or two or three, if he can get you to seethe and turn and just boil about that for about a day, you know what he'll get? He'll have the opportunity to turn that into thumas just like that because on Sunday when you see him next, boom, right through. So what's the answer? Well, the answer is easy. It's easy to see. It's hard to do. I want to grab you with this and please follow it's so simple we miss it the answer first of all is this speak the truth each one of you with his neighbor you know something if you've seen something in me that's hurtful if you've seen something in me that's inconsistent and believe me friend there's more than one but if you've seen something in me that's inconsistent and isn't bringing glory to God and is hurting the body of Christ you know what you need to do? you know what you need to do with that response you've had to me, you need to come and tell me. You need to speak the truth to me. You know what you shouldn't do? And you know what leads to all sorts of disease communication? Is when you've got a problem with me, and you tell Tom. Right? But that's what we do, right? You've got a problem with the pastor, so you tell George. And I do the same thing. If I've got a problem with you, you know what I need to do? If I've seen some hurtful thing in you that's hurting the body, you know what I'm responsible before God to do? To go to you with love, and tell you, and speak the truth to you. But you know what I do? Instead of going to you, I go tell George. And I go tell my wife. And I go tell my friends. And I build a case. And by the time that thing that was right gets out, it's disease. You know what? We can really help each other with this. And let's just do it. Let's just kind of come together and say, listen, let's really be healthy with this. But the next time you're in on a conversation that's diseased, and you hear diseased communication coming, and listen, it may be me. You know, you may be listening to me and you just, what's he doing? Why is he telling me this? Why doesn't he tell them that? When you're in a conversation like that and you're hearing paragasimasa, seething, dripping with slander, would you just lovingly take the person and say, hey, hey, you know what you ought to do? Don't tell me. Tell him. Tell him. You know why? Because here we speak the truth, each one to his neighbor. Why? Because he remembers one of another. That's why. and you know what else there's another suggestion here it's this do it today do it today do it now don't let the sun go down on that justifiable anger on that anger that is appropriate don't let the sun go down on it do it now if you don't you know what you're going to do you're going to give Satan an opportunity you're going to give Satan an opportunity to let it turn over in you you're going to give Satan an opportunity to let it dwell in you you're going to give Satan an opportunity to turn you into a seething, boiling, moody, unpleasant person. But you know what we think? We think that what I should do is when I'm angry, I should go home and I should just sit on it and let it cram it down. And you know what happens when I sit on it and I go home and I beat my pillow? It goes away, right? See, Dave, you're wrong. I shouldn't deal with it now. I should go home and let it go away. You want to bet you haven't dealt with your anger? You haven't spoken the truth in love? you haven't done anything you haven't dealt with your anger you know what you've done? you've set the stage I don't know if it's tomorrow or the next day or the next day but you've set the stage for an explosion somewhere because that that's there and when we bury that kind of thing it doesn't die it just sits there and lives it sits there and lives and all of a sudden two weeks later something will trigger it off and that thing six things that happen all week long go whammo I'm flying up speak the truth each one of you to his neighbor today there's another dimension of this or gay that's extremely important however we've gotten some principles here for not letting it turn to sin and that is that I speak the truth about it and secondly that I do it now, I do it today I don't tell somebody else if I've got a problem with you I tell you, Linda, okay? I promise, all of you I don't got a problem with you there's another dimension of or gay that we need to understand and I want us to see and again it's very very rich you see this exhortation really is not only dealing with how I'm supposed to handle my anger but it reveals something about me because what I get angry about is significant too again the definition of orge is what? it's the violation of a commitment that I have it's a violation of something I value what I value has been violated so I'm mad I think you've probably already put the puzzle together the thing that is so rich in this is this, that anger reveals what? That you're an angry person? No. Anger isn't even the issue. What anger reveals about me is what I'm committed to. Think on that. What anger reveals about me is what I'm committed to. What I get angry about tells the whole world where my real commitments lie. And it doesn't matter what I claim to be committed to. What I get angry about will reveal what I'm committed to. Listen, if I'm committed to winning, you know what's going to make me angry? Losing. I mean, whether that's good or bad, that's just a fact. Losing is going to make me angry. If I'm committed to relaxing, you know what's going to make me angry? When I have to work. I don't like that. I'm committed to relaxing. You know, when I'm committed to money, you know what's going to make me angry? When I don't have any. When it's taken away. If I'm committed to things, what's going to make me angry is when they're broken. If I'm committed to myself, you know what's going to make me angry? When I don't get my way. And all of a sudden, those are the things that I see in myself as being the sources of my anger. And we walk around seething and fuming and it's all about me. It's all about my desire, my ego, my little feelings. If I'm committed to people, if I'm committed to people, I'm going to be angry when they're hurt. If I'm committed to the Word of God, you know what? If I'm committed to the Word of God, I'm going to be angry when it's treated shallowly. And you know what else? I am. One of the biggest changes in my life as I was going into the ministry was this weird change and it wasn't something I designed or anything. But when I would hear somebody speak from the Word of God and it bored me, it irritated me. Because I thought, this is life. This is the most exciting thing there is to do, to see. And when we just treat it superficially, it made me angry. When you're committed to the Word, lack of commitment to the Word is going to make you angry. When you're committed to truth, hypocrisy is going to make you angry. Thank you.
