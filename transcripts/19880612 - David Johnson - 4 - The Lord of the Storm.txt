Matthew chapter 8 verse 23. If you've been with us, you're aware of the fact that we find ourselves in the middle of Matthew in a section called the healing ministry of Jesus or the miracles of Christ. It begins in chapter 8 and that section on the miracles of Christ goes through chapter 9. What we've seen so far is that Jesus has indeed begun to demonstrate his miraculous and healing power by the healing of three different kinds of diseases. is one was leprosy, the other was paralysis, and the other was a woman who had a fever. But we also know that many miracles were going on. We know that from verse 16, when at the end of the day, the Sabbath was over, and people started bringing all of their demon-possessed people. Jesus was casting out the spirits, and all the people who came who were sick got healed right then. And then after that, however, in verse 18, as we moved into the next verse, we saw that there was a little different shift of emphasis, or an application, if you will, of this kingdom power demonstrated, and it was turning into a call to kingdom commitment. The picture was of Jesus and the crowd gathering around him in verse 18, and giving orders to depart from the western shore of the Sea of Galilee to move out into the lake. And the picture that we got in our minds was that of, from now on, it's going to be a little more difficult to follow Jesus. From this period of time, it had been easy. He was on the side of the hill. He was just around. and if you were walking by, you could see the miracles and you could hear the incredible preaching and you could hear the authority with which he spoke, but you didn't have to follow him. You didn't have to choose to do it. Maybe you had to move around a little bit, but now he's leaving the shore and you've got to make a decision. Am I going to go or am I going to stay? And if I go, I'm going to have to leave the security and the safety of the shore to do it. And what we did then was we met three new people in this whole study of Matthew. So far in Matthew, there have been two primary players. The first player in the whole story of, the whole laying out of Matthew have been Pharisees. We have known them very well. Religious, hypocrisy, self-righteous, they look real good, they perform very well, they look like they could probably fit into any evangelical church, but on the inside, their heart does not pump for God. They are hypocrites. The other person we've met and become very familiar with is the broken person. The embodiment of the broken person was found in the leper that nobody wanted to be around and nobody wanted to touch, and Jesus moved into that person's life, put his hand on him, and in the power of the kingdom healed him from his diseases. We saw the same thing in the Samaritan. But that was a type of person, an outcast, broken, mourning, hungry, that's the person who gets into the kingdom. In our last study, we got introduced to a whole different type of person. The embodiment of this person was found, first of all, in the scribe, different than the Pharisee and leper, because not like the Pharisee, he wasn't opposing Jesus, and not like the leper, he wasn't a pile of mush. This guy was respectable, reliable, the backbone of the church type of person, would have been a trophy for Jesus' ministry, and also he had a wonderful testimony. I will follow you anywhere. And when the boat was departing and that promise was given, Jesus said, fine, in verse 20, but you need to know this. Foxes have holes, birds have nests, the Son of Man doesn't have a place to lay his head. And if you want to follow me, that's great, but it might not be comfortable. And as soon as this scribe, with all sorts of promises to follow, heard that it wouldn't be comfortable, he stayed on shore. And as I said last week, he disappeared someplace in the white space between verse 20 and 21. And then another disciple came with all sorts of the same kinds of promises. I will follow you anywhere, but Lord, let me first bury my father. We learned his father wasn't dead. What he meant was, I got to wait for my father to die so that I get my inheritance. God, I will follow you anywhere as soon as I am financially secure, and I will pay whatever price, especially I'm willing to pay the price, when I know I can afford it. And Jesus says to him, listen, you're going to have to let the dead bury the dead. And what that meant, you remember, was simply this. You let those who are spiritually dead and live this life as if this life is all there is, you let them spend their whole life making sure they are financially secure now. Disciples of mine, follow now. and I will make sure you're secure. He left another one behind and the boat started going out. We met a third person in a parallel passage of Luke chapter 9. Another disciple coming, I will follow you anywhere you say. But I got to go home first and check with those who are at home. I got to make sure my friends still like me. I got to make sure they understand. I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea, but I promise you, if you'll just wait here a little bit, I'll go home and check and then I'll be back. And Jesus said to him, Any man who puts his hand to the plow, meaning any man who says, I'm going to follow you anywhere, and listens to my voice, but then listens to other voices too, is never going to do the work of the kingdom. You are not fit for the kingdom. And that person got left as well. And as we come to verse 23 and the drama continues to unfold, the picture is very much this. Disciples who would follow him anywhere, are kind of confused, a little bit scared, maybe a little bit sad, maybe even a little bit angry at Jesus. Hard words, staying on the shore, but the boat's keeping on going, and there are disciples in there. And when he got into the boat, verse 23, his disciples followed him. And behold, there arose a great storm in the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves. But he himself was asleep. Nice guy. And they came to him and awoke him, saying, Save us, Lord, we're perishing. And he said to them, why are you timid, you men of little faith? And then he arose and rebuked the winds in the sea and it became perfectly calm. And the men marveled, saying, what kind of man is this, that even the winds in the sea obey him? Let's pray as we begin. Father, I believe that there is a word here for us that is very encouraging. There are people here today that I know to be in the middle of a storm. And they're in the storm because they obeyed you, not because they've walked away from you. There are storms like that too. but Father I know that there are people here like that and in some ways as a church there are times when I feel like that as a church we go through a storm and Father if it's a result of our obedience this is a word for us tremendous encouragement and I ask your spirit to be released here to minister comfort encouragement but boldness as well to keep following you no matter what I pray your anointing on this time in Jesus name, Amen what I'm going to do with this text basically is kind of go through this and tell you the story break it down a little bit and then there's four things I want to share with you but the best way to teach it to begin with is just by going verse by verse and giving you some color on it and when he got into the boat his disciples followed him I want to stop on this thing disciples just for a minute little little teaching here very brief who are the disciples anyway I don't know about you but I'm a little confused because that word is getting thrown all over the book of Matthew. His disciple came to him and said, I will follow you anywhere, but let me bury my father first. His disciple came to him and says, I will follow you anywhere, but let me make sure my friends like me first. His disciples got in the boat. Who are the disciples? Anyway, I've got a perception of discipleship and a disciple. It was all the rage a few years ago to make a very clear distinction, you might remember this, between a Christian who was a normal, everyday, run-of-the-mill, ordinary Christian and a disciple. A disciple was a real follower of Jesus. But I'm confused because it seems like a lot of people are being called disciples, and they get to a certain point, and some of them drop off, and some of them continue, but they're all called disciples. Well, maybe the disciples were the twelve, and what you've got in this boat here are the twelve. They are the disciples. Well, I've even got that dynamic of some of them following him and some of them falling off, even in the context of the twelve, because among the twelve, there were eleven who followed him right to the end, and there was one who fell off and didn't continue to follow him. What is a disciple? Who do we got in the boat? The word disciple that is being used here in the Greek is the word mathetes. All that word means is this, follower, learner, or pupil. It does not give any designation. That word does not give any designation to the level of the commitment that this learner or disciple or follower has. So all along the line, you've got, let's say, at the Sermon on the Mount, a multitude of people. And it could be said that that whole multitude of people were disciples. They were mafetis. They were followers. They were learners. And they were sitting there, and they were approving. Now, you might have had your Pharisees who were sitting there trying to rip the whole thing apart. And you might have had your lepers who were coming and just grabbing on to Jesus for dear life, but a lot of people were just kind of moth-a-taste, following, learning, assessing. And all along the way, Jesus kept doing something. He kept moving away and saying basically this, do you still want to come? After I show you the power of the kingdom, you want to come. After I tell you the dynamic of the kingdom in the Sermon on the Mount, it's the broken, it's the mourning, it's the hungry, do you still want to come? I'm sure some left. After he did some healing, do you still want to come? I'm sure they did. But if you got to leave shorter, you still want to follow. Some of them did. Some of them didn't. After the storm hits, you still want to come? A disciple is a mathetes. He is a learner, a follower, and get this, he is a learner and follower whose level of commitment is consistently being disclosed. It is consistently being determined. It is constantly being deepened. It is constantly being changed, and it is constantly growing, but it is always being revealed. You get it? whoever these disciples were, they were not just the twelve. Whoever they were, whatever their level of commitment was, they had taken another step with the master. They had heard the Sermon on the Mount. They liked that. They had seen the miracles. They liked that. They had heard the call to leave comfort, security, and people, and they were okay with that. So they got in the boat. So, So far in this discipleship progression, we got the real dudes in the boat. These are the tough guys, the committed. I will follow you. Some of them meant it. Some of them didn't. The ones who meant it are in the boat. They're going off the shore. Get the picture in your mind. Let's join them in the boat. Okay? How do you think they felt? Let's just picture ourselves leaving the shore, okay? We're hearing the dialogue between the scribe and Jesus and the disciples, and we're hearing them say, I will follow you anywhere. And when we hear them, we go, I believe that. I think he's really sincere. I know this guy. He really means it. Jesus, he's got a good heart. And then we hear Jesus say, foxes have holes and all those things, and they stay, and we're in the boat, and we're leaving. What do you think you would have felt? Well, there's a couple things you might have felt, depending on who was in the boat. I think some of what you felt was a little bit of fear, maybe, a little bit of anxiety. you know it's not any easier for them to leave the shore in the comfort than it was for the people who stayed so they might be a little bit anxious there might also be some people in there who aren't anxious at all and they don't even understand this anxiety stuff this is fun i'm a thrill seeker anything that anybody lays in front of me that is a challenge i will do couldn't maybe never have anything to do with god they're just kind of going along because this looks like a happening thing I'm getting in the boat. So I'm not even sure all the people in the boat here are totally committed for the right reasons. Let's go for an adventure. I got nothing there anyway. As they leave shore a little bit, some of the ones who might have been a little bit scared and nervous would begin to realize, you know, I left all my friends, but this is kind of encouraging because I'm not as alone as I thought I'd be. Mark's account of this particular thing indicates that there was a whole flotilla of boats that followed Jesus' boat. You've got to have that in your mind. It's not just one little boat with two or three people in it. There's a whole flotilla of boats following along with him. Hey, you know, I left those people who were playing it safe, and I left the shore, and I was kind of scared, but I'm not as alone as I thought. I got a new group here, and these guys are committed, and I got a feeling I'd start getting a little bit more exhilarated. About 100 yards off, I can still see the shore, and the little dots of people going like this, But I'm starting to feel, hey, you know what? Hey, I am one of the committed ones. I'm on the team here. I think I'm going to write a book. You've got to leave the shore or something like that. We did it. Kick back in the boat a little bit. It's still pretty calm and start thinking, you know, this is what it's all about. People go to church all the time. It's all boring. It's all mundane. And they never get in the boat. And I get in the boat. This is what it's all about. This is Christian living. You got to get in the boat. You've got to leave the shore. You've got to pay the price. I can feel a sermon coming on, you know. Let's sing a song, men. I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. The waves before me, the shore behind me. I'm going. Faith is the victory that overcomes the world. We got it. And behold, a great storm came. Amazing how that changes your attitude. Behold, remember that word in the Greek? Remember when we met the leper? Behold, literally in the Greek, man, holy cats, you'll never believe it, a leper came. Remember that? Holy cats, you'll never believe it, there arose a great storm. A great storm. I'm having fun. A great storm. In the Greek means great storm. Seismos. We get our... Okay. we get our seismos is the word there for great we get our word seismograph it's a quaking is what it was and if you want to know how great it was it was so great that the boat was covered with waves so the waves were coming in it's amazing how it changes your attitude have you ever been swamped in a boat I think most of you know that I am a man of the sea great fisherman that I am well I am not but I have gotten into that pretty recently I have a good friend named Tim who brings me out and shows me how to put worms and things on hooks and things like that. I was deprived when I grew up in Chicago. Nothing like that. But we went to Lake of the Woods early spring, and it was supposed to be nice, calm water, and we were going to catch all sorts of walleye. I didn't even know what a walleye looked like, but it was supposed to be fun. Well, the wind was there, and the waves were there, and the whole time the wind and waves, and we were in this huge bass boat. And the whole time I'm thinking, God, you really love me, and you care about me and my ministry is not over so I know I'm not going to die. So I was cool. I was just kind of staying in there and rocking and the water was coming right up to the edge. And then we were trying to cross this one lake and when we took off it was real calm and we got to the middle what looked like whitecaps when we left the shore. I saw whitecaps out there. They really were whitecaps. But the waves were way over the boat and water was coming in. It was amazing how my attitude changed when the waves started coming in. All of a sudden the water started looking real dark and the lake started looking real big, and the boat started feeling real small. These guys had a major attitude change when the storm hit. What do you think they were doing when the storm hit? Well, these guys had been on this lake before. They were fishermen, all of them. They were familiar with boats. They were familiar with storms. So they did what anybody would do who has been on the lake that many times and familiar with storms, they panicked. I'll tell you what they did. I know what they did. It's not in the text, but I know what they did. When that storm first started going, they started working like crazy to make sure they were going to make it. And they rode, and they rode, and they rode, and they bailed, and bailed, and they made sure the bow went straight into the waves and so the boat didn't turn sideways because if it went sideways, they would go over right now. and they worked and worked and worked and worked. And this whole time they were working and bailing, two problems were happening. Number one, no matter how much they rode and no matter how much they bailed and no matter how much they were striving to keep afloat, it wasn't working because the water kept coming in. And number two problem was this. The whole time Jesus was sleeping. Would that bother you? Here we are, working our fingers to the bone, rolling like crazy. It's all for him. We're bailing like crazy. The water's still coming in, and he's the one who got us into this, and he's sleeping. And they came to him, verse 25, and awoke him. How do you think they did that? Probably tapped him on the shoulder and nudged him a little bit. I'd like to arouse you from your slumber at this point. Excuse me, we have a situation. I don't believe that, and I don't mean to be irreverent at all, but I don't believe for a minute that if the waves, this great storm wouldn't wake him up, and if the wind wouldn't wake him up, and if the fact that he was soaking wet from the waves didn't wake him up, a little excuse me on his shoulder wouldn't wake him up. He was hearing this, Jesus, wake up! Get him! See, I can hear people from the other boats going, what is he doing? Where is he? He's what? You know, I don't know if it's connected yet. This is fun. This is a fun story. I don't know if it's connected yet, but when I first, this story dawned on me and what it was following, this concept of leaving the shore and paying the price, you know, I'm going to leave the shore, no turning back, and then the storm hits. This whole dynamic, I see my whole spiritual pilgrimage flash in front of my eyes. Has this ever happened to you? As soon as you obey God and you go out on a limb and you really know that the going out on a limb was something he called you to do, don't go out on limbs that God didn't tell you to go out on, okay? Because I don't know if you're going to get a whole lot of support if he didn't tell you to do it. But when you know he called you to go and he told you to move, it's amazing how many times I've gotten out there, I'm out there, I'm all exhilarated, and all of a sudden I look back and I go, where did he go? I don't hear his voice is clear anymore. I don't, I'm not as sure about this as I was a week ago. And I wonder if he's asleep. And right now, the mediocrity and the apathy and the impotence of the shore looks real good. And see, when I left the shore, I was kind of ridiculing those people who didn't want to go. I love them, but I was kind of saying, hey, you're missing the boat. It's over for you. We love you. You're in the kingdom, but man, you're going to really miss it. And now I'm going, this was really ill-advised to do this. We should have stayed on the shore. And then Jesus in verse 26 rose and he said two things. Why are you timid? How would you respond to that? Why are you timid? Again, I don't want to be irreverent, but you've got to stick yourself in the boat. The waves are all over. Why are you timid? Silly me. You know, we're dying. That's why I'm timid. Do you see the waves? Earth to Jesus, you know. Hello. We're going to die and you wonder why I'm afraid. And then he says this, Oh, men of little faith. Don't you love it when you're dying and people get spiritual on you? Oh, you have little faith. Where's your faith? Jesus. I'm all for faith. I believe in faith. I preach faith. but this is real life. There's something there for us to get right there. You see, I love talking about faith and hearing about faith, and I believe it, and it moves in my spirit. When I hear about it on Sunday morning, and when I hear it on a calm sea, and when I'm sitting on a hillside in Galilee, and you're talking about faith and the Beatitudes, man, my heart is just blessed, and I leap, and I follow you anywhere, and I do even get into the boat. But you're talking about faith in the storm. Is there faith in the middle of it? Is there peace in the middle of it? Is there somehow a way that there is to be rest in the middle of it? That does not connect with how I live. Confrontation there. Hear it. There's something being offered and we're going to connect it a little bit later. There's a lesson in there about that that's powerful. And then in verse 26, He arose, rebuked the winds in the sea, and it became perfectly calm. And the men marveled, saying, what kind of man is this? Did even the winds in the sea obey him? Why did they marvel? I think they marveled, first of all, because of the miracle. I mean, I've seen him do lepers. I've seen him do paralytics. I've seen him do all sorts. I've seen him do demons. But even the wind is subject to his authority. This is God, for one thing. But I think there's something else and very practical and very exciting. And something that is a dynamic you need to catch in your own walk with God. I think, again, you've got to picture these guys leaving the shore. Everybody who said they were following didn't come, but they did. Leaving the shore, feeling a little bit like us sometimes when we obey God. I have just gone deeper. I really do understand. And I am willing to pay the price. And then the price got higher, you see. The price got higher. And you thought you were going to die. And all of a sudden, you calm the winds. And what you marveled at was not just that he calmed the winds, but when you thought at one time you knew it all and you knew what it meant to follow him, after this episode, you're sitting there like a little baby, quivering, saying, I don't know if I know anything about what it means to follow him. I'm right back at square one. Broken, mourning, hungry for more. I don't know if you see this. This is incredible because he keeps bringing you back. And he keeps bringing you deeper and deeper and deeper. And when you step out, he's going to go deeper. And you step out again, he's going to go deeper. What a picture. Just in telling you the story, I'm sure there's applications, and it could nourish you and confront you in many fronts. Let me just share with you some of the connections I've made, the things I think I want you to see. First of all, I want you to see the panic of the storm, some things about that. I want us to see the predictability of the storm and some hooks that you can put some of our thinking on. I want you to understand the peace of the storm and also the promise in the middle of the storm. Let's look at the panic first. Two things about the panic I want you to see. First of all, it's normalcy. It's normalcy. These guys panicked. They had all sorts of faith. They were really the elite. But when the storm hit, they went to pieces. There is a comfort in this for me and for you. The comfort is this. That if you are believing God and if you are stepping out on limbs, And then somewhere along the line, the wave gets so big that you can't handle it, and you panic, and you lose sight of God, and you lose sight of His care, and you really have a hard time believing it anymore. That does not mean you have forever been put on the ash heap of ineffectiveness in the kingdom. It is a normal thing. In fact, we're going to find out in a minute that it's almost a necessary thing to become dependent even more at a deeper level. You need to know that when you panic doing the work of the kingdom, you are in pretty good company. Let me bring you back to the Old Testament. Isaiah, the prophet, 51, verse 9. Now, this guy was a limb-goer out on her. He went out a lot. If there ever was one, he did it. Obeyed God, no matter the cost, no matter what anybody said. But you know what? Sometimes he got scared, And sometimes the voice of God was not quite as clear as it was last week when he went. And he came to God not pretending that everything was okay. He came with his heart the way it really was. He says this in chapter 51, verse 9. Awake, God, awake. Put on the strength. Put on strength, O arm of the Lord. God, you are God. Put on your strength. Why are you sleeping? Awake as in the days of old. I like that. You know what? We always get on people today because they're always talking about the good old days. I've even said that. Oh, quit talking about what God used to do. God works now. It comforts me to realize that Isaiah had problems sometimes. I believe Isaiah is saying here, you used to work in power. I would like to see it now. I would like to see it today. That tension we feel is something every man and woman of God has felt. We have trouble believing Him for the moment. Do what you used to do in days of old. Did you retire? What? Are you sleeping? What? Psalm 44, 22, David, the psalmist, says this, Lord, for thy sake, we are being killed all day long. We are considered sheep to be slaughtered. We got in the boat, David is saying, We followed you. We're being slaughtered. And it's because we obeyed you. Arouse thyself. Wake up. Are you sleeping? Why do you sleep, O Lord? We're going to die. I don't know if that ministers to you, but it does to me. What it ministers to me is how real it is, how human it is, how somehow normal it is to have times when I have stepped out in faith, believing God, and then my frailty gets exposed all over the place. Elijah defeated the prophets of Baal in a powerful way. Jezebel goes, boo, and he's ready to kill himself. This is really good for me. I have to laugh. One of the things I'm aware of in our church is that most of what you see, most of what the mass of the people in our church see about our church is what they see on Sunday morning. But you know what? What goes on here is not pretend. It really isn't. This is not some big show that we try to make look really good. We want to be the God and the power of God. And the fact is, most of the time when I'm here on Sunday and I experience the worship and the Word of God comes, it's victory day for us. This is the day we're supposed to beat the devil to death. We just go wham, wham, wham, wham. The sword is out. Wham-o. Everybody leaves going, wow. And I leave going, boy, bless God, and it lasts for a day. It's great. And then the waves start to come, see? And we're leaving the shore. But all week long, what happens to us happens to you. You walk out the door and the waves start to hit. And sometimes as the waves hit you, just like when they hit me or anybody else, sometimes you hang on and you're believing God the whole time and you don't get into striving and paddling and rowing and trying to keep your head above water. You go right to God and you go, God, I can't do this. You're going to have to do this. I'm broken. You just work through this. And there's rest and peace. And sometimes it doesn't go like that. See, sometimes you panic, and sometimes I panic, and you lose it, and you feel like you're going to die. Let me bring you to a meeting. We had a governing board or a ministry team meeting. Delightful time. There's a feeling among us that as a church, we've left shore. We're kind of moving out, and and doing what God wants us to do. And people are coming, and that's an exciting thing. When we had the Wednesday night thing, and 600-some people, wow, boy, that's great. But as people come, some of the good things also represent hard things and wave kinds of things because as the people come, demands are greater, and resources haven't changed that much, and the resources feel few, and it feels like the water is coming over the side of the boat, and we're going to sink. And we start talking about all sorts of wonderful things that we don't talk about on Sunday morning. We start talking about the space and the problem we've got putting all the people in. Where are we going? We're not going to stay like this. It's going to continue to grow. If it's alive, it's going to continue to grow. Where are we going to put people? And then we get a little letter from Cooper High School here. This is delightful. And I'm telling you this to scare all of you. One of the Sunday school rooms got kind of messed up and didn't get cleaned up right. And so we got a letter saying, if that happens again, blah, blah, blah, kind of thing. We're going to review this whole thing and see if this open door is going to be able to stay in this building. And we're going, ha, that's good news. We're sitting on a bubble. It could pop tomorrow. We're going to save 1,500 people. We're going to meet out in the parking lot, I suppose. I don't know. You know, Lord, we've gone out in the boat. We've left that other building. You're going to have to take care of us. Are you asleep or what? Finances, ministry needs, more and more people. not getting to everybody we need to one of the big issues tuesday night and this is going to sound maybe like a small thing but it's not a small thing it's how these waves they go wham wham wham you know one right after another and by the way i'm sharing you mine you've got your own but a press went out the thing the bulletin is done on and all these materials in a newsletter all these 90,000 pieces of literature a week or something right a million okay no That's a month. It doesn't matter. The press is out. $11,000. Another wave. You're going to die. You're going to go under. And here we are, a whole bunch of godly men and women paddling and bailing like you've never seen. Tension between us. And it really became a gift because it led right into this text. I learned some things from that meeting and we did together and I want to share it with you. I think there's some dynamics that happen when the waves start coming over the boat. And I want to share them with you. One of the first things that happens to me when the waves start coming into the boat and no matter how much I paddle, the water keeps coming, one of the first things that happens is I become very aware of my inadequacy. I don't like that. You see, no matter how much I'm bailing and how much I'm rowing, the water is still coming in. That makes people very tired. The second thing that happens is this. You see, after a while, I get tired of looking at my inadequacy. So what I'm going to do is start looking at yours. Get it? Listen, I am paddling and bailing and my fingers are numb. What are you doing? And we were doing this to each other at the staff meeting. Not out loud, but that was the dynamic. You know how that works. You do that to your wife. You do that to your husband. You do that to your kids. You do that at work. I'm doing it. What are you doing? Okay. we're going to die and it's my fault I'm sick of that, it's your fault the third one on my hit list is God oh boy are you going to tell me that you don't believe in his adequacy no, I'm not no way see the truth is I don't know if he's adequate or not he's sleeping that's so right there but you know what that leads me to the second thing about panic not only it's normalcy but it's necessity what do you mean well let me just take my kind of person what do you think it would take for the kind of person who got in the boat to cling desperately to Jesus and nothing else the kind of person who got in the boat is a doer the kind of person who got in the boat is willing to accept a challenge the kind of person who got in the boat is willing to make the commitment and leave comfort security and people no matter what i will do it and the kind of person who got in the boat is when the trouble comes they bail and they row like nobody's business and i'm going to tell you right now the only thing i know that's going to get that guy to quit his driving and quit his bailing and quit his rowing and desperately cling to jesus is a wave that he can't handle because I can guarantee you if the storm was a bad storm and the waves got big and they bailed and they rowed and they were able with their bailing and with their rowing to keep the water out they would have given God all the glory but it would have had nothing to do with God it would have been all them and they would have never learned about cease striving know that I am God and even if you die I am with you Psalm 46 says that be still and that means cease striving and know that I am God quit your bailing and quit your rowing and come to me hang on to me but we might die you're right you might see you can't even hang on to life if you're going to hang on to Jesus you know what that does it brings you deeper you've left the shore now you're going to leave the boat now you're going to leave this world and it's only going to be me are you still wanting to come you hear him? he gets deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper some do some don't this would be a real good time to bail out and go back to the shore it's real important that you catch this picture of the disciples who the lesson here was not to work harder but to quit all of that and come to Jesus. And that is, believe me, I know how hard that is to stop. To stop the striving. One of the things that happened at that meeting, near the end we got giddy. We started to pray and I think God began to minister and this text, I brought this text in it kind of reminded me of what was going on and it became a gift to us and we began to get giddy and we thought what's going to have to make us okay is not even that the storm goes away and I was like, okay, now we learn the lesson okay, make it go away now we learn the lesson but you know, it is deeper than that it's Jesus alone and we even talked about the fact I hope this doesn't scare you but it's a very liberating thing if you can get this I can't hang on to and we can't hang on to what we're looking to for security if it's anything other than Jesus and that includes this church and that includes things going great. And what if the whole thing does fall apart? What's going to make you okay then? It's going to have to be Jesus. You know what? That's good news. That's good news. And now I'm supposed to say, but don't worry because everything's not going to fall apart. We're going to follow Jesus no matter what. predictability the panic of the storm the predictability of the storm I've kind of already said this I just want to give this for a hook what that simply means is this if you leave the shore and get out of the boat you need to know he's going to call you deeper he's going to call you deeper he's going to the storm is going to come again I've already said this but the scene is simply this it started on the hillside where the sermon was nice everybody liked it then he moved away you're still gonna come then he left the shore foxes of holes birds have nests you still want to come then the storm came, he quieted the storm. Do you still want to come? You know in Matthew 14 the storm continues. Matthew 14 another storm happens. The same sea, it's the same disciples on and on. But you know what? This time it is different. He keeps changing the rules. You're going to have to trust him no matter what. He's not in the boat this time. And instead of being in the boat for them to go to, they're on their own. They're going to die. Jesus comes to them on the water in the storm. And this time of all things, they've already left the shore. They've already believed him in the storm. And now he's going to this time say, okay, you got in the boat. You believe in me in the storm. Now get out of the boat. Peter said, Lord bid me come. Jesus said, come. He had not calmed the storm. The waves were all over the place. Peter, like an idiot, gets out of the boat. It was so funny. This concept dawned on me right after church Sunday morning. We were up here. Lelana and Dave Busby came up to me and they were talking about last week's talk of getting into the boat. And Luana was laughing. She goes, it's just like Jesus. As soon as he says, get in the boat, we're going to get in the middle of the lake. I just know what he's going to say. Okay, everybody, out of the boat. And it is just like him. He's going to call you deeper. And he's going to call you deeper. You still want to go? You still want to go now? You still want to go now? Because I want it all. San Francisco did a song. He doesn't want Sundays and Wednesday nights. He doesn't want little, you know, token things of affection. He wants it all, the life. Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, when Jesus calls a man, he bids him come to die. It is fun, though, how he takes you step by step. He'll start to get you to shore, get you in a lake, where you can't do nothing. if you want smooth sailing and cozy comfort do drugs or something don't do this don't do drugs you know somebody's going to take that in my sermon and put it on TV he said you know find something that's going to make you peace And all that wonderful stuff. We're going to talk about peace in a minute, but it's not like that. It's not numbing. Because if you follow Jesus, he's going to call you deeper and he's going to knock all the pins out. But you need to also understand that when he knocks all the pins out and when he calls you deeper and you follow, he will not only knock the pins out, he will demonstrate the power of the kingdom to those who are desperately dependent. Get this picture. The people who left the shore experienced the storm in the middle of that lake that the people who stayed on the shore did not have to go through. So it might have been better to stay on the shore. But let me tell you something else that the people who went through the storm got that they didn't get. These people got to see the almighty hand of God stretch out over those waters and go, Be still. And it stopped. And I want to tell you something else about Peter who got out of the boat while the other ones didn't get out of the boat. Peter sank and almost drowned. and the people who stayed in the boat didn't almost drown. But you know what Peter got that they didn't get? Peter walked on water. So right in the middle of your panic and your failure, if it's because you followed God, there is also the power of God right there. Every time. And there is something very exhilarating about that. And when I hear about the abundant life, that feels like the abundant life. But he is going to make you desperately dependent every step of the way. And that is the act of a gracious, loving Father who wants to keep demonstrating His power to His church by bringing them to dependence, by once in a while sending a wave they can't handle. I would like to think that God's going to meet all of our needs as far as space. We're going to be here. It's really no big deal. But we need to remember this talk when, if it happens someday, we don't have a place to stay. What's going to make us okay then? God's going to have to intervene. You know, Rick Linnell said that at that meeting. I don't even remember what it was about. The statement was this. I'll tell you the impact it had on me. He said this. I don't know, but if God doesn't intervene, directly intervene, this just isn't going to work. I'm not even sure what he was talking about. When he said that, you know what it did to me initially? It made me sick. I went, oh, oh. I mean, is it that bad? That we'll need God, direct intervention? How often does he do that? And all of a sudden, I got a picture of a rower and a baler. That's me. And I got a picture of a gracious Savior in sleep in the boat saying, Jesus is driving, Dave. I am God. It's not your church anyway. That's getting deeper and deeper and deeper. by the way there's something else i want to just interject here one of the pictures i've painted i think is that if you go and follow jesus there's going to be a storm if you stay on the shore no storm not true if you go and follow jesus there will be a storm if you stay on the shore there's going to be a different storm okay what you're going to have to deal with if you stay on the storm is the storm of knowing that you're living in mediocrity disobedience and impotence knowing that like the one disciple who said i got to make sure all my friends like this knowing that you are going to be the victim of people's opinions all your life that is quite a storm friend i don't think the safety of the shore is all that safe i'd rather be there any day jonah had a storm okay but his storm wasn't because he went out on a limb believing god he had a storm because he was running the other way god gave him a storm you're going to get a storm either way. Pick. The glory of this storm is this. Jesus is in the boat right there. That leads me to the third thing, the peace in the middle of the storm. The picture of a sleeping Jesus is one that initially irritates us. We find it irksome. What are you doing? Have you forgotten us? David felt that. Isaiah felt that. I have felt that and so have you. The picture seems to be that of an uncaring, detached, insensitive God. That is not the picture that Matthew intends, although I think he knows that in the flesh we'll look at that and see that. The picture that is being contrasted here is a bunch of disciples paddling and rowing and desperately trying to work it out themselves and getting nowhere, and a Jesus who is at peace in the middle of the storm. Here's the message of that. One of the things that my soul needs desperately is to know that somewhere along the line I can find peace and rest in the middle of the storm. The reason my soul needs that so much is because if I cannot find some measure of peace in the middle of a storm, some measure of internal rest while the storm is raging, if I can't find that, then I'm not going to have much peace because the storm is raging most of the time, doesn't it seem? of some sort. And if my peace is contingent on no waves, not much peace, is there some spirit-induced, God-delivered internal peace that I can know while people are upset, while things aren't going well, when my kids aren't doing well, when the money isn't coming in? Philippians talks about peace that passes understanding. There are certain kinds of peace I can understand, and so can you. Say it this way. If I've got money in the bank, funny how I have peace about my finances. Isn't that something? But that's a peace I can understand. Why do I have the peace? Well, because the money's in the bank. If my kids are doing well, and they're behaving, and they look good, and they're happy, and they marry the right guy or the right gal, and they don't have any pain, and they're healthy, it's amazing how much peace I have about my kids. But that's a peace I can understand, because they're doing great. it's amazing how when people like me or people like you and they're saying all sorts of nice things how much peace you have about yourself why well because they're saying nice things about you and they like you and that's a piece i can understand i'll tell you what you need a piece and so do i that is an internal rest even when the kids aren't doing well the wife isn't doing well the husband isn't doing well the job isn't secure and the money isn't in the bank and the waves are swamping the boat. And I got the news for you that that kind of peace comes when the waves maybe have gotten so big that you can't even hang on to the boat anymore because the boat's disappearing and all you got left is Jesus. And you know what? For an awful lot of us, that sounds real grandiose and far off. It really sounds far off until the boat starts to sink. Until you don't have any other gods to hang on to. That's why it's the broken who come. Because they've lost their money. They can't hang on to that anyway. They've lost their kids. They can't hang on to that anyway. And all they've got is Jesus. If you're hanging on to your money for your peace, hope you keep your money. If you're hanging on to your kids and how they look and stuff and how they're doing for your peace, boy, I hope they don't trip and break their legs. We're hanging on to this church really being a neat place for our peace. Hope no waves come. We're hanging on to Jesus and Him alone as your source of value and identity and peace. And His presence is enough. The waves can keep on moving and God can give you peace in here. In here. The promise of the storm. The promise of the storm. He rose, rebuked the winds, became calm, and then marveled. The promise of that is, I don't think, that he's going to calm the storm every single time. I think the promise that I want you to hear is this. I am the Lord of the storm. Would you hear Jesus say that to you right now? Whatever storm you're in, would you hear that? I am the Lord of the storm. Not only am I the Lord of the storm to such a degree that by a spoken word I can bring the column C. But I even govern how big those waves get. Let me explain that for a minute. I have a point in that I want to get. One of the things we say around here, I'm kind of giving you the flip side of a two-sided coin. And one of the sides we talk about a lot. It's this. If you step out of the boat and you believe God and you go out on a plateau or you go out on a limb and you really start doing the work of the kingdom, the first thing you can expect is all hell is going to break loose. I've said that. When you do the work of the kingdom, the enemy is going to begin to assault you. Jeff Hagen has a little cliche he uses all the time. If you're getting flack, you must be somewhere near the target. Okay? So if you're getting waves and all sorts of things are really kind of going on and there's rumblings, you must be doing something right because the enemy's coming. I think that is a true thing. One of the results of that is this. We start getting into all sorts of verbal battles with Satan. You know what I mean by that? I believe that we have authority on earth to come against Satan. So do not let what I'm saying water down that, needing to oppose the enemy. But we get into verbal battles with Satan. I command the waves to stop in Jesus' name. Stop the problems. You better know Jesus is the Lord of these storms. In Job's case, he let the head down. Satan, though he had power to do some things that didn't feel good, could not move one more inch past what God allowed. And then God moved under that and turned that thing to gold. Some of the waves we want to have go away are necessary for this body, for your family, for this person, and for this person. Some of those waves you want to have go away are necessary for you to go deeper and deeper and deeper in dependence on Him. And this all started when we started Matthew 5, blessed are the broken. It's worse than you thought, but it's better than you thought. and they marveled in the Luke account the word marvel there is not marvelous they were terrified it's interesting because up in verse 26 when the storm was going they were afraid, they were timid when God, when Jesus who is God come the storm. By the word of his power, they were terrified. Not just timid, they were terrified. One of the things I want to picture in your mind is this. When you leave the shore, believe God, go through the storm. He delivers. You're going to get a picture of God you never saw before. And you know what it's going to do? It's going to make you low. It's going to bring you low. It's going to humble you. I hear Isaiah, in the year the king Uzziah died, says this. He saw God. And when he saw God, he said, woe is me, for I am undone, and I am a man of unclean lips, and I live in a land of people who've got unclean lips. And then God reached down and touched his tongue and purified it and said, you have been made pure, speak the truth. But the initial response to the presence of God was a breaking, oh God, this is really you. Let me tell you why the disciples are going to hang on to Jesus now. Because I'm going to hang on to Jesus, because he's going to make all the wind go away and I'm never going to have any more pain. No, I'm going to hang on to Jesus now because he is God. And wherever he goes, I'm going. And whatever it leads me into, I will go through it. The promise is not all the waves go away. The promise is I am the Lord of the storm. I will bring you through and I might even bring you through death. Good news, huh? You know that these disciples, though they went into a storm and came out the other end, there was later a time in the life of every one of them but one, a time when a storm came into their lives because of their following of the master, who is their king Jesus, and the storm did not go away. But the king, who is God, who is the ruler of this universe, was the one they were clinging to so much so that they not only let go of the boat they let go of their life every one of them died a martyr's death in hebrews 11 we have the the the faith chapter and it says this and and time would fail me if i was going to tell you about samson and barack and jephthah who did all these incredible things by hanging on to god and believing god they did wonderful things they conquered kingdoms they shut the mouths of lions women received their sons as as if it were back from the dead. God in power was moving because they hung on to Jesus. But without skipping a breath, he goes on and says, some were sawn in two, however. Others were tortured. Some didn't accept their release. They hung on to Jesus, not just because he calmed the storm, but when he calmed the storm and the power of God was displayed, this is God. I'm going with him no matter where he ghost and no matter what it means I'm hanging on to him for dear life even if it means death let's pray Lord I find this text wonderfully encouraging amazingly timely not only in the flow of the text but in my life personally in the life of the church and I thank you for words like this that encourage us at the same time, don't sugarcoat it. God, we don't know what you're calling us into. But Father, as much as we know how to say it right now to you, we're willing to go through it. And the biggest thing we want is to be able to hang on to you, no matter what. Pray that you would brand this into our minds and hearts and make it a real thing for us in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
