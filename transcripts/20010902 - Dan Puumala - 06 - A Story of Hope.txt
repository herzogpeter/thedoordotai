I think most of you know at Communion Sundays, we kind of change the order of things and bring the word in kind of an earlier time in the service than normal. As we have been speaking these last weeks, as most of you know, about disordered sexuality, among the vitally important messages that I think we need to communicate is that God has the power to reorder what has been disordered, not only in the arena of sexuality, but in anything. We just happen to be talking about sexuality these weeks, that God can heal what has been broken. And I believe that among the best ways to communicate the reality that God can reorder what has been disordered is with story. The power of story, I believe, is incredible. real life, flesh and blood examples of how the amazing grace of God can restore what has been broken. Dan Pumala is going to be coming this morning. In fact, he's not going to be coming. He's here to speak to us this morning and sharing our story. Now, one of the things that I've been kind of pointing out the last few weeks as we've been dealing in particular with sexuality is that around disordered sexuality, there is a lot of shame and there's a lot of silence. The silence is because there's a lot of shame. and as we were talking about how could we come up with a flesh and blood story it's like who is going to, because there's so much shame around sexual things who could we get to talk about that? We got him. And the only reason he's sharing this is because he's the only one who will talk. It's really not that his story is even that compelling. See? It's incredibly compelling. And it is a celebration of amazing grace. One of the reasons that we did want Dan to come and share is because of his story. But also, Dan is one of us. It's not like you can pull somebody in from the outside and they tell us an amazing story. And I think that's good. I'm not saying we won't ever do that. But part of the power of your word, Dan, is that you are one of our sons. You are one of our men. And you have come through the ministry of this church. And you are us. And your struggle is our struggle. Dan has been a part of Open Door for 26 years. Came to Open Door as a 16-year-old kid to a high school youth group. He'll tell you a little bit about that. In fact, last night, as we were kind of getting ready in the Crystal Building, Dan reminded me of something I forgot. That 20 years ago when I came to Open Door, the first person I baptized as the pastor of this church was Dan. So that was just totally weird. And you recovered. You got over that, and you're okay now. Okay. You finally let me up. I finally let you up, yeah. I held you under for quite a long time, as I recall. Yeah. Dan right now is the executive director of Outpost Ministries. Outpost Ministries is a discipleship ministry committed to helping young men and women walk away from homosexuality the way Dan, by the power of amazing grace, was able to walk away himself. I would like to pray for Dan as he comes to the pulpit. Let's pray. Father, first of all, I thank you for him again. Thank you for not just the courage of speaking this morning, though I do thank you for that. I thank you for the courage that is the mark of his story. The critical times in his life when he found himself in the dark places, in the dying places, when he could have easily chosen to stay there and maybe no one would have noticed and even left him be. He chose to come into the light. to feel even the initial pain of coming into the light, but he found their life and joy and freedom and amazing grace. God, I pray for him. The three things we have kind of been praying for him and for this service in all of these services, that, God, you would put in him a sword that is sharp and that, Father, from his mouth would come a sword that is sharp, that is dividing and uncompromising, exposing and revealing, but God, that that sharp sword be wielded with great compassion and that this entire time be flooded with amazing grace. A sword that's sharp, compassion that is great, and grace that is amazing. I pray these things in your name. Amen. God bless you. well it is a special honor for me to be here to address my church my congregation my family and I'm really grateful for this opportunity I did grow up in a Christian family here in the Twin City area and I found out recently that my family had been Christians for over 100 years for sure, and that a long Christian heritage was something that God had given me. I wasn't always so grateful for it when I was younger, but I did have a home that God was honored in, and I was taught to obey God, to love Him, and to follow His commandments. In fact, when I was in Sunday school in second grade, we learned the Ten commandments, and I was particularly happy to find out there was only ten of them because I was very rule-oriented, and so, and I was very compliant, and I thought, oh, this, this I can do. I can obey the Ten Commandments and make God happy with me, and that was pretty good news for me. Now, the law is not usually good news for people, but I was a legalist, and so there was only ten things. I had trouble with one of the commandments very early on, and that was the commandment about adultery, thou shalt not commit adultery. I didn't know what the word meant. I didn't understand the broader ramifications of it, but I also knew that I couldn't ask the question, what is that? What does that mean? And so I didn't ask the question, and I kind of took an inventory of my life at that point and realized I had no guilt about anything else, but I had a question mark about this. And what I struggled with was some of the childhood games that I played that was involved with a lot of secrecy, a lot of don't tell anybody. There was kind of excitement about it, and there was guilt also associated with that. And I thought that what it meant was that I couldn't continue on. I thought the word thou shalt not commit adultery meant I couldn't play these games with girls. But I decided that if I played them with boys only that I could be obeying God, and that would be a good thing. I now have called that my early theological precedent for homosexuality because what it did was it made me isolate who my friends were and think that there was something wrong somehow. with the other or with girls. Well, these kinds of games continued until puberty hit, and puberty hit with a vengeance. And I was very shocked and surprised and bewildered by it all. I didn't know what to expect. I certainly was very naive about the biology of human sexuality. And one day when it happened, I was like, okay, what we're doing here is really bad. It's really wrong. It's really awful, and we're never, ever going to do this again, so go away. And indeed, I was building a wall there between me and my peers, and I discovered that the excitement and the pleasure I could make happen on my own. So I dove deeper into isolation already. I went to Bible camp when I was in junior high, and I tried to kind of confess this, as I was coming to Christ and received Christ as my personal Savior. And I really didn't get much answers. I really didn't come into a full understanding of what was really happening. And so it wasn't until I kept pursuing my relationship with God, and it wasn't until I was about 16 years old that I came to Church of the Open Door because I met some of the kids in the youth group that I went to high school with. And they seemed to really love God, and that was really, really cool. That was really important for me. And so I started coming to Church at the Open Door, and we all were like on fire for the Lord. We wanted to, you know, worship him. We wanted to witness and bring the rest of the world into alignment with the good news. And so when we graduated from high school, we all went away to college, to Christian college, to Bible school to prepare for ministry so that we could save the world. We were young, we were enthusiastic, and we were idealistic. A side agenda for me for going to the Christian college was because I was so afraid of what might happen to me in a secular university in terms of my sexual struggle. And I thought that I'd be entering a safe place. However, a year and a half into my college career, I recognized that this was not necessarily a safe place when a fellow came to my room and started asking me all kinds of questions. And it was before I understood about boundaries, and it was before I understood about privacy issues, and I couldn't deny that I'd struggled with my sexuality. And what began that day as a kind of an excitement secret turned into a sexual relationship with that other male student that lasted until college graduation. Now at graduation, I recognized a couple of things that were happening. Number one, it seemed like all my friends were getting married. And number two, they had some place to go. I didn't know what to do or where to go, and I knew that I was struggling more intensely now with my homosexuality than ever before. So I decided that I would go into the ministry because pastors, of course, don't struggle with homosexuality. So I went into the ministry, became a youth pastor and a music director, and things went pretty well. I literally poured my life into my work and my relationship with God. And about a year and a half after I got there, we had a student intern, and he and I became fast friends. And pretty soon, we had a real guilt problem on our hands because how do you reconcile sex on Saturday night with worship on Sunday morning? And we were leading both. well he had a convenient excuse to leave and that was school was starting and I recognized if I went back to school that would be a really good thing part of that was a big cover-up because it would be an easy out for me just kind of quietly leave not make waves don't tell anybody what's really going on and it would look really good because you know god bless him he's going on to seminary. And so I did. I moved across the country and I started seminary. And almost immediately the same thing happened again. And I became very exasperated with God. And I was like, God, what do I have to do to get rid of this thing? I felt like I was doing everything that I could possibly have done. And I didn't get an answer right away. So I made up an answer. And the answer that I came up with was, well, I know, I'll start dating women because you can't be gay if you're with a girl. So by the end of the school year, Katie and I had definitely become an item, and I was thinking this is pretty good. Unfortunately, she graduated at the end of that year and went overseas and became a missionary, and the wheels of my thinking started turning as I recognized, you know, if I become a missionary, I'll really be it. And somehow God will be obligated to take away all my struggles. Now, you can hear in that some false hope and some false ideas about what it means to serve God and to love God. God does not take your problems away when you serve Him. And indeed, I was looking very much forward to my future. So I finished seminary two years later and went overseas to visit her, and we got engaged to be married. And there's a wonderful whole story about the romance that happened there. I don't have time to tell you about that, but I remember coming back and going straight to my 10-year high school reunion after that trip, and I told everybody, I'm on top of the world. I just graduated with my master's degree. I just got engaged to be married. I just took a vacation in Europe, and I got a great job offer on the East Coast, and things are really going my way. And unfortunately, I fell right into what the world does at every, at what everybody does at the 10-year reunion, and I just really bragged and boasted about myself. During the next 12 months, almost exactly everything that I had had started to fall away. The first one was this fabulous job that I had, I had to work with people in this job. And whenever you work with people, there are going to be problems. So I didn't get along with my boss, which is a significant thing when there's only two people working for a church. And I kept thinking, well, you know, pretty soon Katie and I will be married, and then I'll have someone to talk to. And besides that, this is all just temporary anyway. And so I kind of just put off dealing with the difficulty. Secondly, Katie broke off our relationship suddenly without warning and for no apparent reason. And I didn't understand what was going on. Certainly there were things that she did not understand as well because that's what she told me. She knew about my struggles and she grew up in California and she said, I've heard about that, homosexuality. No big deal. I can handle that. That's not it. Well, that was a real shock to me because I didn't know what to do when I got back to my job. So I just went deeper and deeper into my job and became pretty much workaholic and so forth and so on. And finally, I couldn't handle it anymore. And I went to talk to the pastor and I said, what would you think about me going to some other church? And he said, that'd be great because today we want you to resign. And I was like, okay, I quit. And off I went. However, what happened really was I collapsed in not too pretty of a sight, literally in my parents' basement for about three months, and I couldn't do anything. I didn't know who I was anymore I wasn't in the ministry I didn't know what I liked or what I disliked or what I wanted in life because nothing tasted good to me I was very very much alone and at probably one of the lowest points in my life I recognized the obsessive compulsive nature of my sexual struggles and the isolation and loneliness that happened at the same time and I decided to invite another person in there with me. And so I did. I had a sexual affair with another man who also went to Church of the Open Door. And unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it at the moment, he could not handle the guilt. I could, of course. I was used to that. I'd been doing that for years. But he couldn't, and this was many, many years ago, and he went to talk to Dave Johnson and said, this is what's going on with Dan. And I knew that this spelled the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning or something in my life because now all of a sudden I realized I was forced to make a decision. I was either going to decide to leave my church, leave my career, leave my God and my family, get a gay lover, find an apartment and an orange VW Beetle and get on with my life. Or I would face the music and I would deal with this issue once and for all. I would confess it as sin and allow God to do whatever he had to do with me no matter what. That was a very, very difficult decision to make and some of you have been in positions where you've had to make decisions like that. I decided that I would go talk to Dave. I could not leave my relationship with God. I was too embarrassed really to tell my family why I would be leaving them. So I went to talk to Dave and I said, it's true, everything you've heard about me, and I don't know what to do about it. And Dave asked me a very simple question, and that is, do you want to change? Well, I thought about it for a nanosecond, and I realized my whole life had been about wanting to change. There was Bible school, there was the ministry, there was seminary, there was marriage, there was the mission field, and I was climbing the spiritual ladder of success trying to achieve my own healing, and nothing was working. I wanted desperately to change, and I went to great lengths to accomplish that. So I said, yes, Dave, I do want to change. And Dave said to me, life-changing words, and that was, we can walk through this thing together. And I knew that what he meant was not that he was going to hold my hand and take me to my counseling appointments and make everything okay, but that I could be here at Church of the Open Door and struggle with sin and come out the other side, one of the body. That meant so much to me. It was the first time an influential man in my life had ever given me that kind of affirmation or acceptance or support. So I did. I went to a counselor. He put me in a group of men who struggled with their sexuality. This was not a pretty group of men. There were men who had just been released from prison for sex offenders. There were men that struggled with every conceivable sexual problem that you can imagine. And God said, Dan, these are your people, and you are one of them. And I went there, and I shared my story with them, and I found out that I, indeed, I was very, very much like them. I was a human being, and I needed help, and that was okay. And I needed to know that I was not alone in the midst of this battle. One day, one of the fellows said to me, I wish we could trade places. I thought, you're crazy. Why would you ever want to struggle with a socially unacceptable issue like homosexuality? And he said, oh, but you have it so much easier than I do. Look at the mess my life is in. This fellow told me that he had sex with as many women as possible because he wanted to prove to himself that he was a real man. And I just thought that was so odd because I had sex with men because I wanted to prove to myself that I was just like these men. and God used that relationship powerfully in my life to confirm that I was one of these people called men well we started a support group because we thought it would be cool that all these Christians would get together and this was before we had boundaries at Church of the Open Door and on Wednesday nights on Wednesday nights we had the book of Matthew class praying in the spirit class men's sexual addiction and, you know, underwater basket weaving or whatever. And the names of the classes were all printed on the doors. So if you ever wanted to walk into one of these classes, you had to make a pretty big commitment. So I did that because I knew, remember, it was going to be whatever God had for me I would do because I knew he loved me and I knew he could heal me if I obeyed him. So I did that. About a year later, I finally went to Outpost Ministries. Nine years after I first heard about Outpost, I went to Outpost. I had so much shame and fear about confronting the issue of homosexuality that I couldn't even bear being in a place where other Christians were dealing with this issue. And because I was so enmeshed in my identity as a church boy or as a pastor or as a man of the cloth, whatever you want to call it, I also didn't know how I fit in with the rest of culture and society. And so I became a full-fledged groupaholic and joined a 12-step anonymous group. And there I found out, guess what? Wonder of wonders. Amazing, amazing as it is. I'm just like all of these other people who struggle with whatever it is that they're struggling with. And God really began to do a mighty work of healing. Well, I knew that as I grew, the relationships were going to need to develop as well. and I was going to need to come to a place where I was going to start talking about this with some other people in my life who were going to be there no matter what, namely my parents. So I hauled them into a therapy session with my counselor, and I sat them down, and I said, Mom, Dad, there's some things you need to know, and there's some things I need to know. And I told them about my struggle in about 13 seconds and then said, do you love me? I really needed to know that my relationship with them was based on truth and honesty and real love, not on them loving the image that I had so carefully constructed before them. I mean, I was their proud son. I was an ordained minister. I had a master's degree, blah, blah, blah, you name it. And there was this silence in the room. I can't understand why. But the therapist finally said, Mr. and Mrs. Pumala, your son has asked for your love and support. Is there anything that you can tell him? And my mom flew out of her chair and ran towards me, threw her arms around me, hugged me, and said, you're our son. That's never going to change. Of course we love and support you. Which is exactly what I needed mom to say. However, this was followed by another extended period of silence, which was so thick you could have cut it with a knife. And then the therapist said, Mr. Pumala, your son has asked you for some very important news from you. Can you love and support him knowing this about him? And my dad, in classic Minnesota style, kind of looked at the floor and said what she said, and that broke the tension and we could finally look at each other and say what's real and that was the beginning of my telling what was going on a couple years later they invited me to come on staff at Outpost and work with the ministry and I knew I was going to need to start telling other people because I had to partly raise my own support So I sent out 181 newsletters, and I told everybody that I ever knew that I thought cared one whit about me and said, this is what I struggle with. This is what God is calling to me. Can you support me in this? And the amazing thing happened was the apologies, the repentances, the begging forgiveness of those who, you know, told gay jokes or whatever in front of me. the love and the support became overwhelming. And I really knew that I was doing what God had always called me to do. So I was moving into ministry now, and I was starting to do public speaking, telling my story around the Twin City area in the upper Midwest. And pretty soon I started getting this question. Well, if you think God is healing you from homosexuality, how come you're not married? And I had to think about that, and I was like, well, you know, I don't know. So I went to talk with one of my colleagues in ministry, and he seemed to think that one of the problems that I was struggling with was this huge fear issue of relating to women. And so he said, Dan, you're afraid of making mistakes and getting hurt, and you've got to get over that. You've got to just get over that. And so I committed to him that I would go out there and I would make some mistakes. Now, I know he didn't suggest that I should go get some girl pregnant or anything like that. He wasn't talking about that kind of mistake. But I needed to be emboldened to go out there and start doing something. So I did. I asked three women out at the same time. And they all said yes. And then I had another problem to deal with, but I tried to ignore that, you know, like I'd always done. And pretty soon I chose one of the gals, and I got an amazing gift from her when I finally was able to begin to open up to her and share with her some of who I am. I discovered in that relationship that for a guy who had been exclusively attracted to members of his own sex, attraction to the other was possible because God was not only changing my behavior, he was changing who I was, and he was changing my passions and my desires. When it first hit me that this was happening, and it's really a great story, I wish I had more time to tell you that, I thought, oh my word, this is scary. And then I thought, no, this is normal. And then I thought, well, this might have been normal in seventh grade, but I'm 39. And really what happened was I treated that relationship like a seventh grader. And most seventh grade relationships last about, what, three months? And unfortunately, we broke up, and then I moved on from there. And there have been a number of things that God has shown me through the years, And I can't begin to explain them all to you because we just don't have time. I just want to say one more that I haven't even included on any of my other talks, and that is that about a year and a half, almost two years ago, my father died of a heart attack. And through that whole experience, God brought such amazing and powerful reconciliation between him and me. And the words were verbalized directly, I love you. I support you. And I had never heard that before and I longed my whole life to hear that. We as a church, we as a congregation can minister those kinds of words to each other. And it is through the Church of the Open Doors love and acceptance making a place for me very, in very literal terms, making a place for me to be who I am and struggle with what I struggle with, that I've been able to overcome homosexuality. I have not had any sexual contact with another man for over 13 years. I've overcome my struggles. Thank you. Thank you. My obsessive relationship with my self-pleasuring, as it were, has also been an issue that God has freed me from. It's been over five years. And people don't radically change their sexual behavior without a radical change from the inside out. And God has done that, and in very, very large part, because you have been here being who you are as Church of the Open Door. It is indeed through the body of the local congregation that God mediates and mitigates his healing to the body. And that is one reason why I'm so happy to be able to share my story of healing on a communion Sunday where we gather together around the table to talk about what God can do in each and every life that's represented here. I often end my talks by saying this. If God can heal me of my struggle with homosexuality, he can do anything he can touch you in that place in your life where you have been unable to bring into the light he can heal the broken parts of you one last word here before I turn it over to Dave and that is that I will never live my life as though the fact of homosexuality never existed in my life I have scars in my life because of that and I'm reminded of them from time to time. They'll itch or they'll hurt. There'll be some reminder about, yeah, that happened in my life, kind of like getting an appendectomy. When you're all done, you've got a scar on the outside, but guess what? Your insides are clean. And so my struggle with homosexuality is very similar. I'm clean inside. There's no poison in there anymore. God has rid me of that. But there probably are still things that are going to remind me of that from time to time. And in the case of your healing, there may be similar situations too. So I want to invite Dave to come and bring us to the table, to set the table as it were, to bring us all to a place where we can bring to the body of Christ what it is that we're struggling with. so that he can touch us and heal us. Amen. Thank you. Thank you, Dan, and thank you for that response as well. I'm going to ask the worship team to take their place and the communion stewards to come and join me up at the front as we prepare ourselves for the table. Just a word. You know, we've been in this series for some weeks and will be for a few more of disordered sexuality, and one of the things that I've given to you over these weeks is that as we've looked at different manifestations of what we're calling disordered sexuality, Some of those behaviors are what we would maybe call vile or disgusting. But I've always asked you as you look at these things to also add words like this, that they are marked by hunger and thirst and desperation. And that while we're talking about sexuality these days, the truth is that people who are hungry will look to anything to feed that hunger. And people who are thirsty will drink just about anything. Disordered sexuality is just one of those things. As we deal with this issue, some may not be struggling with things of a sexual nature. And maybe not of a homosexual nature. But the truth is that all of us, at one time or another, in one way or another, find ourselves drinking from a well that can't quench our thirst. and eating things that have no power to satisfy the hungers of our soul. And with that in mind, I find it very fitting that we come to the table. Because among other things, what the table says as we take the bread and we take the wine is this, that this is the bread. I am the bread that can satisfy the hunger of your soul. And I am the wine that can satisfy the thirst of your soul and bring to you the wine being a metaphor for, among other things, joy, the kind of joy your heart even hungers for. So the message of the table is come and eat and come and drink of the only adequate source of life and joy and the quenching of thirst. Another theme that has gone through this series, and we heard it powerfully this morning and all weekend from Dan, is the destructive power of secrets And how when we hold things in the dark, things that we hold in the dark are almost always, not almost, always, they are things we are ashamed of. But in the dark, those things grow in their power to grip us and enslave us, be it of a sexual nature or something else. And the invitation underneath these weeks, every week, though, again, the focus has been sexual things. The real message has been that when we bring into the light what we hide in the dark, it is there that we find the life, and it is there that we find amazing grace. And that's why the request I had for Dan in terms of prayer was that the sword would be sharp, the truth between what is right and wrong would be clear, but compassion would be real and grace would be amazing, that those three things would even be at work as we go to the table. Let's pray as we do that. Father, I thank you for Dan and his story. I thank you for how all of us can identify with it at this level that we hide things from you and from others, and those things spell death for us. And I thank you for your invitation to walk in the light and to experience from you the satisfaction of the deepest hungers of our heart and thirsts of our soul. May that reality be something we experience even as we come around the table this morning. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
