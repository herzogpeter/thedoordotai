Good morning. Our scripture reading today is from 1 Peter 2 and Ephesians 5. But you are chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. Be very careful then how you live, not as unwise, but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Lisa. So as it turns out, we're a people. A chosen people, no less. A people for God's own possession. And because that's true, people, be careful how you walk. Not as unwise, but as wise because the days are evil. And because the days are evil means, among other things, that the stakes are high. So be careful to walk as wise. And not just because if you walk as wise, you'll avoid all the evil. The real word there is to walk as wise, people of God, because we need to become an alternative to that evil. Because unless that happens, there really is no hope. Let's pray as we go to the word. For ears to hear what you are saying to our church and to the churches. I pray for courage to respond to what we hear. And for power that can only be generated by your spirit to become who you've called us to be. And to do what you've called us to do. I pray and I pray it in Jesus name. Amen. so who are we is the question we were asking before we took a break for advent some weeks ago but it wasn't just about us as a church it was really a bigger question about the church what is the church is what we were asking why are we here what is it that you're going to when you're going to a church do you go to church what kind of church is it a big church or a little church a Catholic or Lutheran church? Is it a conservative or a liberal church? Because I'm looking for a church, just the right kind of church. So what kind are you? Who are you? So who are we? Is the question we were asking and are returning to today, and while it's a pretty basic question, that ought to be obvious, at least to some, I think, because a church is a church. How different can they be? Actually, even if it is obvious to some and almost too basic to go into, we kind of think it's a pretty important question to ask and to answer and maybe to remember who we are as a church, particularly at this time in the life of our church, but not just our church. And this kind of occurred to me and got bigger during the week. It really isn't just our church, because I'm talking about the church, the big C church, where things are shifting and changing at a very rapid pace, because they're shifting and changing in the culture as well at a very rapid pace, such that most of us, without even knowing it consciously, are a little bit off balance, kind of all the time, and we don't even know it, just a little bit dizzy, which is maybe why Vicki's word last week for many of you. In fact, it was something that kind of grew during the week, struck such a deep chord. We were hearing things from people, Vicki especially, when she talked about the tyranny of time because we've become enslaved in many ways to chronos, what she called chronos time. Chronos time, if you were here, you remember this, is the chronological time, the time on your watch and it's going very fast and we're always trying to keep up and we never quite are, which means we're constantly missing out on kairos time, kairos, which would be moments of transcendence, moments of reality, moments of face-to-face experiences with God. So in this enslavement to time that's going so fast, we're prevented often from experiencing God, sometimes even from knowing God because time moves so fast, Things change so quickly, there's just no space. There's no time for face-to-face time. For the kind of time that could change you, for the kind of space that could actually transform you or touch the world around you. Think about it with me. The way things are changing and the speed with which it's happening. Because technology, for instance, has changed the face of things. It's changed the face of things in our culture. It's kind of obvious, but it's also changed the face of things for the church. Just give me one simple example. If you come here, for instance, to open door, if you go to church, and the primary reason you came this morning or you ever go at all is for the message, just for instance. If that's why you come, I have some good news for you, because you don't have to do that anymore at all. It's really good news for some of you, I suppose, because you can listen to it online. Just download the app. You can get it through iTunes. Don't ask me how, but you can do that. Which raises a question. It's a question people weren't asking 10 years ago, 20 years ago. Why are we here? What is the church? Why are we here? Last year, Bonnie and I got a Christmas letter from a family that we distantly knew. They went to Open Door as far as we knew, and they kind of came and went. And so we knew them. And it was one of those Christmas letters that are like what Christmas letters are. And they share about their family and what they're doing and who got added and what their jobs are and things like that. But among the things they shared was that they had finally found a church in Atlanta. And, Bonnie, I looked at each other, and I don't remember who said it, but one of us, I didn't know they moved to Atlanta. Turns out they didn't move to Atlanta. Postscript on the envelope. No, no, they still live in that same place. They didn't move to Atlanta. They found their church, and they watched their church online in Atlanta. That's their home on a TV. They go to church, which means the face of things has changed. And it raises this question. It really is a serious question, I think. What is the church? Why are we here? Over the Christmas break, my daughter and her husband were able to be with us for a length of time. It was a wonderful time. And Hain is Erica's husband, and we have long talks, and he's just a great guy. But he was telling me, we talked about a lot of things, but he was telling me about a book he had read recently, which caused Bonnie and I to really think about that because we actually didn't know he could read. You know what I love about what I just said is that he is going to listen to this message, hear that and he is going to zing me back, I promise you. But way more people heard my zing of him than they will hear his zing of me. So, Hayne, I'm just talking to you. I'm up on you here. The book he was talking about was a book entitled The Shallows, which intrigued me right away, written by a guy named Nicholas Carr. And what it was about was what the internet is doing to our brain. how we process information and the speed with which we do it, resulting in, says Nicholas Carr, and I'm quoting him here, it results in a growing inability to pay attention to anything for more than just a few minutes. In fact, he got into this whole thing by just noticing himself that he couldn't pay attention to anything. He wouldn't read a whole email. He couldn't read a whole blog. He'd get here and he'd have to go to something else. And the research that he uncovered told him that his brain wasn't drifting. It was hungry. And what he was feeding it was not information, not a depth of thought. He was feeding it and had been for a very long time. Soundbites. Soundbite, soundbite, soundbite. And so it's hungry. The brain is hungry. I got that. I need another one. I need another one. It's like getting a hit. And it's changing the brain chemistry of him and people. ultimately resulting, quoting him again, in a physiological inability to access what Carr called deep brain thinking, which means you can't think through anything. Think about that. It's created an inability, a physiological inability, to access deep brain thinking, which means we can't think through anything. And that's changing the face of things, because we can't sit in anything long enough to think it through. It's changing the face of things in the culture. It's changing the face of things. Also, in the church, entertainment has done the same. It's changed the face of things. Indeed, Neil Postman, in a book he wrote 30 years ago, says it pretty well, I think, in the title of his book, entitled Amusing Ourselves to Death. A fascinating title. We're amusing ourselves to death. Public discourse in the age of show business. And his contention is this, that modern education, politics, journalism, and even religion has become subject to and have largely taken the form of entertainment. Think about that. Politics. It's really entertainment. Journalism, really entertainment. At the end, nobody's going to listen if you don't entertain. Religion, really entertainment. No one will come if you don't entertain. Indeed, he begins his book with this fascinating perspective from 30 years ago. And I'm quoting him again here. He says this, that while America was keeping its eye on 1984, which, by the way, is a reference to George Orwell's nightmare vision in 1949 of what he thought life would be like in 1984. And if you remember that, it was the name of a book, 1984. I was talking about Big Brother and was coming kind of in the, just in the wake of Second World War, 1949. He was talking about 1984. Well, the year finally came, says this author, and the prediction didn't. So Americans sang softly in praise of themselves because the roots of liberal democracy had held and wherever else the terror of Orwell's nightmare had actually happened, it hadn't happened here. But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another slightly older and slightly less well-known, though equally chilling vision, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. It's a book that some of you are familiar, vaguely maybe remember it. Postman goes on to say this about that, contrary to common belief even among the educated in those days, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. This is where it gets fascinating. Orwell warned that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. And again, this is coming in the face of two world wars and lots of fear. The Cold War was kind of upon us. So he warns about being overcome by this externally imposed oppression. Huxley's vision had no big brother, because no big brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity, and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression and to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think. Wow. What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much information that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared that the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of what he called the feelies, the orgy porgy. Really, the orgy porgy. I had to look this up. I had to Google that. What does he mean by the feelies? The orgy porgy. People used to talk like this, I guess. Very weird words that refer simply to overstimulation of the senses, of all the senses. But in his book, it was kind of the sexual whatever it is you want thing. Feelys, actually, were a reference in his book. It was his anticipation of technology that would allow you to go to a movie and not only see what was happening, but you would be able to feel it. It's called a feely. You'd be able to have these incredible experiences, but they weren't real experiences. They were virtual experiences. And isn't this wonderful? I don't know. In Orwell's book, people were controlled by inflicting pain. In Huxley's, they were controlled by inflicting pleasure. So everything in our background, says Huxley, has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us. But who has prepared us to take up arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain? And when? And in what tone of voice when serious discourse has been reduced to giggles? When a population becomes distracted by trivia? When cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainment? When serious public conversation becomes a form of baby talk? Stop right there. Wow. When serious public conversation becomes a form of baby talk, what would that be? Think, think. Real Housewives of LA there you go I don't know what it is think entertainment tonight hello John it's a form of baby talk and we love it when in short a people become an audience just observing things and they're a public business a vaudeville act then those people are at risk and culture death is a clear possibility and quote, he seems kind of grumpy. I don't know. To me, maybe he didn't take his happy pill when he wrote that book. In fact, does it change the face of things? In ways we don't even know. In the culture, it's changed the face of things. But in the churches, well, I mean, how do you get people to come if they can only pay attention for 10 minutes or five? How do you get them to stay? How do you get them to pay attention? Maybe we should talk, maybe talk too. Maybe we should dumb it down, become entertainers, just bring it into soundbite. A couple weeks ago, we talked about the gospel of Jesus. And I talked about a truncated gospel, that we have reduced the gospel to mean nothing more than some basic rudimentary things we need to believe about Jesus to go to heaven when you die. How did it get so reduced to that? Because it's such a bigger story, a more fascinating story, powerful story than that. but the gospel in a variety of ways has been reduced. Why? How? I don't know. Maybe we just needed baby talk. Change the face of things. And the culture also, the church, how do you become a people? We talk about being a people. How do we become a people when, it's no fault of our own, this is just the sea that we swim in, We are fundamentally in our, we're an audience. That's what we know how to do. Myself included. Fear has changed the face of things. The culture we live in, the church, churches we go to, what happened in Paris this last week that rocked all of us. Once again, we're getting used to being rocked like that. It's changed the face of things. And it raises this question, at least it does for me, and I think it does for you as well. I know it does for us. What is the church? Why are we here? Do we have a response to those kinds of things? Those kinds of things in Paris, sure. That violence, the terrorism. Do we have a response to that? Do we have a response to the trivia as well? And I don't just mean a speech. Do we offer an alternative to the trivia, to the violence, to the hatred being matched with more hatred? Do we provide any hope? Do we model something fundamentally different than what we see everywhere else? Or are we just kind of a Christian version of, you know, baby talk? That which is trivial and quite meaningless. Because I'm looking for a church. It's the right kind of church. So what kind are you? Who are you? So who are we? as a church? It's a pretty basic question, really. One that ought to be obvious and is to some because, I don't know, a church is a church. How different can they be? But we think, even if it is an obvious question, almost too basic to go into deeply, we actually think it's an important question to ask and to answer and maybe to remember who we are, particularly at this particular time in the life of our church, but not just our church. Because I'm talking about the church, Big C Church, where things are shifting and changing at a very rapid pace because they've been shifting and changing in the culture as well, and they've been shifting and changing for a very long time such that the face of things has changed. Which means that this question of who we are as a church is not just important, but if you get down into it, it's a little bit scary. Because how we answer it might actually matter. Because maybe the stakes are higher than we know as to whether we even exist. I don't mean our church exists. I mean the church. I mean, it's a pretty well-known fact that when we think about the European church where God did amazing things. The assessment of the church in Europe is it's dead. How are we doing? For the church in America, a vibrant, authentic expression of the life of Christ, the kingdom of God on earth, will even exist. And if it does exist, if we do exist, will we have a voice? And if we do have a voice, will it be a prophetic voice? Not a baby talk voice. Will it have an edge? Will it make sense? Will it have any substance? Will it provide some light? Will it provide some hope? Or will it just be a giggle? Having unwittingly developed a religious version of baby talk because it's the only thing people understand, so we better talk that way. And it also fills the room. And you don't have to look far for that kind of thing, I'm afraid. It's fascinating. Friday morning, Bonnie showed me this blog. And it's weird because this is, I mean, I talk to her about this kind of stuff all the time. But this is a talk that got inside me. And my mind was buzzing all the time. And so we were talking about this. And she walks into my office on Friday and kind of puts the computer in front of me and says, you're not going to believe this. It's a blog I just ran into. And what it was was an open letter to the church. and it was entitled this. Here's the real reason people are leaving you. Okay. Written by a woman who, as I read it, it became obvious to me that she'd been to church and maybe for a very long time but she was now speaking on behalf of many people in her opinion and maybe she was and there were five reasons. Reason number one was fascinating to me particularly in light of what I was thinking of at the time and even writing in the context of my talk. Reason number one is this, the real reason we're leaving is we're tired of being entertained. All the lights and camera in action is like white noise to us. Yeah, the songs are cool, show is great, but I can be entertained anywhere and they do it better than you, church. So until you give us something beyond a Christian-themed performance piece, something that allows us space and breath, and it made me think of what Vicki talked about last week, But actually to understand what she said, you'd have to, I don't know, think. Something to provide substance and depth, a sense of reverence and transcendence till I see some of that. I'm sleeping in on Sunday morning. It's kind of chilling. And it reminds me of another reason that this question of who we are as a church is a scary question. Not just an important one, it's a scary question because what if we don't know who we are as a church? Because if we don't know who we are as a church, it begs another question. Why are we here? If we don't know who we are, why are we here? Why do we bother with any of this? But there's one more reason that I thought of that makes this question a scary question. At least to me, it's this. What if we tell you who we are and we really make it clear this time but you don't like who we are. So you leave because you can. Well, we can't have that. So we better make it attractive and we better find out what you want and we better dumb it down at least a little. Religious baby talk might help. I don't know, now and then. Which is maybe what you do when you don't know who you are and you've forgotten why you're here. I remember some months ago actually a year or so ago in our visioning process we'd been doing it for quite a while and getting some sense of what God was saying to us and one of the things we started talking about in the course of many things was marketing should we do it? should we market ourselves? we think God's doing some incredible things and there's an aroma of life and if people would smell it they would like it and so maybe we could market this a little bit and they all looked at me because they knew I'd go, I don't know. And I said, sure, yeah, I'm up for that. As long as, and this wasn't just me, we all kind of were thinking this way, as long as we come up with something that makes it really clear why we're really here and who we really are, and if we really make it clear who we really are, that will draw some people, and it will repel some people, and if it draws some people and repels some people, that's the thing I want to say. In fact, one of the things that was in my mind was the story of Ananias and Sapphira. Acts chapter five, some of you might remember that. When Ananias and Sapphira came to Peter pretending to be generous when they weren't, they were smoking mirrors. They were lying about what they had actually given. But the real deal wasn't that they lied. It was that they were pretending. It was they were pretending to be something that they weren't. It was smoking mirrors and they dropped dead. Boom! Wouldn't you love to be part of that church? Well, apparently, later on in Acts chapter five, a lot of people didn't want to be part of that church because it says that all of them left them and fled. But the very next verse confusingly says this, but multitudes were being added to the number because apparently there was something about that that drew some people and repelled some others. And there's your church. I don't know if you remember, but we equated it to, we equated it to, I know this is a weird stretch, but little kids in the pool, you know how you do this with your kids on vacation in the pool. You know, if you pee in the pool, it's going to turn blue. What if you were part of a community where every time they spun it, every time they lied, every time they postured and posed, every time you walked away wondering what they really meant, I don't know, I feel slimy, but the words were, and you had a smile. The water turned blue. Every time it turned blue. Would you run from a community like that? Some people would, because I pee in the pool. I'm a poser. And a community like that would expose all the pretense of my life, and others would go, oh, give me that, please. That was the idea behind all of this. So my suggestion was a billboard, something that would draw and repel. My suggestion was a billboard that said something like this. Come to Open Door, where we have zero tolerance for any BS at all. Yeah, whatever Okay, it would draw some people But I promise you See, this does No, we're not going to do that It's really not a good idea But that is something That would draw some people And it would repel I can't believe they said BS And repel some people It means brown sugar, whatever You don't even know what it means Anyway In fact, here's our mission statement It has a touch of this I don't know if you know our mission statement but our mission is a sense of why we're here, what we're here to do, and that is to invite people into the struggle of becoming fully alive in God. And we talked about that. I love that word struggle, but that's a word that repels a struggle. I want happy. It ain't happy. It is happy. It is joy, but this is a struggle to become fully alive because you're going to have to put to death some things and put off some things and put on some things, and we're all in this thing together about becoming alive, but it's a struggle. We're telling you that up front. That's going to draw some people, repel some people. But it's scary to do that. Why? Because some may be repelled. But that reminds me of a fascinating dynamic of Jesus' ministry, and it was this, that over and over again, there was this recurring pattern. And it happened over and over again, where multitudes were drawn by him. They would come to him because the word had spread that a demon got cast out, or someone had gotten healed or someone had gotten fed. The whole 4,000 or 5,000 people got fed free food. They came. And he speaks really good like one having authority. But then he'd do the dumbest thing, Jesus would, from a marketing standpoint. Because he'd start to get down into it. And he'd start to clarify what he meant by what he said, what he meant, what it meant to follow him. And people would begin to drift away because it drew some people but repelled others. My favorite is Matthew 8, 19, where a scribe comes up to Jesus and the multitudes are there. And a scribe, by the way, is a big catch. I mean, he's got nothing but losers so far. Peter, fisherman, tech, what am I gonna do with these guys? A scribe, let's keep this. The guy comes to Jesus and says, good teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. Sign them up. To which Jesus says, wonderful, in verse 20. But here's the deal. Just know this. Foxes have holes. Birds have nests. The Son of Man has no place to lay his head. And if you follow me, it might be like that for you. Do you still want to come? And as I like to say when I'm telling this story, that guy disappeared in the white space between verse 20 and 21. He didn't want that. John 6, same kind of thing. He has many followers at this particular time when in verse 54 he says the strangest thing. He says this. You can see it on the screen. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has this eternal kind of life for my flesh is true food and my blood is real drink. But here's the problem with what he said. He doesn't explain it. Or quickly say, it's a metaphor. He just lets it lie there. for them to, I don't know, think it through. To wonder, what does it mean? I don't know. Just stick with it. Sit in it. And some did, but most didn't. Verse 66, actually, it says this, that many of his disciples, when he said that, withdrew and were not walking with him anymore. Why? I don't know exactly why, but maybe it's because they wanted a religion that answered all their questions, didn't raise more questions, that made them feel safe and secure, but this that he's talking about could cost me more than I'm willing to spend, and this could be hard, and this might take time to even figure out what he's talking about. I might have to think about this. I need something quick and easy. Someone who will do all my thinking for me, hmm, that's what I want. So Jesus, when everybody left like that, changes his strategy, he saw the error of his ways and said, everybody, I was just kidding. In the next verse, he does. It won't cost much. It won't be hard. It won't take long. No, he didn't say that. And neither will we. do you know why because we know who we are and as it turns out we're a people a chosen people no less wow a royal priesthood a holy nation for once we were not a people but now we are the people of God so we have an identity as a people but we also have a mission as a people to be light in the middle of the darkness to provide hope in the middle of despair, to make sense in the middle of baby talk, to provide substance in the middle of the trivial, to give mercy and grace when it isn't deserved to speak truth in the middle of banality, which is why we've decided, don't know if we'll do it well, but we've decided that we need to have, in ways we've never had before, a radical commitment to spiritual transformation, not so we can feel holier than thou, but so we can actually provide some light, but even more so we can actually provide an alternative to the emptiness, to the superficial and the trivial, an alternative to the fast food religion of the day, to the hatred and the death that returns evil for evil to be a different kind of people living a different kind of life manifesting a different kind of love and a different kind of authority born of humility and servanthood because we're following a different kind of king King Jesus it's his name who said the strangest things that you'll have to take some time to sit in to even know what he means like love your enemy and do good to those who hate you bless them, don't curse them and if someone forces you to go one mile go with him too and if they take your coat give them your shirt as well okay, what? what? Just sit in that. Wonder about that. Given it will be given unto you. Forgiven you will be forgiven. While you know the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them he says in Matthew 20 and their great men prove their greatness by exercising authority over them. It is not to be so among you people. I don't care who you are. If you're the pastor, it's not to be that way among you if you're an elder big shot give a lot of money it's not to be that way whoever wishes to be great among you among these people my people because we're trying to provide an alternative to what everybody else does whoever wishes to be great among you will be the servant of all the slave for I have come not to be served but to serve and to give and to give and to give my life. Come join me. And that, because all of that speaks to a different kind of kingdom, speaks to a different kind of people following a different kind of king, but so much of that still seems foreign to us, still seems foreign to me, even foolish at times. Here's why, because we've fallen asleep. we've grown deaf of hearing we've grown blind of seeing even dead are we maybe in certain places of our lives but here's good news God has made us alive but God made us alive together with Christ Colossians chapter 3 and now that we've been made alive we as a people are called to keep seeking those things that give more and more life. So put on, therefore, a heart of compassion and kindness and love. And you can do that in 10 minutes, I'm pretty sure. No, you're going to have to enter into the struggle of becoming fully alive because it takes some time to even become aware of your lack of compassion so you can start to put it on and put off, therefore, your bitterness and pride, your anger and your wrath, and put to death, therefore, Lust, immorality, pride and greed. Put to death your demand to consume. And when it talks about lust and all that, it's demand to consume people. I will consume you to satisfy me. Put it to death. About 10 minutes. This could take some time. And all of that is who we are in that kind of struggle. But in truth, it's not who we are. It's who we want to be. And that is why we've made it our mission to invite people into what we think is the struggle of becoming fully alive in God. And it's why we talk about a radical commitment to spiritual formation. Because in a crooked and perverse generation, people who are becoming fully alive in God provide some light. They actually can provide some hope and some healing. They actually provide an alternative to the emptiness, to the trivial, to the fast food religion of the day that has put us all to sleep. Let me close with this. A friend of mine, Ned Berube, we met this last Friday and we were just talking, but he was talking to me about his blog. So he sent me his blog. And in the blog, he mentioned a book by Os Guinness entitled Renaissance, The Power of the Gospel, However Dark the Times, where much like Nicholas Carr in the book I mentioned, The Shallows, and Neil Postman in his book, Amusing Ourselves to Death, Os Guinness is sounding the alarm of globalization and the speed with which we live such that everyone is now everywhere. Think about that. We live in a day that everyone is now everywhere, making us the first generation in history to see everything as it's happening. Like we did this last week, when the events of Paris kind of unfolded, and ten minutes after it happens, we're watching it. And we've been watching it all week. We're there. Indeed, he says, we're in an age of gargantuan numbers, Truly instant information, ceaselessly hyperactive social media, uninterrupted information and emotion that pounds down on us by the minute with its ceaseless roar, which he likens to Niagara Falls. Because if you've ever gone to Niagara Falls and you've done that little boat trip under it, the noise is deafening, but you get used to it, so you kind of can't hear anything anymore, but that's okay. Further, he says, the fashionable obsession with public opinion, numbers, quantity and metrics, and measurable outcomes has created a crisis in the church that we're not even aware of because we've moved, he says. From an integrated faith to a fragmented faith, from a stance under authority. Think of being under, we don't submit to anybody. From a stance under authority, having bent our knee to God, to a stance of personal preference. I don't like that. I like it over there. And we serve that. From a stance, a supernatural or kingdom sense of reality to a purely secular perspective. Every age, he says, is fooled by its own fashions. I love that. Every age is fooled by its own fashions. They think they look good. Remember the pictures you look at of your parents when they got married? You should see mine. I wore platform shoes. I thought it looked good. Every age is fooled by its own fashions. It is time, therefore, to subject the modern idolatry of opinion and numbers to critical Christian thinking.

So what do we do? What do we need? He gives four things. They're going to be on the screen. I'm not going to elaborate. Here's what we need. Church, number one, we need an unshakable trust in God who can face any future. We need an unshakable trust in God who, in the words of my friend Ned Berube, thinks all of this is his. Two, we need a profound intellectual seriousness willing to wrestle with unprecedented problems because that's what we're facing. Three, we need a constant and humble reliance on God's spirit for fresh and creative imaginations that might be able to conceive what has never been conceived. About the church. And how we respond and how it is we become an alternative. Four. We need untiring perseverance. Worthy of past reformers. What I hear in that is worthy of the apostles. worthy of the prophets worthy of the people of God and that is who we are Paul said it this way Philippians 1 27 only conduct yourselves hang on just a second only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that whether I am come so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I may hear of you, that you are standing firm with one mind, striving together for the faith of the gospel in no way alarmed by your opponents, which is a sign of destruction for them because if you're not alarmed, they're in trouble. But salvation for you and that too from God and all of that is who we are. And all of that is where we're from. And all of that is why we're here. More on that next week. Let's stand as we're dismissed. Thank you, God, that we are yours. You have called us and chosen us. You redeemed us and made us, your sons and daughters, your church. help us to hear what you're saying to the church give us courage to respond power by your spirit to become and to do and all God's people said Amen God bless you as you leave there will be people here if you need prayer Thank you.
