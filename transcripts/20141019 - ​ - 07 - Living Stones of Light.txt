Our scripture reading today is out of 1 Peter 2. But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood. And then from Ephesians 2, 19 through 22, So then, you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God's household, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you, as living stones, also are being built together in a dwelling of God in the Spirit. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks, Sue. Sue. Thanks, Sue. So, well, beloved, great to see all your faces. You actually look better when I get closer, especially you, Al. Well, Dave Johnson is out this weekend, but don't be dismayed. We need a break from that loud, fast talker anyway. I say that as someone who has to live with them every week. Anyway, we have a teacher in our midst who's just fantastic. Peter Kapsner was with us in May. But Peter goes way back to 1989 and through the 90s. He was on staff both in children's and in adult ministry. He's an adjunct faculty at Northwestern and Bethel. He's a friend of this place. He and his family came back here a year, year and a half ago and have just found themselves in the story again. So would you help me welcome back Peter Kapsner? applause applause applause applause applause It hit me last night when Joel said it, but I remember growing up people would say things like, time goes by really quickly. And when you're 10 years old, you don't really believe that, but it's a little staggering to me to think it was 25 years ago that first came here to this place, how quickly the time goes. I think I came sometime during the book of Matthew in the Robbinsdale building. I believe Dave was about 12 years old back then, sporting the mullet early fashion for Dave. And he was 10 years into ministry at that time, born with that gift. And it's just amazing to be part of the journey for this long and to just see what has been done. It's just been delightful to come back too. And I don't say that lightly. I do some speaking in different places and find myself in different communities from time to time. This is home for us. And what I find delightful about it is that it just seems like we're on a common journey with common language and just anticipating this weekend has been delightful, though terrifying too. I was telling Dave this last week, you know, Dave, do you ever lose sleep when you're prepping for sermons? And Dave, being filled with compassion as he is, just looked at me and laughed. Yes, you do. But it is delightful. So with that, let's go to prayer and then we'll get into the text this morning. God, just for me, one of the themes this morning throughout the worship and all of what's been said is that it is your presence, it is your light, it is your life, and love that is what is needed. And so I ask that you would bring your light into this place, into our hearts, that you would be living and active in the ways only you can be. Thank you for this body, for this journey, and I ask that by your spirit you would continue to walk this out with us. By the power of your spirit we pray. Amen. Well, if you've been here the last couple of weeks, you know Dave has been reflecting on this question related to who we are as a church. How many of you have been here the last couple of weeks, or at least one of the two. And he has been going through this question, who are we, and even reflecting on how he as a pastor finds himself in different environments. And they will ask him the question quite often, so Dave, what kind of church are you? And so Dave, like Dave does, he goes through a wide variety of possibilities to try to answer that question. I looked back at the video again this week to try to get all the possibilities down here on paper. I found that I could type just about as fast as Dave could speak. And so in typing out the possibilities, see if this sounds familiar to you, Dave, in reflecting on who we are, says, are we a Baptist church or a Catholic church? Because that might tell us something about ourselves? Are we a spirit-filled church or are we not that kind of church? Are we a big church or a little church, a seeker-driven church, a missional church? You remember this? A liberal church, a conservative church, a mega church, a small group church, a friendly church, a really cool and hip church, a Bible-believing church, or do we read from another book altogether? Do we have a choir? Do we have a band? Do we like rock and roll? Are we a worshiping church? Are we a contemporary church? Are we just the right kind of church? Because in our culture, I'm looking for a church. And of course, in response to all those kinds of questions, Dave then took us back into the biblical text and read for us two weeks ago what's been read a couple of times already this morning about how out of 1 Peter 2, that whatever else we are and whoever else we are, that this is what is true about us. We are a chosen people, says the text. A royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that we together may declare the praises of him who has called us out of darkness and into his wonderful light. So hang on to that word light for a minute. And then last week, Dave took us into another passage, read again this morning about how we as the church are living stones in whom God is building his dwelling place. You remember that from last week, this language that whatever else we are, we are living stones, all of us, individuals, but put together as well. And as we're put together, we become the dwelling place of God. And so last week, Dave said, because this is true, that however else we see this place in which we are, that at the end of the day, this is just an auditorium. And he even apologized to the auditorium last week for letting it know it was just an auditorium. I'm sorry, auditorium, that's what you are, for the church is us. And it's the living stones filled with God's presence looking for a dwelling place. So regardless if we have coffee, and I really hope we have coffee, regardless if we have pews or a sign or a steeple, regardless of whether this organization is growing or contracting, the call to grow as living stones into this dwelling place stays the same. So that's the recap. And I just regularly sit over there during the services week in and week out. And as I took all of that in, I don't know how you responded to some of that language, but for me, I found myself even getting some chills from time to time and just saying, wow, I want that. Sign me up for that. Because I hear sometimes in circles in which I run, people say things like, you know, the church is really the people. The church is really the people. But then we spend so much time trying to build the organization. And not that we shouldn't. We need an organization. But I think Dave really meant it the last couple of weeks. And I felt myself being called and compelled into that and wondering about that a little bit. And as I wondered the last couple of weeks, a question came to mind. And it's a question that really drives the sermon now this morning. And the question sounds something like this. If it's true that we are a dwelling place for God, what might God be looking for in a dwelling place? if it's true that we are to be filled with the dynamic presence of God what is it that he might be looking for in that I let that sink in a bit in just the last couple of weeks and often as I'm with my students we talk about this sort of thing and I'll ask the question you know what if it was true that God was actually real what if he really was real and not a figure we believe in for something though yes, or a theological notion about whom we argue. But what if God was really real? What might he be looking for as he's dynamically involved with us, even now? Not just in the biblical text, but now as the story continues. So I was asking myself that question and wondering about that. I mean, I know what I'm looking for, by contrast, in a dwelling place. I'm looking for a space with four bedrooms for Hallie and me and our five children. I'm looking for an unfinished basement in which the kids can just run around and break stuff. Well, maybe not the sump pump in the middle of the now monsoon season that is our spring these days, right? Maybe not the sump pump of the soccer ball and we don't know anything about it until the flood in our basement hits, but an unfinished basement where they can break most stuff. I would love a spot for a piano in my dwelling place, not because I have the first clue how to play, but my children do. I love that. I need a spot for a 6,000-inch big flat screen TV. Need it. And now they have those like curve models, and I don't know why they're cool, but they must be cool because they're new. So I need one of those. I would enjoy a two- or maybe three-car garage. I would like a nice lawn. I don't know how to make a nice lawn, but I would like one. I would love a garden that somehow feeds all five children and requires no work. Love just enough refrigerator space for a few pints of water. And maybe some space on the shelf for some native drinks from Scotland. Some of what I'm looking for in a dwelling place. What might God be looking for in a dwelling place? Because it's just a wild guess, but I'm guessing it's not some of those things. And as fun as that is to even think about it, it began for me, I think for us, to be a crazy important question. If that's actually true, that God is real and looking for a dwelling place. So trying to answer that question, sometimes it's helpful to maybe just look in the scriptures and even some of the scriptures that Dave has read, specifically out of that 1 Peter passage again, where it refers to the fact that we're called to declare the praises of this God who has called us out of darkness to live in his wonderful light. And so again, as I sat over there these last couple of weeks, and I kept hearing this phrase light in different ways and in different texts, and even the Philippians texts that were called the shine like stars, and this word light, it for whatever reason captured my attention, began to dig into it a little bit, and thought about it. I thought if I asked you or you asked me, do you want to live in darkness? And I think our answer to that question would probably be no, right? I mean, Del, if I, and Del, just call you out. If I was singing up here, and I promise I won't sing, but if I was and I sang, you know, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. And then if I said, Del, should I hide it under a bush? You would say, yes. See, you wrecked the song, Del. I mean, great. Yeah. But thankfully, we had some Christians on this side over here that said no, so that was good. We can chat after church, Del. I'll pray over you. But this word light was compelling. I don't want to live in darkness. I want to live in light. I want to do that, and I've heard this kind of word said from the biblical text many times, but I, frankly, actually, I don't really know what it means. It just kind of sounds good. So I began to dig into that a little bit and wonder what's there, and didn't think it would be that big of a deal, that'd be a pretty easy answer to come to. Until I actually opened the Bible, I found that light was used in the New Testament some 59 times, which may not seem like a lot at first, but by comparison, I was just doing some searching, and the word salvation, which is a really important word, I think, for the most part for us, right? It's used 44 times in the text. And then I looked further and there was this little theological word that gets chucked around from time to time. It's the word justification. You've heard of that word maybe. And the word justification is only used by comparison twice. And that may not seem like a big deal, except that the very organization in which we find ourselves sitting this morning was birthed out of this very word justification. So if you'll just indulge me for a moment, we'll take a rabbit trail back into history just for a few minutes. I promise it'll mostly have a point on that. But to offer a comparison about this word justification in light, just in terms of what happened with this word. It was the early 1500s that a monk by the name of Martin Luther, heard of Luther? Okay. Luther, well, he was meditating in a monastery on the book of Romans. And he was meditating, trying to figure out how it was that he could be made right with God. And while he was meditating, he came across these passages in Romans that have this word justification. And he talks about how he was just struck and almost like a thunderbolt hit him when he realized that he was justified by faith alone. That's his kind of language. And for Luther, when he gets struck by stuff, it was a big deal. This guy was sort of a loose theological and social canon. I love Luther. He was the guy, again, if you remember when he was convinced of some abuses that were happening in the church at that time, that he wrote up 95 statements or 95 theses back then. And he wrote them. It must have been a really long piece of parchment back then. And he wrote them all down and he nailed them onto the door of the Wittenberg Chapel for all the world to see. And the chapel was a seat of theological power at that time. I mean, I love Luther. There's no anonymous email to the pastor here. And so we've got some big doors out there, and I just encourage you, you know, to give your sermon feedback on any given weekend by just nailing to the door. That would be great. So when Luther got hold of this idea of this justification by faith, he sort of went wild with it. And in fact, he suggested to the church at large that we really should just throw out the book of Revelation as well as James and Jude and Hebrews because none of them really talk about justification by faith. So let's get rid of them on that. And I guess I sort of understand Jude because I can never find it in my text anyway. One page, but just seems like a loose canon. But the point of this is that we're sitting here today as the people of God in an organization that flowed from just two words in the biblical text, this word justification by faith, gave rise to Baptists and Lutherans and Christian Missionary Alliance and Covenant Church, Pentecostal Church, Episcopalian, all of these churches birthed out of just this little word. It makes me wonder what would have happened if Luther had come across the word light in the text. 59 times. So however we're shaped by that, how could we be shaped by this word that seems sort of pervasive all throughout the text? I sort of hope on the other side in eternity I get at least three centuries of one-on-one time with Martin Luther. And I just want to bring light to him just to see what would happen. Because now the dude won't be constrained by time and space at all. He can just do any number of things. But other major figures talk extensively about this light of God. It's Thomas Aquinas' writings. that's St. Augustine's writings. Leon Morris, as a matter of fact, a modern commentator says, we can hardly spend too much time considering what it means to be in God's wonderful light. It's not just in the New Testament, but the Old as well. The Israelites were the light of the nation. Even Genesis 1, remember the opening day, it says in the beginning there was light. And the sun, moon, and stars aren't made until day four. So if you study some of that as our sources of light, that whatever else that light is in Genesis 1, there's more to it than just physical light. In fact, John in his gospel starts out, his John 1, 1 through 5, by saying, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And all things were made through him. And then it says this, in him there was life, not some sort of physical life, but the very kind of life that God lives. And this life is the light of all humankind. And it's a light that shines in the darkness, says John. And the darkness cannot overcome it. So I went from this place of saying, well, it's probably not that big a deal. I can figure it out fairly quickly. To now I don't know what to do. It actually gave rise to a very practical problem here for us this morning. And that is, where do we go? How do we see that it's all over the text? I don't know what to do. So maybe we can just narrow it down. Started having some conversations with people around this word light. What could it mean? What does it look like? And in narrowing it down, brought it down to just, for at least just this morning, much more to it, but for this morning, two texts in 1 John. So I'll read those for you, and then we'll look at that more fully. It says in 1 John 1, 5 through 6, this. So this is the message that we have heard from Jesus and declared to you. This is his disciples now. This is the message that we've heard. That God is light. And in him there is no darkness at all. So if we claim to have fellowship with God, if we claim to be a dwelling place for God as living stones and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. Second passage, and this is where it gets a little dicey and wildly interesting. For how do we know if we're walking in this light of God? John says this a chapter later. Anyone who claims to be in this light, but hates his brother or sister, is still in the darkness. Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there's nothing in them anymore to make them stumble. But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness, and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they're going, because the darkness has blinded them. So we know we're walking in the light when we're loving our brothers and sisters. It's the connection between light and love. And when I say it gets a little bit dicey, it caused me to ask a few questions of myself because you see I have all sorts of fancy letters after my name. Doctor, Reverend, PhD, MDiv, blah, blah, blah. I can wear the fancy robes like I've just come right out of Hogwarts or something. Nice big hat. I can do all of that. And I can argue about theology and different positions and ideas and thoughts and everything until I'm blue in the face. And none of that means that I'm walking in light. Not a bit of it. I have to ask myself the question, how well do I love to live in the light? What do I see when I look around in this world? What do I see when I even look around this morning? Like right now. So if God was actually present, maybe I should try to see. What would I see? I think about C.S. Lewis's words where he says, so here's the thing, there are no ordinary people. You've never talked to a mere mortal. Nations and cultures, arts and civilizations, those things are mortal. and their life as to ours is the life of a gnat. But it's immortals whom we joke with, immortals whom we work with, that we marry and even sometimes snub and exploit. So how do I see even this morning? Do I see in that? I can tear apart the biblical text just fine, but can I love? Because John then says even two chapters later, these profound words. I remember singing these words in camp growing up, Beloved, let us love one another. For love comes from God. And anyone who loves is born of God and knows God. But he who does not love does not know God. For God is love. It's beautiful. My heart jumps towards that. I notice that. I don't know if it's yours. It jumps towards that. But it's troubling because then I wonder about that. And how do I see? And would it matter if we saw differently? What could that look like in this? I was compelled even by some of what Dave read these last couple of weeks out of a book. I think it was Renovation of the Church or some book that he had read that was describing some of what we see in some of our churches these days. That's present in our churches but doesn't necessarily belong. Things like maybe greed or infidelity or power plays. I mean, I know that never happens in churches, right? Or maybe some gossip or trying to get their way or get the pet idea moving forward. And I'm just going to sort of use you to forward my and further my ministry or idea or thought or opinion or whatever it is we're supposed to be as a church. And I was compelled by that as he was reading some of those passages out of the book. And even then I get a chance, this great privilege to sit with students week in and week out at Bethel in Northwestern. And these students are students that they represent many, many churches, just like ours, into the classroom. 30, 40, 50, 100 students coming from different kinds of churches. And I get a chance to chat with them about some of this stuff in real time. And so we talked about what was present in some of their churches growing up. And they talked about, yeah, boy, some of the divisions and power plays and some of it was there. It was interesting to watch them reflect. Stuff that is there but doesn't belong. But then we took some time together and we flipped that question upside down. We know what's present in many of the churches today that doesn't belong. But do we know what's absent in some of our churches that may just belong? Do we know what's present? Yeah. But do we also see sometimes what's absent? Not all churches. But sometimes it's absent. Let's wonder about that. And the students said, yeah, you know, I'm kind of interested in this word love and being able to see and walk in the light. Just want to share with you some of the questions that we asked, that we talked about, then not just with some of the students, but also with some of the staff here. And as I do, just four pictures and four thoughts, four questions about what love might look like or what it even kind of sounds like or tastes or taste is here, touch is here. feels like in this. Before I do, I just want to make one caveat or qualification on this, is there's a concern that I had even in bringing this word love, because I think sometimes we misconstrue it in our culture these days as being something that's sort of mushy and something that is, well, you know, who are we to say? Just do what you want to do and be who you want to be, it's our job just to love and that's it. And I just want to say out loud that that is actually tolerance masquerading as love. And tolerance is birthed in a cultural ideal that we all share and hold that in many ways not bad but it leads to something and that ideal is that I'm entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness but now it's become as defined by me. And who are you to say? And who am I to say? You see, I can tolerate you, but I don't have to like you. I can tolerate you, I don't have to love you. It's not the kind of kingdom love we're talking about. Dave said by contrast last week, I love what he had to say about this idea that there's a third way that neither tolerates nor condemns. But it's a kingdom kind of love. And I know many of you know this way better than I. But it's a kingdom love that when we encounter it, it convicts and it woos and it compels and it gladdens. And sometimes it calls us to places we don't want to walk, but only so we can become more alive and learn how to love. So that third way and kicking that around and what might that taste like? What might that feel like if I was in the midst of it? Because I'm sure you know, and I do too, when those times I have been in the midst of it, and it's not as frequent as I would like, and it certainly isn't how I see the world on an ongoing basis as much as I would like. We talked about these things, four pictures, four questions. Let me just ask you this to try to get after this, coming from our biblical text. So when is the last time someone really delighted in you? when is the last time when you walked into a room and somebody's eyes just lit up when they saw you not because of some status you had or some position you carried or something you could bring to the table or how you might look their eyes just lit up when they saw you they just danced with delight they couldn't wait to just be with you I was asking my students again that question coming out of all these different churches and it was a little staggering to me as I asked the question because most of them, all of a sudden you could just see the pain in their eyes and the longing of their heart. They would say things like, I can't remember the last time I was delighted in. Where somebody seen in the light just saw who I was and just delighted in me. Just glad you're there. You know, the Garden of Eden in the Hebrew doesn't mean kiosk. It does. That was great. Joel, wherever you are. The Garden of Eden in the Hebrew literally just means delight. It's the Garden of Delight. It's what we're made for. It's why, I don't know about you, but when I'm delighted in by somebody who just sees me, it's like my heart just explodes. I can run for weeks with that kind of delight. I don't even need coffee then at that point. Just run. Dance. I don't dance, but I would. when is the last time someone delighted you? That was the first question. The next one was, when is the last time you were with somebody who knew you and just longed that you would be made whole? Just longed for you to be made whole. So if you're like me, there's stuff inside, there's darkness, there's fragmentation, there's things that I live in to which I am not called, that doesn't belong. It's part of the fragmentation of this world and from God. When is the last time you were around somebody that just longed for you to be made whole, not because they wanted you to be whole because the fact that you are not whole bugs them, right? If you could just be whole, I'll be happy. But somebody who is just desperately other-centered and just longs to see wholeness in you. There's a woman here that I've known for many years, and as we were talking about these pictures this last week, she was like, oh, Peter, I remember a time. It was many years ago, again, back in the Robbinsdale building and her husband and her were going through a difficult time in their marriage, separated in the awkwardness that comes to church when you're separated. Can you really even walk in the door? Because I'm not happy. And they walked in and somebody knew them, knew what they were going through and just swept them aside and began to weep over them and prayed over them. And she told this story many years later, even now. It felt fresh for her. She began to get teary and she said, you know, Peter, my husband and I just celebrated our 36th wedding anniversary. I know it doesn't always work that way, but in that way it did. Somebody who just longed for their wholeness and wept over them as Jesus would have wept when he stood on the hillside overlooking Jerusalem, seeing all of what's going on, and his heart was moved just to weep. You know, people ask me sometimes, how's your walk, Kapsner? How's your walk? You know, and I always think, jeepers, when's the last time I did a quiet time, you know, at the sunrise, by a pool of liquid with the text open or something like that, because that's what holy people do, because I kind of freak out, you know, I mean, but then starting to ask myself the question, when is the last time my heart broke for somebody? Could that be a little barometer in the air, just, hmm, where's the wind blowing? There, third question, third picture, this one came from Joel, something he actually even did this morning, he talked about the capacity to just bless one another with words, Words of hope and wonder, kindness and goodness, not little kitschy sayings or phrases that we sort of, yeah, you know, with each other sometimes, but somebody who has dialed in to the life of the kingdom and who the power of God just flows through them to speak life and light into the darkness of our world. When is the last time somebody just blessed you that way, saw you, delighted in you, and just went bang, right over the top? And your heart just went, whew. Because our tongues have the power to bless and curse, says the book of James. Love that. Final picture, final question. When is the last time that someone really carried a burden for you as if it was their own? Like really carried it. And again, if you're like me, when somebody expresses things that they're struggling with or some difficulties in their life, I kind of don't know what to do. I kind of stand there and I say things like, that's too bad. or I'll pray for you. Don't know what to do. It's out of a good heart, but I don't know. Jesus carried our burdens, like really carried them to the cross somehow. He says, bear each other's burdens somehow. Sometime last year that I was standing with a young man, I didn't know him well, but I knew him well enough and we were standing sort of in this machine shop somewhere and sort of a crazy place to stand, but he had just gotten word that a mentor in his life, a significant figure, had died, and died rather suddenly. And he stood there in this shop, and he just began to weep. And I stood there, awkward in the way that we do, and not knowing what to do, and I also just felt prompted to just say, oh, God, help me carry this with him, like really carry it with him, like in ways that maybe I don't even know how. And as God began to move in those places, My heart just broke open and I began to weep with him. I don't even know this guy that died. And I began to weep with him. And I looked at this young man and said, I don't know how to carry that with you, but I will carry that with you. I will carry this person that you knew in my heart as well. And I began to weep and we looked at each other and now we're standing in a machine shop weeping. And then we just began, the funniest thing happens in those times, we just began to laugh somehow. that there really is joy in the sorrow. It doesn't mean the sorrow goes away. It just means that something comes alongside of it. Something speaks into it as well. I don't know how to do that, but those little times that I do do that, that see those places, it kind of feels a little bit like heaven. And yeah, I want more of that. Think about those things. Think about us as a church. Think about what is possible here. Because what I'm excited about is I think we get this stuff. I think Dave really means it about being living stones. But I think we all do too. And what could that look like? You know, I do love this place. It's why I've been here as many years as we've been. And I've loved the preaching that has come from this pulpit. Just loved it. So grateful for the people who have stood in this place, that have spoken words of life over and over again, from the Brennan Mannings to the Dallas Willards to the Larry Crabs to the Ruth Haley Bartons to the John Ortberg, and everything goes back in the box, and I'll always remember that sermon. And all these people that have stood here and just brought life. So grateful for Dave and what he walks in to bring us life. I know you're all more spiritual than me, but I confess that when I walk in sometimes and I look at the bulletin and I see somebody else's name besides Dave, I get a little bit disappointed, right? I was like disappointed when I saw my name this morning. Darn it. Bald guy ranting away with a nasling voice. Rant, rant, rant, right? I mean. So I'm grateful for that. I'm grateful for the worship and the space that gets created. I come maybe like you careening into most weekends. Just, and I find myself here. And whoa, what am I doing here? And now we're singing. And then usually a couple. songs and I'm like, oh there, there's life again. That's what I'm meant for. And a big old space is created in my spirit around the worship that happens, feel anchored again. But because I believe Dave means it, and because I believe I think we want it, and I know you're living stones, what could it be like if alongside of the wonderful preaching and the beautiful worship and the heavenly realities that are associated with that, that if people walked in this place and they just said, whoa, the air I'm breathing is love. I can just almost taste it. What would it be like if many years from now our children grew up sitting in some classroom with some stupid professor who asked them the question, Tell me about your church. What was there? And maybe our kids might even look a little bit confused to say, well, it was love, of course, that that was what they grew up in. Because Dave gave us this picture about the fact that we're to shine like stars. I don't know how else to do that. But one quick piece as we close. I do recognize that the last thing that sort of rose in my spirit again this week and just sort of thinking about where Dave has been is that though my heart longs to love in this way, I recognize that there was something else that came alongside of it, which was, oh, do I have the capacity to do that? Because I'm really busy. And Peter, I do want to delight in people and I do want to long that others would be made whole and I want to bear burdens and learn how to speak life and blessing, but I've really got a lot to do. Where am I going to create space for? This is what I have been living the past even several months, just kind of came into this sermon as well. And as I've been wondering about that and noticing that God has been sort of gently but firmly in the third way that God does, sort of tapping on me. Hello. Guten tag. Bonjour. door. Hola. Oh, see, now I'm out. That was the last one. Not because I speak in tongues, I'm just thick. McFly. That's a really old one. I'm really sorry about that. But what he's been doing in his rapping and his tapping is saying, Peter, you got to remember something. This love stuff, it's not about you trying to drum it up with a bunch of human effort, finding space in your day to love and then go back to regular life. Remember, love comes from me. Love comes from me. Let me teach you how to see. Let me teach you how to walk in the light. Let me teach you how it just might be part of the flow of your regular life where you're not even thinking about it anymore. You just are somebody with the capacity to love because it's how you see the world. it comes from me. And yeah, Peter, some stuff is going to have to die in order for this to come to life. Just part of the struggle of coming fully alive. But I promise you on the other side of that, I have riches of which you do not know. That's the invitation, to walk in this kind of love, to push and be pulled by it, to be compelled and convicted by it. But again, maybe our children will say, ah, it was love that I grew up in. So if you'd stand with me as we close. I don't ever really know how to do a benediction. So I'm not going to try to rustle something up. But we did this last night. Whatever comfort level you have with this, I'm just going to encourage you. We're going to close our service the way that we opened it with what the text was that Joel read. But if you wouldn't mind maybe just grabbing somebody's hand next to you, You don't have to, but if you would. So whatever else is true of us as a church, whether we are Baptist or Catholic, spirit-filled or not that kind of church, big, little, missional, liberal, conservative, here's what's true here, the truth of the word. You are a chosen people. A royal priesthood. A holy nation. God's special possession, that you as living stones may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness and into his wonderful light. Blessings as you go. Be at peace. Looking forward to the journey ahead with all of you. Thank you.
