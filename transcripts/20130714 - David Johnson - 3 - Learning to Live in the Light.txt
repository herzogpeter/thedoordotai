From 1 John 1, verses 5 through 7, this is the message we have heard from him and announced to you, that God is light. and in him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie. We do not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus, his son, cleanses us from all sin. And then from Acts 5, 11 to 14. And great fear came over the whole church and over all who heard of these things. At the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders were taking place among the people, and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico. But none of the rest dared to associate with them. However, the people held them in high esteem. And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. A great fear came upon the whole church and upon everybody who heard of these things as just the strangest thing. Let's pray. For the work of your spirit, I pray, because it's actually your spirit that I trust in wielding this scalpel today that needs to open us so we can see the ways we're living in the dark to stir up in us a kind of healthy fear of ever learning how to hide and to live in the dark places that we get so used to being in. So, Holy Spirit, come. In Jesus' name, amen. Well, if you've been with us the last couple of weeks, anyway, then you are aware that we're dealing again today with this story that came to us in chapter 5, this actually strange and, I think, disturbing story of Ananias and Sapphira, who, because of their pretense, they're hiding it, they're denying it, their posturing and posing it, their shifting of the feet, their winking of the eye. You can trust me. Their pointing of the finger. It's not me, it's them. It's not here, it's there. They're lying. We call it spin. They breathed their last. They died on the spot. And because As they did, verse 7 or verse 11 says, this great fear that we've been talking about came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things, causing many predictably to run, to get away, to get as far as they could get from this emerging body of people that had been, according to verse 12, meeting at Solomon's portico in ever-increasing numbers, actually. That is until now, until this Ananias and Sapphira thing happened, Because now, with that thing on the radar screen, people were being scared off, such that none of them who were being scared off, it says in verse 13, dared even to associate with this group of people anymore. So it was really a strange thing. And by the way, this is the strange thing that's kind of kept us in this text. It's why we're in this for a third week. the strange thing was this, that the very same fear that was scaring many people off was, in fact, drawing many others in, and that it really is strange. It's the first thing about the story that got my attention, because in verse 14 it says, while some were leaving, all the more people were believing in the Lord. Multitudes, actually, weird, of men and women were constantly being added to their number, which makes this story not just a disturbing one. It is that from beginning to end. It is that, but now it's a fascinating one because they were all looking at the same thing, and they were all reacting to the same thing. Ananias and Sapphira were dead, which raised for us this question a couple weeks ago that, again, we've been sitting in since then. The question is this, What was it that they saw, that they sensed? What was it that they feared that drove many people off, predictably? This was the surprise. It drew many others in. Because all the more were believing in the Lord. Well, my first swing at that a couple weeks ago was this. that for some, maybe, this strange and disturbing event had, in an unexpected way, stirred up a kind of out-of-left-field sort of hope. I mean, where did that come from, this story? Though mixed with fear, I think it stirred up hope that maybe, I don't know, just maybe, there could actually be a community of people, if it's not a church like a family, or maybe a church like the one that's meeting now in Acts chapter 5 at Solomon's Portico that actually tells the truth, where people in it actually tell the truth. Can you imagine that? No song and dance, no smoke and mirrors, no spinning of the truth, no pointing of the finger, no wondering what they really meant, no blowing smoke at all, which is, as I think you know, if you've been with us the last couple of weeks, is my in-the-pulpit way to say, no BS at all, no blowing smoke at all. There's none, because if you do, you're dead. On the spot, it gets exposed immediately. Wouldn't you love that? Indeed, it turns the water blue. Remember that? Immediately, which is the analogy I've been beating to death the last couple of weeks. I love it, but I actually like this one because it softens, actually, this story a bit. And the way I use this analogy was it's like when we go on vacation, we tell our kids when they're swimming in the pool that there's a chemical in the pool that'll turn the water blue immediately if you pee in the pool. So don't be pretending and acting all innocent, And please don't get offended if someone suggests, like maybe I suggest, that maybe it was you who peed in the pool because you turned the waterboard immediately. So all of us know, sorry, it was you. But now I ask this question. What if all of us knew, like here in this church, it was you? Or what if all of you knew it was me? It was hiding in the eye, posturing, posing, spinning it, shifting it, pointing the finger. Not here, it's over there. Winking the eye. And we know it. Not because we're so discerning and wise. But because every time someone in this church starts to spin it to hide it, deny it, posture it, it turns the water blue immediately. It gets exposed on the spot. We know, sorry, it's you. It's me. Well, if that happened, I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that a great fear would come upon the whole church and upon everyone who heard of these things, causing many to run from this church, to get as far away from this pool, if you will, as they passively could because of fear. But all the more, I don't know, maybe, to run toward this place, to jump into this pool as fast as they can, also because of fear. That's a different kind of fear. In both cases, running toward it, running away from it, there's a kind of fear, but it's a different kind of fear that draws people in, that moves people toward. Because now, I think, not sure, but I think that what they feared in Acts chapter 5, as they considered the plight of Ananias and Sapphira, whoa, was that they themselves could ever become good at what Ananias and Sapphira had become good at, the kind of people who in fact could hide it and deny it, spin it and shift it, point the finger, wink the eye. Indeed, to become good at that, I think, was now their fear because you can get good at it. And it doesn't take long, and it isn't that hard, and it often starts simply rooted as it is in some very human things that all of us share, this instinct that all of us have, not to blatantly lie, but to simply hide a little bit at first, and deny and cover and conceal those things about ourselves that we, this is human, this isn't evil yet. It's just to hide those things about ourselves, we don't want people to see, at least not clearly see, like our arrogance and anger, like our jealousy and fear, like our unforgiving spirit and our need to control. So we call it something else. It's not arrogance, it's confidence. I'm just a confident person. And it's not controlling. I'm leading right now. And we spin it just a bit. And we keep it in the dark. It began in the beginning. We kind of come upon this honestly, if you will, in Genesis 3 with Adam and Eve, whose first instinct when sin entered in was to do what we now do, hide it and deny it and cover and conceal it. to keep it in the dark. And they did it with a fig leaf. I love that. It's fascinating, really, that they thought that that would work because it didn't cover much. I don't know. Just guessing. Not very effective. I mean, you just look at that picture in your mind, the reality of the metaphor of it. It's fascinating because there they are thinking it worked. You look stupid. Sorry. It didn't cover much. Not impressive either. Not effective or impressive. So I like picking on them, too. That's another way to stay in the dark. Problem is, we've been doing that ever since. You know it's true. Though now our fig leaves are much more elaborate and much more refined, says John Eldridge. I think rightly. Such that now, he says, when you meet someone and think you know them, maybe you don't. Because all you really meant, maybe, was an elaborately constructed fig leaf designed from the beginning to do what we all do in one way or another, to hide it and deny it and spin it and shift it, to cover and conceal it, to keep it in the dark. Those things about ourselves that we don't want people to see, At least not see them clearly. And it's not always sinful things we're trying to hide. Sometimes it's just embarrassing things we're trying to hide. Like our weaknesses don't want to look like that. Or our fear don't show them that. Never let them see us sweat. That's a reference to two weeks ago when a member of the shirt, yeah. So it is. We don't call it this, but so it is, we lie. Variety of ways, for a variety of reasons, sometimes blatantly, but actually, most of the time, it's not blatantly. We do it with half-truths and flattering speech, with insincere smiles and inflated stories. Religious God talk is one of the best ways to kind of do your fig leaf, especially if you're in church, intending not to hurt anybody. It's never the intent to hurt anybody, at least not at first, but simply to, and we understand this part, protect ourselves, to save face, to avoid a consequence, to manage someone's impression. I want them to think this, so I'll act like that, to sell a product, to project an image, to gain an advantage, to do what you want, which is what you want, isn't it? I mean, isn't that the point, to get what you want? So we lie it, and we spin it, and we... But then, see, something happens. We didn't expect when we started in small ways to do this that we didn't foresee, that we didn't desire, we really didn't want this because we start getting good at this. We start getting slipperier and slipperier, shiftier and shiftier because it didn't, see. It didn't turn the water blue. And you didn't breathe your last, like Ananias and Sapphira did in Acts chapter 5, so you kind of got away with it. But as you did get away with it Get good at it Get slipperier and slipperier Shiftier and shiftier While you didn't die out here Things inside where you couldn't see it And you couldn't feel it Things inside began to die Just as surely as Ananias and Sapphira died Things inside began to die And as it turns out kind of significant things like character and integrity, authenticity and transparency. And when things like that die, people's ability to trust you dies. And when things like that die, relationships die. Marriages die. Families die. Churches die. They breathe their last, which gets us back to the fear, a great fear. Came upon the whole church, so be afraid of what? Be very afraid, hears of what? Getting good at this. Because you can't get good at this. Indeed, so good at this can we become that we deceive ourselves that we can't see ourselves, so we can't see and we don't know because we can't tell. that we're doing what we're doing even when we're doing it when we're hiding and denying and spinning and shifting and the reason we don't know and we can't see is because we've learned to live to live not just go there once a while but to live in the dark we've gotten good at it and in so doing we've managed to deceive ourselves and self-deception says Cornelius Plantinga on the quote I gave you last week, is the shadowy phenomenon by which we pull the wool over some part of our own psyche. We put a move on ourselves. Indeed, he then goes on to say in another quote that I didn't give you last week, this, that self-deception about our sin, not really being aware of what's really going on inside of us and why it is we're doing what we're doing is like a narcotic, the effects of which are a tranquilizing and disorienting suppression of our spiritual central nervous system. And what's devastating about that is that when we lack an ear for the wrong notes in our lives, we cannot play the right notes or even recognize those notes in the lives of others. So eventually, we make ourselves spiritually so unmusical that we miss the cues, that we miss the music, that we actually miss the main themes, he says, that God is playing in human life, which is a lot to miss. So if, for example, you're selfish and angry, arrogant, and controlling, but you're living in the dark about that, and you like it there, and you've learned to live there, then it's a pretty good possibility that you have no idea. You really do not know how your selfishness and anger, your arrogance and need to control affects the people around you. And when they protest, and eventually somebody probably will, try to shine a light on it some way. You either, we either, get really defensive because bright lights hurt the eyes. I mean, the metaphor of light is incredible. Ah, oh, it's exactly how you feel. Especially it hurts your eyes if you've been in the dark. Or you actually believe that it's their problem and not yours. Indeed, you're as a victim here. Because you've been living in the dark about what's true about you, which means in maybe some significant areas of your life, you have no clue at all, which creates some serious problems. The chief among them is this problem, particularly for those of us who are followers of Jesus. The problem is this. I gave this to you last week, too, 1 John 1, 5. Here's the problem. God's light. God is light. Indeed, verse 5, 1 John chapter 1 says this, and this is the message. It's like this is all of the message right here that we heard from him and now announced to you that God is light, and in him there is no darkness. In other words, no song and dance, no shifting shadows, no blowing smoke, none at all, which creates, again, a serious problem, especially if you've learned to live in the dark, because if we say we have fellowship with him, which is the next verse, with his God who is the brightest light, and yet walk in darkness, in other words, we've learned to live in the dark, you've gotten good at hiding and denying, posturing and posing, you lie about having fellowship with this God who is light, because you couldn't possibly be near this God who is the brightest light and in the dark at the same time. Man, this just touches so many things because it's just so weird for me. Because I grew up in church, like maybe many of you, and what we all wanted to know, I mean, all the time, what we all wanted to know was, am I going to heaven when I die? Are we going to heaven when we die? And we were told, yes. If you believe the right thing about Jesus and the right thing you need to know is that he died on a cross and rose from the dead to forgive you over your sins, which I believe is true, then you go to heaven when you die. But God is light. And in him there is no darkness, so what if? I don't know, this is weird. This is where my mind gets bent. What if all these people who believe the right things about Jesus, but actually in their lives, their actual lives, they spent most of their lives and spent tons of energy to learning how to live in the dark. Learning how to hide and to deny and to posture and pose, to shift their feet, to wink their eye, to point the finger, to live in the dark about their anger. I mean, they believe the right thing about Jesus, but you never met a more angry person in your whole life. Blind about that. About their arrogance, their jealousy, their fear, their need to control. pulls up weird questions for me. Because the question now is not, will you go to heaven when you die? Okay, what did I get to say? Yes! Well, I love you! I'm the pastor, so yes! Just wave my arm and there you go. So I don't think the question is, will you go to heaven when you die? Here's the question. Will you be able to stand it when you get there? Because God is light. And in him there's no darkness at all. And what occurs to me about that, and this is for me, wow. If I've really grown comfortable with the darkness and all the baloney I've lived with, I might not like it there. Because it's all going to be out there. I mean, that light might hurt my eyes. Just like it does now. which brings me now to the final question. And it's this. If we can, in fact, learn to live in the dark and get used to it there, because we can. And we have, all of us, me too. Can we also learn to live in the light? And this metaphor is incredible. I hope it's working for you because I can see it and get used to the light. Like, stay in it long enough. Okay, it's not hurting my eyes anymore. And if so, if we can in fact learn to live in the light, how? What does it take? A couple things. First, courage. It takes courage. Humility too. But generally, humility is not something someone has who's been living in the dark. You don't. So we'll wait on the humility. Start with courage. Honestly, the humility will come. Happens almost every Sunday. At the end of the free services, talk to people and walk out that side door. And if the sun is out, I think about it almost every time. I go, I'm not ready for it. I feel like I have to, I almost stop. It hurts. It hurts my eyes. And it almost knocks me over at times. And so when the light comes on and you just can't stand it and it hurts your eyes, do you have the courage to stay there in the light until you get used to the light? And you will get used to it. This darkness and light thing It's so spiritual You feel this every day Because if you stay there I never did it But you get out there and go oh like this And I want to go back in I never do because I know I'm going to get used to it But that is an incredible thing for what we feel emotionally When a light goes on Oh get me back in there So it's going to take courage To not go back in This place we've grown used to This is called the dark. And the first thing we need courage to do is this. We need to have the courage to quit lying about our lying. Because at some level, we all live in the dark. In ways we don't even know, and the reason we don't know the ways we live in the dark is because we're in the dark about those things. In ways we don't even know, we hide and deny and spin and point. and this is really, I think, actually good news. It kind of softens this word. We're all in this together, you guys. I know I got a lot of energy today. I'm like that. I am in this. This is coming at. We are all in this together. Which changes the conversation then between us from am I in the dark about anything pertaining to my life Two, in what ways am I in the dark? Because I am, and so are you. Trust me. In what ways am I in the dark? Assuming that you are. Because you are about something. So the courage is the courage to quit lying about our lying. Second, just begin to wonder why. When we do lie, and when we do hide and deny, when we spin it and point and continue, if it wasn't for them, why? When we do that, do we do that? Ever think about that? What's driving that? Could be many things, and getting to that helps sometimes because maybe it's fear. Or need to control, who am I trying to impress? Why did I go blah, blah, blah, talk on and on? Who was I trying to impress? Who was I trying to control, maybe, their impression of me? I think it's good to wonder. Is there a reason that I hide it and spin it for control, to manage impressions? Is it to win? Is it to look good? Is it to gain some advantage? To get people to do what I want them to do. In Matthew 5, Jesus talks about this, these Pharisees who are saying, in fact, he says, I want you to let your yes be yes, your no be no. And there's all these other guys going, I swear to God, by the altar, by the throne. And Jesus is just kind of cutting through all the BS there, saying, just let your yes be yes, your no be no. Why are you saying, I swear to God? Because you're trying to get them to believe you so they will do what you want. So do you have the courage to quit lying about your line and wonder why you do when you do? And start paying attention to even small lies. And wonder, I know these can be funny actually. You wonder why you even kick yourself. Why did I do that? Why? Why? When the phone rang at 7 o'clock in the morning and the friend on the other end of the line heard the sleep in my voice and said, Did I wake you up? I say, No! Been up since 5. how pathetic you know what how pathetic why do you do that me you do i do i've never done that there's another lie right there for you why is what they think about that whether i was up or not so important And let it go. Gee, wow. Finally. And this one's a bit risky. So I dare you to do this one. Ask someone who loves you. Someone who you trust. So how do you experience me? Like that last season we were just in or that conflict we had or whatever. How do you experience me? I mean really a friend or a spouse am I as amazing as I think I am or am I in the dark maybe something we close with this a promise I promise that if you can't find the courage in the face to come out of hiding and live in the lights. It will hurt at first, but you will get used to it. And if you do, I promise you two things. You will find freedom. You will feel clean. You will know forgiveness. You will experience grace. Operative words there are find, feel, know, experience. Not just in your head intellectually, Actually, 1 John 1.9 says it this way. Actually, it starts in 1 John 1.8. If we say we have no sin, it's not me, it's him. We actually are deceiving ourselves. That's that whole hiding thing. You've deceived yourselves. You actually believe it's not you. You have no part in this. If we confess our sin, bring out into the light what we all tend to hide in the dark, He is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us. David said it this way in Psalm 32. When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away through its groaning all day long as with the fever heat of summer. But when I brought out into the light what I'd been hiding in the dark, when I acknowledged my sin and my iniquity, I did not hide. Then you forgave me, and the guilt of my sin was washed away, so he found freedom. He felt clean, experienced forgiveness. He tasted grace, and so can you. First promise, you'll feel clean. Experience grace. Second promise, you'll make some new friends, actually. You'll actually experience community, maybe for the first time, because if you're hiding in the dark, posturing, imposing, constantly presenting to me and me to you your elaborately constructed fig leaf, then I can never know you and you can never know me because all you ever met, if all I ever gave you was my fig leaf, and all you ever gave me when you met me was your fig leaf, I never met you. I just met your image. I just met your false self. But if, 1 John 1, 7, look at that on the screen. But if we begin to walk in the lights, if we stop the song and dance, the shifting, the spinning, the hiding, we'll have fellowship with one another. Isn't that nice? Oh, this is huge. We'll have fellowship with one another, maybe for the first time. You'll actually make some friends, and your new friend might be an old friend who quit hiding, finally. But your new friend might be that guy or girl, that man or woman, that husband or wife who's beginning to say, I'm tired of pointing the finger at everybody else, of hiding and denying, of posturing and posing, of blaming my spouse or my kids or my parents, my boss or my therapist. It's me. I need to do me. And get into and discover what I'm hiding and denying, refusing to see about me. And if you have the courage and humility to learn to live in that light, I promise, I promise, you will find freedom. You will feel clean. You will experience grace, and you'll probably make some friends. So let's quit lying about our lying, and when we do, let's wonder why we do. Pay attention to even the stupid small ones and then invite some people in who you trust to help you see what you can't see about yourself because you've learned, like all of us have, to live in the dark. So seriously, how do you experience me? By the way, that's not an invitation to all of you. Tell me that. Some of you. What do you see about me that I can't see? and as you do, I promise one more thing. I promise one more thing. Just as sure as Ananias and Sapphira died, if you do these things, just as sure as they died, you will come to life. To more, ha, and more and more life. And I think that's a promise. Because if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we'll have fellowship with him. We'll have fellowship with one another. And the blood of his son will cleanse us from all the junk. And all God's people said, amen. Let's stand as we're dismissed. Help us by your power. Man, God, we can't do this alone. Help us by your power, your Spirit's power, to have the courage to come out into the lights, to get used to the lights, stay there long enough to get used to the lights so we can come to life. We pray these things be true among us in Jesus' name. Amen. you
