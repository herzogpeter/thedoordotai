We've been in Matthew, but we are specifically in a section now in chapters 8 and chapter 9 that is dealing specifically with what we've called the healing ministry of Christ or the miracles of Jesus. The last miracle we dealt with last week was verses 1 through 8. And what we saw was a paralytic who was dropped down by four friends into the lap of Jesus to receive healing. But what we found out was that he got more than physical healing. He got spiritual healing. And that was a real word to us. And it was a real manifestation of the real message in the miracles. Because what we discovered last week was that there's been a progression in these miracles. He started out in the very beginning in chapter 8 healing a leper. And then he healed the centurion slave. And then he healed Peter's mother-in-law. And that was a demonstration that Jesus does indeed heal physically. But then he went beyond that with the next miracle. And he calmed the seas. and the response of the disciples was that they were amazed that even the wind and the waves obey him, not just physical things, but he moves into the arena of nature. He is the Lord of that as well. But then he even went past that and he dealt with the demonic realm and with the word, not even with the word, with his very presence, the demons were buckled at the knees. And at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow and tongue confess that he is Lord to the glory of the Father. And we found out that he not only has authority in the physical arena, in the nature, in the arena of nature, but also in the spiritual arena relative to demons. But then last week what we discovered was this. Jesus saying through the miracle, I not only heal disease, and I not only calm the storm, and I not only cast out demons, but I can meet your deepest need. I can give you a clean conscience. And with the word he forgave this man's sin. And we also got last week the kingdom perspective on all the miracles in general. And that was found in verse 6 of chapter 9 when he said this, In order that you may know, that you may really know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to do what He cares about the most, and that is to forgive sin. He said then to the paralytic, Rise and take up your bed and walk. And what we discovered last week, that all of the miracles, the reason for all of the miracles, walking on the water, rolling away the stone, rising from the dead, healing the sick, casting out demons, is so that we would know He does the real thing, and that is forgive sin. As we come to verse 9, we need to understand that the theme is still the forgiveness of sin. But Matthew now is personalizing it, number one, for himself, and also giving us a picture of the real agenda of God. As we come to verse 9, let's read the text. And as Jesus passed on from there, from where? Again, we're filling in from Mark 2 and Luke chapter 5. Just know that as I fill in the blanks. He's leaving from there. That means he left Peter's house and the time in Capernaum, and now he's walking on a road. near the lake, the Sea of Galilee. And when he was on this road near the Lake of Galilee, the Sea of Galilee, he saw a man named Matthew. Matthew was talking about himself, speaking of his conversion. And Matthew was sitting in the tax office, and he, that's Jesus, said to Matthew, Follow me. And he, that's Matthew, rose and followed Jesus. And it happened that as he was reclining at the table in the house, again, filling in the blanks, the house is Matthew's. Matthew was having a party with a few of his friends. Matthew has just experienced the forgiving hand of God through Jesus, and he invited Jesus to be the honored guest to meet his friends. And Jesus is there reclining a table. And behold, the friends that Matthew brought were tax gatherers and sinners. They were the ones who came and were dining with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, Why is your teacher eating with tax gatherers and with sinners? And when he, that's Jesus, heard this, he said, it is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick. And go and learn what this means. I desire compassion and not sacrifice, for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners. And really, you need to hear this. He is saying these words to these Pharisees, and that last word to them would go like this. You need to know, Pharisees, I did not come to call you. I came to call them. That's why I'm there, and that's why I'm not with you. Let's pray. Father I believe that this message is at the very core of your gospel and if that is true then this message is very close to your heart and I pray in the name of Jesus that every work of the enemy in this place that would hinder this word being a clear one that it would in the name of Jesus be bound right now and Father that the heart of God would be heard today by every one of us myself included I pray for clarity and power the anointing of your spirit that your kingdom message would be heard among us here today in Jesus name Amen I believe that one of the most twisted perceptions that is perpetrated by Satan himself on the minds and on the hearts of men and women in the world but as I have it today in my mind today specifically in this country the United States, the twisted perception is this, that religion, that church, that a relationship with God is fundamentally for good people, for shiny people, for religious people, for clean people. If I were to give you a picture of churches around the world today, but specifically again around this or across this nation today, if I were to look at the kind of people that are filing through the doors, I think I would get the impression that religion is for the shiny and the clean and the good people because the sinners don't seem to be going there. The sinners don't seem to be welcome there. The fact is this, at the very core of Jesus' message and gospel is this message. My gospel is not for the righteous. It is not for the good people. It is for the sinners. But you need to clarify something, David. and I will right now. It is not just for sinners in general. You see, the gospel doesn't come and vindicate sinners who aren't broken over their sin. It is for a specific kind of sinner. Luke, in fact, at the end of verse 13, clarifies something. I did not come to call the righteous. I called sinners to repentance. The ones that the gospel comes to are the ones who are sinners who have responded to a call of repentance. they are the people who have come to realize that they are not rich and they are not increased with goods and that they are in need of something Revelation chapter 3 talks about people who are rich and increased with goods and in need of nothing and isn't it great and what they desperately need to see somewhere along the line is the truth about their lives is this they are miserable, wretched, poor, blind and naked and if they would see that about themselves they would be able to come into the kingdom of God the message of the kingdom is for people who have come to realize They are separate from Christ. They are excluded from the commonwealth. They are strangers to the promise. They are without hope and without God. And if it were not for the matchless grace of Jesus, they would be victims all their lives. In this particular text, we have one of the most definitive, comprehensive, revealing statements that our Lord ever makes in all of Scripture relative to the gospel of the kingdom. it is among the most important statements in all of scripture and it is found at the very end of verse 13 with these words I did not come for the righteous I came for sinners who are repentant religion is not for the good it is for the sinner who knows he needs a healer and he needs a savior it is for the broken it is for the hungry it is for the morning. It is the message we have been hearing ever since we've been in the book of Matthew. And Jesus here today is bringing it together with a crescendo that we cannot ignore. In 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 15 Paul says these words, It is a trustworthy statement and worthy of our full acceptance that Jesus Christ came into this world for one purpose, to save and to redeem sinners who knew they were sinners. And you know what Paul says? I knew that about me. I was not just a sinner. I was a sinner who came to know he was a sinner. In fact, I was the foremost of all of them. If anybody needed grace, it was me. But now as I even speak this way, a problem arises and I need to address it. The ones who get into the kingdom are the ones who are sinners and know they're sinners. But the Bible says this, all have sinned. So there's nobody who doesn't fit into the category of sinner. But there's a problem. There are people who have stuck themselves into the category of the righteous, thinking that they are. We know them as the Pharisees. And there are people who have a very hard time, number one, being breathless and amazed at God's grace, who have a hard time stirring up feelings of what a dirty, rotten, vile sinner they are. In fact, we live in a spirit of the age. the spirit of the age where we live, is any message like that is a vile message and put it aside. What we need to know is that among the people who have the hardest time, knowing that they have sin, are not the kind of people that Jesus is going to meet at Matthew's party. Those are the ones who know. Those are the ones who have it painted all over. They're reminded of it every day. the kind of people who have the hardest time responding to the message of the kingdom are the kind of people who normally will be at a gathering like this even who are filling the churches across this country this morning who are good, moral, religious church people who always did it right, not always did it wrong, our church is filling up more and more with people who are really aware of their sin and so messages like this that talk about sin, they're going, whoa, I mean I don't need it I know at all, if anybody, I could identify with Paul, the foremost of sinners. The problem is, in many churches, and it better not happen here because we'll have to keep confronting it, it will happen here. The kind of people who are most deaf to and blind to the message of the kingdom are not the sinners who are ready to walk away from the dust of their lives and hear repentance and hear forgiveness. They are the religious, the good, the moral, the righteous. Who this morning as we deal with this text, if you're very honest, in fact this is a little help for you, if you really want to submit yourself to this text, one of the things you need to do is enable to help you identify yourself possibly as one of the righteous. The way you'll be able to identify it is that you will be able to find yourself more able to identify with the response of the Pharisee than the party of Matthew kinds of people. when you see the Pharisees frustrated with the kind of people that Jesus was ministering to you might be able to identify better with their frustration than with Jesus who was reclining at table with publicans and sinners and if you find yourself better able to identify with them, you are identifying yourself as having a pharisaical problem. The kind of people at Matthew's party in verse 10 are the kind of people that we, in many ways, wouldn't let into our churches. And so it is that Matthew in verse 13 says, what you need to do is go and learn what this means. go and learn what this means I desire compassion and not sacrifice for I did not come to call the righteous but I came to call sinners to repentance and again I want to say this he is saying this go and learn what this means to Pharisees to religious people to people who grew up in the synagogue to people who know their Bible he is not saying that to the sinners at Matthew's party go have a Bible study guys and figure out what this one means i didn't come for you i came for them what we need to do this morning is figure out what that means to go and learn what this means and the way we're goingと do it is break the text into four parts the first thing we're going to do is hear matthews story and as we hear matthews story it's going to help us learn what jesus means when he said i didn'nt come for the righteous i came for the sinner the second thing we're going to do is we're going to go to matthews party and when we go to matthrews party we're going to geta little bit more of a glimpse of what it means when Jesus said, I didn't come for the righteous, I came for sinners. And then we're going to see and enter into the conflict that Matthew and the disciples had with the Pharisees. And when we see that conflict coming from moral, religious, good people upon the real work of the kingdom, we're going to get a little bit better picture of what he said when he means, I didn't come for them, I came for the sinners. And then when we hear the gospel of the kingdom from the lips of Jesus in verse 12 and 13, we're going to get a little bit better picture of what he meant when he said, come and learn what this means. I don't want sacrifice. Ritual. I don't want you just going to church and playing a game. I want compassion. That's what I want. We're going to learn what that means. Let's first of all hear Matthew's story. We've got to know this guy, Matthew. Saint Matthew. Writer of scripture. Filled with the Spirit. One of the chosen twelve. Pictured in a stained glass window somewhere, wouldn't he be? I don't know what kind of picture or image you've got of Matthew in your mind, Saint Matthew, but I have a feeling that if this guy who is coming out of the pages of scripture saw himself in a stained glass window, he would not recognize himself. You see, Matthew was a publican. Now a publican is simply a tax gatherer in Palestine. Now it wouldn't bother me so much to live next to a tax gatherer if he was my neighbor. If he worked for the IRS, he'd be the butt of some of my jokes, possibly, but it really wouldn't bother me that much. I would see him as someone with integrity and intelligence and having a good, solid job and someone contributing to society. The problem with the publican in this particular society, however, was this. Palestine at that time was being overrun by Rome and they were being dominated by Rome. The Jews not only were losing their country, they were losing their very identity. The Jews, the Romans, however, came into Palestine, got it under its tutelage, and then began to tax it. And the way that Rome taxed the Palestinian people, or the Jews in that area, was to sell franchises to Jews who lived there. And the franchise given to a particular person would be a business which would give him authority to collect taxes among his own people. The way the tax would run would be this. Rome would expect a certain amount. Let's say they wanted $40 a month. That's all that Rome cared about. The way the tax collector would make his money would be to get the $40 a month from the people and add 44 himself. So he would be getting $80 a month. What you got to do is put a picture together here of a tax gatherer, number one, being hard to handle anyway, even if he is straight, okay? I mean, I would like my neighbor who was working for the IRS, but I'd have problems with him near April somewhere. I'd go, I don't know about that guy. And he's so nitpicky. You got to add to that that this particular tax gatherer is working for the government that just overran us. It would be as if living in the United States, we became overrun by communism, and my neighbor went to work for the communists. collecting taxes for me, from me. And not only that, the money was going to them, it was going to him. He doubled it for himself. I would have some tension with him. They were greedy, dishonest, and heartless. There were two categories of publicans. One kind of publican was called a gabai. G-A-B-B-A-I. Gabai, he'd like him to do that, but he didn't. That's how you say it. Basically, this guy was in general taxation areas. Established kinds of taxes. He would collect things like property tax, land tax, income tax. And that wasn't so hard to take because you had to pay that even under the theocracy. So I had to pay those things. I'm kind of used to that. The thing that was hard to take, even in that one, though, was that he would be sticking something on the end for himself, and it was always more than he should have had. These guys got rich at the expense of their own people. Another kind of tax gatherer was what was called the moches. M-O-K-H-E-S. M-O-K-H-E-S. And that went beyond the general tax to other more incidental things. And by the way, even as I get into this taxation, we can identify with this as well. This guy would collect things like we have today. Food tax. There's a liquor tax. There's cigarette tax. If you fly a plane, you pay a tax. If you buy a new car, you pay a tax. If you go through the state of Illinois, you pay tolls for a tax. It's just the same kind of tax. You pay a road tax. Import tax. Export tax. We're used to that. We don't chafe on that too much. Well, we do, but we just know we're going to have to do it. The problem with the Mocas in Palestine was that there were no restraints whatsoever. He made things up. And they really did. And very often what they would do, they would situate themselves, because they had been given a franchise from Rome anywhere they would want, and they would set their tax offices up very often at busy intersections where people were coming and going. And everything they saw, they'd tax it. If you had an animal walk by, they'd tax it. Four hooves? Okay, five dollars a hoof. They'd cut off a leg, people were going through Palestine with three-legged animals. Did you know that? Just kidding. Just so they'd kind of get around the tax a little bit. They would get near the lake when fishermen would get off, on and off the lake. They would have a tax to leave. They would have a tax to come. They would have a tax for bait. They would have a tax for fish. Everything. Packages that would be going by on an intersection of people, if you had a package, they had the authority from Rome to stop you, open the package, see if there was anything of value there. If there was, you had to pay a tax. And by the way, for all of the publicans, all of the tax gatherers, whatever thing you wanted to add for yourself, they would support by throwing you into jail if you didn't pay, or literally forcefully executing or punishing you in some corporal way. Not only were there two kind of publicans, a Gabai and a Mocas, but there were two kind of Mocas-ses. the first was a great mochess this was the kind of person who would set up his tax office at a very important intersection where there was all sorts of traffic get all sorts of taxes there but he would never be there he would hire someone else to take the heat he would be there he'd do all the taxing he'd get punched in the face he would be reviled in the community and this other guy this great mochess would sit back in his huge house and nobody would ever touch him there was another one called a small mochess and this guy either maybe because his business wasn't that good or else he was just so downright greedy and callous to what anybody thought, didn't want to hire anybody because he'd lose a few pennies if he did that, and he didn't care what people saw, so he would sit in the tax office and collect the money himself, confronting everybody who went by. Guess what kind of tax gatherer Matthew was? He was not only a publican, he was a mokess. He was not only a mokess, he was a small mokess who sat in his office near the Sea of Galilee. By the way, according to Luke and Mark, right on an intersection that one of the roads went into Damascus, the other one went into the Orient. Everybody who came and went, went by him. We're talking hot spot for him. St. Matthew. Writer of Scripture. Stained glass window. The guy was a weasel. I got a picture in my mind of this guy and I got to share it with you. Some will be able to identify someone. Have you ever seen Rockford Files? It was a show a long time ago. You ever seen that? Okay, you remember the guy named Angel? That's this guy right here. That's Matthew. Kind of blows up the stained glass window, doesn't it? Now let me get you here back to earth because there was something fundamentally different, however, about Matthew than this guy I just talked to you about with Angel. In fact, that was funny, and I want you to put that aside because there was something that I know about Matthew that wasn't true about that weaselly guy I just referred to on Rockford File. And that was this. For whatever reason, we don't know. And what it was that was working in his spirit, we don't know. But what we do know this is this. That when Jesus said, follow me, without bladding an eye, he left what he had and followed him. And what that tells me is this. For whatever reason, the lifestyle that Matthew had and had accumulated for himself and the money that he had gathered had turned to dust for him. He had come to a place where he said, I am sick of the guilt. I am sick of the shame. I am sick of the chicanery and the hiding and all the weaselly things I do. And when someone finally offered forgiveness, he ran for the forgiveness. You need to know something else about his response to the forgiveness, response to relationship with God, and the call to follow. He was living in a religious culture that said to people like Matthew, you have gone over the edge. I'm sorry, pal, but church is for the good people. Church is for the religious, and the good, and the clean, and the shiny, and there is no way we are extending ourselves to you. You have gone over the edge. You are the kind of person we will preach about on Sunday morning, and talk about in terms of how to stay away from you, and everybody will nod their heads, yes, they really are vile, aren't they? But we will never come to you and offer you a hand and offer you forgiveness and cleansing. And Jesus, the Messiah, came to him and said, Matthew, follow me. Matthew was not just a sinner. Sometimes sinners involved in vile kinds of activity can be offered forgiveness and grace and decide to hang on to their vile activity and decide to hang on to their lifestyle and to their sin. They might even try to add Jesus to it, but it never works. Funny how it doesn't work. But Matthew had come to a point for whatever reason, this lifestyle is one I'm stuck with. I hate it. It is a burden to follow. Jesus isn't the burden that will lift me from the burden. No white knuckles hanging on to the decks. He left and he followed Jesus. He was a repentant sinner. He was broken over his sin. He was sick of his sin. Follow me. And he rose and followed. Volumes of things to learn there. One of the things we need to learn and hear and see in that little phrase, that little collection of words, is something we've been hearing all through Matthew, and that is this, that Jesus continually keeps getting response to his gospel and kingdom message from people who didn't make the team. They weren't the first stringers. They weren't the ones who went to church. They didn't look clean and they didn't look respectable. Why? I'll tell you why. Because I didn't come to call the righteous and the respectable and the ones who were all wrapped up and how respectable they were and how good they looked. I came to call sinners. Why? Why? Because righteous people don't need forgiveness. They desperately need forgiveness. They just don't know it. They are so wrapped up in how good they look and how much they know and all their synagogue activity that they never have a sense of brokenness and breathless need for forgiveness. That is why I didn't come for them. They never hear me. The only ones who hear me are the ones like Matthew whose lives are a mess, who it's all turned to dust for, and when they hear forgiveness, they run. I didn't come for them. I came for them. They never respond. They respond. It isn't that they don't need it. They just don't know they need it. And they hang on to their self-righteousness right into hell. And the ones that they wouldn't even have dinner with are the kingdom dwellers. I already said this, but another thing you need to click with is that Matthew was not just a sinner. He was a repentant sinner. a broken sinner. And the key is to follow him. When Jesus said, follow me, and he rose and followed, if you are going to follow, it means you left this. To follow him means you leave this. The picture that you have to have in your mind to understand this is not that of Matthew hanging onto his desk for dear life. wishing he could bring it with him this had turned to dust my only hope is you that's all I want and so he went Jesus offers a gospel to sinners but when he offers it he does not say follow me and stay there at the same time follow me and stay there atthe same time remember the narrow way if you're going to come in the narrow way if you're going into the kingdom you're going to come in a narrow way and that means you're going to drop everything it's a narrow way that means there's only room for you nothing else you leave that you follow him you leave your self-righteousness you follow him you leave all your performance you follow him you leave your tax table and your money and you follow him. Jesus is real little words. He just says, follow me. And some people didn't, some people didn't. And again, I hear these scribes echoing in my ears when Jesus said, follow me, let's leave the shore. The scribe said, I will follow you anywhere, but let me do this first or let me do that first. And they never came. And Jesus just said, follow me, follow me. And I'm not even going to say, leave all those things. See, again, I need to just put a finger on this. There's a way you could emphasize both these things. One way you could preach this is you've got to leave everything and follow him. You've got to leave everything. I'm not even, the emphasis is this. Follow Jesus. Okay? Follow him, Matthew. Matthew, follow me. If you do, by the very act of following him, you will leave that. And it won't be white-knuckle time. In fact, if you need to white-knuckle it to follow him, one of the things I know about you is you're not broken yet because broken people like Matthew, whose lives have turned to dust, don't have anything to hang on to, whose wealth has turned to mush, don't have anything to hold on to. They just follow. I got to have you. I don't care about that anymore. Those are the people who get in the kingdom. Matthew ran. There's something else I want you to see about Matthew in this verse. Because as he writes this verse, one of the things I'm reminded of is the fact that he is writing this from a position of having been an apostle. He is an apostle now. He is filled with the Spirit. He has seen the crucifixion of Christ. He has seen the resurrection of Christ. He has seen the ascension of Christ. He has experienced the filling of the Spirit. He understands that he is forgiven fully. He understands that he is an heir to the kingdom. He is a joint heir with Christ. He does not have some sort of a problem with his identity or some sort of self-concept that I'm really some sort of a weasel. He understands he's a king. He's a reigner with God, a son of God, redeemed and holy. But you know what? He never forgot the old neighborhood. He never forgot the pit from which he was dug. and I have a feeling that when he was writing this gospel and he thought of and recounted the miracle of forgiveness that came to this paralytic and then he saw and wrote down the response of the people who saw this paralytic get forgiven they were filled with awe and they glorified God and people were amazed that that guy could get forgiven but I think under the inspiration of the Spirit something else happened to Matthew it really is amazing that God forgives sin And it really is amazing that that paralytic got forgiven. But I'm going to tell you what amazes me even more than that. God not only forgives paralytics, God forgave me. And I remember the pit that I came out of. And whenever I think of God's grace, it amazes me. And it causes me to fall to my face and thank and worship God. I think that a little thing for believers here. I think we do well to remember what he pulled us out of. and don't let that turn into some sort of worm theology because I am not that anymore and that's the wonder of it I am not that weasel anymore Matthew could see I am not that person anymore God has redeemed me and forgiven me and made me new and given me an inheritance that's incorruptible and undefiled and it will never fade away but even as I say those words some among us and the kind of people generally who would be at a gathering like this in a church could hear Matthew recount the fact that he got dug out of a pit and even Paul in 1 Timothy 1 one of the things he did this is a trustworthy statement and worthy of our full acceptance that Jesus came to forgive sinners one of the things he says in the verse just before that it was this I was a blasphemer and a persecutor of the church. I was acting in ignorance. I didn't know what I was doing, and Jesus came to me and forgave me, and it blows me away. He remembered the old neighborhood. And some of us hear that and go, you know, I really have a hard time identifying with that because I wasn't dug out of a pit, and I've really always done it right. I have trouble being amazed at God's grace, and I have trouble feeling like God dug me out of a pit at all. Let me say something to you. I don't want to be mean, but I need to say this as clearly as I can. You need to note that if that is your response, at least in this juncture of this talk, you are more capable of identifying with the Pharisee than you are with Matthew. You are more capable of identifying with the Pharisee than you are with the friends of Matthew at his party. You see, like the Pharisee, you always did it right. Like the Pharisee, you grew up in the synagogue. You've always known this. Like the Pharisee, you've always been moral. Like the Pharisee, you were religious, you were righteous. Like the Pharisee, you might love and receive and be comfortable with people just like you. And it really drives you crazy when sinners and Matthews and those kinds of people start invading our church. And it upsets you. And you actually believe that Jesus saved you and that you were a sinner because the Bible says all have sinned, but you really do believe that he didn't have to save you from very much. And when I say you, I don't know who you is. It may be nobody. I hope nobody. But you feel like that because you really didn't break the law much, and you're sure you're a sinner, but you were a good sinner. But you need to know that that attitude is why the righteous go to hell. because they never come broken. Generally, when that kind of person even responds to Christ in any way, it is not the kind of response that you see among the broken, hungry, mourning sinner that Jesus had ministry with. It is the kind of thing that says, well, I've done everything right, and one more right thing I'm going to do is pray this prayer. Never broken over your sin. Do you think that we have churches full of Pharisees? Maybe. If the American church is not characterized at some point by Phariseeism, then we're the first ones. It was here. Religion is for good people. It's for clean people. It's for rich people. And the sinners who would respond to the real message of the kingdom, We never go see them. See. And Jesus says with ringing clarity, you guys don't get it. You need to go and learn what this means. Learn what this means. I desire compassion. Not your ritual sacrifice. Not your coming to church. I didn't come for the righteous. I came for sinners. Because they're the ones who respond to a call of repentance. The righteous are wrapped up in their own righteousness going straight to hell. let's go to Matthew's party let's go to Matthew's party verse 10 and it happened as Jesus was reclining a table in the house of Matthew I'll add he asked his friends and we all know that his friends were the elders from the local synagogue well they weren't the text even tells us they were tax gatherers publicans mokas small mokas large mokas and sinners and they came and were dining with Jesus and his disciples. Jesus was the honored guest. Publicans and sinners. Sinners is simply a broad category of word. It's just kind of an all-encompassing word. It includes everybody. But to kind of keep going with the picture I've got in my mind, a sinner is just generally the kind of person you do not associate with a holy gathering. It's not the kind of person you associate with a holy gathering, a religious gathering experience, are good people, nice people, shiny people, not this kind of people. And the reason that is significant is because Jesus finds himself reclining a table here. He is in their midst. I was sharing with Peg Longley before she was sharing with me how one of the little insights of this was the very fact of him having dinner was more than just eating a dinner, but it was a sign of acceptance, And it was a sign of, I'm with you and I'm committing myself to you guys. And that was incredible to these religious good people. Obviously. I believe, and I don't know if I can paint this in your own mind, but I believe that Matthew's party, as Jesus is reclining a table and he looks around and sees the kind of people who are at this party and he sees Matthew who was what he was but he was just redeemed and he sees all these people. By the way, I think the party probably was called before Matthew was ever redeemed. I think they were probably going to have a party anyway. They were going to come together and maybe work out some shady deals and maybe get blasted and do some dope. I don't know what they were going to do, but Matthew thought, I'll tell you what, I just got forgiven. This stuff has turned to dust for me and I know some friends who are living in the same dust I am and maybe if they would hear a message of forgiveness and maybe if they would meet the forgiver, they would respond the same way I did. so he brought his friends, and Jesus is the guest of honor. And I think Jesus, as he was looking around, and then he considered the Pharisees outside the door. In his mind's eye, he said this. I think this is what my kingdom looks like. And this is what church looks like to me. Full of sinners who are ready for repentance. Full of broken down people who are saying, my only hope is you. With a bunch of religious people outside saying, I don't believe you're having dinner with them. you see Jesus is going to moving among and offering the kingdom of God to sinners broken people who are ready for repentance he is offering the kingdom to Matthew picture this it won't be hard to picture this pastor you will never believe who I saw in church last week I'll get this call on Tuesday okay not this week I won't but Do you know that someone came into our foyer, and I was there, and I smelled liquor on his breath? I did. And I really believe I smelled cigarette smoke on his breath as well, and marijuana too. I think so. And I saw someone in our church just a few weeks ago. You know, I'm really sad. People come to our church, and he was wearing a T-shirt. He was, and it had a swear word. It had a swear word on the T-shirt. And I know someone who came here, and I don't know, but he's a homosexual. I know it. Now, some of you might think I'm saying that all those things are okay, and I'm not. But here's the response to that person. The response is this. Fine. We had someone here with alcohol in her breath and her smoking dope, and they came in loaded, and maybe they're homosexual, and that is all absolute sin. We're going to deal with that. But let me ask you a question. Did you offer them the kingdom? Did you call them to repentance? Did you tell them there was another way to go and they didn't have to eat dust anymore and that they could become a son of God forever? Did you tell them that? No, no, I asked them to leave. Like any good Christian would. I avoided him, I shunned him. And see, that's why I didn't come for the righteous, I came for sinners because they're the ones who respond. You've got to put a trigger in your mind here. If you would find yourself uncomfortable at Matthew's party, you are identifying more with the Pharisee than with the kingdom people. And you better take a real hard look at that. Let's enter into Matthew's conflict, verse 11. When the Pharisees saw this, that Jesus was reclining at table with these people, having dinner with those guys and not having dinner with them. See, by the way, the Pharisee, if this guy's really a godly man, what's going to happen is he's going to have dinner with us because we are the holy ones and we are the religious ones. And after all, we built a temple, so where he's going to spend his ministry time is with us holy ones, making sure we're happy. That's the normal flow of ministry. Make sure we're happy. He's going over there making sure that they're hearing the kingdom message. I don't get it. He's having church over there. It doesn't even look like a church. It doesn't look like a synagogue. His conflict. They came and said to his disciples, by the way, that's a little note I want you to grasp. Isn't it interesting that they didn't say this to Jesus directly? One of the problems with hypocrisy and one of the signs of hypocrisy is that it is hardly ever straight. Doesn't go to the person, goes to everybody else. Goes to his disciples. Did you tell me why is he doing that? Why don't you go ask him? Well, it's great because he heard. That's a breakthrough, by the way, that the Pharisees were cornering the disciples. How come he's doing that stuff? And Jesus overheard. That's a break. That happens, by the way. This dynamic happens in the church all the time. Grumbling all the time. And every once in a while, God gives a gift. The pastor hears it. It's great. Because then you can confront it. And as the conflict emerges and they're all mad because he's ministering to sinners, Jesus begins to bring the gospel, the good news of the kingdom, and he starts with an analogy. You see, when he heard this, he said, listen, you guys, it is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick. Pharisees, religious types, good people, churchgoers, synagogue goers, I got news for you. From your own mouth, Pharisees, you have confessed that the people I'm having dinner with are the worst. Right? Well, let me tell you something from a medical perspective or ask you something. What kind of a doctor do you think it would be who would stand aloof and just look at people and diagnose, oh yes, he has that vile disease, and oh, they've got another one over there, and yes, I spot that as that disease, what a disgusting thing. But never, ever was with sick people. What kind of doctor would that be? Ineffectual, absolutely irrelevant. And Pharisees, that is a word for you. And if there are Pharisees here, that is a word for you. Because Pharisees would generally sit in their synagogues and stand in their pulpits and pontificate wonderfully on the vile nature of the world we live in. It is a vile world out there. Sin is out there. Let's stand here and be holy. But they were never doing anything to heal the sin. Ever. And if sin came around and when the holy man, the God-man, came to earth in the name of Jesus and went among the sinners, they were totally blown away and it totally contradicted every perception they had of who religion was for. It is for the good people. No, it isn't. I didn't even come for them. I came for them. And I'm afraid many churches are like that. God forbid that that ever creep in here. It has been here. We have seen that kind of thing. Some of us have grown up in that kind of thing where we stand in our pulpits and with great clarity are able to diagnose what a scummy culture we live in and never go to the sin to heal it. Let me tell you, what kind of doctor is it who never is around sickness? What kind of a Messiah is it, healer is it, that is never around sin? What kind of a church is it that never has sinners there who don't fit in, Who are not made new yet. Who need to hear that what they're eating is dust. And we start offering them the bread of life and the water. The living water of Jesus. Brilliant to diagnose. Very few bring healing. That's what we need to be about. But he went on from there and he said, Now go and learn what this means. I desire compassion and not sacrifice. That's a quote out of Amos 6.6 where he said this, I am not concerned and I am not moved by your ritual. What I want is compassion and mercy. Basically what he's saying is this to the Pharisees then and the Pharisees now. Your little churchy thing that you come to every Sunday really makes me sick. It just drives me crazy. Because you go and you feel good because you go and you do all your little churchy things and you listen to radio all week long and you isolate yourself completely from a lost and dying world and you feel spiritual because you do that. And Amos 5.22 says the same thing. The people who thought they were people of God, he says this, I hate your festivals. I take no delight in your solemn assemblies. When you come to church, I don't come. I won't even look at your offerings. I take the noise of your songs away, and I will not listen to the harp that you play anymore. The only time, you need to understand this, God's saying, the only time I receive those things, the only time I like your festivals, and I delight in your solemn assemblies, and I come to church, and I bless your offerings, and I delight in your songs, and in the sound of your harp, is not when you sing good, and you preach good, and you play the harp good. It's when you've got a contrite, broken heart coming to me saying this. My only hope is Jesus. That's when I receive it. But all you've got is a ritual, and it looks great, but there is no compassion because you're not reaching anybody, and if they don't look like you, you don't like them. And here's the final word to you, and this is a hard one, Pharisees. I didn't come for you. you're so worried about if we're doing it right you're so worried about people who are looking kind of scummy coming into church but you need to know you who think you're the most spiritual I didn't even come for you I came for them so I'm not going to spend my time with you and I'm not going to have dinner with you and I want you to turn with me to Luke 15 as I close this and nail the final word down and all this is going to do is take what he just said there I came not for the righteous, but I came for the broken, the dirty, the repentant sinners. And they are the only ones I came for. And we will see this in Luke 15. I'm just going to read them. There's three of them. Verse 1. Now all the tax gatherers and the sinners were coming near to Jesus to listen to him. And both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble again, saying, This man received sinners and he eats with them too. By the way, that sets up all the parables we're going to read. So the issue that we're talking about is Pharisees who are grumbling because he's not having dinner with holy people and because religion is for good people, he's totally turning the whole thing upside down and he's eating with sinners. And Jesus told him a parable that would confront that saying this, what man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the 99 in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors saying to them, rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost. Stop right there. In verse 7, he is going to give the interpretation of that verse and what he means. But I want to give you what I've always thought of that verse first. I've always pictured in my mind this. The 99 is the people of God, and that's church, and we're all the true believers, and we all really love Jesus, and we're not having any problems, and we're not having any pain. But one among us, or that's the 100, but one among us wanders off, and the true shepherd will leave the 99 who are faithful and pure and okay, leave them there, and go and get the wandering sheep and bring them back. nothing could be further from what Jesus is saying here. How do you know that? Well, read the verse. First of all, I set it up. He's talking to and confronting self-righteous Pharisees who think they're the most spiritual and saying, why is he eating with them and not with us? And he says this to them, I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over that one broken, mourning, hungry, repentant sinner, that Matthew who repents, there will be more joy over them than the 99 righteous persons who don't need repentance. Far from the 99 pure and holy, and they're okay, and they don't have any problems. I'll go here and take the stumbling one. The 99 in the mind of Jesus is a picture of the Pharisees, the self-righteous, the many and the few, the many and the few. And he says to them, I am not going to spend my time here because you guys never will receive it. What you want me to do is sit with you Pharisees, pacify you, pat you, tell you how holy you are, appreciate how much you do for God, and spend all my time there while the ones who would respond to the kingdom message wander off and never do go there. I never get there. What I'm going to do is leave these self-righteous ones, bye-bye, and I'm going to go get the one who is ready to hear that there is water for thirsty people and there is food for hungry people. And by the way, if you're in ministry or you're thinking of going into ministry, you need to hear that word loud and clear. Because when you go into a church, any church, you are going to have 99 in your group and there are going to be self-righteous people who want you to spend all their time with you, patting them, telling them how holy they are, wonderful, and you spend all your time there and you will never get to the only people who will respond to the kingdom message. And they are the broken, the hungry, the mourning. They will never do that. You need to hear something. The 99 are not the holy ones that we will leave because they're okay. They are the Pharisee. They are the many and the few. And you need to know that God is totally indifferent to the 99. It says so there. There is more joy over one sinner who repents. than over 99 righteous people who are sitting there thinking they're so holy, who never do the work of the kingdom, who never come broken. They don't even know what it feels like. They've never been there. They're not redeemed. They look great. They fill churches across this land today. And they are among the many. I'm going after the broken, the sinner. That is the agenda for your ministry. If you're going into ministry, you better make it that because that's what Jesus went after. Then he tells about ten coins and one rolls away. Ten coins don't have souls. There is no choice in the matter. So he's just making a metaphor. And again, the metaphor is this. Leave the nine. They're all wrapped up in their righteousness and how secure they are. And they want this church to be this wonderful place where they can feel good. Get out of there. Go get the ones who are ready to hear. And then he tells another one in verse 11 about a boy, a son. You've heard this story, the prodigal son who takes his father's fortune and he's living in rebellion and he ends up to his eyeballs living in dirt and eating with pigs and squandering his father's inheritance. But then in verse 18, we hear a beatitude attitude and there is brokenness and I will get up, verse 18, and I'm going to go to my father and I'm going to say to him, Father, I've sinned against heaven and in your sight and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired men. And he got up and he came to his father but while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And his son said to him, Father, I've sinned against heaven and in your sight, and I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. But the father said to his slaves, Quickly go out and get the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet and bring the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry, for this son of mine was dead, but he has come to life. And he was lost, but he's been found. And they began to be merry. And that's the picture of the kingdom. And that's a picture of Jesus redeeming people who know they're sinners, who know they need help, who know they need forgiveness, and their only hope is the grace of God. That's exactly what that's a picture of. But he had a son, another son, verse 25, who was in the field. And when he came and approached the house, he heard the music and dancing, and he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things might be. And he said to him, Your brother's come, that's what's up. And your father has killed a fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound. And I got a feeling the father really expected the other brother to be happy because he probably figured he had a right heart too, but he found out he didn't. He was just a picture of Pharisaical, pious religiosity who was totally self-righteous. But he became angry. Interesting, I've been saying this for weeks. The way you can spot hypocrisy in the church, the Pharisees in the church, is that when God begins to move and do the work of the kingdom, the people who he reached begin to come and the Pharisees don't like it. He became angry and was not willing to go in. I'm not going to go there anymore. I'm not going to go to that party. And his father came out and began to say, Hey, come on in. This is incredible. God's here. But he answered and said to his father, Look, for so many years I have been serving you. I went to Sunday school. I've been on the board. I built a church. I did it right, and I never neglected a command of yours. I've done it right all my life. And yet you have never given me a kid that I might be married with my friends. What a picture. I don't know if I can put words on how powerfully it explodes in my mind and in my spirit, how that looks like every kingdom field. The kingdom of God is like a field. It's full of wheat and tares. It's full of people redeemed who've come broken. It's full of sons who are self-righteous who don't want to be there when God begins to move. It just looks like that in any church you're going to be in. I'm not picking on our church. I think it's here in our church. I see it all the time. But it's in any church. And like those spoiled sons, self-righteous sons, I've done it right all my life. I don't get it. You know, some of you might, again, be able to identify with him. You know, kind of going, yeah, you know, I kind of sympathize with that guy. He was good. He did it right. And now the one who repents is getting all the attention. I mean, I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to repent of. I've done it right. That's what you're supposed to repent of. The audacity that you really believe that you don't need to repent. What you need to repent of is your self-righteousness. And I'm going to tell you something. Hear this and never forget it. You probably will. Do it anyway. I just want the Spirit to brand this on your spirit. We see as people who've gone over the edge in sin as being beyond hope sometimes. But you need to know that Jesus' grace reaches that time and time again. When we go there where those people are and they hear about forgiveness, they respond. The sin that is so hard to reach is not that of the publican and sinner. The sin that is so hard to reach is that of the good, moral, religious, synagogue goer all his or her life who really doesn't have a sense that they've done anything wrong. And they never came broken to Jesus. They just added Jesus. And that is why they never have breathless gratitude for grace, because they never really saw their own sin. Verse 8, chapter 18. Another one very quick. Verse 9. He also told this parable, verse 9, chapter 18, to certain ones who trusted in themselves that they were righteous. I'll wait for you to find it. I want you to read this with me. He told this parable to certain ones who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and viewed others with contempt. Two men went up to the temple, one a Pharisee, the other tax gatherer. And the Pharisee stood and was praying thus to himself, God, I thank thee that I am not like other people, swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax gatherer. You know what he's saying there? He's saying, God, I thank you that I'm not like the people at Matthew's party. I'm so thankful that I'm not like them. I fast twice a week. I pay tithes of all I get. But the tax gatherer, standing some distance away, was unwilling even to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast and saying, God, be merciful to me, the sinner. and I tell you this day I did not come for the Pharisee I came for the sinner and I'm going to walk away from the Pharisee and I'm going to go to the sinner and I'm going to avoid that guy and I'm going to go to that guy and that is where I'm going to spend my time and that is where the ministry is going to happen the churches in that day were filled with Pharisees the churches in our day are very often filled with Pharisees I tell you this day this man who was broken went to his house justified rather than the other for everyone who exalts himself shall be brought down humbled but he who humbles himself brings himself down comes broken shall be exalted last one I just read it and close chapter 19 verse 1 the story of Zacchaeus and he entered and was passing through Jericho and behold there was a man called by the name of Zacchaeus he was a chief tax gatherer and he was really rich and he was trying to see who Jesus was and was unable because of the crowd for he was small in stature. And he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see him. And he was about to pass through that way and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down for today I must stay at your house. And he hurried and came down and received him gladly. And they sought the Pharisees, the self-righteous, and they began to grumble saying, he has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner. But Zacchaeus got redeemed. He got changed. Great picture. Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor. Remember Matthew? Follow me. It was not white knuckle time. Oh, I want to hang on. This is dust. This is dust. The mark of the truly redeemed is that they follow him and leave that. And letting go of his money was no big deal. Why? Because he was broken. One of the things that some people need to let go of is sin. You need to let go of that. You hang on to it, that's right. You need to let go of that. The thing that the self-righteous needs to let go of is their self-righteousness. And that's what Paul said in Philippians when he said, if you want to know somebody who did it right, I did it right. I was circumcised the eighth day of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews as to the law of Pharisee. I did it right. I did it right. But you need to know something. I consider that dung now. That is garbage to me. When I compare that to the surpassing value of knowing Christ, I followed him and I left self-righteousness. It is harder to get a self-righteous person into the kingdom, just like it's hard to get a rich person. And you know why? Because they hang on to their money and they hang on to their self-righteousness right straight into hell. He gave it all back and in verse 9, Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house because this guy here is the son of Abraham. And then the greatest words in all of Scripture, For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save those who are, what? Lost. Sinners, and they know it. And nobody else. would you stand let's pray Father I just want to ask that your spirit be released here to do among us what you need to do again I believe that this message is close to your heart I pray that my words whether good or not whether clear or not would be circumvented by your spirit so that the true essence of the message would be heard. That those who are among us today, who are hanging on to their righteousness as their source, would be convicted by your Spirit and realize that the sin they have to repent of is far worse than that of Matthews or the prostitutes. It is that in the face of God they dare to feel self-righteous. And I pray this morning that those who are like a Matthew, that those among us who may be very aware of the sin, that they would hear the good news from the Redeemer, that they could follow Him. But they need to hear the full thing, too, that to follow Him means to leave that. And there are some this morning who may need to repent. And I pray that the power of your Spirit would be here for repentance, and I pray that forgiveness again would flow here like a river, that people would know before they leave that they are clean before you, that it would come to the righteous and to the sinners. Do your work among us. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
