Okay, here we go. Ephesians 4, 11 and 12. I'll give you the shortened version here. Ephesians 4 is all about the body of Christ. The first several verses in Ephesians 4 talk about unity. The next few verses talk about diversity. The diversity is due in great part to our gifting, being different from each other. Verses 11 and 12 tell us how the body of Christ is to be structured. verse 11 says and he gave some as apostles some as prophets some as evangelists some as pastors and some as teachers he mentions five giftings or five offices some want to call it okay that reflect gifts of apostleship prophecy evangelism pastoring and teaching he says those five gifts are to be used in such a way as to verse 12 to equip the saints for the work of service and so verse 11 is gifts given for the purpose of equipping. And those equipping gifts mentioned are apostleship, prophecy, pastoring, evangelism, and teaching. The primary use of an equipping gift is expressed in a way that prepares and trains someone to accomplish a task or serve a person. In other words, a person with one of those gifts is what I would call an equipper. they make a deposit in someone else so that that someone else who's now been deposited into can now go and make a contribution elsewhere. So if you weren't here today, if I have the gift of teaching, and you don't show up today, no one comes today, am I going to use my gift? No. Why would I use my gift of teaching if nobody's here? But now on the other hand, our sound guy came earlier this morning or yesterday to set up all the sound stuff. Nobody was here, and yet he did all his setup. Well, his gift didn't require, if he has a gift of helps, it didn't require anybody being here. No, because in this case, he was doing something, a task, that made a direct contribution. That is, prepared the room so that when I spoke, I could be heard. All right, now, verse 12 says that equip saints, serve one another, and in turn, build up the body of Christ. Equip saints, serve one another, and in turn build up the body of Christ. Verse 12, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ. And so there are other spiritual gifts which are more of a serving nature. I'll give you some examples. The gift of helps. Or service, if you want to call it that, serving. Administration. Mercy. Hospitality. Giving. Encouragement. Healing. Wisdom. Discernment. Those are all serving, examples of serving gifts. Now, a serving gift, the primary use of a serving gift is expressed in a way that a person or a task is affected directly by the gift. It's affected directly by the gift. meaning if a person's going to use the gift of mercy who's the recipient? a person with the gift of mercy if they're going to use it the recipient needs to be in need of mercy a person with the gift of encouragement uses it on a person who needs to be encouraged a person with the gift of helps uses it in doing a task or in serving somebody who needs help okay so what happens here this is the way the body of Christ is structured God gives some people gifts which are intended to make deposits in other people who as a result of being deposited into now have the resources, the energy, the spiritual input, the instruction, whatever it is that they need in order to then go out and do what God has called them to do in serving. And he said when this happens the way it's supposed to happen, then the body of Christ gets built up. In verses 13 to 16, spell that out. When the body of Christ is structured like 11 and 12 says, all kinds of good things happen, verses 13 to 16. All right, now. Now, those with equipping gifts must be identified and placed in roles which enable them to equip servers. And those with serving gifts must be identified and placed in roles which enable them to serve others. All right, now this is a very important distinction because when you get people who are in reverse roles, all kinds of bad things happen. now that doesn't mean that you are either a server or an equipper what it means is that your spiritual gifting and who you are as a person is probably primarily either of an equipping nature or a serving nature and if you're primarily wired to be a server that's your gifting that's your personality that's who you are then you need to be in a role that enables you to serve if however your gifting is primarily of an equipping nature and that's kind of who your personality is and your temperament and your experience in life then you need to be in an equipping role and by the way the people who lead in the church should be the equippers because the leaders are the ones who are called to make the deposits in the people who end up doing the work of service now often times is not the way the body of Christ is structured because most ministries are started by servers Why are ministries started by servers? Because servers see the need. Need shows up. So they say, I'm going to do something about this to meet the need. Well, if they begin to do it and bear fruit, then the ministry begins to grow and more needs are being met. And eventually the ministry becomes something that now all of a sudden that server is no longer in a position where they're continuing to serve because now they're having to raise up other people to do the serving. and all of a sudden they say, something's not working. Right. Because your role got transitioned to being an equipper and you're not primarily an equipper. So what we need to do is we need to let you go back to serving. We need to bring somebody else in who's an equipper. Okay? Now, what happens? What happens when you get a server in the role of an equipper? Okay? Well, just give you a few fill in the blanks here. They will do the work themselves. They do it themselves because what do they do best? They serve. They don't delegate best. They serve best. They seldom attract others. Well, yeah, it's hard to attract other people when you do everything yourself. The ministry lacks vision and strategy. It lacks vision and strategy because vision reflects what? A big picture of the future. And what does a server see? Right here. They see the need right here. So therefore, you get into a ministry that's run by a server, and you say, you know, where's the vision? An equipper will see that. Where's the vision? Well, what do you mean, what vision? Well, I mean, what's the picture long term? Where do you see this thing going? How do you see this thing playing out? What's your grand plan for how you plan to build this ministry? Oh, we just want to serve more and more people. Well, yeah, I know that. how do you plan to do that well we're just going to you know just keep you know doing it as we do it I know that but when it gets to be more people than what you can personally serve or a few others around you what are you going to do then well I don't know we'll figure out when we get there I don't want to figure out when we get there I'm going to figure it out now you see because equipers tend to be people who see the bigger picture see down the road because you see as an equipper what they want to do is they don't want to do the job themselves They want to bring other people on board in order to help make it happen. So a ministry that is ultimately led by a server often lacks vision. They stifle the growth of the ministry. Yeah, they stifle the growth of the ministry because their serving is limited to them and the few people around them. They do a mediocre job of serving. Yeah, they do a mediocre job of serving because eventually they get spread too thin. And finally, they often become frustrated or overwhelmed. All right, now flip it around. What happens when you get an equipper in the role of a server? Their development is stifled. As a person, their development is stifled. In other words, what you've got is you've got an individual whose contribution is potentially greater than what is being expressed, and so this person is frustrated that they feel like they can do more, but they can't do it because they've been told to do only this. And they want to spread their wings, and they want to get out and do some other things, and they're being told, no, do this. You see, equipers are not wired to be the primary servers, they're wired to be the people who build into the servers who do the work. They end up lacking fulfillment. Yeah, they lack fulfillment because this is not... They say, this is all there is. This is what I'm here to do. They become a burden to leaders over them. Yeah, they become a burden. When you get an equipper underneath the leadership of a server, three months down the road, they'll have a broken relationship. More times than not. And they wonder, why is our relationship? We were such good friends before. Now all of a sudden we start to work together. We thought it would be a great thing, and all of a sudden we're at each other's throats. Why is that? Well, it's because this server can't get this equipper to just be content serving. And this equipper can't figure out why this server isn't leading more effectively. And so they start to point fingers at each other and blame each other. And really, there's nothing wrong with either their walk with Christ. It's not that they stop liking each other. It's not that they stop being friends, etc., etc. It's just that they need to switch places. So that the equipper is free to lead, and the server is free to serve. Now, in many cases, that's a tough transition to make, especially if a ministry is empowered by a server, because for a server to come to a place of saying, this ministry, in terms of its size, is passing me by someone else needs to come over and take this over and take it the next leg of the race i want to just go back to serving is a major ego adjustment and and our pride and our ego gets in the way and we say well i should be continuing to climb the ladder no no no friends that's corporate america that's not the church the church isn't about climbing the ladder we're not climbing the ladder. There is no ladder. Okay? We're not climbing anything. What we're doing is we're finding out who God made us to be, and then we're getting the anointing of the Spirit of God, and we're doing what God called us to do. Okay? Ego is our enemy. That's the flesh. Okay? Don't let it get in the way. Be who God has made you to be. Do what He's called you to do. Alright? Finally, they end up stifling the growth of the ministry yes because they bring an air of frustration their their own personal frustration begins to impact the ministry all right in the pages that remain the difference between equippers and servers in terms of just some observations of mine over the years okay no chapter in verse but just observations over the years to help you discern maybe which you are primarily okay equippers focus their efforts on developing others to serve. Whereas servers focus their efforts on serving others directly. An equipper, their ministry is all about who else can I get to do this? A server just wants to do it. Two, equippers are fulfilled when they see God use someone they trained to meet a need. Whereas servers are fulfilled when God uses them to meet a need personally. Equippers get as big a bang out of seeing someone they trained to see God use another person as anything. Whereas a server doesn't get the same delight out of that. They get the delight out of seeing God use them. Three, Equippers long to do ministry with and alongside others. Whereas servers are content to do ministry alone. Not all the time. It depends how relational a person you are, but often. Four, equipers are intentional about selecting ministry partners. Equippers, they conduct a draft. just like the NFL or the NBA because they're you see key to them is who they work with so they don't want to work with just anybody so they're intentional about who they pick whereas servers they just want to see the job of serving get done so the servers are the ones who says let's just put out a list and ask people to step forward and sign up on a list anybody who expresses interest will take them because what do we want we just want the serving to get done and the equipment says no I don't want just the serving to get done I want to get done the right way by the right people that I want to build into. All right. Five. Equippers are passionate about getting every believer into faithful, fruitful, and fulfilling service. Servers are passionate about using their, about using their own gifts, personnel, their gifts in an area of meaningful service. Six. Equippers are motivated to train and delegate the ministry to others. Are motivated to train others and delegate the ministry to them. Whereas servers find it easier to do the job themselves than to train someone else. I had a woman, young gal, in our children's ministry at Willow Creek years ago who was the administrator of the ministry. And she would take care of all the, crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's, getting all the supplies and all this sort of thing. Well, the ministry was growing to a point where that job of administration was becoming bigger than what she could really do. And we were needing to find volunteers to become administrators on every children's ministry team, and we had 16 teams at the time. And so I had said to her, Lori, what I want to do is I want to add somebody in the area of administration, and I would see that person probably being your boss and being like a point person of administration and overseeing the team administrators and things and your real strength is the task deal and all that. She understood these terms, equipper and server, and I said, I see you more as a server. She said, Don, I don't agree. I think that's me. I said, I don't think that's you. Yeah, Don, that's me. I said, let me press you just a little bit on that. I said, every Monday, and I was very involved at this time in the children's ministry, I said, every Monday you go down to Sam's Club and you take the shopping cart and you walk up and down all the aisles and you get all the craft supplies for the coming Sunday, right? How many weekend services? Right. I said, Lord, it seems to me if you were an equipper that you'd have found somebody a long time ago to do that. Well, Don, I've tried that. I tried that. Been there, tried that. You know what? They just don't do it the way I do it. I don't want to say that in pride. I'm not trying to be boastful, but they just don't do it the way I do. He said, yeah, I know that. But, you see, Lord, if somebody told me I had to take a cart and go up and down the aisles of Walmart or Sam's Club every single Monday and get supplies, like I would have killed somebody a long time ago. I would have found something. Don, you just don't understand. There's just so many, you know, you've got to get the right construction paper and the right scissors. At the time it takes me to explain it to someone and make sure they get the list. I end up having to check it when they get there. It's not right. I end up going back, fixing it. It's just easier for me to do it myself. I said, well, I think that indicates you're a server. Well, I wasn't convincing her. So the only way at that point that I was going to get her to change immediately was to power up on her and to just say, unfortunately for you, I'm in charge. Well, that works really well if you want to get something done. It doesn't work really well if you want to be friends afterwards. So I said, I'll tell you what, Lauren. We need 16 point administrators for every team. And we've been working on trying to find people, right? I said, how many do we have right now? She said, three. I said, okay, I'll tell you what. I took out a sheet of paper and I drew 16 boxes. I said, right now we have three. This is May. If by the end of July we have 16 filled in, you have found the other 13 people that are needed. And I would affirm that they're the right people. And you have found those people. then you can have that job. If, however, you don't, then you need to agree with me at that point in time that this is probably not your best deal, finding other people. And she says, okay, fair enough. So she began to go to work on that and we talked about it. How are you coming, Lord? I'm looking at it, talking to some people, you know, great, you know, and look forward to it, you know, so we, you know, you're getting, well, talking to so-and-so and so-and-so, they're thinking about it, they're praying about it, da-da-da. Well, in the meantime, I'm looking around the church to find somebody else. Okay? Because I don I mean, she'd been working on that for months, and she had three. So I ended up talking to this woman named Sue Dunn. Now, Sue had at one time been a Mary Kay Cosmetics saleswoman, and she drove a pink car. So what kind of person do you think she is? Now, you don't drive a pink car from Mary Kay because you sell a lot of makeup yourself. You drive a pink car because you've got a lot of other people to sell a lot of makeup. So I've been talking to Sue. But we came to the end of July, and Lori had a total of five. So we came to agreement. She said, you know what, I worked on it really hard, and maybe you're right, it's just not me. We ended up bringing Sue on the staff that August, and within a month, she not only had 16, the 16 had assistants. In fact, it was her idea that the following summer, we give all of our regular children's ministry workers the summer off for about 10 weeks. She said, what I'll do is I'll go to church, and I'll try and recruit about 300 to 500 adults who will simply be willing to come in as child caregivers. And if we can put some large group programming together, I can just have caregivers. We can give our regular teachers 10 weeks off, say, hey, if you can go get that done, more power to you. And she did. Well, those two began to work together and became great friends. I maintained a relationship with both of them. Still to this day, they have a relationship with each other, Although Sue still works at the church, Lori has had children and is now home full time. But we still have a relationship. And it worked because, you see, the equipper was the leader and the server was under her authority. If it had been the other way around, it doesn't work. So, seven. Equippers work themselves out of a job by replacing themselves with an equipping person. Servers may leave a hole in the ministry team when they leave their position. See, because they went about training someone else. And the reason that they're, it's not because equippers are better than servers, it's because a pupil is not above his teacher, but once he's fully trained, we'll be just like him. Somebody famous once said that. Jesus. In case you didn't know. Eight. Equippers seek to identify, train, develop, coach, and support those in ministry. Servers need to be identified, trained, developed, coached, and supported in ministry. Servers tend to need to be trained in the ways of ministry because the thing that they do best is serve. And when ministry is growing and the serving becomes more complex than just serving, they have to be trained. Equippers tend to figure it out for themselves. All right, now, there is a difference between equipping and using. if we don't want to be using we want to be equipping so very quickly as we wrap this up what's the difference between an equipper and a user equippers see servers as an end in themselves users see servers as a means to an end two, equippers see the task as a means to develop servers as disciples users see servers as a vehicle to get the job done this is a very important distinction okay picture standing here that I'm a I'm a I'm a a user okay I'm a leader of the ministry and I have this ministry down here that I'm trying to build in other words there's a need that God has put on my heart that I'm trying to meet So here's this ministry. And I realize that my ability as the leader to meet the needs of this ministry is going to take more than me, so I have to raise up some people to help me. A user says, okay, these people here are the vehicle I'm going to use, the means to get the ministry built. An equipper says, an equipper says, I'm going to use this ministry to build these servers. Now, if you're under the leadership of one of those two people, who would you rather be under? The person who sees you as a means to their end? Or a person who sees the ministry that you're engaged in as a means to you in developing you as an end? you see it's interesting you will often find as I started out in the very beginning of this morning Jesus fed the 15,000 why did he feed the 15,000 well in part because they had a need but the greater the greater reason why Jesus did that was to accomplish what to teach his disciples that's why notice that when you go through the gospels time and time and time again on the heels of Jesus doing something with the masses, he pulls away his disciples. And something that he did with the masses has a direct application to what he was trying to build in to his disciples. Because, you see, Jesus was in the business of equipping them for the day when he would leave. They were not a means to an end. If they had been a means to an end, then when Peter turned his back on Jesus three times, any user would have said, fine, screw you, I'll get somebody else. but Jesus didn't do that Jesus went after Peter and restored him in fact Jesus disregarded well what's the word I'm looking for Jesus was any attempts at usury Jesus frowned upon when people tried to get him to do miracles just to show who he really was how did he respond no I'm not going to be used When Martha tried to get Jesus to go and get Mary away from his feet, you know, to help in the kitchen, no. I'm not into usury. I'm into equipping. You know, I learned this in youth ministry in the early years because, you know, I am a leader by God's gifting, which makes me an equipper. but in the flesh, that would incline me, because I'm a builder of things, to use people in the process. So when I was in youth ministry, I had this growing youth ministry going on out in Palatine, because when Willow Creek first started, I was doing the youth ministry, and I had this growing youth ministry going on. And as this growing youth ministry was building, I needed more and more high school kids to help on a leadership level to help make it happen. Well, you know, I had one of those aha experiences one day in the midst of cranking out this youth ministry that was growing and was a lot of responsibility. I had this aha experience. You know, youth ministry, you don't know the impact of youth ministry until about 10 or 15 years after kids are out of high school. Because until they get jobs and until they get married and until they start to have kids, you don't know the fruit of what you're really doing. Because the commitments a kid makes at 16 or 17, you really don't find out what's really happening until they're 27. And they've gone through college and they're making now life decisions and you're finding out was it really... Because 10, 15 years down the road, I don't know what's going to happen with the 2, 3, 4, 500 that are coming, but I have a pretty good idea of what might happen with the 40, 50, 60 who are helping to make it happen. That changed my perspective dramatically from one of these kids are a means to an end to looking at the youth ministry as God's tool to build kids. So then the goal became get as many kids into leadership as possible because the greatest blessing that's going to occur is that their lives are going to be built as they lead their peers. That's an equipper. Three, equippers relate to give something. Users relate to get something. For equipers, invest in the servers they lead. Users invest in those who produce the most. Perhaps some of you have been in the marketplace and you've been under a leader in the marketplace who is a user. One of the ways you know you've been under a user is that you will find them favoring the people who produce the most. Because what's the bottom line for them? Profit. Production. Okay. Five, equippers create a loyal following. Users cycle through workers. You can understand why, can't you? Someone's going to really build into you. You're going to be loyal. Six, equippers derive satisfaction from the success of their followers. Users derive satisfaction from results achieved. Seven, equippers love and empower the servers they lead because he loves and empowers the people around him to do what they do. On the other hand, users cause servers to feel used and eventually resentful. Eventually, when someone uses you, eventually you're going to turn on them and you're going to resent them. Because nobody likes to get used. No one wants to be a means to someone else's glory. Eight. Equippers see people and relationships as what is profitable. Users see people and relationships as expendable. People are just a means to an end. Nine. equippers measure success by product and process users measure success by product alone an equipper says it's not just the end product we're after it's the means by which we get there the process is extremely important a user says no no it's just the end product what we're after you know when you have to think about it life is spent much more in process than it is in product pastor gets up to give a message 35, 40, 45 minutes, he's done. He has spent hours preparing it. And most of the time when he's done, he takes it, puts a paper clip on it, and puts it in the file. If you can't enjoy the process, you're in the wrong line of work. I learned the importance of this from a friend. It came through very clearly. Mike Singletary attended Willow Creek and still attends Willow Creek. Has for many years. Mike's a very committed believer. Very serious follower of Jesus Christ. and we got to know him in the early years of, well not too early, but when he was playing for the Bears because Bill Hybels and I had been invited to do some Bible studies with some of the players and things. And so we would do that and got to know Mike. And so he moved out near the church, sold his home, moved out near the church to be closer to it, etc. And he and I have boys that are about the same age and so we coached football together for a couple of years. He was my assistant. He was my defensive coordinator. okay and so anyway Mike you know Mike's in the Hall of Fame in the Hall of Fame do you know that on Sunday afternoon when he played football if you took the total amount of time that he spent on the field in actual play from the time the ball was snapped to the time the whistle blew it's less than five minutes less than five minutes but for that five minutes he's in the Hall of Fame. Because what he didn't at five minutes was that good. Now, what do you think enabled him to play that five minutes at a Hall of Fame caliber? The hours upon hours upon hours of not only practice, weight lifting, conditioning, training, but watching film. It really became evident in the year the Bears won the Super Bowl. They played the Rams in the playoffs. And at a key play early in the game, it was a fourth down play, fourth in like less than a yard. It was a key play. And so the Rams were going to go for it. It's a famous play. Maybe some of you, if you're football fans, have seen it. Mike goes up in the air, dives over the line, and as he gets up to the top of his field, this Eric Dickerson who got the ball is coming up, and Mike hits him and knocks him back. The Bears stopped him and then went on to win the game. And I said to Mike later on when I talked to him, I said, Mike, when you did that, it appeared as though you started leaping through that hole over the line in that spot before he did. Now how did you know that's where he was going? And he said, Dan, I had watched so much film and I had a pretty good guess that on a fourth and short situation that that's the play that they would run, that's the hole he would go through behind that particular blocker. And he said, I just, I figured I had nothing to lose at that point because, you know, he was going to try and get just that yard. He said, I just took an educated guess and that's where I came through. You see, friends, that's process. training. So that when the product comes, you're ready. To an equipper, it's not just fourth and one. It's all that leads up to it that's important as well. A user says, hey, all that matters is what happened on fourth and one. Now, if you're a coach or you're playing for a coach for a football team, you know what you want to be? You want to be under a coach who cares not just about fourth and one, but who cares about all the hours it takes to lead up to fourth and one. That's the kind of leader you want to be under because 95, and I'm saying considerably now, 95% of life is lived in process. 95, at least 95% of life is lived in process. You're selling your product at work, you're building up to the sale, building up to the sale, building up to the sale, and all of a sudden you close it. How long does the closing take? In some cases, two minutes. We have a deal? Yep, we got a deal. Done. How long did it take you to get there? Oh, my goodness. I had to court that guy for a year. Well, how you did that is really important. And so, to an equipper, the process is a goal in itself. Okay? Ten. Equippers raise up other equipers. Users raise up other users. Again, a pupil's not above his teacher. Once he is fully trained, we'll be just like him. 11, we're done. Equippers lead with authenticity and vulnerability, and they lead from a position of humility. They're authentic, they're vulnerable, they're humble, and that's why people enjoy following them. Users lead with force and authority, and lead from a position of control. Now, out of this last section here, I would give you two applications. Number one, if you listen to all that and you say, you know what? That's kind of convicting. I've been involved in the work of the ministry here, and, you know, I've been guilty of using people. I would encourage you to confess that, repent of it, and go to the people that you feel that maybe you've been guilty of using and go to them and confess your sin to them and tell them that you're sorry about that, but that's, you know, your flesh and the motives of your heart. You've been convicted on that, and you know what? You want to change the way in which you lead them. And while you may think that doing that, that you would lose credibility in their eyes, in fact, the exact opposite will occur. You will gain credibility in their eyes because you have acted in a way that is characterized as humility. I would also encourage you in terms of an application, and if after you listen to this, you say, you know what, I'm a server. I am primarily a server, but I've been put into a role where I'm being asked to be an equipper. That may explain why I've been so frustrated. Go to the leader of your ministry and just say, you know what, I'm primarily a server, and I need to talk to you about my role in this ministry because I need to get back to doing what God's called me to do. If, on the other hand, you say, you know what, I think God's wired me as an equipper, but yet I'm in a role I'm being asked to be a server, and I've been frustrated, I want to go talk to you about, you know, is it possible for me to get into a role that's maybe more of an equipping nature to it. Now, understand something. We all start out as servers. We all start out as servers. Why? Why? Because it takes time to develop the credibility, the maturity, spiritual maturity, etc., to be given a position of being an equipper. Some people, then, as a reflection of growing spiritually and in maturity and character, and kind of paying their dues, eventually, you know, get into a role where their gifts as an equipper surface. And they get into a role of being an equipper. While other people remain in a position of being a server for the rest of their lives. Now understand something, again, in the body of Christ, there are no ladders. There's no greater to be an equipper than it is to be a server. The greatest thing is to live with the anointing of God. That's what you want. The anointing of God. And whatever you do, if you've got the anointing of God, that's what you're after.
