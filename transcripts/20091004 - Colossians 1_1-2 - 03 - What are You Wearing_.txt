Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. As most of you know, if you've been around Open Door for any length of time, on the first weekend of every month, like this, we turn our attention to, as a community of faith, to gather together around the table that is the Lord's table. We call it communion. And by way of preparing ourselves this morning for that, I'd like you to open your Bibles. If you have them to the book of Colossians, as we enter into now the third week of what amounts to an extended introduction. This is why these series take so long. We're going to take a month and a half to get out of the second verse. Into the background and to the themes of this incredible epistle, begun a couple weeks ago, as I said a moment ago, by Steve Wiens. It's an epistle that begins with these words. Colossians 1, verse 1, Paul, who introduces himself as an apostle of Jesus Christ, made so by the will of God, and Timothy, our brother, to the saints and faithful brethren, who are in Christ, who are also in Colossae. Grace and peace to you from God our Father. In other words, the kind of grace and peace that comes from God our Father is the kind of grace and peace I'm extending to you, Colossians. I'm desiring for you. I'm praying for you. Grace and peace. Which is something that all of us need, I think. Grace and peace. Might be some in this room this morning who feel like they need it desperately. Some grace. And desperately some peace. But the people in Colossae, there would have been an acute awareness of their need for this certain kind of grace. And mercy and peace. The kind that comes from God, our Father. Because to live in Colossae, as Steve has been explaining to us over the last couple of weeks, was to live in the shadow of Rome. And Rome offered a kind of peace as well. To call it grace and peace might be a bit of a stretch, but maybe peace and mercy was offered by Rome. But the peace and mercy offered by Rome was embodied in what was known at the time as the Pax Romano, the peace of Rome. And this kind of peace was procured by the ruthless crushing by Rome of everyone who stood in their way. And the mercy they extended, if any at all, came by means of capitulation to them, if you gave in to them. So if you pledge your allegiance to Caesar as Lord, then you'll have some peace, maybe. And you might get some mercy as well, maybe. All of which created for the people in Colossae what Steve referred to last week as the story or the reality within which they had to live their lives. And it was a story. It was a reality of oppression and fear and, to say the least, an uneasy peace. But Paul wasn't just writing to the people in Colossae generally. He was writing specifically to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ. in Colossae. And last week we discovered that being in Christ in Colossae changes everything. It changes everything. Because though being in Christ didn't magically change the fact that they were still living in Colossae and under Roman rule, it didn't change that, being in Christ. And it didn't change the fact that Paul, as he wrote these words to the Colossians, was in a Roman prison, not sure of life or death. Being in Christ didn't change that either. Being in Christ, however, brought with it the liberating and empowering awareness that in Christ we have the potential of living in a different story than Roman rule or Roman prisons. We have the potential in Christ to live in a much bigger story than Roman rule and Roman prisons, which is why last week Steve talked about what it means to be in Christ. Bigger story. In Colossae, and Colossae is a big story, but what if you could be in Colossae and in Christ? I almost coined a phrase, and I think it empowered many of you to be asking some of those questions. What does it mean to be in Christ? Big story, when you're in conflict, and the conflict is a big story, but what if we were in conflict and aware of being in Christ, and what does it mean to be in Christ when you're in trouble or in success or maybe in failure? A friend of mine last week, as we were talking about this, really affected by that sermon and this concept of being in Christ and how it's a bigger story, talked to me about how he and his wife, through that talk, began to grapple with what it actually means to be in Christ. Big story, when you're in treatment for cancer. Being in treatment for cancer is a pretty big story. Pretty scary story. But what if we learned how to be in Christ while we were in that? All of which raises this question that I want us to bring to the table this morning. The question is this, what are you in this morning? What are you wearing? Weird way to say it. But Paul says it. Paul, all of his epistles, talks about being in Christ and Christ being in you. And he talks about it in a variety of ways. In Galatians 3.27, he talks about being clothed in Christ, thus raising this question of what are you wearing. In Galatians 3.27, he talks about the fact that all those who have been immersed or baptized, immersed into Christ, have been clothed in Christ. It's a weird picture because it's almost like you wear him like a coat, which is weird. But even though it's weird, let me ask it anyway, what are you wearing like a coat? What are you clothed in? What do you look to as your source of confidence and hope in the middle of your Colossae, in the middle of your conflict or your fear or your success or your failure? And would it hope to know, for instance, that if you are here today in failure or in sin, that in him, according to Colossians 1 verse 14, In him, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sin. And have you ever been able to put that on, to wear that like a coat? Or do you do what many people do, perpetually wear your shame and your guilt? Because we wear it sometimes, this shame and guilt thing, we wear it like a coat. So here's the question, what are you in? What are you wearing? Now, well, this issue of being in Christ, and Christ being in you, is a serious theology. Again, it's a major theme for Paul all through the book of Colossians. We're going to bump into it and unpack it over and over again, which is really good news because we haven't even come close to plumbing the depths of that. But also, all through all of Paul's writings, this is a major theme. But what I want to focus on today is this, that for Paul, This issue of being in Christ and Christ being in you was more than serious theology. For him, it was intensely personal. In part because Paul knew what it felt like to be in other things, to be wearing things other than Christ as his source of confidence and hope. His name was Saul, actually, before it became Paul. By birth, he was a Jew. By citizenship, he was a Roman. By education, he was a Greek. At the age of 13, Saul left his home in Tarsus to go to Jerusalem, where he studied under the great rabbi and teacher of the law, Gamaliel. Under Gamaliel, Saul memorized great portions of the Old Testament. Like all students of great rabbis, he was trained in all forms of dialogue and debate. He was quick and bright, excelling beyond his peers, even if he does say so himself. And in Galatians 1.14, he actually does say so himself. He says, I have advanced in Judaism far beyond any of my contemporaries, being extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions, which is why in Philippians 3.4, he could rightly say, if anyone had a mind or a reason to put confidence in themselves, I had more reason than them. Because I was really something. That's what he's saying there. It really was. And it really could be said of him, particularly in his earlier life when his name was Saul, he had it all. His pedigree was spotless, his capacity was boundless, unusually intelligent, passionately committed, tremendously gifted, supremely confident, bordering on arrogance. In fact, he moved kind of beyond the border of arrogance into arrogance itself. He was arrogant in his earlier life, and it was, I think, his arrogance that fueled in him in his younger days a seething rage. A rage that we actually get a glimpse of in Acts chapter 6, verse 9, where Stephen, prior to Paul's conversion, obviously, but this is after the baptism of the Spirit, the ascension of Jesus, and his resurrection, obviously, and now the church is beginning to move, and men like Stephen and women like others, full of the Spirit, are having this incredible effect, and Stephen in Acts 6, verse 9, is in this debate, and he's in a very prestigious place in the synagogue of the Greeks with Cyrenians and Alexandrians, some from Cilicia and Asia. Well, Paul, whose name was Saul, was there as well, but according to verse 10, during this debate, these brilliant people were unable to cope with the wisdom and the spirit with which Stephen spoke, and they hated him for that. Began to spread lies about him in the very next verse. If you go on and read the rest of that chapter, they incite people to believe that Stephen is a blasphemer, and they stir people up against him, because people like this don't lose very well. They don't lose very often, so they don't lose very well. They can't be wrong. They can't look bad. Maybe no one ever said this, but I can just feel this in the spirit of Paul, because we know what he does to Stephen, saying something like this. Stephen, You might have won the battle, but you will not win the war. So when in Acts 7, 58, Stephen was driven from the city by this crowd of people who had been lied to by these others, and his stoning began. Saul was there as Stephen was being executed in Acts 8, verse 1, giving hearty approval to putting him to death. In fact, it says that Saul was holding the coats. Let me help you throw the stones better. I'll hold your coats while you kill him. Indeed, in Acts 9, verse 1, it says that Saul was still breathing threats and murder. Pretty angry guy. Against the disciples of the Lord and was aggressively looking for more people like Stephen to arrest and maybe execute. Now, that was early in his life. Later in his life, we get a glimpse of how that season in his life, that earlier season in his life affected him. And kind of hung with him because in 1 Corinthians 15 verse 9, Paul, his name is now Paul, he says this, I need you to know that I am the least of all the apostles, not fit to be called an apostle precisely because of that season in my life where I persecuted the church and happily executed Stephen, which continually, maybe daily, I don't know, raised this question for Paul. Paul is, with that memory vivid in your mind, it makes you even think you're not fit to be an apostle because of what you've done. Here's my question for you, Paul. What are you going to wear? What are you going to be in today? And then, Paul, do you really believe what you said to the church in Colossae when you told them that in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sin? And if you do believe it, Paul, will you wear that Or will you wear what people do when they're aware of their sins? Sometimes they just wear their sin. They wear their shame. And even sometimes think it's holy to do that. Well, it turns out that he did learn what it meant. It might have been a daily battle to put this on again. And it often is that way. It's not often a one-time deal. It's something in our journey with God we put on again and again. and we need to be reminded again and again, what am I in, what am I wearing, what am I looking to as my confidence? But we know he won this battle over time, I think, because in verse 10, after he says, I'm the least of the apostles, not fit to be called an apostle, he says in verse 10, but by the grace of God, I am what I am. And not with a braggadocia anymore, he says this, I am an apostle. In Colossians 1.1, he says, I am an apostle by the will of God. He might have added, by the grace of God. And his grace toward me did not prove in vain. Because I decided to wear that grace, to put it on, to believe it was true. And to use it as my only source of confidence and hope. See, Paul is really an interesting character relative to this issue of what we're wearing. Because at one time in his life, what he wore clearly was his success. But at another time in his life, he could have easily worn the opposite. He could have embraced and put on forever his failure and worn it the rest of his life. At one time in his life, what the Apostle John said to the Laodicean church in Revelation 3.17 could have accurately been said of Paul. This is Revelation 3.17. I would kind of translate it speaking to Paul. Paul, you see yourself as rich, increased with goods, in need of nothing. In need of nothing. That's Paul on the road to Damascus. In need of nothing. He's supremely confident. That's Paul full of himself in need of nothing. That's Paul when he was clothing himself in his religious pedigree and performance. Something he speaks of in Philippians chapter 3. A Hebrew of Hebrews. That's who I am. That's the law of Pharisee. Need I say more? That's who I am. And as to righteousness, which is acquired by rightly performing the law, I am blameless. And when he was wearing those things as a source of confidence, he felt rich, increased with goods, in need of nothing. I am the man. Just look at me. But then that pesky little light from heaven thing happened. Remember that? Acts 9 verse 3 On the road to Damascus he heard the voice of God And suddenly a light from heaven it says Flashed around him and what the light revealed Among other things was this That what Paul, his name at the time was Saul What he was wearing, as pretty as it looked on the outside Was flimsy and false A woefully inadequate source of confidence and hope Indeed, far from being rich, increased with goods and in need of nothing. The truth is, Paul, and this is the rest of the verse that John spoke of the Laodicean church, the truth is, while you just think you're great, you are in fact wretched, poor, miserable, blind, and naked. And generally, when people realize they're naked, they start looking for some place to hide. They start looking for something to wear. all of which helps to explain, quite frankly, the energy with which Paul says what he says in Philippians 3 verses 8 and 9 when he says, Oh, how my ambitions have changed. For whatever things were gained to me, I now count them as loss and consider them rubbish. Skubalon. I love that word. I had to be here last week to know why. I consider them rubbish in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him. Are you getting this picture of why I say that this issue of being in Christ and Christ being in him was more for Paul than serious theology? This is intensely personal. This is going to save my life. This has to be true. I have to find something other than me to be in. So what are you wearing? because if it's your bright and shiny stuff today, it's fine. We're all impressed. It's okay. And your bright and shiny stuff isn't so much evil as it is inadequate. It just has no power to really clothe you. I just love Joel's story of how he was all dressed up and on the inside, he was just, and it had no, he even knew then in high school, this ain't working. I still feel miserable. I wish I could be in something else. And if it's your sin and shame that you're in, I wish I just had a magic wand for this, but repent and believe that the gospel is true. And repent and believe that in him, we have redemption through his blood. And in him, there is forgiveness of sin. So what are you wearing? What are you in? His name was John. He lived in Milwaukee. He taught high school. He died several years ago. He was an ordinary guy. He never wrote a book, appeared on TV, or converted to masses. He never gathered an international reputation for holiness. But he was a man, in Brendan Manning's words, Manning is the guy who told this story originally, a man whose soul was seduced and ravished by Jesus. This guy John wrote in his journal these words, written actually to himself. John, he said to himself, the heart of it is this, to define yourself radically as one beloved by God. And now, in repentance, take your shadow self, that pretend person that you want everyone to see, take that pretend person to the cross and dare to live as a forgiven man. And then to laugh at the preposterous idea of your worthiness. Because it's God's love for you and his choice of you that constitutes your worth, not your possessions, not your talents or esteem or reputation or applause or appreciation. And then he says this, I stand anchored now in God, in Christ, before whom I stand naked. But this time, not ashamed, closed only in Christ, because in him, it's my only safe place, in him we have redemption. Through his blood, the forgiveness of sin, and in him the fullness of the Godhead dwells in a bodily form, and in him we've been made complete, we're being made complete. In other words, we're given everything we need for life and godliness, and anyone who is in Christ will become by his work in us a new creature. So what are you in? What are you wearing? Indeed, as we come to the table, there's a question I want you to open yourself to and wonder about what are you wearing. Do you need to take anything off? Do you need to put anything on? this is weird because nobody would do this physically but it might be good if you came naked without your self-righteous how are you and also without your sense of shame that you carry and maybe coming to the table would help you put it down and put something else on powerful symbolism at the table today it's amazing to me we come to this once a month and every time it feels like the table is saying something to us and the symbolism is powerful in a variety of ways and to me the symbolism today as we take the bread and the cup and ingest it, it's like saying I need to be reminded of many things when I take these elements but today I need to be reminded that Christ as I take him in is in me and I need to be in him. In Christ, in Colossae. In Christ, in conflict. In Christ, in success. In Christ, in failure. In him, we have redemption through his blood. Forgiveness of sin in him. Holy Spirit, come and mediate over this time as we come to your table. Bring to life these symbols and make them for us real. In Jesus' name, amen. you
