Open your Bibles with me, Exodus chapter 33. We will kind of pick it up in verse 18, moving to chapter 34 as well. Born of Moses' request in Exodus chapter 33 to first know the ways of God and then see the glory of God, we have been asking this question. What are the ways of God that reveal the glory of God to the people of God? In other words, are there principles? Are there spiritual dynamics at work that we need to know about and walk in when it comes to the manifested presence of God? Well, the answer to that is yes. And we have identified over the last several weeks seven dynamics, seven ways of God that reveal the glory of God. Among them are these, the way of desire, humility, reverence, and dependence. Last week we discovered the way of His sovereign choice, His precious Son, and our heartfelt worship as all being ways of God that reveal the glory of God. Today, as we will see revealed in the text beginning in verse 19 and all through chapter 34, the next way of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the amazing grace of God. Amazing grace. Not as revealed in the New Testament alone, though in the New Testament, through the blood of Jesus Christ, this gift of amazing grace is brought into its full expression. We need to understand that amazing grace has always been God's way. Now one of the things that excites me about this message this morning is that the amazing grace I'm talking about here is so richly revealed in the text. I love that. It's absolutely my favorite kind of sermon just to work the text. We don't have to go anywhere else to make the point. It's all here. Indeed, it is so richly here in the text that I had some concern this week as I was studying this as to how to unpack it simply because I want you to be able to see it and rejoice in it with me as much as I have this last week as I've studied. So here was my dilemma. Should we dive in to this whole thing? Should we just kind of jump in? Should I give you the big picture all at once, running the risk, if we do that, of missing some very important nuance and specifics that I don't want you to miss? Or should we wade in, kind of start in the shallow end, give you this text piece by piece, eventually kind of getting the big picture, but the risk there is that in giving you little pieces along the way, if you don't pay attention for every piece, you really won't see the big picture. What I decided was this. First thing we're going to do is dive in. I'm going to show you the whole deal. The big picture, we're going to splash around. It's a great story. Then everybody get out of the pool, and we're going to go to the shallow end and wait in. Now, what that's going to do is it's going to take two weeks. Today, we're going to dive in. I'm going to give you the whole thing, the whole picture. We're going to shoot the wad. Everything you need to know, you're going to know. Then we're all going to get out of the pool, and next week, this is kind of a two-point sermon. It takes two weeks. Point number one, dive in. That's today. Point number two, next week, or next time, after communion service, we're going to wait in, not after the, we're not going to have communion and then this. Forget it. Let's dive in today by simply reading the story and explaining it to you as we go. It all began in verse 18 with Moses' request to see the glory of God. Chapter 33. Then Moses said to God, I pray thee, Father, show me thy glory. In verse 19, God complies to that request by saying three things. Before I even read it, I want you to just know what he's about to say. Number one, I will show you my goodness. Number two, I will proclaim my name. And number three, my name is I will be gracious. That is my name. My name is I will show compassion. Let's read the verse. And God said, I myself will make all my goodness to pass before you and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you and I will be gracious. That is my name. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion. Now in verse 19, it needs to be noted that all God is doing there is telling Moses what he's going to do. In verse 19, he did not yet show him his glory. He simply says, I want you to get ready. In a minute, I'm going to show you my goodness. In a minute, I'm going to proclaim my name, and this is going to be a big deal, so I want you to be prepared for this. In fact, the preparation continues in verse 20. Read with me. preparing him for it. In chapter 34, having told Moses what he is going to do, God now tells Moses what he wants Moses to do. Verse 1, now the Lord said to Moses, here's what I want you to do. Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the former ones. What's he talking about? The former ones? I don't get this. Keep going. And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which were shattered. Which were shattered? He shattered the Ten Commandments. We're going back to the Ten Commandments. He's going to do it again. So be ready by morning and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai where you were before when we did the Ten Commandments. Present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain. Verse 4. So Moses cut out two stone tablets like the former ones and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai as the Lord had commanded him. And he took two stone tablets in his hand. A strange thing is happening here. In fact, it is something that I am going to guess many of you did not know even happened. Even many of you who kind of know your way around the word of God maybe quite possibly did not know that the Ten Commandments were given to Moses and the people of God not once but twice. This is a revisiting of the covenant relationship that got shattered before it ever had a chance to begin. In fact, if you're still struggling with whether that's really what's happening. Look at verse 10 with me. Then God said to Moses, behold, I am going to make a covenant, the covenant that really never got off the ground the first time because the vows of that covenant were shattered. And I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth, nor among any of the nations. And all the people among whom you live will see the working of the Lord, for it is a fearful or it is an awesome thing that I am going to perform with you. Verse 27, then the Lord said to Moses, write down these words for in accordance with these words. I have made a covenant with you and Israel. I am entering into a relationship with you and Israel according to these words. So he was there with the Lord 40 days and 40 nights, and he did not eat bread nor drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, and here we go, the Ten Commandments. The second go-round of the Ten Commandments, Chapter 34. Shattered the first time before they were ever even delivered, before the people of God even saw them, obviously before the covenant was entered into. Let's try this. Says chapter 34 again. Though you probably know the background, I want to put the pieces together for you as we kind of dive in and get the whole picture. The covenant embodied in the Ten Commandments, which I believe can best be understood as wedding vows. Extremely important that you see it that way. The Ten Commandments, seen best as wedding vows between God, the passionate lover, and Israel, and now later, His church, the beloved bride, were originally hammered out in Exodus chapter 20. Several months ago, we spent several months on the Ten Commandments. These wedding vows that I'm calling them now were hammered out between God and Moses on Mount Sinai. Now you may maybe have never looked at it this way before, but when Moses went to the mountain to meet with God, what he was doing up there was going to work on their vows. It would be like somebody getting away for the weekend and we're going to get married. We've decided to consummate this relationship and really commit ourselves to one another. But before we do, we really want to be thoughtful about the promises that we are going to make to one another. We've decided to get married. We're going to enter into the covenant. What are going to be the terms? What do we pledge to one another? There was a time when I stood at an altar with the woman who became my wife. Her name was Bonnie. And I said, I, Dave, take the Bonnie to be my wedded wife. That is the kind of thing that is being fashioned here. There was a problem, however. Before this covenant could be consummated, even before the vows could be seen by the people of God, Israel had already fallen for another guy, as it were. You remember that? I think you do if you were with us. Moses was on the mountain too long. Can't be away too long from a bride like Israel. Got to stay there, make sure she behaves, I suppose. Just couldn't wait. And Israel made for herself a golden calf. Exodus 32, verse 19, And it came about when Moses came near the camp. He saw the calf and all the dancing. His anger burned, and he threw the tablets from his hand and shattered them at the foot of the mountain, as if to say, why did I bother with this at all? As if to say, the wedding is off. What a joke. We were preparing to consummate this thing. We were going to get married. But before I could even show you the vows, and this is a little indelicate language here, but this is what was happening spiritually, Before I could even show you the vows of our marriage, I come here and you're having sex with someone else. It's called spiritual adultery. And you shall have no other gods but me. You shall have no other husbands but me. I want to be your only love. In chapter 34, in chapter 34, God is coming to Moses saying something inexplicable. It's this. I still want you for my bride. I still want to be married to you. I would like to try this again. Verse 10 is exactly what he's saying. Behold, I'm going to make a covenant. I will make a covenant. Meaning, you guys, you thought it was over. You thought it was going to wipe you all out. Because that's the anger of a lover. It's like, but I want to make a covenant. I want to get married. before all your people I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth nor among any of the nations for it is an awesome thing that I am going to do with you. If this is seen was happening not in the spiritual arena between God and his people, Israel, God and his people, the church, and were just happening between two people. And I, let's say, had a friend who was doing what God is doing right here with a fiance who consistently went off with other guys and demonstrated in a number of ways that she wasn't very faithful to him, but he constantly, this friend of mine, kept saying, oh yeah, I want you back. Oh yes, we'll get married anyways. If I really had a friend like that who was behaving like that, I promise you, I would go to that buddy of mine and I would say something like this. What are you nuts? What on earth are you doing? You need to wake up. Let me get you away here and slap you around a little bit and come to your senses. I love you very much. You're a good friend of mine. Please pay attention. Everything about her behavior has made it clear to you she doesn't love you. She isn't faithful. She sleeps around. Think about this. What kind of life is this going to be for you, God? and God would say of Israel. And God would say of His bride to church to that confrontation if I were to bring it and that's kind of a bizarre thought. But what He would say is essentially this. You don't understand. For reasonable or not for whether you understand it or not I have set my love on her. Israel. the church. I have chosen her to be my own, and I can't go back. Not because there's a rule. Not because I made a promise, and I have to keep the promise. And, you know, I really do hate her, but I made a promise. I'm going to give the promise and marry her. It's not because of that. It's because I've given my heart away. God's talking like this, because I have chosen you and you are mine. In chapter 34 of Exodus, the most amazing thing is happening. God is saying here to Moses, let's try this again. Exodus 34 is a rewriting of the Ten Commandments. More importantly, more clearly understood, it is a rewriting of the vows, of their covenant relationship. So Moses, verse 2, be ready by the morning. Come on up to the mountain where we started this thing in the first place. And I will make a covenant with you, says God, verse 10, and it will be beyond your wildest dreams, for it is an awesome thing that I am going to do with you. We're going to do it again. And beloved, if you haven't picked it up yet or not, what that's called is amazing grace. Now here's how it actually happened. Back to the story, verses 5 through 7 of chapter 34. God begins to actually do what he said he was going to do in chapter 33, verse 19. Remember, I will do three things. I'm going to show you my goodness, I'm going to proclaim my name, and my name is, I will be gracious. That's what he said he was going to do. Well, he starts doing that in verse 5. Let's watch. And the Lord descended in a cloud because Moses went to the mountain and they're going to work on their vows. Moses, God then met Moses there, descended in a cloud, stood there with him and called as Moses called on the name of the Lord. and the Lord passed by in front of him. Stop right there. And what did God show him? Well, we already know because God told him what he was going to show him. When he passed by, he showed him his goodness and proclaimed his name. I'm going to show you my goodness. I'm going to proclaim my name and proclaimed his name, the Lord, the Lord God. Going to give you more detail about that next time. Yahweh, Yahweh. And my name is this, or my name means this, compassionate, gracious. I am slow to anger. I am abounding in loving kindness. I am truth. I keep loving kindness for thousands. I forgive iniquity, transgression, and sin. Stop right there. Need to pick this apart a little bit. Give you some detail anyway with more to come. He kind of overwhelms Moses with the reality of his grace. It is, by the way, interesting that when Moses asks to see the glory of God and God shows him his glory, what he shows him is grace. What he shows him is compassion, mercy, forgiveness. It struck me that he mentions loving kindness twice. I'm abounding in loving kindness. I keep loving kindness. Abounding speaks of plenty. It pictures a fountain that is never-ending. Keeping it speaks of storing it up. either way what it means is simply this there's enough loving kindness for you and some of you who may wonder if in your covenant relationship with God having served other gods wandered away from God whether you can come back home or not the word of God word from God's mouth right now is this I am abounding in loving kindness and I keep loving kindness there is plenty it's continually coming. In fact, I store it for you. When he mentions three kinds of sin, I forgive, iniquity, transgression, and sin. Basically, what he's saying is, I forgive every kind of sin. You name a kind of sin, I forgive it. But suddenly, as we've kind of jumped in the pool here and tried to get the big picture all at once, we become aware that in the middle of verse 7, the water turns decidedly cold. Has that ever happen to you? A lot of times it happens at a lake. You're going to swim along and you go, oh this feels just wonderful, it's so warm. And you hit this cold thing. It just, and you want to get out of the water. I got a verse for you that's going to make you want to get out of the water right now. It says this, here's all the loving kindness, forgiveness, every kind of sin. This God I can cuddle up to really nice. Then he says, yet I will, he will, by no means leave the guilty unpunished. Visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations. Thank you very much. I want to get out of the water now. Forgiveness. Loving kindness. But by no means do I acquit the guilty. Whatever happened to Grace? The water was warm when we got in. This gives me a chill. The fact is this. This verse is problematic. Anyway you cut it. And again I want to get into this in more detail next time. but the primary reason this verse is problematic is this. When he says, I will not acquit the guilty, what's the problem with that? Everybody's guilty. That's the problem with that. So who on earth gets the compassion? Who on earth gets the grace? Because everybody's guilty. This doesn't feel like good news anymore. Well, that problem is solved with a question, a question that, by the way, is going to bring us right back to grace And to the heart of the gospel, the question is this. Since everybody is guilty, who are the guilty that he will acquit, forgive, and grace? And who are the guilty that he will by no means forgive, acquit, or grace? Well, the short answer to that question is this. He will forgive and welcome back to his embrace those who see their sin, repent of their sin, and desire to return to the groom. He will forgive those men and women who may be struggling having seen their sin with whether or not the groom is even going to want them back. He will forgive and acquit that person. That person who may be like the prodigal who left home, wasted their inheritance, lived in the slop with the pigs, then one day looked up and said, I don't want to live this way. I wish I could go home to the father, but I don't know for sure if I would leave the slop, having done what I've done and wasted what I've wasted and spurned the love of my father the way I have. I don't even know if the father in that distant land that is now so far away would ever receive me back. And that son does a very courageous thing. And that is he tries, at least, that he starts to walk and he finds out that the father, seeing him afar off, runs to him. I got news for you. The father will forgive. He is compassion. He is grace. He is loving kindness. He's not only abounding in it, he's storing it up for you when you want to come home. And if you're wondering about that, understand the name of the Lord. For my name is the Lord, the Lord God, and I am gracious, compassionate, slow to anger. But he will by no means, this is where the water gets cold, and you need to feel the chill, I will by no means forgive those who love their sin, those who embrace their sin, those who like the prodigal go and sit in the slop and expect the Father to join them there and bless that somehow, I will by no means forgive those who play God for a fool or presume on grace. Here's the deal. God is not a chump who says to his bride, well, sure, you can sleep around. Oh, we're married, but yeah, but well, if you want to have some lovers on the side, no big deal. My wife didn't say that to me. Well, just come back on the weekend and bring me a flower. just go to church on Sunday and sing a song that'll be okay God is not a chump who says to his bride yeah yeah you can play the harlot no you don't have to be faithful no don't worry no consequences that's not true in fact the consequences of your sin are things that I can't even deliver you from if you turn back if you come back and break the bondages of sin and I would empower you in ways it's a fearful thing that I would do It's an amazing, awesome thing that I will do for you if you come back to me. But if you embrace your sin, that sin is going to be passed on to your children. It's going to infect everybody around you. But if you desire to return, if you would like to start again, maybe even come to the groom for the very first time, but you wonder if you can, because again, like the prodigal, you got slop all over your mouth. What on earth would the groom have to do with us? Know this, know this. It is never too late. And I am not speaking here in general biblical verbiage right now. I really believe that there are men and women in this room right now who need a word from God that says to you right now, it is not too late for you to come home. It is never too late. your sins if you're aware of them now and are wanting to turn from them now your sins are not too great and here is how I know verse 6 Exodus 34 the Lord the Lord God that is my name this is who I am I am compassionate gracious slow to anger abounding in loving kindness. I keep loving kindness for thousands, and I forgive every kind of sin, even yours. On top of that, verse 10 and 11, I will make a covenant with you. I still want to marry you. I still want to enter into this relationship with you. And before all your people, I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth, not among any of the nations. And all the people among whom you live will see the working of the Lord again, for it is an awesome thing that I am going to perform with you. In other words, what God is saying in the 10th and 11th verse is this. I will be a husband you can trust. I will be a husband you can love. Did you know that when you came to God through Christ, that's what you were entering into? That's the kind of relationship He's calling you to. I will, as your husband, honor you, protect you, provide for you. And I will take, says God the Father, now through Christ the Son, where it's been fully consummated, this gift of grace. And I will take great pleasure in dressing you in fine array, in lifting you to the fullness of your purpose, in empowering you to be everything you can be, for it is an awesome thing that I am going to do for you. But here's what I want from you. Here's your part in the wedding vows. Listen to it, starting in verse 11. I'm going to do all this stuff. I still want to be married. I'm going to extend to you grace. If you want to come home, that's what I want. I want you home. But be sure to observe all that I'm commanding you this day. Behold, I'm going to drive out the Amorite before you, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. Say that faster than I did. What I like about what I just said there is this, that he said, so here's what I want you to do, but before he can even tell them what he wants them to do, he starts gushing with more stuff he's going to do for them. I'm going to drive all these people up. I'm going to break the bondages in your life so you can come back to me. Then verse 12, he says this. Here's what I want from you, that you watch yourself, that you make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, lest it become a snare in your midst, but rather you are to tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and cut down their asherim. For you shall not worship any other god, for the Lord whose name is Jealous is a jealous god. Jealous? Yeah, yeah. See, this is a marriage. Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they play the harlot with their gods and sacrifice to their gods and someone invites you to eat of his sacrifice and you take some of his daughters for your sons and his daughters play the harlot with their gods and cause your sons also to play the harlot with their gods. Here's what I want. for you to not make any more golden calves. Okay, the Bible language, the golden calf, it's like, I don't know how you feel. When I first read that, it was like, oh, there he goes again. Thou shalt not, this is his law, thou shalt not. And then I thought, the way you need to see it. These are wedding vows. And all of a sudden, the light came on for me because what dawned on me was it's all God is saying. The groom to the bride is saying this. Like my wife would say to me on the day of our wedding, or I would say to her, I'm going to give you everything I've got. Just one thing for you. Don't be dating any of your old boyfriends anymore. In fact, I want you to take their pictures off your dresser and take their phone numbers out of your wallet. That's exactly, beloved, what he says in verse 12, but rather tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down their ashram. Restrictive, really? These are wedding vows. What did your wedding vows sound like? Somewhere along the line in my wedding vows, I said to Bonnie this, I pledge myself to you and to you alone in a commitment that will last as long as life. But just one thing, don't date anybody else. take the pictures off the dresser, take the phone number out of your wallet, and she would say to me, well, if I knew that was what I was going to be, I want to be able to date. No, no, it doesn't sound so unreasonable anymore. It's not unreasonable at all that I expect my wife to be faithful, that she expects me to be faithful. You need to understand that when we come to God through Christ, this is not just an arrangement where we say the magic words, embrace the right theology, and because we say the magic words and sign the card, we get to go to heaven if we keep the rules. I fear that some are living in some false security because they even did come forward and say some, what they thought was magic spiritual words, but they have never entered into the marriage that looks at God the Father and says, I belong to you. This is a love affair. And I will not serve other gods. And sometimes, yes, sometimes we wander and sometimes we stumble and sometimes we make horrible choices and we look up and we wonder, will he want us back? He does. How do you know? Because he is the Lord, the Lord God who is compassionate and mercy. He's the most unbelievable husband you've ever heard of and he will lift you up and he will bring you to a new place. It is an awesome thing, says the groom to the bride, whether it be Exodus 34 or the book of Galatians. It's an awesome thing that I want to do for you, and it's all because of grace. Do you see the grace in Exodus 34? And that is why I say one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God is the amazing grace of God. I just got to tell you, just like inside stuff, it was an incredible experience for me this week to see Exodus 34 unfold as being nothing less than the gospel that we preach. I didn't know the gospel was in the Old Testament, at least not this graphically. But here's the good news. Our God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Guess what? Grace has always been His way. Everybody out of the pool. Let's get out, dry up, tie yourself off, come to the shallow end. We're going to start to wade in. I'm not going to do it today. I'm out of time here, so don't freak out. I'm not going to do the whole thing here. but next time when we come back we're going to pick up the detail catch some of the nuance give you an outline in fact I'm going to give you the outline now and then we'll fill it out there are three things in particular and I just want you to chew on this all three of these are right in the text that I want you to see the first thing we're going to see is this I want us to see how the glory and grace of God are revealed first in the name of God second I want us to see how the glory and grace of God are going to be revealed in the judgments of God that time when the water got really cold, and I don't acquit the guilty, and I visit these things on generations, I want to talk about those judgments in more detail and show how they reveal the grace of God and the glory of God. Third, my favorite. I want to talk about how the glory and grace of God is revealed in the covenant of God. And not just the new covenant, but even the mosaic covenant. Let me close with this. There are two kinds of people that are generally very hard to reach with the gospel. One thinks that they've gone too far to be forgiven. Therefore, grace is beyond their grasp. The other thinks that forgiveness is a snap. No real consequences. All will be forgiven. One thinks that they're utterly hopeless and forever disqualified. The other thinks that they're a shoo-in. After all, they're not near as bad as so-and-so. One sees God as unbendingly wrathful. And no matter how many times I read verse 6, that God is gracious and compassionate, unbendingly wrathful is the image they have of God. The other thinks God is a codependent wimp who needs me to like him. One is blind to the glory of God's amazing grace. The other is blind to the magnitude of their own sin. Both of them are very hard to help, and both of them are in this gymnasium right now. Question. After the sermon's been preached, after words fail to persuade either the one who is cavalier about their sin that their sin is real, they need to turn from it, and walk toward grace, or the one who's convinced their sin is horrible and grace wouldn't apply to them. After all of that fails to work, what might work? Well, I would invite you to not only consider this, but enter into echoing the very prayer of Moses at the beginning of this whole thing in chapter 33, 18, when he says this, I pray thee, show us your glory, God. glory that reveals among other things your judgments. Verse 7. Show your judgments God to people among us who would be cavalier about their sin. It's no big deal. But God here's also the deal. If you would hear by the revelation of your glory show to some among us the reality of their sin and their desperate condition. If they really see their desperate condition, they will come up probably believing that they can't come home, that it's too late for them. A soiled bride is what they are. Who would want a soiled bride? Come back to Exodus 33, 18. Make the request, God, show us your glory. Show us your glory, not only in your judgments, but also in your grace. God, show us your name. Proclaim your name. Show us your goodness. And reveal to us that your name is this. I am gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness. I keep loving kindness. And I forgive every kind of sin, even yours. Then God said, Behold, I am going to make a covenant. I want to be married to you. Before all your people I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth nor among any nations. And all the people among whom you live will see the working of the Lord. For it is an awesome thing that I am going to perform with you. Here's the message. You can come home. Here's the word from God. I want you back. And all of that is why I say that one of the primary ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the amazing grace of God. For without grace, who could stand? Without grace, Who could come home? Who could enter into a covenant with Almighty God? Nobody. But I am the Lord, the Lord God, full of compassion for you. It thrills me that this morning, in the Old Testament, I preached the gospel of amazing grace. It's our only hope. I'd like you to stand as we close. I felt compelled in all three services to make an invitation, more pointed than I even normally do, and it would be to those among us who, for whatever reasons, feel like they can't come home. And I would just, if God is moving in you, even to a point where you're feeling kind of nervous and afraid and wish I would shut up and just end this thing, that if you're hearing the voice of God today about your need to come home and respond to grace and get reconnected to the groom, if today, if you hear his voice, don't harden your heart. Don't walk away without doing business with God because you can come home. And I don't want to stir fear, but for some of you, words like this come along from time to time, and you won't hear this maybe for a while. Today, if you hear his voice, don't harden your heart. Father, I pray, I just need to release this and forget about more words thrown at this. Reveal to us your glory, which includes your judgments. and your grace. Call your people home in Jesus' name. Amen.
