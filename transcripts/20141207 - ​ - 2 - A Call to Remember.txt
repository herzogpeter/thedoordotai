Today's scripture reading is taken from Mark 1, the beginning of the good news about Jesus, the Messiah, the Son of God, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet. I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way, a voice of one calling in the wilderness, prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him, confessing their sins. They were baptized by him in the Jordan River. And also Psalm 85. I will listen to what God the Lord says. He promises peace to his people, his faithful servants, but let them not turn to folly. Surely his salvation is near those who fear him. This is glory made well in our land. Love and faithfulness meet together. Righteousness and peace kiss each other. Faithfulness springs forth from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven. The Lord will indeed give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest. Righteousness goes before him and prepares the way for his steps. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Well, welcome to week two of Advent. If you were here last week, you heard that we are going through the lectionary this season for these four weeks of Advent, following the progress through that text in terms of some of the themes that we would pull out for the book of Advent. And when Dave and I were chatting about this a couple of months ago, he had originally invited me to do week one of Advent, and now here I am in week two instead, and I think he actually read ahead in the lectionary. And I got a text a couple weeks ago saying we needed to flop these services. And I come to find out a little later that this week's theme is about repentance. I mean, he has like 80 years of ministry ahead of me. So he saw ahead. He knew what he was doing. We flopped it out. And we actually had a lovely time these last couple weeks just talking about this and trying to bring some of the dimensions of this word to light. There's a lot there in this word. And what I'd like to do is pray as we get started. God, for the sound of your voice from 2,000 years ago to be heard again today in all of its wonder and beauty and the call of your voice towards and back to you, I pray. that we as a people can hear the sweetness of the journey back, myself included. In your name I pray. Amen. Well, again, when you hear this word repent, I don't know what goes through your mind in terms of the first sort of free association kinds of images, but I know for me when I hear this word repent, one of the first things that comes into my head and in my thinking is that of this long bony finger, right? And it's this bony finger either of God's bony finger or much worse, that of the street evangelist as I'm walking down the streets of Minneapolis, minding my own business, and suddenly this finger is right next to my nose shouting, repent! It's not one of my favorite words. I may just repent in that situation, mostly just to get out of dodge, right? I mean, just out of fear, try to walk past, yes, I repent, and move on down the street. Or maybe it's not that image, but I know for me another one that comes up is that of the relationships in which I find myself. And so repent in that situation is not necessarily a word that I'm super fond of. It's not something that I want to readily do, because if I start to think about this word repent a little bit, it seems to mean that perhaps there's something about my own life that might be misaligned, that I might be walking in a certain kind of way that has implications for me or perhaps those close to me or possibly God as well. And in those spaces where I hear this word, part of me, at least a lot of me, wants to go ahead and just turn up the volume, Move along. Avoid. Keep walking out my life. Don't turn my head or my heart towards that. It's not exactly my favorite idea of a night out if Hallie and I get a break in our calendar with our five kids. It's not like we say, let's go out for dinner tonight. And you know what we want to do? We want to share all the misalignments of our life with one another, all the things that might be irritating from time to time. Let's repent together over a nice dinner. it's not my favorite thing to think about related to that turn up the volume avoid it altogether and even the main biblical image that i have related to this and i'm not saying it's a healthy image i'm not saying it's terribly helpful image but it is the image that i have and it's an image of a biblical character we saw some of the reading of this character this morning, and that's John the Baptist associated with this idea of repenting. And John the Baptist is among maybe the 100 or 200 characters in scripture that I would want to invite over for dinner. He would not fall in the top 200. This is not the guy, come on over for dinner. I mean, he seems like he sort of emerged out of the blue from some Essene cave somewhere. He's pasty white in his complexion. His hair is a little wild. He's wearing something I don't know what. It's like camel or something, and clearly he's had a bit too much of the wild honey. And again, a silly image, but I get that image, I don't know if you remember the movie Braveheart, of that Irish guy that shows up about halfway through the story, and he's kind of got this semi-sane sort of darty eye looking, he's kind of crazy, right? It's John the Baptist for me. He's sort of the street evangelist on steroids, right? So I'm unsettled by that kind of thing. I don't understand what he's trying to suggest and what's going on and why this call. And what I particularly don't understand about all of this is that when I read the text this past week, and it was something that really captivated me, was that I may want to avoid repentance and I may want to turn up the volume a bit so I don't have to turn my face towards that, but when he was calling out from the waters, come to the waters and repent, people weren't running away. In fact, the whole countryside, it said, was coming to the waters. And even all of Jerusalem was emptying itself towards the waters. There seemed to be even this growing buzz of everybody come down to the waters and repent. So what did they know that perhaps I don't? What did they see and hear that perhaps I can't? Because I don't read, you know, the latest church growth books. That isn't part of my lexicon of reading. But I just can imagine that in those books to grow a church is not the idea. Just call everybody to repent. That'll grow the church. As if my wife and I get up in the morning with our five kiddos and we get them out of their jammies. And then we're like, guys, let's get up. Get your clothes on. Your Sunday best. And let's all head to church and repent together. And like the whole cul-de-sac, you know, there's this buzz in the cul-de-sac. And pretty soon we're coming out and cars start following us around. And we're like, yay, big party of repentance at church. And yet when John called with this word repent, the whole countryside came to the waters. And all of Jerusalem emptied. They wanted to go there. Not turning up the volume. What did they hear? that maybe I can't? What did they know and see that maybe I don't? So I dug into that a bit this week, and one of the places of digging in that I found helpful was just to look a little bit at the context of the nation of Israel during this time. If you look back a little bit, Israel is in the season of its journey where 600 years before they had been brought into captivity by Babylon, and they had lost their land and lost their identity, pulled out of Jerusalem and their spaces that they had known so well, and into this place of slavery to the Babylonians. And yes, they came back to the land some 70 years later, but the land was just a shadow of its former glory. And for the foreseeable future, and even the next 500 and some odd years, Israel was an occupied people. There was a force that enslaved them. There was a force that everywhere they turned, they couldn't break free. That force was always there to govern their lives. It was after the Babylonians, it was the Persians, and then it was the Greeks, and then it was the Romans. Always occupied in their own land. And it's not like the occupiers were terribly gracious to the Jews. They wanted to wipe them out, at least keep them under control. The Greeks, for example, banned all practices of worship on the Sabbath, thus taking away a major sense of identity. The Jews would begin to forget who they were. They took away all the festivals that they would do once a month and just took that all away. They banned circumcision, anything that would have given the Jews a sense of identity and hope and past and future, the enslavers were taken away. Now, to make matters worse than that, not only were they enslaved, but the voice of God had gone silent in their lives. For Malachi was the last prophet that had the identifiable voice of God. It was 400 years before the time of Jesus that Malachi had last prophesied. And it's said of that time, Isaiah writes, that the people of this land are walking in a great darkness. Those living in a land of deep darkness, it says. And so the picture that is developing for the nation of Israel at this time is that they as a people are having their identity stripped from them. They don't know who they are. There is no sense of future, and they're living in darkness without the identifiable voice of God in the midst of it. And if there's anything that you know and that we know about the darkness, is when you're in it, even just physical darkness, is it's hard to even see your next step, right? It's hard to see where you can even go. And even if you can see, you're met by this enslaver in the sense of the Jews then, the Persians and Greeks and Romans and Babylonians. So Israel was a people without a future, losing hope, caught in the powers of an external bondage from which there's no release. And into all of that, add one more piece, And that is that this predicament was at least in part of their own making. For God had warned them time and again from the Ezekiels and the Joels and the Amoses and Hoseas and Jeremias and finally through Malachi to just turn back, turn your hearts back towards God. But they ever resisted and so God withdrew his hand. And they began to walk in the darkness of their own predicament. So the picture we have is an occupied people. Everywhere they turn, there's power that's there to greet them, to keep them enslaved. Walking in darkness, can't see their past, can't see a future. It's everywhere they are. And now into that context, out of the wilderness emerges this guy with camel hair and wild honey and clearly the identifiable voice of God who says, repent. Come to the waters. Prepare the way of the Lord. And his voice is something that Israel hadn't heard for some 400 years. We used language last week like the language of de-centering. You remember that word last week, being de-centered? Where no longer does your life make sense in the way that it once did. You are no longer what you were, but you can't necessarily see a future ahead of you. You're living in this weird in-between liminal space, and it's a de-centering place. The Israelites were clearly de-centered, and after 400 years, the silence came to an end. They had waited for that long. I don't know about you, but if I have to wait 400 minutes for something, it's like I'm ready to declare the end of all things. 400 minutes, I don't get what I want. I know for sure that the bowls of wrath are being poured out. The horsemen are riding. The trumpets are blowing. This is the end. I'm waiting 400 minutes. It must mean God is done. Please rapture me now. I don't know what it'd be like to be 400 years. It's a very long time. Now, Dave is a Cubs fan, so he does understand this kind of thing. I'm a Vikings fan. I'm only at about 60 years or so. So along with the return of God's voice it's not just even partially good news in those waters for John says that a king is coming it's not just that my voice is here but I'm telling you that a king is coming so prepare the way and the way you want to prepare the way for the Lord is to just come to the waters and repent so if you know anything maybe you've been around here a number of years but you've probably heard the teaching that before a king would come to a land that they would send a messenger in front of them. And it was that messenger's job to take the stones out of the pathway of the king, to remove those stones so that the king would have a straight path down which to walk as the king came into this land. And so when John the Baptist is this messenger on behalf of the king preparing the way, what he's calling the people to in repentance is to remove the stones of their heart to make way for the king to come. And repentance, as I've said for me, has always been this thing that I've wanted to avoid, but recently and in the last several years as we've done Advent in our home with our children to some degree, one of the things that we'll do is we'll go pick up an actual stone, and maybe it's from the cul-de-sac or whatever, and we'll take this stone and we'll spend some time with God and write on that stone some sort of sin or misalignment or something that is standing in our way. This turned out to be a beautiful and rich time. It's the first time that I've gotten a whiff of that, wait a second, I can actually be with God in the midst of this. And I'm not seeing any long bony finger as I'm doing it. And I look down at the word and I wonder with God and the stones just stay during the time of Advent as we prepare the way of the Lord. And if we explored that word a little further in terms of just what it means to repent and that there's even an invitation here, that I love what it says in Revelation 2.5, where Jesus says, oh, please, church, repent. And then he says this word, remember. Remember the heights from which you've fallen. Remember what is deepest and truest about you. Remember that you come from the hand of the king. In the darkness in which you've walked, and the slavery in which you find yourself. Remember this, that darkness is not what is truest and deepest, for you are a child of God, bearing his image. Return and remember who you are and whose you are. Return to the face and the breath of God. So when I hear all of that, suddenly it might start making a little bit of sense as to why the people from the countryside began to just come down to the waters, and Jerusalem emptied and began to flock towards those beautiful places of repentance. For in the bleakness and the blackness of their lives, there suddenly was a little bit of hope. For Isaiah writes to those people that he says that the people walking in darkness have seen a great light. For them who are dwelling in the land of deep darkness, on them the light has shined. So come to the waters. Run to the waters. Remember what is truest and deepest about you, Israel, because before all of this silence, you were, and you actually still are, in the midst of the silence, my chosen people. You are made in my image. Do you think they had forgotten some of that over all those years in darkness? So come to the waters of repentance. They help us remember. we remember we're children of the king. And when I hear that, as we start transitioning our way to the table, suddenly those words of 2,000 years ago don't seem all that far away, do they? For, I would just guess, we're not going to be anytime soon an occupied people by a foreign nation who is enslaving us. We're not going to see the Greeks and the Persians and the Romans and the Babylonians that are hedging us in and creating a reality in which we cannot move without that power greeting us there. I know a lot of Canadians tend to live on the border. I know like 90% and stuff, but I don't think they're mustering to come down and take over Minnesota. So we're probably not going to be enslaved in a power that way. But if we ask the question, how many of us know what it's like to walk in darkness? To everywhere we turn, all we see is something that is enslaving us. We don't see much of a future. We don't see much of a hope. We can't remember who we are and whose we are. Anybody ever have anything like that in their marriage? Hallie and I have been married 20 years. As you'd imagine, ups and downs all the way through. But we know what it's like. When you're walking in such a persistent pattern of miscommunication and you can't quite sort it out and you wonder why do we keep treating each other in this way? Maybe nothing big but why can't we just even get on the same page and it just it seems to govern all of our communication patterns and everywhere we turn we're greeted with this and this and we can't seem to break free and the future that we had once dreamed of maybe we can't see anymore and or the past and the future towards which we're walking, we don't see any hope, for this is what the rest of our life will be. Just this. Anybody constantly losing patience with those around you? You can't understand why? It's a little burst of anger. Hear sharp words towards people. You don't want to do it, but something just ignites in you, and you just can't control that for that little piece of time. You hate that you do it, but you just think this is just who I am. It's part of my personality. I can't possibly break free from that. Or maybe no matter how hard we try, we can't put down the bottle. There's no future but this. Day in and day out, I wake up and it's right in front of me yet again. You know what it's like to wake up when you're in the midst of that kind of season? And it's right there, again, as you rise and as you sleep. People constantly spinning information, maybe in little webs of lies, just so that people will like us a little bit more, playing the game of pretend. We say things that aren't quite true, just mostly, and we don't like that we do it, but it is our reality. We spin towards seeking, perhaps instead, money or position or power. We know it's illusory, but we can't stop grasping after it. anybody can't come present to their own children no matter how many books you read about being a good parent and just there's something there i like everywhere i turn it's right in front of me or maybe it is that thing towards which we run that we don't belong maybe it's a him or a her or that image on the screen and you wake up again and the darkness is there and you can't see, you don't remember who you are and whose you are. You can't even see the possibility of any future other than this. I love Paul's words related to this. Because if he understood it, Paul, I mean, he was greeted by a risen Savior on a horse. He spent three years in the heavens and yet he still struggles with this. I love his words in Romans. They capture so many of our journeys. He says this. for I have the desire to do what is good but I cannot carry it out for I do not do the good I want to do but the evil I don't want to do this is what I keep on doing so I find this law at work says Paul although I want to do good evil is right there with me for in my inner being I do delight in God's law but I see another law at work in me waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin oh what a wretched man i am who will rescue me from this body of sin and death so again if you're like me maybe it's not 400 years but when the darkness is present when there's a power that is at work everywhere in which we turn even 400 minutes feels like an exceptionally long time. And how quickly I forget who I am and how fast I am to assume that this is my future. There is no hope. So what do we do? Well, the call is the same. The call is the same as it was 2,000 years ago. Yeah, we have iPhones and automobiles and big buildings. We don't have stony cities and countrysides and rivers towards the walk, but the call is the same. It's to repent and to return and to remember. Which is why I love that this particular week of Advent from the lectionary falls on a Sunday in which we celebrate the table and the cross together. Because the table and the cross is nothing if not a beautiful invitation to return and remember that the hopelessness and the lack of future is not what is truest about us. you know it's interesting sometimes I even wonder as I'm in these patterns and I can't see and I don't know it must mean I have a hard heart must mean I have a hard heart no we can have a soft heart it's just that sin is that powerful if you're in those patterns and you can't break free it doesn't mean you have a hard heart it means that there's only one place to go with it and that that word repentance among all the words of our faith perhaps is the gladdest word of our faith not something from which to run, not a bony finger in our nose, not something towards which we should turn up the volume for repent has within it this idea that something else is possible, that there is something out there, there is a light that will shine and so we can come to the table and we can come to the cross again and again and i really mean again and again if you study the first century jews and and their desire for repentance it happened all throughout their year for sure at the festival of atonement but you could even be an essene in a cave and those essenes in the caves would sometimes go to the waters twice a day well that makes me feel better the table's always open the cross is always there just because there's a cycle does not mean you have a hard heart just keep coming to the table for they knew back then that repentance was a very posture of life and because a different way was possible it was a beautiful word it was a lovely word and perhaps among all the words the gladdest because you can keep coming back and I realize for some that there could be this thought that oh Peter you have no idea what I've done you have no idea the places in which I've walked and you have no idea the well from which I've drank and more than once I like the idea of the table and the cross but that can't possibly be for me. I can't possibly come to those places and those spaces and I've been trying to think of what to say in response to that and how we understand where we are in the midst of this when we're in those places and so the only words I could come up with are these. Is that if there is a power at work in this world that is more powerful than the cross and the resurrection of Jesus, if there is a power that this table and that cross and his rising can't handle, then you should serve that. You should. But here's the thing. There's not. For Jesus took sin's best shot on the way to Calvary. every last jot and tittle of it. I love the words of Colossians 2. It says, God made you alive with Christ. Remember that. That is who you are. The darkness is not who you are. For he forgave all our sins. He canceled the record of the charges against us and took them all away by nailing them to the cross. And so in this way, he disarmed the spiritual rulers and authorities that would keep us in captivity and he shamed them publicly by his victory over them on the cross. Every last jot and tittle. And so now we stand on the edge just a few weeks before the birth. And I love the words of Silent Night. Sitting with my son in the car driving yesterday and we heard these words and we both reflected upon them. I love that last line that it says, we stand at the dawn of redeeming grace. He's coming. repentance is not a word to be feared it's a word to be embraced another way of life is possible so come to the table and come to the cross and let's together prepare the way of our lord Thank you.
