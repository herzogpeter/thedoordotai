Well, good morning. It is very good to be here. But in some ways, this is like, it's a little odd. It's like going on a blind date. Because what we're going to do here in the course of this sermon, people normally do in the confines of a really good, safe relationship. So you know the pastor, and the pastor knows you, and they're part of the community, and you trust each other, and you love each other, and you're in with each other no matter what, through thick or thin, and you have this wonderful relationship that goes on. And so then the preaching becomes a regular part of that. And this is like going on a blind date where we go out and we have dinner and we go to a movie and we hang around and we walk around the lake and we talk for a while. And we're doing things that people do normally when they really are committed to each other and like each other and spend time with each other and can trust each other. But we're sort of trying it out, right? We're sort of practicing and we're seeing if we really like each other or not. Now the trouble with this blind date is I'm coming back again next week no matter what, no matter how it goes. So we're going to spend all this time sort of thinking, oh, and if I don't really like you, I have to come back anyway because I said I would. And if you don't really care for me, well, it's church and you have to come back anyway and put up with it or volunteer in the children's program downstairs and sort of get over that way. But we're going to do the very best we can, fair enough. And we're going to spend some time with each other and we're going to interact and we'll see where all of this goes. And I'm going to ask you to wonder with me about a few things. So taking this metaphor of being on the blind date, we are going to, I want to tell you a little bit about myself and a little bit about the things I'm wondering about and see if you would like to wonder along with me. And the things I'd like to wonder about have to do with God and they have to do with Jesus and they have to do with the kingdom of God. And they really have to do with the gospel of Jesus and what it is. And I wonder about it. I wonder what the gospel of Jesus really is. And there are some people who think that, you know, A pastor with a seminary degree and a master's degree in theology shouldn't be wondering what the gospel is. They sort of figure that you know that before you get out of seminary. Like you have to check off a box that you know what the gospel of Jesus is before they give you a master's degree and such things. But there's something about the story and the gospel and the way of Jesus that's befuddling and it's confusing. And it might be because of the complicated words that are used in it and the myriad of words that you use. Christianity can be terribly confusing because there's all these different phrases that mean the same thing or sort of mean the same thing. So someone would talk about the Lord or their Savior or their Master or their Teacher or their Rabbi. And so throughout the Bible, you have all these different phrases, and they're all talking about Jesus. And so you sort of have to figure those out. And I came to Christianity sort of, I don't know, a little later than some people. I was 17 before I ever got involved in any of this stuff at all. I didn't know before starting to follow God in the way of Jesus that there was a connection between Christmas and Easter. I just didn't know anything. I didn't grow up in some far off land. I grew up in Golden Valley. But I didn't know that Christmas and Easter had anything to do with each other. So it was all new. And so coming into the things of Christianity, it was all sort of fresh and confusing, really quite confusing, trying to pull it all together. So we're going to talk this morning about the gospel and about the kingdom and about the call and about the good news. That's really confusing. At least it's confusing to me. And I would like for you to wonder with me for a while about it and see if maybe there's some places where God meets us in all of that confusion. So let me say a little bit more about what's sort of confusing or wondering about the things of the gospel. I was told that the things of Jesus, that the gospel, that the good news, had to do with the life, death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. So when someone would talk about the gospel of Jesus or the good news of Jesus or the kingdom call of Jesus, it really had to do with people understanding and professing their belief in Jesus as the one who lived and died and was buried and resurrected and ascended into heaven and promised a return. And so as a Christian, you're one who understands that story and you understand that call, and you profess faith in Jesus. You believe in Jesus. Now what's confusing is that it seems like that part of the story is only one part of the story, but isn't the entire story. So when people start talking about the kingdom call, some of us think, well, it means to believe in Jesus. That's what it means, that I believe in the things of Jesus. But let me show you what's confusing about this and what I'd like for you to wonder with me about. I want to read for you this part out of Mark chapter 1. If you're not familiar with the Bible, the Bible is basically two general sections, an Old Testament and a New Testament. But from our perspective, they're both really quite old. So that can be a little confusing right out of the shoes. But you have an old part and a not quite as old part. And the New Testament, or the not quite as old part, picks up the story of God where Jesus comes into the story in a physical birth. And so it's the story of Jesus forward. And the beginning of that New Testament part are these biographies about Jesus, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And the Bible is terribly confusing just on its own right sometimes because you have all these books in the Bible, 66 of them, and they have different names to them. Sometimes the name of a book has to do with an event, like the genesis of things, the beginning of things, or something that's going to be revealed, like the book of Revelation. And sometimes the book of the Bible is named after the person that it's about, who it's sort of written about. and sometimes it's named after the person who wrote it. So boy, I'll tell you, if you don't know a lot about the Bible, they can just throw you for a loop, or a Luke, I guess, if you sort of want to do it that way. So the book of Luke isn't about Luke. It's written by a guy named Luke. It's about Jesus. So the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are not things about them. They're stories and biographies of Jesus. Well, Mark writes one of those, and he begins this section that we're going to look at, we're actually about 12 sentences or so into it. So there's these little references, Mark 1, 12 through 13. So here's how it reads. At once, the Spirit sent him, which was Jesus, out into the desert. Actually, this takes place just after Jesus's baptism by John the baptizer, which can be confusing enough on its own. There are some people who refer to John as John the Baptist, and then they realize that they didn't really have Baptists until about the 1600s. So how was it that John was a Baptist, and why wouldn't we all be Baptists then? Because it was good enough for John. Why wouldn't it be good enough for all the rest of us? But John, the baptizer, was baptizing people and baptized Jesus, and the Spirit of God in the form of dove descended upon him, and this voice from heaven and all those things happened. And immediately following that, the Spirit sent him, Jesus, out into the desert. And he was there in the desert 40 days being tempted by Satan, and he was with wild animals, and the angels attended to him. Now this isn't actually the part I want to wonder about, but it's just become, in the last couple of weeks, one of my favorite parts of the Bible, and it's just before the part I want us to wonder about. But it's a really cool section on its own, so I sort of threw it in there as a kid's toy freebie. But it's this beautiful thing about Jesus gets, is baptized, goes out in the desert, and then the way Mark tells it, and there the wild animals are there and the angels of God attended to him. That the wild and the angelic meet together. There's something just profound about this kingdom thing where the regular earthly things and the spirit of God commingle in the kingdom life with Jesus. That's just really, I think it's pretty cool on its own. But let's wonder about this next part. And after John the baptizer was put into prison, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the good news of God. The time has come, he said. The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news. And Jesus walked beside the sea of Galilee, and he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. Mark just wants to make it clear they weren't just crazy men out there throwing nets into lakes, but explaining it's okay. They were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, come and follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And at once they left their nets and they followed him. Now somebody might read that and think, what's so befuddling about that? What's so confusing? What is there to wonder about that? Well, the version of Christianity that I was told was that the good news is that Jesus lived and died and was buried and resurrected from the dead, ascended into heaven, and someday promises a return. And that's the good news. But those of us that know the story of the Bible know that these things in Mark took place years before Jesus's death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and promised return. So what was the good news that Jesus was calling them into? The kingdom of God is near. It's at hand. Repent and believe the good news and live into it. The good news was not that Jesus was saying to them, in a couple of years, I'm going to live and die and be buried and resurrected and ascend into heaven and promise my return. He wasn't just inviting them into a future act. He was saying, come into the kingdom. Come live in this now. The good news is around and it's available and you should come and live in it. Well, what was that good news? What was that kingdom of God that Jesus is inviting them into? So it can be terribly confusing when we think that the kingdom of God is simply the story of Jesus and that's all. And we can sort of convince ourselves or be told by others that the story of God goes something like this. In the beginning, God creates everything, and everything is really good. It's what goes on in the beginning parts of the book of Genesis. It's the way God wants it, and everybody's living in harmony, and things are good, and they're right, and they're procreating, and taking care of the world, and everything's right. And then sin comes into the world, and there she goes. And all of the world goes into this deep, dark spiral for thousands of years until Jesus comes along, and then she spikes back up, and everything is right in the world. And then Jesus is crucified and he goes away into heaven and everything starts getting back. And someday Jesus is going to come back and everything's going to get better again. And we sort of get this version of the story that the kingdom of God are sort of these little high points. And when we're living in the midst of all of these, we're just waiting around for God to make things better. We're just waiting to get out of here until God can bring us to heaven and make everything good again. But that wasn't the invitation that Jesus gave. Jesus walks onto the Sea of Galilee, well next to the Sea of Galilee. Later he walks on the Sea of Galilee, but at this point he walks next to the Sea of Galilee and says to people, the kingdom of God, let's come and live in it. And he wasn't just saying, let's follow me to the cross. The disciples had no idea that Jesus was going to be crucified. In fact, when it happened, they didn't know what to do and they just dropped their faith and ran. At his resurrection, they were so confused by the very notion of his resurrection that they wouldn't believe it when the women told him about it. It wasn't just them being hard-headed men not wanting to listen to women. It was the fact that they could not get it through their heads that the death would come in life. So what was this invitation into following Jesus before those things ever happened? I think there's something wonderful about it because somehow in this version that you have Genesis and then everything gets bad and then you have a peak where it's good with Jesus and now everything's bad again and someday it's all going to be good again. What's the good news in that? What's the come and live in the good news of that? So I've been wondering about this. That maybe there's something really wonderful and really great about the kingdom of God that is alive and is active that encompasses the whole story of Jesus and encompasses the whole story of life and encompasses the whole story of creation and it all fits together and it doesn't center only around this one activity. But this activity of God sending Jesus fully God and fully man into the world and dying on the cross fits into the kingdom of God, but it doesn't start with Jesus. In fact, nearly everything that we know Jesus said, every teaching of Jesus that we hold to, almost all of them were before his death, burial, and resurrection. He was speaking to people that he anticipated would live in the kingdom life right then and there. But boy, it can be hard to wonder about these things because there's so much of Christianity that just wants to center around belief in Jesus and the cross of Jesus only. And look, I'm a big cross person. It's a big deal. It's extraordinarily important. It is key to understanding the way of following God and the way of Jesus. I'm not minimizing it for a moment. But the kingdom of God is something that's much larger than just that one portion of the story. And the good news that we have is to invite people into kingdom life. So you have all of these disciples who are invited into kingdom life so that they will understand the things that happened to Jesus. And maybe we flip the story around thinking that people can only understand the kingdom if they first believe the things of Jesus. So there's some things that make this really hard to get our heads around. Like that song that we sang earlier, which is a wonderful old hymn that has been redone. It's a great song and it should be sung. But there's some parts in it that if we don't look at it carefully and if we don't understand the whole story, we start to think that the call of Jesus is just around the cross. Love so amazing, love so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all. Oh, the wonderful cross, oh, the wonderful cross, bids me come and die and find that I may truly live. Yes, true. But when Jesus called Andrew and Simon by the side of the lake, and when he came to Galilee and said, the kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe the good news, the time has come, let's live in it, he wasn't calling them to the cross yet there is a call of god that has been going out to everywhere and everyone for all time to come and to live in the story of god there's another part that became befuddling to me i was reading through the end of the the fifth book sort of of the biographies of jesus there's the four matthew mark luke and john that's specifically about jesus and then there's one called the book of acts or the acts of the apostles it's another one of those places where if we don't know the insider language of christianity can be sort of confusing because you have these two phrases that are kind of used interchangeably about the disciples the word disciple and the word apostle well they were called disciples when they were following jesus and they were called apostles after jesus's death burial resurrection ascension and promised return when they were then leading the things of god so that there's this book that follows the life of Jesus and then the life of those who are following Jesus and they are called the apostles. Well in the Acts of the Apostles or the book of Acts it picks up with the story of Saint Paul. Earlier called Saul but he goes through a conversion like a lot of people they have a name change when they decide to live fully in the kingdom in the way of Jesus and he has this name change to Paul. And so about half of the book of Acts sort of becomes following the story of Paul. Paul is doing a lot of things. He ends up being arrested and the book of Acts ends with these words. for two whole years Paul stayed there in the city of Rome as a matter of fact. Paul stayed there in his own rented house and he welcomed all who came to see them. Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ. He preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ. And I wonder have we sort of missed something in Christianity in the West today where we only teach about the Lord Jesus Christ and not preach about the kingdom of God? I'm not saying that Paul had two messages. He had one message that had two parts, the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ. So there was all of this kingdom life. Jesus invites people into it. They're supposed to live in it. Paul is preaching the kingdom of God and inviting people into the way of Jesus to come into this kingdom of God life. And somehow it's sort of become all mixed together where we think perhaps that it's sufficient, that we just believe things about Jesus and that that is the kingdom of God. But wonder with me, is it possible that the things of the kingdom of God are so much larger and so much more encompassing than just that one piece of the story? And that we're invited into this whole life together? Maybe the story isn't just creation, fall, redemption, waiting, promised return, apocalypse. Let's get out of this thing while we can. Maybe there's a different story of God's constant creating and co-creating and recreating process of everything in the world so that the kingdom of God will grow every and anywhere. And that Jesus's invitation when he walks along to the prostitute and to the tax collector and to the outsiders and to all the people is, come on, let's live in the kingdom. Come on, let's live in it. You're invited in. The doors of the kingdom are thrown open wide. You're invited to come in. In fact, there's a story like this, a bunch of stories. In fact, maybe all of the stories in the New Testament are about that. But one of them in particular is the story of the woman at the well. It's sort of a famous one if you've been around the Bible a bunch, so you may have heard it. And if not, then it won't be famous to you until I get done telling you the story. But it's the story about Jesus going and talking to this woman who's there to get some water out of a well. but the significance of the story doesn't revolve only around Jesus talking to a woman which was a very big deal of the day and it doesn't only revolve around the fact that this woman's there all by herself probably later in the day most likely because her life was one that other people shunned and hated because she had been with a variety of men been married to six or seven of them and then is living with another one that's not even her husband it's not like she was living high on the hog as sort of some free independent woman in their day there was no such thing and when she was divorced by her husband, it wasn't her choosing. She was pushed away by her husband and sent out on her own, so she had to live with another one, and another one, and another one. And finally, she's with one that doesn't even have a commitment to her and is just using her. So Jesus meets her. But all of the significance of the story isn't even around that. It's around where he's talking to her. Because Jerusalem was in the south, and Galilee was up in the north, and in between was an area called Samaria. It was a big deal for Jewish people of the day, the religious type especially, because they understood how the story went, and they knew that it was the people in Galilee, and especially those in Jerusalem, who were good and right and pure, and really following God. And then you had these people in Samaria that lived in the middle, that when the Assyrians had attacked hundreds of years earlier, that the people in Samaria struck a deal with the Assyrians and said, we won't fight you, we will join you. And so to a Jew, the people in Samaria became half-breeds, not pure-blooded Jews. and the Jews hated the Samaritans. In fact, when Jesus tells a parable about the good Samaritan, the reason there's significance in the parable of the good Samaritan is because to a religious person of the day, there was no such thing as a good Samaritan. A Jewish man would wake up in the morning and pray, God, thank you for not making me a dog, a woman, or a Samaritan. And so when Jesus is talking to this woman and she goes back to town to tell all the people there that she had met someone who told her everything that she had ever thought. And there's a story of this wonderful conversation where she says, I didn't know you were a prophet, but we worship God in the mountain and you worship God in the temple. And Jesus says, but the time is coming when all who worship God will worship God in spirit and in truth. And he's saying to her, you are invited in the kingdom. You are in it. The disciples came back and they're talking to Jesus. And as the crowd is coming from the town, Jesus looks out and he says, look at the harvest. The harvest of the kingdom of God. It's already been planted and it's ready to be reaped. You didn't plant it, someone else did. But the kingdom of God is alive. And all of a sudden, the disciples are being invited to look around the world and see all the places where the kingdom of God is already active and they didn't have anything to do with it. Because the kingdom of God is bigger than any of our expressions of our faith. and the good news is that the kingdom of God is alive and is happening and people are being invited into it and they need to know the rest of the story and that as followers of Jesus we don't simply bring the kingdom of God to people we go to where God is already active which is everywhere and we find the little seedlings of the kingdom and we bring them to full fruition and we find the parts that are choking out the growth of the kingdom and we pull the weeds out and we cultivate faith. And there is the meaning of Jesus saying, and when some hear the good news, it falls on rocky soil, and others it falls on good soil, and some it falls in places where the weeds quickly take it away. That the kingdom of God is being spread, and it's happening all over the place. And all of a sudden, it becomes good news again. And that's what I wonder about. How is it that our version of the story becomes not such good news to so many people? That instead of finding the goodness of the kingdom of God everywhere we go and trying to cultivate that into full kingdom life. Instead, we have to rip everything apart and tell people to start over with our version of the story. And so there is this big, expansive story of the kingdom of God that we all get invited into that not only spans from Genesis through the end of time, but specifically lands on this guy named Abram, whose name was later changed to Abraham. And the blessing of God on Abraham was that he was going to be the father of many nations and that his descendants would be a blessing to all the world. Then you have the nation of Israel that is supposed to be living out this story. So maybe instead of, it started out real good and then got real bad, and then we had a little peak and it was really, there was some pretty good time there and now it's down again, but someday it's gonna get good again. Maybe instead of that being the story, the story is that we are to live like the nation of Israel as a group of people who are living in the kingdom of God everywhere we go. and were to live as a peculiar people. So the nation of Israel, what they were supposed to do was they were supposed to live out this peculiar way. They were supposed to be followers of God. In the book of Leviticus, this sort of confusing, dry book to some people in the Old Testament, it's really this beautiful story about how the nation of Israel is supposed to live. In the Old Testament book of Leviticus, there was this phrase called the year of the Jubilee. Here's how it went. Every week, the nation of Israel was supposed to rest and worship and give. Every week. While all the other nations stored up and worked hard every day and kept everything for themselves, not the nation of Israel. They rested one day a week. They didn't live off 100% of what they made. They lived off something more like 80%, maybe even less than that. They gave to the poor. They took care of the weak. They took care of the sick. While every other nation was taking their weak and their sick and their depressed and sending them out, getting rid of them, and taking the strong people from other nations and making them their slaves, and that's how they were going to conquer the world, not the nation of Israel. They were supposed to live weak. They were supposed to live dependent on God. They were supposed to live off the hook. So every week they were supposed to rest. And every year they were supposed to take a week. And every seven years they were supposed to rest for an extended period of time. And every seven sets of seven years, or every 49 years, they were supposed to experience what was called the year of the jubilee. The year of the jubilee was a year when God makes everything right. In fact, the Catholic Church declared the year 2000 to be the year of the jubilee. all over the world. So if you're familiar with a rock singer named Bono, it's actually a fake name, his real name's Paul. This rock singer named Paul who's trying to help forgive debt all over the world in the year of the Jubilee. That's the story. It's the kingdom story. It's the God story. So the nation of Israel is supposed to live like that. They had these crazy rules that every prisoner was to go free in the year of the Jubilee. No one was to be kept prisoner. No one was to be kept prisoner and no one was to work. Everyone was to rest and everyone was to share. The only thing you could eat was that which fell to the ground, but that God would provide and every nation would have, and their whole nation would have enough. Prisoners were set free and every debt was forgiven. And there was these really specific rules in the book of Leviticus that say, look, if you're gonna lend money to someone, or in Minnesota, how you'd say it, if you're gonna borrow money to someone and you were approaching the year of the Jubilee and you know that in the year of the Jubilee, all debts are canceled, it's not fair and it's not right and you cannot not give them the loan just because you think it's gonna be forgiven. You give them the loan anyway and it's forgiven. It was called the year of the Jubilee. Well, later on, hundreds of years later, when the nation of Israel goes through all kinds of stuff and they don't follow God and all this, they're waiting for this year of the Jubilee to come for these periods of refreshment. And later, the name of the year of the Jubilee changes to the day of the Lord. So there's all this expression, like in the book of Isaiah, hundreds of years later, that the day of the Lord, this will all change. In the day of the Lord, God will make things right. So the book of Isaiah reads it this way. The spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me because the Lord has appointed me to preach good news to the poor. See, the good news to the poor was, you're gonna be taken care of. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted and to proclaim freedom for the captives, that they would actually go free. This wasn't some metaphor of being free in your heart. It meant you're not a slave anymore and you get to go home. That someday God's gonna make everything right in the world. And to release from darkness for the prisoners. To proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and the day of the vengeance of our God. To comfort all who mourn and to provide for those who grieve in Zion or Jerusalem or Israel. to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness and a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor. So there was this full understanding of how you're to live in the kingdom of God. So when Jesus comes on the scene, what was called the year of the Jubilee, then becomes the day of the Lord. Then by the time of Jesus is now referred to as the kingdom of God. the kingdom of God is at hand and now God is going to make things right in the way God wants them to be your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven and forgive us our what debts as we forgive our debtors lots of versions of it forgive us our trespasses but nobody likes to say that because in groups it gets all trespasses forgive us our sins forgive us our wrongs I think the best version is forgive us our debts because it's hearkening back to the kingdom of God life. Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. Luke tells the version of Jesus' story after the baptism and his time out with the wild animals and the angels and picks up the story and reads it this way. Luke 4. Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He taught in their synagogues and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth where he'd been brought up, his hometown. And on the Sabbath day, he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it was written. The spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind and release for the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Then he rolled up the scroll, he gave it back to the attendant and he sat down and the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began by saying to them, today the scripture is fulfilled in your hearing. The kingdom of God is at hand. Now let's live in it. this jesus didn't make up the kingdom of god it has been going and he's inviting everyone and all of us to step in it and so then what you have in the book of acts is what did the followers of jesus then do and so if you know the story they get together after his death burial resurrection ascension they say we have to live he was right he's the messiah let's live in it now so what do they do they get together and they sell their possessions and they share everything and everybody has everything in common and all the debts are forgiven and they're living in harmony with God in the way of Jesus in the kingdom, in the wide open, crazy fields of God that everywhere they go, they see that God was already there. Then the Holy Spirit of God falls upon them on the day of Pentecost. And all of a sudden, everybody now has the Spirit of God. And the story of Pentecost is that just as the Spirit of God was on Jesus and Isaiah to be anointed to preach the good news to the poor and to set the captives free and la, la, la, la, now that Spirit of God falls on everyone and all these regular people. So when someone is touched by the Spirit of God, that wasn't a new thing. That didn't start with Jesus. People were being anointed by the Spirit of God all throughout the story so that they could be the ones to proclaim the kingdom of God, the year of the Lord, the year of the Jubilee. So we have this enormous story that encompasses so much more and throws open the kingdom gates wide and invites them all to come in. So then Paul says, I'm going to preach the kingdom and I'm going to preach the story of Jesus and how you get to come into the kingdom life. And the good news then is that we don't huddle up and we don't hide away thinking we have the good thing and we have to protect it and we have to make sure that we create a temple and that everything is just right because if anybody comes in and spoils this thing, then all the things of God are gonna be ruined. It's not a big, bad, dark world and we're the good guys cloistering together to keep ourselves safe. We're sent into the world to be a blessing in the world and to find the places where the kingdom of God is already happening and to enter into it and to swim in those waters and to cultivate those fields and to be about the kingdom of God so we can bring the good news and say the kingdom of God is here. Let me tell you the story of the Savior. And there's people who are living in the kingdom who are totally ready to hear the story that we don't have to break them all apart and rip them down before we can tell them the story again. That God has been recreating this whole thing all along so the kingdom of God is at hand and we're all anointed to do such things. our church started four years ago and we started in a little hip neighborhood in Minneapolis and then we moved a year ago to this needy neighborhood in south Minneapolis called the Phillips neighborhood it's been this wonderful thing that we didn't expect we've just noticed that it happened to us making this move from a hip place to a needy place and from a hip people to a needy people it's really something good and right because I don't think God calls us to a life in the kingdom that's hip and cool needy and a blessing yeah so it's been this wonderful thing but when we're making the move into the Phillips neighborhood there are people who talked about how it's such a good thing that we're going to be bringing light to the darkness which I know their best intentions was that they were saying that you're going in there and there's a lot of hard things that go on there my contention is that yeah there's hard things that go on there but they just look different than the hard things that go on in Main Street and Maple Grove they're just different I don't know that anything is as insidious as greed and lust and gluttony. Yeah, so it's stuff going on there that's not about the kingdom, but there's stuff going on everywhere that's not about the kingdom. We didn't bring light into the darkness. When we got into the Phillips neighborhood and where we are, there's all kinds of kingdom of God activity going on there. It is going hard and heavy. It's going hard and heavy everywhere. And we get to join in the cultivating work of God. We didn't come into a dark cave carrying a light. We're entering into the kingdom fields of God, and the world is ripe for a harvest, and we didn't even plant it. But we're going to live in the kingdom life. There's this wonderful expression in a nice version of the Bible called the message. In the book of Romans, which was a letter written by Paul to the people in Rome, so it's named after them. In the 15th chapter, that's this call that people would live in the freedom of the grace of the God of green hope. That the kingdom life is one of green and life and beauty and growth and that we cultivate that wherever we find it. And that as Christians, we join in the activity of God by working with the spirit to make all things of the kingdom better wherever and everywhere we find him. it's a wonderful thing so there's this part of the bible that's one of my favorites and it reads like this jesus has just gotten done telling his disciples they have to do everything that he told them to do he hadn't died yet and they didn't know that that was coming but they know he had said an awful lot of things and probably a few of them said i can't even remember what he said how am i supposed to do everything that he said makes this really big deal out of it in a part of the bible called John 14. He says, you have to do everything that I've taught you. And those who don't, you have no part in me. And they're just like, ah. And then Jesus says this. All of this I have spoken while I was still with you. But the counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything that I've said to you. So peace I leave with you and my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives, so don't let your hearts be troubled. and don't be afraid. I like this part because when we get done doing things like this, where I stand up here and talk for a long period of time and things from the Bible just have a very short period of time, it seems to me that it's important that we're reminded that we're not, our primary teacher is not anyone who stands on this platform or any other platform or that we listen to on a tape. Our primary teacher is the Spirit of God that brings back to our memory everything that Jesus ever said and taught. So I'm gonna pray a benediction on you that anything that I shared today that would be in agreement with the words of Jesus, that those things would come back to your mind. The Holy Spirit would bring those back and remind you and teach you. And anything that was sort of my take on it, my wonderings that aren't worth much, that those would just fall away. And that we would live in the kingdom, that we'd be caught up in the story, and that we'd live in the wide open fields of the God of green hope. So may anything that was shared this morning in the music or in the sermon that was in agreement with the words of Jesus, may the Holy Spirit bring those things back to your mind to teach you everything that Jesus said and taught. And may you be people who run in the fields of the God of green hope, finding the kingdom everywhere you go, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. God bless.
