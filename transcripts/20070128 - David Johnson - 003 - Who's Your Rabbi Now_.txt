For the Spirit of Jesus, for the Spirit of the prophets, for just the right Spirit, I pray. And I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Last week, in the context of this series of sermons we're doing called The Way of the Rabbi, We spent most of our time dealing with a question that I want to pull into this week as, well, the question was and is this, who's your rabbi? To whom have you given authority? From whom do you get your information about life and how life works? I offered you Jesus as the answer to that question who holds within himself, says Paul in Colossians 2, verse 3. All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, a great rabbi he who says to anyone, anyone, who wants to follow him and thereby become like him, lehacharai, come follow me. And immediately, says Matthew 4, verse 20, Simon, who was called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, left. What they were doing, their nets, their way of living, and followed him into a different way of life. Though they didn't fully know even what that meant, they left and followed him, along with many others, actually. Indeed, by Matthew 4, verse 25, just five verses later, it says, Great multitudes were doing what Peter and Andrew, James and John were doing, following him. Great multitudes were following him from Galilee and Decapolis to Jerusalem and Judea and even beyond the Jordan. And while from that multitude, many would actually become his Talmudim, there's a pattern here that I want us to notice. and it's actually why last Sunday I closed the service the way I did, suggesting that maybe some of you should wait before declaring Jesus to be your rabbi. Some of you should wait because while many followed Jesus in the text, in the story of his life, when they first heard him, loved what he said and what he did, great multitudes, in fact, followed. Many others along the way would fall away. Like described in Matthew 8, whose first response to Jesus was, I will follow you wherever you go, until he actually heard what it might cost, what it might mean to be among this rabbi's talmudim. Remember? Matthew 8, Verse 20, foxes have holes and birds have nests, said Jesus to this eager, tell me. But the Son of Man does not have a place to lay his head in. If you follow me, it might be that way for you. Still want to come? You're invited. I want anybody. Anyone can follow me. Still want to come? The answer, no. John's Gospel, rather, the sixth chapter, the 66th verse, the same thing, same dynamic, same pattern. I want you to see it. It's over and over again, having just explained a little bit further to those who were following what it meant to follow him, what he meant by what he said, what it might cost, what it might mean to be among his Talmudim. It says in verse 66 of John 6, many of his disciples, after they finally dialed into what Jesus meant, withdrew. And we're not walking with him anymore. The pattern's consistent. That quite often, when people would first hear Jesus, this great rabbi that we spoke of last week and the week before, when they first heard him, they were amazed because he spoke as one having shmicha. Remember, authority. He spoke as one having authority, an authority that was marked with power such that even demons obeyed him. And when he was doing that stuff, when he spoke and demons obeyed and the storm calmed and the disease fled, the people loved it. When he broke the bread and the fish and fed 5,000 free food right over there, they loved him. but quite often when he would begin to press in to what he meant by what he said what it might cost, what it might mean to actually carry his yoke and we know what that means as a rabbi it was his way of living, his way of being which included things like loving your enemy are you nuts? which included things like laying down your life and picking up your cross. Many lost interest after the free food thing was over. Many even became angry. Luke chapter 4, in what most consider to be his inaugural speech, where he publicly declares his message and his mission, it even happens there. You'll see this very same pattern. Luke chapter 4, verse 16. And Jesus came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. He hadn't been to Nazareth for a while. He's coming back. And as was his custom, he entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read. And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Let me just give you the picture here. In Jesus' day, when a visiting rabbi would come to a synagogue, and that's what Jesus is here in this scene. He's a visiting rabbi. He'd come to the synagogue, the Hazan. That was the name of the synagogue ruler. The Hazan would give to this visiting rabbi the scroll. and the rabbi would first of all take the scroll and kiss it because the words of God are sweeter than honey. Remember that from that sepher a couple weeks ago. We talked about even the children when they began to learn the Torah, the rabbis would cover their slate with honey and teach them that the words of God are sweet as honey and that was a tradition that whenever the rabbi would take the scroll, they would kiss this sweet word of God and then quite often the rabbi would take the scroll and begin to dance around the synagogue with some of the other rabbis actually, a dance of joy because we have the very words of God, and they would celebrate the words of God before they even read the words of God. Now, we don't know if it happened here that Jesus did that, but it happened often, this tradition, so it certainly could have happened. If it did, that would have made Jesus the lead dancer in the synagogue that day, which might have been the day he lost all the Baptists, tell him to you. Anyway, whatever. I'll pick it on the Baptists because that's where I'm from. So he took the book to scroll, and he kissed it, and they danced their dance. And then he began to read from the prophet Isaiah, where Isaiah was talking about what it would be like when the kingdom of God would break through to earth. And Isaiah says basically this all. When the kingdom of God breaks through to earth, it is going to be good news for the poor. Whatever else it is, it will be. That's how you'll know it's the kingdom. Because when the kingdom comes, it's going to be good news for the poor. It's going to be released to captives, recovery of sight to blind, the setting free of the downtrodden, and the forgiving of debt to those who have no hope of ever paying their debts. And then verse 20. This great rabbi closed the book and gave it back to the attendant, to the hazan, and sat down. Because that's what rabbis do when they actually begin to teach. And all the eyes in the synagogue were fixed upon him. and he began to say to them, today, this scripture that I just read to you has been fulfilled in your hearing because the spirit of the Lord is upon me, verse 18, for he has anointed me to proclaim this message and take on this mission that will be good news for the poor, for the oppressed, for the captive, the blind, the downtrodden, and all those who have no hope. And at first, when they heard what he was saying, everyone loved it. Verse 22, and all were speaking well of him in the synagogue that day. Quite a buzz he created, and wondering were they at the gracious words that were falling from his lips. But six verses later, verse 28, all in the synagogue. I'm talking the same people, the same place, were filled with rage. as they were hearing what he was saying, maybe what he meant by what he said, and they rose up to cast him out of the city, led him to the brow of the hill on which the city had been built in order to throw him off a cliff. Why? Why is this pattern so consistent? Why? And is the pattern still that way? I think it is, actually. Why do people in the story of Jesus seem to love what he says at first, but then upon further review, not so much? Well, to answer that question effectively, and we're going to be bumping into this question all along this journey with the rabbi, especially as we get into his teachings and the text in weeks and months to come, but today, to begin to answer it effectively, we're going to need to understand several things, all of which are rooted once again in biblical history, requiring us once again today to dive back into the first century world of Jesus. And it all begins, indeed, the entire stage is set for understanding people's excited reaction and then disappointment, even anger. It's all rooted, the stage is set in what I would call a first century kingdom of God expectation. This begins to explain, if you get into this, why people reacted the way they did. Let me explain. In Jesus' day, most Torah-observant Jews, which is what Jesus was. I read something this week that was interesting. It was just weird how it struck me. Jesus was not a Christian. What? Jesus was a Jew. Jesus was a Torah-observant Jew. And in Jesus' day, most Torah-observant Jews had as part of their spiritual, political, and ethical DNA a belief that the rule and reign of God, the kingdom of God, would one day break through into human history. The kingdom of God to them was not this place you go when you die. Though heaven is real to them and all that kind of stuff. But when they thought of the kingdom of God, it was something that was going to break through into human history. And when it did, everything that was wrong would be made right, including poverty, injustice, oppression, the kind of oppression that was embodied in Jesus' day by people like Rome and all of that stuff. Further, says N.T. Wright in his book, The Challenge of Jesus, These first century Torah observant Jews believed that God had purposed from the beginning to deal with and correct all these problems through Israel. That the kingdom of God, this ruling and reigning of God, would come particularly through them. So that somehow, someway, someday, through Israel, this whole new way of living and being what they thought of as a new world order would come somehow through Israel. All of which, by the way, was at the root of what we maybe know, if you've studied some of this stuff already, this was at the root of what they called their messianic hope. That there would be some kind of deliverer. They didn't know exactly who he would be, but some kind of redeemer. They would be like a Moses who led the people out and set them free from slavery. They would be like a David who was kind of the last king they ever had that represented at least a taste of this kingdom on earth. and this Messiah would even come through the line of David. He's going to be like a David in that kind of way, and that this deliverer, Messiah, would come through them, but not just for them. That this person's way, this Messiah's way, would literally save the world. Now, this expectation that all of them kind of had was rooted in prophetic promise. A little note on prophecy in the Old Testament. A lot of us, when we think of prophecy, we think of someone who's foretelling the future. Truth is, even in the Old Testament, prophecy was about 4% that kind of prophetic thing, where they were telling you something that the Lord revealed to them was going to happen. So about 96%. Did I do the math right? Anyway, the vast majority of prophetic ministry in the Old Testament was what you would call foretelling, where the prophets, and you kind of just see them as pretty strong people, prophets calling the people of God and particularly if you really dial into who they're addressing particularly the prophets would be addressing and speaking to rulers people who were in positions of power be they religious, political, economic prophets were constantly calling on the people who had the power and had the money to do justice love mercy reprove the ruthless defend the orphan plead for the widow and if you don't ruler judgment is coming. That was the spirit and the message of the prophet. Indeed, the Old Testament prophets were marked by four things. Just keep this in mind. It's all part of the picture. Number one, all prophets, there was a speaking on behalf of the poor. Amos, speaking to the rulers of his day, says, I know how many are your transgressions, how great are your sins, that you afflict the righteous, and you push the needy aside, the prophet is speaking to people who have power, who are using it to crush and oppress. The poor Isaiah, again, Isaiah 58 says, let the oppressed go free. He is speaking not to the oppressed. He is speaking to people who are oppressing. Here's what you need to do before God. That says the Lord, you need to be an oppressor, a freer of the oppressed. Divide your bread among the hungry, powerful. Bring the homeless poor into That is the spirit of the prophets marked first by speaking on behalf of the poor. Second, it's marked by an emphasis on the heart, not simply external conformity to law. And law would not just be moral, it would be moral, but it would be moral, social, civic, and spiritual law. So don't just keep the rules. You know, leaders, those of you who have power, you need to have the poor in your heart. You need to care about them, not just kind of get off the hook because you did some little thing. The Spirit of the prophet speaking on behalf of the poor, emphasis on the heart and the promise of coming judgment on perpetrators of injustice and hypocrisy over and over. Hear these words. Woe to you. Woe to you. Jesus had that spirit in Matthew 23. Woe unto you, brood of vipers. That's prophetic. Fourth thing was this, a promise of a new way coming. That was the spirit of the prophet, a new world order where all would be reversed, where the blessed ones would be the broken ones, where the first would be last and the last would be first, where the lion would lie down with the lamb. Prophets used images to speak of this new world order, like a new heavens and a new earth and a new heart, all of which would speak of a new way of living and being in the world, which means that lions lying down with lambs, get this, did not speak to a literal biological transformation, where lions would lie down with... This is imagery here. Rather, lions lying down with lambs speaks to a spiritual and social transformation where violent, lion-like people, more than people, where violent, lion-like institutions, corporations, countries, governments with money and power would no longer use their money and power to crush and oppress the poor and the needy, the least and the lost, the widow and the orphan, but when the kingdom comes, people with power will use their power to lift the lambs. Indeed, they would lie down with them, and the imagery there is they would lie down with them because they're with them. They're for them. We're going to help you. We're with you in this. Beloved, that is the spear of the prophets. So when Jesus put all that together, you're thinking a little like a first century Jew. So when Jesus in Luke 4 came and said, my message and my mission is good news to the poor and to captives and to the blind and downtrodden, everybody who's listening is going, this is the prophetic promise. It would strike a chord. This is the kingdom of God. This is our expectation from the beginning. This is our great hope, so that all were speaking well of him. in Luke chapter 4 when he was done and wondering at the gracious words that were falling from his lips, but there's a problem. Quite simply, the problem was Rome. In fact, let me say it this way. First thing you need to understand is this kingdom expectation. Second thing you need to understand why people would get excited and then fall away was this centuries-long frustration. Promise of the kingdom, but centuries-long frustration where's the kingdom? It's not coming. And the frustration is embodied in Rome, who is the old pressure. But before Rome, it was the Greeks. And before the Greeks, it was the Medo-Persians. And before them, it was the Babylonians. Before them, it was the Assyrians. Listen, B.B., you've got to be a first century Jew. Almost 600 years. I don't see no kingdom. Where on earth is the kingdom? But of all the kingdoms of the world and all the oppressions that they had been under, none had been bigger, brighter, bolder or more ruthless than Rome. Gidor Seleucus, a Roman historian, said the goal of Rome was to possess the world. They made the boundaries of the empire equal to the boundaries of the earth so that everything they did was to increase their reach and their wealth, and they did it by force because they could. They had power. Josephus records that when the Roman general Titus conquered Judea, they captured 500 or more people a day, and would amuse themselves by nailing their prisoners to crosses in different positions. So great was their number that space could not be found for the crosses, nor crosses for the bodies. The Roman historian Peluvius said that viewing a city destroyed by Rome with human and animal corpses everywhere led him to believe that they do this simply for the sake of terror. This was the first century world of Jesus. Obrey Hendricks in his book, The Politics of Jesus, says this, and I want you to get a picture of the poverty in Jesus' day and why God would be angry about that. He says this, that the economic realities reflected in the Gospels presents two classes of people in Jesus' day, the very rich and the very poor. The very rich in Israel were a tiny upper class, no more than 5% of the population. So 95% is poor, desperately poor in many cases. It was comprised, this upper class, of Roman bureaucrats, aristocratic priests who ran the temple system, we'll talk about them in a bit, and a handful of rich landowners and successful tax collectors. Rabbinic writings tell of bands of homeless poor roaming the countryside, sometimes resorting to crime to stay alive. I've told you before that the life expectancy in Jesus' day of a man in Nazareth was about 35 years of age because of poverty. And because of poverty, there was nutritional issues. They wouldn't last much longer than 35. Matthew's gospel, Hendricks says, tells of standing groups of unemployed village workers so desperate for a day's wage that they'd accept work without knowing how much they would be paid in Matthew 20. And it was a poverty created by greed. It was a poverty created by people who had the money, wanting more money and power, and kind of sucking the poverty-stricken people dry. And the way they did that was through taxation. And you have the Roman taxation on top of the Rome exacting unbelievable taxes on the people so they could build their glorious places. You also had the corrupt temple system because like today, religion was big business then like it is now not helping the poor. They were making people poor. In fact, this taxation system that came from both the temple system and Rome caused many small landowners in Jesus' day to lose their land. You'd have hardworking farmers, but the taxes were so incredible, they couldn't pay them anymore, so they would borrow money. And because the taxes kept coming and they couldn't produce enough, they couldn't not only pay the tax, they couldn't pay their debt, and they would go to what's called debtor's prison, and in debtor's prison, you couldn't ever get out. By the way, that whole thing puts another spin on Jesus who said things like this, forgive us our what? Debt. Not just general, debts. When he talked about the favorable year of the Lord, the year of Jubilee, it was all about a time when people who were being unfairly treated would be going, no, no, no, this isn't right. We're setting you free. This is the first century world of Jesus. Indeed, it's interesting. One of the reasons Jesus spoke, and we'll get into this later when we get into the text and go through the Sermon on the Mount, but you know there's places where Jesus talks about not borrowing money and not lending money and that kind of thing. But what you need to get is, well, that's the rule. Oh, man. What you need to understand is that in many cases, in Jesus' day, The only reason a wealthy person would lend money to a poor person was because they knew the poor person could never pay them back. So I'll lend them a little bit of money. They'll never be able to pay me back. I'm getting their land. It was all about a poverty created by greed. Then the prophets rise up and say, Whoa, whoa to you. And in this first century reality, in which Jesus grew, by which he was formed, it raised this question. I've already given it to you. The question was this. Where's the kingdom? And if it's real at all, how will it come? By what means will it manifest itself? Well, in Jesus' day, there were four answers to that, four groups of people who kind of had a different idea of how the kingdom would come. They were, first of all, the Herodians, who were also called the Sadducees. I'm going to put it on the screen so you can see it. They were the Zealots, the Pharisees, the Essenes. I'm going to break them down one at a time. Let me tell you about the Herodians first, who were also called the Sadducees. This group, in my opinion, probably had to be, or at least could have been, the most hated of these four groups, maybe even hated as much as Rome, because their answer to the problem of Rome and the oppression that they were under as a people was to simply get along with Rome. They were the collaborators who basically said, hey, if you can't beat the system, join the system. Let's get ourselves a piece of this pie. Indeed, they became very much a part of this oppressive system because as they cooperated with Rome, worked with tax collectors, paid homage to Caesar, Caesar took care of them, giving many of the most important positions in all of Israel to Sadducees, including the temple business, so that the high priests and the chief priests in the temple were all Sadducees, chosen by Rome through Rome's puppet leader, Herod. And because of that collaboration, the Sadducees were very, very, very rich. How'd they get rich? By literally overtaxing their own people. In fact, I've told you this before, where people would come, Torah-observant Jews, worshiping God would come to the temple and they would want to bring sacrifice, but they couldn't afford it. They couldn't afford it. And then the Pharisees would call, they are the unrighteous because they're not observing the temple stuff. I'm telling you, they couldn't go to church because they couldn't afford to go to church. Church. Sing to God, temple. Again, I don't know if you can hear it, but I hear the echoes when I hear, think of that kind of system. I just hear woe to you woe to you, the woes are coming you brood of vipers, Matthew 23 second group, the zealots who really would have hated the Herodians their posture was this the reason we are oppressed and the reason the kingdom hasn't come is because we're passive, we're cowardly and we have got to stop doing this their answer therefore to the oppression of Rome and to the temple system as well was to rise up and revolt, to poke Rome in the eye and don't be afraid to die. I mean, I can just see these young guys speaking. Don't be afraid to die. You come and follow us, the zealots. Don't be afraid to die because you're going to die. When you sign on, you are signing on to die. But again, and they would cite the prophets, you guys, to come against oppression and to care about the poor, and we're going to die anyway, so let's go down this way. Now, depending on your point of view, these guys were either terrorists or heroes. indeed in Jesus day these guys were often the heroes of the poor because the poor would basically say you know they're not going to win they don't have a chance but at least someone's fighting for us if you were a mother in Israel in Jesus day you might have had something going and your son was a zealot you know you'd probably be very very sad and very very scared and very very proud because my son's got the spear of the prophets on him cares about the poor what he's doing ain't going to work. Those are the zealots. Third group, the Pharisees, who believed that God would send his Messiah and the kingdom would come if we would just get purer. Our problems are caused, they thought, because there's just too much sin. So their solution was get rid of the sinners. What we need are more people like us, righteous people. And it was interesting how they define righteousness. I'm not going to go into that now. And what we need right now are fewer sinning people like them. And sinners were the prostitutes, the drunkards, the tax collectors, the collaborators, the unclean. And in Jesus' day, there were just so many ways to be unclean. All of you are unclean. Fourth group, the Essenes, who publicly took the Pharisees' approach and pushed it just a little bit further, by withdrawing completely from what they considered a corrupt and godless system that was beyond repair. So their approach was this, because the system is so evil and messed up, why try to help or to heal? Why try to get involved, to change the system? Why would we bother feeding the poor or fighting injustice? Because it's all going up in flames anyway. Praise God, hallelujah. I'm not kidding. No, their deal was to withdraw. Literally into the desert, where they would be pure and wait for God to come for them, just them. Indeed, they believed, this is interesting, that the kingdom would come when things got bad enough. So trying to make things better, well, that would be ridiculous. The kingdom's going to come when things get bad enough, God gets mad enough, and he'll just blow towards this whole thing in one final magnificent judgment. But they'd be safe because they were what? Pure. All of which leads to the fourth thing you need to understand. If you hope to understand why some people would respond positively to Jesus' message at first and then go, huh. It's because Jesus, in the face of everything I just told you, would at one time or another often sound as if he agreed with and was part of one of those groups. Only two then, and often very quickly, but sometimes it took a while for them to figure it out. But eventually, he would make it very clear he didn't agree with and wasn't going to be part of any of those groups. Brian McLaren, I was reading something from him this week, and he speculated. I thought this was interesting. He just speculated on this, how people were trying to figure out this Jesus and go, man, he had just confused them. Because at one time, Jesus would say something like, in Matthew 5, unless you're righteous and succeeds that of the Pharisees, you're not fit for the kingdom of heaven. And some hearing that might have thought, whoa, this guy is not only a Pharisee, he's a super Pharisee. This guy's in our group, he's going to out-Pharisee the Pharisees. He's going to out- legalist the legalists. He's our guy. And they would write, yeah, I'm going to follow you. But then they'd see him in the afternoon and he was at a party with prostitutes. And it raised this question, who is this guy? you know one of Jesus' disciples was a zealot Luke 6 14 Simon the zealot what do you think Jesus would say to zealots you know what I think he'd say I think he'd say this I agree with and I applaud you're fighting for injustice and you're caring for the poor indeed some of you have the spirit of the prophets on you who fought against and for those very things. In fact, I don't know if it went this way. It makes sense to me. I kind of in my mind even see Jesus coming to Simon. When he came to the others, they were doing their nets. And Simon was a zealot. And I just wonder if Jesus, when he came to Simon the zealot, said something like this, son, I'm going to tell you something that I see in you. I see in you the spirit of the prophets, the prophets who you studied in Betsephir and Bet-Telmud. I see it in you. I want you to know something. God gave you that spirit. It is a good thing that you want to fight injustice and you care for the poor, but here's the deal. Violence and force is not the way. It'll never work. L'chacharai, come follow me, because the zealots are wrong. Disagree? Follow them. Want to follow me? We'll go in a different way. And Simon, the zealot, said, he cares for the poor. He's going to fight injustice, but it's a different way, and I still might die. He followed. zealots are wrong but so are the essenes would say jesus because passive withdrawal is not the answer but sometimes he sounded passive like he was advocating passivity so again you get confused remember the time jesus said to people in the sermon on the mount again we'll get into this in more detail later if someone strikes you on the cheek well what you need to do is turn and offer him the other one, which sure sounds passive to me. Doesn't it? Like something a zealot would never do. I mean, you know, the zealots are going, man, look at him do the temple thing. I mean, he's one of us. And then he says, turn the other cheek, and the zealots go, see ya. You need to get this on the turn of the cheek thing. In Jesus' day, who is slapping Israel in the face? This was not just between individuals. You know, this is what you should always do. This is not what you should always do. But who is slapping Israel in the face? Rome. So the picture you need to have in your mind is that of a great power using its power and its force to humiliate, crush, and oppress people who can't do anything about it. They oppress them because they can. That's the picture you have here. So what do you do if you're at the mercy of an oppressor who just crushes you when you say boo. How do you resist that? How would you ever change that? Well, one option would be to run out into the desert and complain about how bad things are. Go passive. Be a victim. Become an Essene. Yuck. Would say any, I mean, say, this is weird. I've never said this before because I've done these groups before. I would have been a Zealot. I'd have joined that group. Essenes, I just, And I'd have had arguments at home, you know, with mom. My brother would have been with me too anyway. Anyway, another option would be hit him back. Hit him back, okay? Run to the desert. Another option, smack him back. As hard as you can. And they'll crucify you in every different way you can imagine. And it won't work. Jesus says, I got another option for you, and not many of you are going to take it, but I'm telling you, that's the kind of thing that can bring the kingdom. Here's the deal. Do not go passive. Do not become this whiny victim out in the desert complaining about how bad things are. Do not strike back. Instead, do something truly defiant that still might get you killed, but will serve when this great power strikes you. Boom. And you don't go, and you don't go, but you just go, you know what, here, let me give you this one too. What that will do, it will expose the evil of this power for everyone to see. And everyone watching will go, whoa. And if you don't get it yet, think Tiananmen Square. A single solitary Chinese student, I don't know, 125 pounds, standing in front of a tank. this changed the world standing in front of the tank went passive not passive at all didn't hit it either I'm hitting the tank go ahead hit the tank tank don't care no it just was there and all of a sudden the evil looked as evil as it was and you know talk about revolution You know, the kind of revolution that Jesus was calling for was truly revolutionary. Revolutions that are violent, not revolutionary. You know why? Everybody does it that way. I was trying to get a picture of this thing, Dr. Martin Luther King in the 60s, fighting, fighting for the poor and the oppressed, even in our country. And, you know, I am as a 16-year-old white kid in the suburbs watching all this stuff and going, oh, these people ought to just, you know, stay in their place. and oh my goodness, you know, that whole thing, we thought. And then Martin Luther King was saying, do not be passive. We thought they should have been. Do not strike back. Now some of them did, but they weren't following him. Do not strike back. And all of a sudden, we started seeing these TV shows, these TV pictures of black people, African Americans in Alabama, just standing there being attacked by dogs. And all of a sudden, something in us went, whoa, whoa, maybe I don't know who the bad guys are here. so who's your rabbi now as Jesus calls to himself people like Simon Simon you're a zealot you hate collaborators like tax collectors who get rich by oppressing the poor I'll take you I really like you Simon but Matthew I think I'll take you too Matthew who before he became a follower of the rabbi's way was a tax collector which means he was a collaborator I'll take you you can room with Simon ha ha ha ha wouldn't you like to be up late at night listening to that conversation Nicodemus was a Pharisee into purity I'll take you and then that woman at the well that woman at the well think about her she was the wrong religion she had the wrong gender wrong race wrong sexual history she was pure as the driven slush I'll take you oh by the way Is that okay with you, Nicodemus? I'm taking her. But I need to tell you something. I need to tell all of you something. While I want all of you to come, what I want to tell you is this, that if what you want is money, power, and success, then don't follow me. And some of them didn't. If what you want is money, power, and success, follow the way of the Romans. Follow the way of the Herodians, the Sadducees. And if what you want is to just give vent to your anger, then follow the way of the zealots. And if what you want is a smug sense of spiritual superiority and a little religious subculture safety zone, then follow the way of the Essenes and the Pharisees. What I offer you is the way of the cross, for that is the rabbi's way. So who's your rabbi now? I'm not kidding. And many, upon hearing these things, withdrew and were not walking with him anymore. When I was a kid growing up in church, I would often hear this question. It was often a question that was raised in my own house. I mean, I can hear my mom saying this of one of our new friends or somebody. And the question was this, do they know the Lord? And I said it in a sarcastic way anyway. Because that question, do they know the Lord, what it was, it was actually code for, are they in our group? Now you're laughing, you know. Do they think the way we think about God? Because we know God and we know everything. We've got him on our little evangelical box and we know what he's like. Do they? Now the truth is, now here, let's tie that question into everything we're talking about. I think that's a really important question. Do you know the Lord? This one? I mean, when you really get into the story of who this rabbi was, do you ever wonder, I mean, in your quiet moments when you're by yourself and you're overwhelmed with his glory and his brilliance and his tenacity and his courage, do you ever just in this quote wonder if you know him at all? Because I do. But see, wondering, that doesn't scare me at all. I mean, some of you, what do you mean? Are you telling me I don't know the Lord? Yeah, yeah. But here, let me tell you about our rabbi. He is infinitely knowable. He is altogether unknowable. You know what that makes him? Amazing. That's why I'm still interested. Did you get it? Yeah. See, sometimes I wonder, do you ever wonder about this? This is going to be a little feisty here, but sometimes I really do wonder if the Jesus of Scripture, this rabbi that we're going to come to know more and more about as weeks go on, I sometimes wonder if that Jesus would come to some of our churches and if he would say now what he said then, or if he would do now what he did then, And I wonder sometimes if a lot of people who today are singing songs about Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, if they heard what he actually was saying and saw what he was actually doing, the same ones are going, I will follow you, wouldn't follow him anymore. Which makes me sometimes wonder who we're following. Oh, Dave, don't talk like this. You're scaring the children. But you know what? This is the good news. This is the confrontation and the invitation all at the same time. You know why you don't need to be afraid? You know why you don't need to be afraid of this question? Because our rabbi says, anyone, anyone, a zealot, a prostitute, anyone who wants to follow me and become like me can come. In fact, to anyone who wants to, I will say, Come. I'm not pushing anyone out. Just follow. But it's not the Roman way, and it's not the Pharisee way, it's not the Essene way, and along the way, you're going to get confused. In fact, I think sometimes the more you get confused and off-center, the more you may be on to the real deal. So who's your rabbi now? Lord, give us courage to wrestle and to wonder about who you really are and if we're really following you. Holy Spirit, come. Lord I really do pray for that I want to pray for that again for the courage to stay in this wrestling match to allow ourselves to be knocked a little bit off what we think we know about you and our little settled certitudes and then the unsettledness of it press press into you the drama of it, the adventure of it. Come fill this place with your Holy Spirit, life and power, so we ordinary people could really, really become more and more and more like the rabbi that we follow. And all God's people said, amen.
