Well, today we want to recognize the heroic moms and stepmoms in this room who make our lives better in countless ways, many of them unseen. And I have a special place in my heart for moms of little ones right now, because as many of you know, with the arrival of our twin boys last month, my wife is now the mother of three boys, all under the age of two. God help us. And you help us. So you moms who have little ones, you get no sleep. You actually haven't sat down and ate an entire meal in one sitting for months. Someone's always touching you and needing you and wanting you, and it's not your husband. well today we want to say we notice you and we think you're heroic some of your moms and step moms of tweens and adolescents and your little ones that used to love to snuggle with you and hang with you now sometimes want nothing to do with you they're convinced that you are on a campaign against their very happiness but then the next day they want to snuggle with you and hang with you again. Well, you moms and stepmoms of tweeners and adolescents, you spend most of your time juggling a busy day's work with family commitments and carting people around, and no one seems to notice your hard work. Well, today we want to say we notice. And we think you're heroic. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not done yet. Some of you are moms and stepmoms of adult children. And some of you are even grandmothers now. And you find yourself in a new season where the kids who you spent so much time worrying about are now getting married and finding jobs and having kids on their own. And today's a day where we want to say that you may have made mistakes along the way, but you didn't. You raised your kids. And now it's time for them to take care of you, right? Yeah. Well, we notice you too, and you are heroic. Lastly, some of you desperately want to be moms, but for reasons that seem completely unfair, you haven't been able to. And we want to know, we want you to know, that we notice you too. And we grieve with you, because what you're going through, and how alone you feel in it, is a kind of suffering that words can hardly describe. so for those of you who want to be moms and can't be yet we're with you yeah and some of you this is a difficult day because you because you've lost your mom or maybe even a child and if this is a difficult day for you I want to encourage you to stop by the Mother's Day memorial table in the gathering place you can leave a remembrance there along with specific prayer requests. So happy Mother's Day, everybody. Let's pray. Now, Jesus, you are building your kingdom and sowing your seed. And so we pray that we would be the kind of people that perk our ears so that we can hear your kingdom when it comes and that we would look out off in the distance to see it coming, that we would look inside and ask ourselves the question, is it planted within us or not? Because we want to be people who are about your kingdom. Amen. Well, shortly after time began, people received their television signal, not through cable or satellite, but through an antenna, the way God intended it to be. Now, I'm not completely sure how antennas work, but I'm told it has something to do with free electrons. charged ions, and that little bit of aluminum foil that you have to put on the end of it to make them work. Now, I remember those rabbit ear antennas because in order to watch the Dukes of Hazzard or Mork and Mindy or the Incredible Hulk growing up, it just went through memory lane for some of you, didn't I? A little nostalgia there. But in order to watch those shows and not get a snowy picture, I had to stand with my left arm sticking out while my right arm was holding the tip of that antenna while I was humming and perched on one foot. That's the only way I could get a clear signal. And sometimes communication in my family feels a lot like trying to get reception from those rabbit ears. A few weeks ago, my son Isaac, two-year-old son Isaac, almost two-year-old son Isaac, was standing in front of me saying something to me, but I wasn't paying attention to him. So he literally took his two little paws and put them on my cheeks and made me look at him right in the eye so that I would receive the signal that he was putting out. And all of a sudden, I was receiving it loud and clear. Well, at Open Door, we talk a lot about following the rabbi. We sing about him being the center of our lives, and we pray to him to meet our needs, and we should do all those things. But the question that comes up for me, and I know for you, is this. How would we know, beyond just singing about a rabbi and wanting to follow him, how would we know if we were receiving the signal that he was putting out? How would we know if it was getting in here in a way that changed us? Is it possible that we might be receiving a snowy picture and maybe we don't even know it? Or is it possible that sometimes we change the channel entirely because we just don't like the programming? We don't like the signal that's coming in. Well, as Dave mentioned a few weeks ago, the way of the rabbi has taken us into the parables of Jesus, which are stories that are familiar to everybody listening about everyday life, in which, though, the price tags have been switched around and the furniture has been moved so that when you go to sit down, you find nothing to sit on because what you thought was true isn't. Parables are designed to provoke. They're designed to start conversations and to throw us off balance in ways that invite us to think differently about God, about ourselves, and about each other. But they're all centered on describing the nature of the kingdom of God. A reality that Jesus himself spent his life proclaiming and demonstrating. Luke 8, 1, we read this. Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. And as Jesus walked around from one town and village to another, he proclaimed, and he also demonstrated this kingdom of God. Jesus brought with him the reality of the kingdom, that it invades things that have gone desperately wrong, and it starts making them right again. The kingdom of God is present and active when people's diseases are healed, when enemies become friends, when the excluded are included, Where the hopeless are given hope. Those are markers that the kingdom of God is present. And as Jesus was bringing this kingdom, he couldn't help but notice how people around him were receiving the kingdom. He couldn't help noticing that some people were so eager to receive it that they stuck out their right arm and perched on one foot and hummed so that their picture would be clearer. But others changed the channel because they didn't like the programming. It wasn't what they were expecting. So Jesus tells a parable that represents his commentary on how the people of his time were receiving the kingdom that he was bringing. And it's called the parable of the sower. It's found in Luke 8, starting in verse 4. We read this, While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town. Again, this is Luke 8, starting in verse 4. He, that is Jesus, told this parable. more than was sown. And when he said this, he called out, whoever has ears to hear, let them hear. I'm not a farmer. Thank God for the world and the economy in the world. But I know this about farming, that farmers sow their seed in order to produce a crop. And whether or not they produce a good crop depends on a number of things. But perhaps the biggest variable is the soil. Farmers tend to their soil until it becomes rich and fertile So that seeds can grow in it But the farmer in this parable that Jesus tells Seems almost careless in how he scatters his seeds Some fall along the path far away from the fertile soil Some fall on rocks Some fall among thorns And some fall on good soil The farmer scatters his seed everywhere. Everywhere you go, you can see traces of the farmer and his seed. It's there. So our question needs to revolve around the receptivity of the soil, not the presence of the seed, because the farmer scatters his seed everywhere. So that's what Jesus is going after in a laser-like way. How is the receptivity of the soil? How are people receiving my signal? Now, uncharacteristically, Jesus explains this parable, and his explanation begins in Luke 8, 11. This is the meaning of the parable, he says. The seed is the word of God. Now stop right there. Question. What is the word of God? well according to the scriptures in john chapter 1 verse 1 says this in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and he was with god in the beginning through him all things were made without him nothing was made that has been made in him was life and that life was the light of all people. So what's the word of God? Better yet, who's the word of God? 1 John 1, verses 1 and 2 explains it as well. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at, and our hands have touched. This we proclaim concerning the word of life, that the life appeared. We've seen it. We testify to it. And we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. He's the center of the universe. Everything was made in you. What's the word of God? Jesus is the word of God. See, this isn't a parable about how people hear sermons. Like, I mean, what a boring parable that would be. Let's tell a parable. Let's tell a sermon about how people listen to sermons. It's not even a parable about how people read the Bible. It's about how people respond to and are receptive to Jesus of Nazareth who is the seed that the farmer sows everywhere. That's the first and perhaps the most important thing to understand about this parable. Jesus is the seed that is sown, and it's sown everywhere. Jesus goes on with this explanation, continuing in verse 12 of Luke 8. Jesus says, Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They bleed for a little while, but in the time of testing, they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear. But as they go on their way, they're choked by life's worries, riches, and pleasures, and they do not mature. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering, produce a good crop. See, the first kind of soil is represented from Jesus by a path. If you think about a path, not an asphalt path, it wouldn't have been that, or a concrete path. It's a path that's made of dirt that has been so packed down that nothing can get in. That's the picture that Jesus is painting. So the seed that is spread by the farmer sits on top of this path, and it's either trampled underfoot or the birds of the air come and see it as a snack to eat and take away. See, on the path, the seed just can't get in the soil So question How would you know if nothing was getting in? How would you know if you were characterized by If your soil was like the path? Because I'm not sure we're the best at seeing this in ourselves When it's true about ourselves So imagine that you're walking by a government building And you notice that a few hundred people have gathered to march for peace and judging by their signs and slogans you gather that this peace march is to end violence produced by a war but pretty soon you hear some angry shouts from some passers-by calling these protesters names and sort of mocking their protest and one of the passers-by you see forcibly removes a sign from a protester's hand and knocks it to the ground so then one of the protesters whose protesting violence shoves the person who knocks the sign down. And pretty soon an all-out fight is happening at an anti-violence demonstration. The real message of peace and the incredible personal cost of actually making peace never sunk in to this one protester who responded to an angry shout with an angry shove. It never sunk in. Imagine a speaker who preaches eloquently that love wins, but when she goes home, she yells at her husband when he doesn't do something exactly the way that she wanted him to. See, the message never sunk in. Imagine a man who says to his friends and family that family is the most important thing. But then he spends 80 hours a week at work when he doesn't really need to. Well, the message never really sunk in. The way that I can tell in me that nothing is getting in is when I find myself getting defensive. When I feel like I have to defend my thing from whatever it is that's trying to get in. When I'm convinced that my soil is just fine the way it is, and don't you dare suggest that it needs something else, that's when I can tell I'm like the path. So how packed down are you? I'm not packed down. Well, if you are packed down, you're probably not the best judge. So the challenge would be to get two or three of the people who see you every day. It doesn't have to be your family necessarily, but who see you the most every day. Maybe people at work. Just ask them this question. It doesn't have to sound real spiritual. Just say, listen, do I ever get defensive when you try to bring me new ideas? Or things about me that maybe need to change? Or you might say, listen, how open do you think I am to new ways of thinking and new ways of doing things? And if you get a response like, then you'll just know that you have a little work to do. Second kind of soil is rocky. According to Jesus' explanation, rocks prevent the newly formed plant from taking root. That's what the rock does. And it prevents that little seed from receiving nutrients and water from the surrounding area. See, rocks allow the newly formed plant to stay on the surface, never diving down deep and getting what it needs to survive. And so in the time of testing, Jesus says, they fall away because they have no root. And it's interesting for me to note that it doesn't say, Jesus doesn't say in a time of testing. He says in the time of testing, which to me suggests you will have at least one time of testing in your life. In fact, you'll probably have more than one. I interpret that to mean that no matter what you are, No matter whether you follow Jesus or yourself or no one, life is hard and there will be tests. Now, there is a certain kind of Christianity that seems to say that if you believe correctly and with enough faith, then you'll somehow magically escape testing and instead you'll be blessed immeasurably and even says that if you find yourself in a test, the reason why you're in a test is probably because you're sinning or don't have enough faith. And that is a form of theology. It's just not rooted to the story of God found in the Scriptures. Because the story of God that I find in the Scriptures among the disciples and Jesus himself is that testing will come. And when testing comes, what is important is what you are rooted to. That's what's important. So the question has to be, what roots you? In order to find out what you're actually rooted to, because I could ask you, what are you rooted to? And you're likely to say something like, well, I mean, I'm a Christian. So I am rooted to Jesus Christ. But what actually reveals what you're rooted to is how you spend your life and what you do. So you could start asking yourself a different question. If I lost blank, how okay would I be? If I lost my house, how okay would I be? If I lost my job or my health or even my family, how okay would I be? then you start thinking oh okay maybe the roots go down to some different things that i wasn't aware of because in the end it would make sense to be rooted to something that can't fall away something you couldn't lose then you would actually be okay even if you lost everything else so what's something that can't fall away that could root you it would be worth everything else in the world in order to find that thing. Because in order to withstand the test of life you have to be rooted to something that is bigger than you or bigger than your house or bigger than something else that can fall away. Something that can withstand the test. So what might that be? And how might you become rooted to it actually? Let those who have ears to hear, let them hear. The third kind of soil is choked by thorns, which Jesus calls life's worries, riches, and pleasures. And so he says the seed doesn't mature, and it's such a great word. It's choked out by the life's worries, riches, and pleasures, which, you know, I think, like choked by riches and pleasures? I mean, that's kind of weird because I kind of like riches and pleasures. Those are the things that don't necessarily choke me. I wouldn't call those things the things that choke me. But here's the deal. Some of us are not receiving the signal of Jesus because we have resolutely insisted on being rooted to things which cannot nourish us, which cannot withstand the test. And so we've stopped growing. We're immature. now these past five or six weeks have been completely insane at our house with all three kids needing something every minute of every day i've been overwhelmed and i've found myself engaging in this thinking perhaps you are familiar with it it says this i just got to make it through this then it'll be okay and it used to be like i just got to make it through, you know, when all the kids are out of diapers. Now it's like, I just got to make it through dinner. But thinking about life that way is preventing the roots of my life to go down to where they need to go to get nourished. Because at the end of that rainbow, just got to make it through dinner. When I finally do make it through dinner, I'm so desperate to be nourished that I'll go for the first thing that promises to be nourishing. A full night of sleep would not be a bad option. A glass of wine is sometimes a good necessity. A lingering glance at someone that I have no business lingering over is sometimes there. And when I stay rooted to those things, nourishing though they seem to be at first, the result is I do not grow and I stay immature. So when I'm thinking clearly, which admittedly is hit and miss these days, I try to change my framework from I just got to make it through to this test, this challenge is really an opportunity for me to learn to be nourished by Jesus, to sink my roots down deeper, past the things that don't really nourish me. I believe, honestly, that my kids can teach me everything I need to know about patience and kindness and dependence. If you have kids, your kids are the world's best teachers. Instead of the things that keep me from growing, because I know some of you moms and dads who have little kids at home or maybe even big kids at home are thinking, I don't have time to grow. I mean, you show me the five minutes in my schedule where I can read the Bible or pray. Please, show it to me. And we'd have this little kind of confrontation. And I'd say, your curriculum is your kids. Or your curriculum is your work. Your curriculum for growth in Christ is your test that you're going through. And there are endless opportunities for you to say things like, Jesus, I need you. I need you. I mean, there are word pictures and parables all over the place. A couple days ago, I changed two huge poopy blowouts in a row. I mean, it's like all up the back, down the legs. I mean, you're like, you're not that big. How can you make that? Right? Well, I mean, this sounds goofy, but that's a great opportunity to say, oh, what a great picture of my life. Right? I mean, it's a mess. It's a mess, right? So then you could just say, okay, Jesus, enter into the mess. Enter into the mess. See, that's your discipline. That's your spiritual disciplines. That's what you do. That's how you grow. It's not like, oh, I got to find five minutes to go pray. That's your prayer. That's your prayer. Like, it's so funny. Oh, man. The final soil that Jesus talks about is good soil, in which the seed can grow into a huge crop. He says, a hundred times more than was sown. And these people, he says in Luke 8, 15, are marked by what Joel sang about people with a noble and good heart. They hear the word, they retain it, and by persevering produce a good crop. Now, in order to understand this type of soil, the good soil, we need to go back to the very beginning of the parable to understand this. Jesus, again, remember, starts the parable this way. A farmer goes out to sow his seed. There's something you can't miss about the character, the profound, gracious nature of the character of God. God is intent on spreading his seed everywhere. This is what God does. Along the path, on the rocky soil, where the thorns are, in the good soil, the seed is there. And remember, as Dave has taught of in years past, this field is one field. And so when you're talking about the thorny soil and the rocky soil and the good soil and the soil by the path, that is represented by my one heart, which contains all of those soils. It's not like there's a couple losers over there who are, you know, the rocky soil and you in the back, you're the soil on the path and all you guys over here, you're the good soil. No, we're all a mixed bag. So the good news is that whatever condition your soil is in right now, whether packed down or rocky or thorny or good, you can look for Jesus to meet you there because the farmer spreads his seed everywhere. The question is not where is God. It's how can I work with God so that my soil can be receptive to the seed that's planted. Paul writes about this in 1 Corinthians 3, 7 through 9. So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who makes things grow. The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their labor, for we are God's coworkers. you are God's field God's building we are the soil in which the word of God is sown and our work is to become the kind of soil that is receptive to the seed in which Jesus can grow develop deep roots and produce a crop my family and I recently moved up here to Maple Grove into this great new house we love it It's awesome. The only problem is the yard. The yard is filled with weeds. The grass is patchy and thin in areas. And the previous owners, I am quite certain, had a dog, which I promise you left his mark in countless ways all over this yard. This is in rough shape, this yard. But I have a vision for this yard. I'm going to put fertilizer in and some new seed, and we're going to take care of the weeds. I'm going to work the soil so that it starts growing what it's supposed to grow. Now, this may sound cheesy, probably because it is cheesy, but you and I, you and I are in rough shape as well. We're patchy and thin, if we're honest. We're filled with weeds. Pain has left its mark on us many times. Some of us are packed down, and nothing is getting in. some of us are living life on the surface attempting to grow roots down onto things which will not withstand the test when it comes some of us are so worried about so many things that can never nourish us but here's what I know about you and about me that there is good soil in us I know this about this church there is good soil in you and the farmer has scattered his seed in us and I know that so many of you are neck deep in so much of life but your fervent desire is that you would follow the rabbi and be receptive to the soil, even if it means sticking out one leg, perching on one foot, and humming while you're doing it. Because you know that life is found in that seed. So for those of you who have ears to hear, let them hear. You are receiving the signal that God is sending out. You have good and noble hearts. And some of you right now need to know that by hanging on, you will produce a very good crop because the farmer has sown his seed in you. And your work, your work is just to be receptive to him. Amen. Amen. For those who have a noble good heart For those who don't know where to start For all who know they've been rocky ground Just below the surface a seed can be found So hold on Hold on For all who've choked on their fear and regret Know that God is not done with you yet To any who are tired from just hanging on This is your song This is your song Cause just underneath Waiting to grow is the seed It's already been sown, break the ground It's been holding it in Let it live, let it live Let it live, let it live. So let's be people who let it in and let it live. Amen. Please stand for the benediction. This comes from 2 Corinthians 4.16. Therefore do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary. But what is unseen, a little seed taking root in you, is eternal. Amen. Have a great week, everybody. Happy Mother's Day. you
