Welcome. I just want you to know I'm glad you're here and I have had it in my mind all week and I've dialed down the talk, so you will be able to follow this. Seriously, anyway. God bless you. Glad you're here. Glad you're here. Let's pray, okay? Prayer is simple, Lord, for the kind of things that can only be generated, created, and sustained by your Spirit among us through this Word in our lives and hearts in this room, I pray. In Jesus' name, amen. Well, last week, if you were here, you might remember that in dealing with the events of Pentecost, Pentecost, that was revealed to us in Acts chapter 2, beginning to kind of unfold, verses 1 to 21, we learned a number of things that I want to remind us of briefly as we return to the study. First is this, that the day of Pentecost was Pentecost before Pentecost. Remember that? that the day of Pentecost was the day of Pentecost before the day of Pentecost is spoken of in Acts 2, verse 1, which is why Acts 2, verse 1 says what it says, the way it says it when it says this, that when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place, waiting and praying. For what the Father had promised, and what the Father had promised was a baptism, an immersion, into the Holy Spirit for the purpose of power so that we could, that the we would be the 120 people who were waiting, so that we could do by the power of the Spirit what we've been called to do, and so that we could become who God has called us to become, which, as it turns out, for a variety of fascinating reasons, was poured out on this day, which was already known as the day of Pentecost, Acts 2.16, and this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel, Acts 2.16, that in the last days, says the Lord, I will pour out my spirit upon all mankind Pentecost, which we discovered last week was a feast day, actually, for first century Jews. Indeed, it was one of three pilgrimage feasts that the entire household of Israel would participate in every year, and they participated in it every year on the same day every year, precisely 50 days after Passover, which is why Pentecost actually is called Pentecost, because the word Pentecost means the 50th, or literally the 50th day, and so it is on the 50th day after Passover. Every year, Jews from all over the world would begin to make their way back to Jerusalem, where as a people, they would stop in this holy celebration to do a couple of things, kind of like Thanksgiving, to remember and to give thanks for a number of things. Among them are these, number one, that it was 50 days after the original Passover. 50 days after the original Passover, when the people of God were redeemed from Egypt, because when I see the blood of the Passover lamb, I will pass over you. Remember that? It was the final plague. And when the angel of death passed over the people of God, that became Passover. It was a mark of their redemption from Egypt. And 50 days after that Passover, originally Moses met with God on Mount Sinai and came down with the law, the Ten Commandments, Torah, which as I said last week, wasn't a rule book. It's not what the Ten commandments were, much more they were wedding vows where God is calling out a people to be with him. I shall be your God and you shall be my people, a covenant people, which is at least part of. Now when we dial up to Acts chapter 2 and we get a whole lot of understanding of what it's really all about, it's at least part of what God was doing in Acts chapter 2. 50 days again after Passover, On the day of Pentecost, God again was calling out a people, but not just a people, a covenant people, but not just a covenant people, a new covenant people. Hebrews 10, verse 16, quoting Ezekiel 37, and this is the covenant that I will make with them in those days, says the Lord, that I will pour out my spirit on them and they will come to life, and I will put my laws upon their hearts and upon their mind I will write them, and their sins and their lawless deeds that we'll remember no more. And all of that is coming together, is being fulfilled in Acts chapter 2 on the day of Pentecost, 50 days after Passover. And then you might remember last week we started connecting some dots. And I don't know if it's exciting for you, but it was for me because I'd never connected the dots quite this way because Passover was the day on which Jesus was crucified. and 50 days after Passover, which is the day on which Jesus was crucified, came Pentecost. We even did the math. Remember, three days in the grave, he rose. Forty days, he spent presenting himself alive with many convincing proofs, Acts 1, verse 12. And when he then ascended in Acts 1, verse 9, he told them to wait. And it wouldn't be long, not many days from now, Acts 1, verse 5. And as it turns out, what they were waiting for, what God was waiting for, was Pentecost. This incredible day, 50 days after the Passover. Acts 2, verse 1. And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly, there came from heaven a noise. Something's going on. It's big. Like a mighty rushing wind. And it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Which means, among other things, this. that God in Acts chapter 2 is not just changing Pentecost into something different. Actually, it's bigger, more thrilling than that. He's actually changing Pentecost into something more, something bigger, more expansive, because now I want covenant not just with Israel. I want covenant with the world, with the nations, which is precisely who was in Jerusalem on this day of Pentecost, Acts 2, verse 5, because in Jerusalem it was full of devout men. Look at it on the screen, Acts 2, verse 5. Devout men from every nation under heaven, Parthians and Medes and Elamites, residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus in Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, and on and on it goes through the text because I want covenant with the world, with the nations, because God wasn't changing Pentecost into something different. and he was changing Pentecost into something more, and it keeps just getting bigger. Because Pentecost wasn't even just about covenants, which is an amazing thing to think about. It was also about harvests. Indeed, it was about the feast of the harvest when the people of God every year, 50 days after Passover, would stop, come to Jerusalem, celebrate and remember the provision of God, instituted in Exodus, this, rather, 23, 16, which says this, and so you shall observe the feast of the harvest. It was the harvest of wheat, and the design of it was to stop and be grateful for the provision of God. But now in Acts chapter 2, the harvest would become something more valuable than wheat. The wheat is great. We thank you, God. But this harvest in Acts chapter 2 would be more consequential than physical bread, the souls of men and women redeemed would be the harvest now. Because when Peter finished his sermon in Acts 2.41, which was his explanation of the events of this day, it says that 3,000 souls were added that day, and there's your harvest of something more valuable than wheat, more consequential than bread. But Pentecost wasn't even just about the feast of the harvest. It was the feast of the first fruits. And the point of the first fruit celebration was that first fruits always bring with them the promise for more because first fruits were only the beginning, which means that the 3,000 souls that were added that day weren't just harvests. That was great, and it was big. But the real good news about the harvest of 3,000 souls in one day is that they were just the first fruits, which means this is amazing, but this is just the beginning. There's more and more and more and more. So sing and dance and laugh for joy, but then we discovered that it's bigger and more expansive even than that. And this actually is finally getting us to what I want to talk about this morning because this Pentecost event in Acts chapter 2 is, in addition to everything else, it is A picture of, a taste of, the first installment of heaven, actually. Literally the first fruits of heaven of what will one day fully be, because in the baptism of the Spirit, because in any experience you have with the Holy Spirit, what we're getting is a taste. It's only a taste, but it's a real taste of what will one day fully be. So that from this Pentecost event that we kind of plunged into last week, we see it in Acts chapter 2. From the Pentecost event to the end of the age, which is the age we're living in right now, we're going to get tastes. There are what I referred to last week as in-breakings of the Holy Spirit and power and God's kingdom right here and right now. And any time you have any kind of experience with the Holy Spirit relative to power, in breakings of his spirit, maybe in worship, like I said last week, when you weep and you don't know why and don't know why you can't stop weeping, maybe in some deliverance or healing of the body or your soul, manifestations of the spirit, gifts of the spirit, words of knowledge and wisdom and prophecy. What you're getting when you get those things are a taste. Now, it's only a taste, but it's a real taste of what will one day fully be. You're tasting the first fruits, and the first fruits are only the beginning, which brings me to the question of the day, around which we're going to walk a little bit this morning. The question is this. If you've ever tasted anything that tasted really good, what did you want? If you've ever tasted anything that tasted really good, what did you want? More. If you've ever had ice cream and you thought it tasted good, you're going to want some more. Or taste and see that God is good. And if you have or if you do experience or taste that God is good, you will want more and more and more of God. Which leads to another question. Second question of the morning. Can we have more and more and more of the Spirit, of the gifts of the Spirit, of the power of the Spirit, of the wind of the Spirit? Can we get the wind of God's Spirit to blow? More. Can we get the gifts of God's Spirit to flow more? Well, the answer to that is yes. Actually, the answer is yes. And no. And it all depends. Because there are some, and this is really important, because there are some who in claiming to want and to have more and more and more of the Spirit and power, talk and act as if they're the licensed franchisees of the Holy Spirit in charge of distribution, because God for them is kind of like a genie in a bottle that they know how to conjure up, as if the Holy Spirit were just that. And if you pray the right prayer just the right way, with the right amount of faith, if you only believe, you can get God to do kind of what you want him to do. And while there are, in fact, some things in life that you can, in fact, predict and control, such that when you punch in the numbers, it always comes out the same. Something we need to know on the front end of this Holy Spirit thing, especially if you want more, is this, that the person and work of the Holy Spirit is not one of those things where you can punch in the numbers and get the result you want every time. John 3, verse 8, Jesus says this, that the Spirit, like the wind, blows where it wills. And you can hear it coming, but you don't know where it comes from or where it's going. Even if you think you do, You don't. Even if you think you can control this thing and get it to work, you can't. Which changes, and this is very significant, at a fundamental level, our authentic interactions with the Holy Spirit from someone who thinks they can control the wind, make it go this way, make it go that way, make it look like this, and make it blow the way they want with just the right prayer, said just the right way if you only believe with just the right faith to someone who is learning how to wait and to pray in order to discern where the wind of God's Spirit may already be blowing and then to set your sail to that, to partner with God in that, which raises another question. What if the wind of God's Spirit isn't blowing? Well, one answer to that would be, pretend that it is. No, no, don't pretend that it is. You need to do what we don't do very well. But we've been talking about for several weeks, Steve and I, you need to wait and to pray. Indeed, Acts chapter 1, very interesting to me. When Jesus told his followers to go into that upper room, Remember, not many days from now it will come, but I'm not telling you when. I want you to wait for the promise of the Father. So they went into the upper room, and they devoted themselves to pray. So there they were, waiting and praying. But here's the deal. Their waiting and praying didn't make the baptism of the Spirit happen any faster. God was determining that. Their waiting and praying didn't make it happen. It made them ready when it did happen. I'm always intrigued when from time to time I see a sign on a church or an ad in the paper announcing something like this. Revival. Wednesday night, 7 o'clock. Okay. And I think, how do they know? And I don't know if you've ever been to, you know, you've driven into the parking lot where they're going to have a revival at 7 o'clock. and I'm sure that sometimes those kinds of things, there are authentic experiences of, that wasn't one by the way, with the Holy Spirit. But here's the concern I have. When we think for sure it's going to be Wednesday at seven o'clock, the wind you may be experiencing in that room might be the Holy Spirit but it might not be. It might be the pastor's, you know, wind. Honestly, I have a picture of me trying to make something happen up here. And every once in a while, I'll see that. I'll talk to Steve after. How'd it feel? I felt like I was swinging way too hard because I'm blowing. I'm trying to, and it's just about as futile as that. You feel it? Can you feel it? That's a lot different than when the wind of God's spirit blows. You can't control that. You can want that. So you say you want more of the Spirit, more of the power of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit. Stir that up. Great. Paul in 1 Corinthians 14 says, earnestly desire manifestations of the Spirit. But principle number one in actually experiencing the more of the Spirit might just be very serious here. This is how we're going to play it here. This is how we've played it here for years. But principle number one in wanting more, good to want more, is this, have some reverence for the mystery of the Spirit, for the sovereignty of God in the movements of the Spirit, and an awareness of our inability to control the Spirit, which actually leads to another thing. I think we need to know if we're really serious about experiencing more of the Spirit, kind of like one of the ground rules around here, and it's this. we're just not gonna pretend that God did something that he didn't I'm healed, well if you are great, but great but if you aren't don't pretend that you are that God said something that he didn't I got a word, better be sure because sometimes in people's desire for more and the desire for more is good you guys and sometimes in people's desire to prove that they already have more. They treat things that aren't as though they are and call it faith. They treat things that aren't as though they are and call it God. They call it more, but it isn't more. It's actually less. So someone is sick. What do you do? The Bible says there's gifts of healing, so let's pray. Holy Spirit, come. It's what we want, deeply desire the gifts of the Spirit, and so we do. Holy Spirit, come. But sometimes you get around people who say they believe more than you, more than them. And sometimes when you're around people like that, not always, but you hear sometimes things like this. If you want to be healed, you need to walk in your healing. Just believe that you are healed, even if you aren't. The sickness you have in you is a lie. Just believe because the Bible says by his stripes you have already been healed. So claim your healing. Declare that you're healed. Even if you aren't now, you need to walk in your healing. You need to believe it. Then you will receive it. Yes! Funny thing about that. Jesus actually did heal people, and he actually did heal people. They were healed. And though he sometimes did say things to them like, don't tell anyone, and he did that for a variety of reasons. They don't have time to get into here. He never said, very important, he never said this. By the way, even though you're not actually healed right now, just start saying that you are. I want you to name it and to claim it and to declare it as if it is, even though it isn't, and call that faith. He never, I mean, I'm looking for the verse. He never said that because that isn't faith, it's false. And that isn't more, it's less. So here's what we'll do with our desire for more. We'll have some reverence for the mystery. Learning to wait and learning to pray and we will refuse to pretend that what isn't is, but then we will ask and keep on asking and we will seek and keep on seeking and we will invite the Holy Spirit in and we will keep on inviting the Holy Spirit in to come and bring with Him all of the gifts of the Spirit and then right in the middle of all of that inviting and asking and desiring more of the Spirit which I want to fan to even a greater flame. One more thing, we will begin to wonder in the middle of all of this about all the ways we may unknowingly be grieving. The Holy Spirit be quenching. The Holy Spirit to quench is to literally throw water on the fire. Because while some treat the Spirit like a genie in a bottle that they can conjure up with just the right prayer in just the right way, now I've confronted that, I'm done with them. Others, now I've got a whole other group to talk to. Others treat the Spirit like a relic who retired from active duty 2,000 years ago, sometime after the book of Acts was complete. And that kind of disregard for the power and presence and activity of the Spirit can quench the Spirit, can throw water on the fire, and that actually is part of our story. It's actually part of our awakening as a church. when we as a church became aware of the water that we were throwing on the fire of the Holy Spirit, thereby quenching the Spirit in ways we didn't even know. The year was 1986. I'd been here just shy of six years, and we were doing our verse-by-verse things through the book of 1 Corinthians. And I even remember why we were going through 1 Corinthians, because having spent a year in the book of Galatians, where the constant theme was freedom and grace, I thought the book of 1 Corinthians would be a really good balance and even serve as a warning to what can easily happen when true Christian liberty becomes licensed to sin, the Corinthians being the embodiment of people who took grace as license to sin. But the book of 1 Corinthians, I found out, is a really long book with more than one theme. So when we came to 1 Corinthians chapter 12, where Paul begins to deal with the supernatural manifestations of the Holy Spirit, that was a theme that didn't represent my primary purpose for teaching the book. But there it was. And if we skip it, people might notice. So we didn't skip it. This should be fun. Let's dive in. And we did. Like, we do. But there's actually some things you need to know about me and the condition of our church at the time as it relates to any study of the supernatural manifestations of the Spirit and the ways that we were quenching the Spirit can understand the drama that was around that text we were teaching. The first is this, something you know about me if you've been around at all. I grew up Baptist, which doesn't necessarily mean what I'm about to say, but because I grew up Baptist, the kind of Baptist I was, What that meant in my growing up was that we had a theology that was firmly convinced that the supernatural manifestations of God's Spirit are not for today. God used to do this stuff, but he doesn't anymore. Indeed, I had deep inside of me a fear of this kind of stuff. There was danger there in my mind and a perception deeply held by me that people who claim to experience and move in supernatural manifestations of God's Spirit had succumbed to that danger. They had been duped in some way. They were shallow and superficial or driven by emotions. So be afraid. Be very afraid. I was. And I shared that fear with our whole church. But a number of things had been working together in me to kind of wear me down and at the same time kind of set me up on this issue of the Spirit. One was something that I hope I never lose, but even then I had a hunger for more. Indeed, I remember even from the beginning of ministry in my life having a deep desire to be part of a church. I didn't know how to make this happen, but I wanted to be part of the church where at the end of the day, at the end of the run, at the end of your life, the only real explanation for the growth of the church would be God. In fact, everybody who was part of it would say, you know what? You know, we did this and we did that and we tried this and we tried that and those were all good, but you know what? God was in this. And I know that's kind of a naive thing to desire, kind of lofty, I suppose, but it's what I wanted, I really did, but how do you do it that way? Especially how, if you don't believe in or are actually afraid of any supernatural manifestations of the Holy Spirit? Well, second thing that had been working on me in this and setting me up to kind of wear me down and set me up with six years of ministry. Actually, by that time, it was 10 years of ministry, because I'd been at another church before, and that time in ministry was more than enough time to get kicked around a little bit, to become a little disillusioned about the church, not just our church, but the church, and even a little disillusioned, well, especially a little disillusioned about me. Just not that great. Lots of, you know, things. We don't have time. And while I've never had a lot of confidence in the power of methods and technology and slick program to do what the actual work of the kingdom is, those things can be helpful, the longer I was in ministry, the ministry itself convinced me that the depth of people's pain, lostness, despair, woundedness, blindness, couldn't be fully touched by human stuff. Hard as you try to have a good conversation, it's really helpful. or give them a nice hug, or come up with a really good talk, or write a new song. All of those things are good. At the end of the day, you kind of have this sense that that's not touching the deepest part. And it was out of that awareness that this hunger for more began to grow. More of the Spirit, more of the gifts, the power of the wind. And so it is with all that stuff back in 1986 kind of swirling. I started preaching through 1 Corinthians 12. Now concerning spiritual gifts, Paul says. Verse 1, chapter 12. I don't want you to be unaware. Because if you're going to do the work of the kingdom, you can't afford to be ignorant about these things. Because this is how you're going to get the work done. Well, first thing I did in getting into it was pull out all my old commentaries that basically said, don't get too excited here. It wasn't actually what they said. But what they said was some gifts are for today and some gifts are not for today. After verse 9, they're not for today. So the gift of knowledge, wisdom, and faith, which is verses 1 through 9, those gifts are good and for you. Get excited. But the effecting of miracles, I don't know. That's verse 9. Discerning of spirits, the gift of healing and prophecy and tongues, don't get your hopes up, don't expect that, don't even desire that, all of which is at least part of why, with those things kind of deeply embedded in me, all of which is at least part of why I'll never forget the Sunday 25 years ago, back in the building that was in Crystal, Minnesota. The text was 1 Corinthians 12, verse 10. I had done the gift of knowledge, wisdom, faith. Today it says this, and to another the Spirit from time to time dispenses the effecting of miracles. Miracles are not for today. The word is dunamis. It simply means power, the operation of power, and I said it. With my knees, I can replay it in my mind, with my knees literally shaking behind this big wooden pulpit. It's really good. You couldn't see how scared I was that day. what I said was this if it really is true that what I've always believed is really true that there is no operation of power available today to do what God has called us to do and to be who God has called us to be if it really is all up to us I can't do this anymore there just has to be more there has to be more power because if there isn't we can't do what God's called us to do. We can't be who God's called us to be. Now, when I said that that Sunday, kind of that way, it felt really radical to me and even a little dangerous. Whoa. But what was really fascinating about that particular day was that the next day, and none of this was planned, it just kind of happened this way. The next day, I boarded a plane to go to a conference that I had been planning to go to for months with a group of elders from our church and staff from our church led by a guy named John Wimber. And yeah, some of you, because you know John Wimber, and some of you go, what John Wimber, whatever. John Wimber was a guy, just to kind of put it this way, who in the context of a class that he'd been teaching at the time, back in the early 80s at Fuller Seminary, had been asked this question, had been asking himself this question, can we at least ask for the Holy Spirit to come? And if you do ask for the Spirit to come and manifest his gifts, Will he show up in any manifested way to do what only he can do, indeed to do what it seems like he used to do in the Bible, kind of read these things in the Bible. In fact, he tells a story about how early in his Christian walk he was saved out. He's quite a big deal, I guess, in Hollywood. He was a producer of like the Righteous Brothers and stuff like that, and he got saved, and he was kind of just coming in and reading the story. He came to his pastor one day, and he goes, when are we going to do the stuff? And the pastor said, what's the stuff? All this stuff that Jesus did, it's all in here, and when are we going to do this stuff? And that was kind of what was behind what his whole thing was. Well, I went to that conference, came back from the conference. Well, my wife would use the word weird. I came back from that conference affected, aware that there was more. Having been immersed into an experience with the Holy Spirit that I had never had before. In fact, I remember vividly being in a motel room 2 o'clock in the morning. I couldn't sleep, tears just streaming down my cheeks, looking at the ceiling. There's more I didn't know. I had no idea. But here's the deal about all that, and that's why I'm telling you that story. What I experienced there, in fact, any experience you have with the Holy Spirit, be it great paradigm shifting or just a little trickle of water, is a taste. All it is is a taste. It's only a taste, but it's a real taste of what will one day fully be because you're tasting first fruits. And the first fruits are only the beginning of more and more and more to come, which brings me back to the question of the day. It's this. If you've ever tasted anything or tasted really good, what do you want? More. Second question. Can we have more of the Spirit, of the gifts of the Spirit, of the power of the Spirit, of the wind of the Spirit? Well, the answer, I think, is yes and no. And it all depends. Because there are some who, in claiming to want and have more of the Spirit and power, talk and act as if they are the licensed franchisees of the Holy Spirit in charge of distribution because the Holy Spirit, to them, There's a genie in the bottle that they can conjure up to do what they want to do with just the right prayer, said just the right way. No, he's not. But here's what I believe. You can ask and keep on asking and you can seek and keep on seeking and you can desire more. Earnestly desire more, says Paul, 1 Corinthians 14, verse 1. But sometimes desire, this is very important, moves into expectation. I not only wanted God to move, I expected God to move. And some of you are saying, we need to have expectation. I think there are places where we need expectation. I mean, you've got to get your hopes up a little bit. But expectations are a dicey thing. You at least better know you have them. Because desires turn into expectations. And expectations that are not met, think on this, become demands. And demands that are not met become disappointment. And disappointment becomes resentment. And it applies to things of the Spirit, but it applies to lots of things. Think about your marriage. Bonnie and I have been married 38 years. And Bonnie came into our marriage with expectations. For 38 years. she has had this expectation that she would be completely fulfilled emotionally, spiritually, sexually, can't believe I said that word from the pulpit, entirely fulfilled. That was her expectation. So as you know, she pretty much got what she wanted. Anyway, that was for the kids. Anyway, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Here, no, this is serious. This is how we manage 38 years of marriage. She took her expectations and put them way down there and were golden. Okay, okay. Some of you are going to watch the Bears and the Vikings this afternoon, and some of you have desire about a certain outcome, don't you? But some of you have had that desire turned to expectation. Just want to tell you, it's going to be a bad day. Yeah. Trash talking from the pulpit right here, right here. This is brutal. I think it is going to be a bad day, actually. Okay, okay, okay. Listen, bring this back to the spirit stuff. This is really, I think this will help you. Desire, earnestly desire more. Fan that. But desires become expectations. And expectations are dicey. You better know you have them. Because when expectations aren't met, they turn into demands. And demands unmet become resentment. I thought the Holy Spirit stuff was real. I thought the Holy Spirit stuff would always do this and always do that. No. Because he's not a genie in a bottle that we can summon on command with just the right prayer in just the right way, which is why as we continue through this story, that is the book of Acts, we need to constantly remember and really understand that any experience we have with the Holy Spirit, be it great or small, is a taste. It is only a taste, but it's a real taste of what will one day fully be, the awareness of which can keep you in a grateful place for every taste you get. It can keep you in an expectant place that God does give good gifts to His children. It can keep you in a hopeful and hungry place for more and more and more. Because when you get a taste of something good, even though it's just a taste, it's a real taste of what will one day fully be, and you're going to want some more. And so we pray and keep on praying. Holy Spirit, come and get us a taste of the first fruit. And give us a taste of this again and again and again. And all God's people said, amen. Would you stand with me as we close in prayer? I'm going to ask the prayer team to make themselves available to anyone who needs prayer because some of you need a taste. We can't conjure that up, but we can ask, and you can come and ask. and the Spirit gives good gifts. Holy Spirit, come. I pray for those among us now who need a taste, need a glimpse, that you would come and give your gifts. We ask, we pray for your Spirit to manifest in ways that in some ways we don't expect, in ways we can't control and really don't deserve. We pray your spirits come even as we walk out these doors into every dimension of our life. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you as you leave. Thank you.
