Let's pray as we go to the Word. Father, I pray by the power of your Spirit, you would breathe life into this Word. Drive it deep into our minds and hearts. Make it part of how we not only think, but part of who we are. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Today, in what we've been referring to as a journey of the heart, which we've discovered is in fact a battle for the heart, we visit a place on this journey, unpleasant, indeed destructive, even evil, that is this, the dangerous reality of a shriveled heart that manifests itself ultimately in a hate-filled, murderous heart born of an envious, jealous heart. All of which we will find embodied in a man named Saul who we were introduced to a few weeks ago in the context of our study of 1 and 2 Samuel and the life of David that we've been using as a kind of guide for this journey of the heart. He was the king of Israel. this is Saul who in the early years of his youthful ascent into power showed wonderful promise and potential 1 Samuel 9 verse 2 describes him as a choice and handsome man who physically stood head and shoulders above all the people of Israel when he was identified and called out to be king he backed away in what was apparently authentic humility in chapter 9 verse 21 of 1 Samuel he says this to Samuel who was wanting to anoint him as king. I'm from the least significant family and the least significant tribe in all of Israel. Why do you speak to me of such things, becoming king? It can't be me, he thought. He was a great warrior, and he started out in his late 20s to be a great king as well, but in the end, so full of himself and a stubborn refusal to bow his knee to God as God. He was tormented by depression, driven by a pathological jealousy. His family was alienated from him. He lost the respect of people around him. His mind and emotion in ruins. He was incapable of experiencing love or joy or peace to the degree that one day, it says in 1 Samuel 16, 14, that an evil spirit came upon him, terrorizing him. And the text says that this evil spirit was sent from the Lord, which begs an explanation, don't you think? The simplest and best explanation, I think, is this, that what we have here is what theologians refer to as sovereign language, where in the big picture, in the vast scheme of things, God is, in fact, in control. He is sovereign. But you and I have a part to play in all of this. We have a role to play. For example, Romans 1.28, it says this, concerning some that God gives them over to degrading passions. God gives them over to that. But that giving over was not and is not capricious. It's not arbitrary on God's part. It is, in fact, a response on God's part to directions that these people were already going, to choices they were already making, desires they were already pursuing, so that God gave them over to what they were already wanting. Some months ago here at Open Door, we were doing a series of sermons on the Lord's Prayer. We were learning to pray, among other things, this, Thy will be done. Thy will be done. And truth is, however, not everybody prays that. Not everybody here prays that. For whether in words or simply in spirit governing how we live, many of us pray this way, my will be done, my will be done. And sometimes, not always, but sometimes, for reasons that are God's alone, God says, okay, your will be done. It will be done your way. Sovereign language where God actually does, in some sense, seals and confirms what you and I actively desire. That's Saul. A bitter, jealous, angry man with an empty, shriveled heart, which began to be exposed as such in 1 Samuel 18, where Saul began to hear with his ears and see with his eyes the emergence and prosperity of David. It all begins to make itself clear, beginning in 1 Samuel 18, verse 5, with these words, So David went out to wherever Saul sent him, and he prospered. And Saul sent him over the men of war, and it was pleasing in the sight of all the people, also in the sight of Saul's servants. Verse 14, And David was prospering in all his ways, for the Lord was with him. And when Saul saw that he was prospering greatly, he dreaded him. Verse 30, then the commanders of the Philistines went out to battle, and it happened as often as they went out that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul. So his name was highly esteemed. But beyond esteem, David was loved, first of all, by Jonathan. And the relationship between Jonathan and David, we spoke of a couple of weeks ago for actually a few weeks. but it wasn't just Jonathan. Saul's daughter, Michael, verse 20 reveals, loved him as well. In fact, verse 16 says that all of Israel and all of Judah loved David, and he went out and came in before them all until the song that was being sung in the streets went something like this, verse 7, that Saul has killed his thousands, but David has killed his tens of thousands. Verse 8 then says this that Saul became very angry for this saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed to David ten thousands but to me they've ascribed thousands now what more can he have but the kingdom and Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on and his suspicion born of envy gave birth in Saul's heart to murderous intent verse 11 in a very ugly mood while David was playing on the harp, Saul took the spear that was in his hand and hurled it at David thinking, I'll pin him to the wall. But David escaped from his presence twice. I'm going to get the twice thing. I just assumed that he took his spear, threw it at him, mess went, picked up his spear, and threw it at him again, and David was fast. Now, when you begin to examine the history of God's people, not just this story, but the big picture of God's people's story as recorded in Scripture, it actually becomes a bit overwhelming. How often this issue of envy appears and how dangerous it is when it does. It didn't take long for it to evidence itself in the very beginning, the book of Genesis, in the very first family, Cain killed Abel for what? Envy. Jacob envied Esau. Ishmael envied Isaac. The brothers of Joseph sold Joseph into slavery. Didn't care if he lived or died entirely because of envy. Leah was envious of Rachel. Miriam and Aaron envied Moses because he had a more prominent prophetic role in the dealings with God's people than they did. In fact, in Matthew 27, it might culminate in terms of the ultimate expression of this, affirming that it's kind of everywhere when it says Pilate, who didn't have incredible perceptions, but he knew this, it was for envy. Pilate knew it was for envy that the religious leaders sought to kill Jesus. They had all sorts of reasons, but Pilate knew it was envy. It really is everywhere. It's part of all of our stories. We need to be aware of it in our own hearts and this journey of the heart because it's one of those things that needs to continually be exposed and confronted and rooted out. In a book entitled Siblings Without Rivalry, one woman tells the story of how one summer day she was ridding the refrigerator in her garage of a two-year frost buildup. It was a hot day, she writes, and the kids were in bathing suits, so I playfully tossed a slab of ice in the direction of one of the kids and said, here, have some ice. Immediately, the other two kids said, we want some too, so I grabbed two more big slabs and slid them in their direction, but then the youngest yelled, they have more. You want more? Here's more. And I threw a pot full of ice at his feet. Then the other two yelled, no, he has more. I threw two more pots of ice in their direction and the first cried out again, no, they have more. By this time, sound like your home? The three kids were ankle deep in ice and they were still yelling for more. So as fast as I could, I threw pot fulls of ice at everyone's feet even though they were hopping up and down in pain from the cold. They still screamed for more in a frenzy of concern that one of them would gain the advantage. That was when I realized, he writes, how futile it was to even try to make things equal. The children could never get enough and as a mother I could never give enough. And quote, here's a flash, neither can God give enough for some of us. For the fact is this, even God is incapable of giving enough to satisfy an envious heart. It's a bottomless pit. It's never enough. Listen, the song that Saul began to hear in the streets went like this. Saul has killed his thousands. Stop right there. Saul has killed his thousands. That's a lot. that's better than most and that is certainly more than Saul ever expected when he was growing up in the least significant family of the least significant tribe if you would have told Saul when he was growing up in that family that he would be used of God to do a significant work in the kingdom of God he would have been so grateful all. But it wasn't enough at this time in Saul's life because David was doing what? More. And it galled him. And what's left of Saul's spirit in this text, this piece of the story just shrinks a little bit more, being devoured by a discontent, grasping, envious heart. Cornelius Plantinga, in his book, Not the Way It's Supposed to Be, takes it beyond, this thing of envy takes it beyond kids playing with ice and kind of creates some energy around our understanding of envy and the danger of it by comparing it to covetousness, covetousness being very dangerous, but watch the contrasts to covet, he says. It's to want someone else's goods so strongly that you might be tempted to steal it. That'd be a bad thing, a really bad thing. But to envy is to resent someone else's good or goods so strongly that you might be tempted to destroy it or destroy him or her for having it. The coveter, he says, has empty hands and wants to fill them with someone else's goods, thus the stealing. The envier has empty hands as well, but wants to empty the hands of the envied, not even caring if you get the goods. I just don't want you to have it. Coveting focuses more on objects than people. Envy is personal. If envy can come away with another's goods, that's fine, but it's not the point. That's an incidental advantage. What the envier really wants is to spoil something or someone. That's Saul, who picked up a spear, thinking to himself, I'll pin you to the wall. Not a lot of spears in our living rooms, I don't think. I don't think you have one sitting next to your, you know, lounge or chair or in your office at work. We don't throw a lot of spears, at least not like that, but we use words sometimes to pin people to the wall. I know I could just destroy someone's character. I could spread have truths and lies and gossip. I'll pin you to the wall, and primarily the motivation in this context would be envy. It's not even that I want what you have. I just don't want you to have it. As I pull this story together, all of it for me raises a question that actually is a personal question for me. It's because Saul's story touches things in me. I don't often preach sermons about people I don't like. I don't like this guy, but more than that, I don't want to be like this guy. And because of that, it raises these questions. What happened to this guy? Where did Saul go wrong? Where did his heart begin to turn? How did this man who started so well, and that's the haunting part of this for me, he started so well, end up the empty shell that he was? I don't pretend to know all of the answers. there were four things that occurred to me in my own personal wonderings about this that might explain how this guy who started so well could end up so poorly. The first and most obvious to me is this. Saul had a deep root of pride. Now that actually does come into the text among the most telling scriptures revealing his decline and his root of pride is found in 1 Samuel 15 verse 17 where Samuel says to Saul, something I actually used to hear my dad make reference to when I was younger. Samuel said this to Saul, you know something, Saul? When you were little in your own eyes, the anointing of God was all over you. In fact, the anointing of God was on you and working through you in ways you didn't even know the anointing was on you. And God was using you in incredible ways when you were little in your own eyes. Do you remember that, Saul? Saul, do you remember when you were surprised that God picked you because you were from the smallest town and the smallest family? Do you remember when it surprised you that God used you at all? And again, it would have blown your mind if one time somebody would have told you that you would in fact kill your thousands, accomplish something significant in the kingdom of God. Do you remember when that would have surprised you? Remember when it surprised you when the anointing of God came on you and you were anointed and he prospered you and you were grateful? Do you remember that? Because you knew that you really were from the smallest family in the smallest town, yet God chose you because you knew in those days that that's what God does. He moves towards and he calls out the least and he calls out the lost. Blessed are the poor in spirit. When you were little in your own eyes, the anointing of God was all over you because you were just so dependent and you were so eager to obey. two incidents many scholars point to as symbols of Saul's decline as manifestations of his pride one is in first Samuel 13 there at Gilgal battling the Philistine Saul was told to wait for Samuel's return before going into battle Saul was going to be or Samuel was going to be gone for seven days so so here's the deal so I'll wait for seven days then make the sacrifice so how long he's supposed to wait, Saul, seven days. What are you supposed to do, Saul? Wait. Okay, that's all you got to do. Samuel didn't show up. It was coming close to the seventh day. Saul decides to do it his own way, offers a sacrifice without waiting, and when Samuel comes to him and asks him why, Saul begins to rationalize and lie and blow what I call religious smoke in Samuel's face. Well, here's the deal. Samuel, the Philistines were coming and the men were nervous. I realized I hadn't made a sacrifice to the Lord and I just care so much about making sacrifices to the Lord. So I just did it. I forgot about the way. I just totally forgot about the way. Liar. On the surface, in fact, when I first read the story of him doing the sacrifice before he was supposed to, I thought, what's the big deal? He did the sacrifice. That's a good thing. Here's the deal, however. It began to set a pattern. It set a pattern. It revealed a pattern in Saul that was really about pride. I'm going to do it my way. I'm going to make my own rules, and I'm going to follow my own rules. That's all about pride. It's all about arrogance. Second incident is two chapters later, 1 Samuel 15, at war with the Amalekites, a particularly vile people were they. The word of the Lord came to Samuel, and then to Saul, what you need to do, is destroy everything, every single thing. You got that, Saul? Yeah. What gets destroyed, Saul? All of it. What gets left, Saul? None of it. So they went into battle and they won the battle. But near the end, Saul noticed that there were some really choice livestock there, some sheep and some cows, so he decided to set them off to the side and hold them for later. We'll have some good steaks. Samuel shows up. Saul greets him in 1 Samuel 15, 13. with more religious smoke that he's blowing in Samuel's face. Samuel's coming and Saul acts all happy to see him. Blessed are you, Samuel. Blessed are you of the Lord. You're looking really good. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Behold, Samuel, I have carried out all that the Lord's commanded. Really, said Samuel. What then is that bleating of the sheep? I hear. What sheep? Said Saul. Oh, those sheep. The soldiers, they got the sheep to sacrifice to the Lord. Yeah, that's the ticket. To sacrifice to the Lord. So you did this for God. So you could show your devotion to God with this sacrifice. Is that right, Saul? Yeah, yeah, that's it. Samuel's response to that smoke, you don't blow smoke in prophets' faces. They've got a way of seeing through the baloney. Samuel's response in chapter 15, verse 22 is one of the phrases he's kind of known for. You've heard it, maybe not in context. Samuel, I just see him saying in just kind of a sober, steely way, looking him right in the eyes and saying, Saul, to obey is better than sacrifice. Sacrifice in this context, please get the context. The sacrifice here was a flurry of visible religious activity, and people do it all the time. Get involved in a flurry of visible religious activity designed not because you are devoted to God, but the flurry of religious activity is designed to convince people that you're innocent when you're not. It's designed to convince people that you care about what God says and what he thinks when you don't. And one way to do that and blow the smoke is to get all churchy. It's like people who come to church, get all emotional in worship. Bruce talked about this a little bit last week. And we'll come and we'll close our eyes, we'll raise our hands, we'll have tears streaming down our cheeks. I love God so much. And you're in an adulterous situation all week long, but this will make people think, I really care about obeying God. No, you don't. It's better to obey than sacrifice. So just put your hands down and quit singing the songs and quit blowing the religious smoke. Just obey. That would be good. Quit the show. Quit the charade. Just obey. Says Samuel to Saul, says the Lord to us. But to just obey would take something that Saul did not have and many of us don't have. it would take humility. You see, obeying takes, among other things, a spirit that says, I will bow, and I will serve, and I will yield, and I will submit. Yielding and submitting. That's a real popular thing in our culture, and in our church, the church. See, to obey takes a kind of humility that would say things like this, your God, I'm not, your Lord, I'm not. It takes people who are saying things like this, hallowed be thy name, when what I'm really committed to is my name being known. And God, I kind of enjoy using your name to get my name known. See, obeying, simply obeying and not blowing a lot of religious smoke comes from people who are praying this way, thy kingdom come. But in Saul's spirit, in many of our spirits, it's really about building our own personal kingdom so our name gets known and our will can be done. Saul's sin was this, that in his pride he disregarded the Word of God. That's exactly what it says in verse 23. And he decided to play by his own rules, to make up his own rules. He would have fit very well into our culture and into many of our churches. Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with this. Why? Well, because I just don't think God would. You don't have a clue what God thinks, Saul. And you have no intent of doing what he says, Saul. So quit blowing your religious smoke and just obey. Just obey. Don't say nothing. Just obey. Then we'll talk. Then come sing your song. And God said, ultimately, I can't trust my kingdom to a man like this. I can't trust my kingdom to a heart like this. Verse 35 is a verse that just gives me chills, actually, as I would consider the possibility of becoming a person like Saul, which I don't want to be, and I don't want you to be either. What it says in verse 35 is this, and the Lord regretted that he had made Saul the king of Israel. Again, the question comes to me, how did this man who started so well end up so bad? I don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with a lifelong root of pride. number two it had something to do with a change of heart it had something to do with a change of perspective I don't often use the same verse for two different points but I find the word of Samuel a haunting one in chapter 15 verse 17 when he said to Saul when you were little in your own eyes the anointing of God was all over you so there evidently was a time when he had some kind of humility and that that that realization kind of triggered a memory for me as i just kind of put myself in the place of this place in his life uh where saul is the memory uh is served this week for me as a kind of warning and i would give it to you in the same spirit the memory was of when i was about 24 years old 23 24 years old. Bonnie and I were in Chicago pastoring a little church there of about 60 people. It was a hard work and it was slow going. There wasn't much growth. At that same time in Chicago, there was a guy whose name I knew was just beginning a ministry that was beginning to get noticed and it was making some significant inroads in powerful ways in the Chicagoland area. his name was Bill Hybels. How many of you remember that name? A few of you. Willow Creek Church, one of the most incredible churches, works of God in the world today. It's an amazing thing. The story I'm telling is not about him, it's about me. And I'm in this little tiny church of 60 people, and Bill, I know who he was. He went to the same camp I did. Kids are like, and he's making all this noise. And I began to hear a song sung in my head. I didn't hear it anywhere else. It was just kind of going in my head. The song went like this. Bill has killed his thousands, but David has killed his tens. It didn't bother me. Yes, it did. I remember very clearly getting a word from God at that time in my life. I even, and I'm not kidding about that. It really was a word. I remember where I was in my office, tiny little office. I remember this little black vinyl chair that I kneeled down and prayed over because I needed to receive this. I needed to let it in. It was from the word of God. It was 1 Peter 5. 5.6 said this, David, here's the deal. Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God. He'll exalt you at the proper time, which meant to me at the time, among other things, don't you spend five minutes trying to be like him. Which meant to me at the time, here's what you do, Dave. Go back in your office, exegete the next five verses, and preach on Sunday. It didn't mean don't aspire. I did aspire. It didn't mean want something more. It didn't mean that, but it meant get back, Just don't spend five minutes trying to be like somebody else. Humble yourself. Let God do what he's going to do with the product. And I was little in my own eyes. I'll take that. Four or five years later, we were at Open Door. We had a church of about 160 people at the time, which seems small now. But then it was huge to me. Go to a church of 60, from a church of 60 to 160. This is big. It felt bigger than me. First year I was there, a guy came up to me. I'll never forget it. I know the person still goes here to Open Door. He said, I have a word from God for you. You're going to have, God told me, you're going to have a worldwide ministry. Cool. And that word came to me again. And the word was this. Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God. He'll exalt you at the proper time, which means, among other things, Dave, don't you spend five minutes trying to get famous. Don't even spend five minutes trying to figure out how to do that. Just go back to your office, exegete the next five verses, preach on Sunday, and just be a little surprised that God called you at all. And just be a little, worldwide minister, just go back and do what you do, and just be a little surprised that God uses you at all, that God has gifted you at all, that you have anything at all to say, and be a little grateful to. That'd be good. Now, let me ask you this. could that perspective change that perspective that i had at 24 and then again at 27 and then again could that perspective now i'm 51 could that perspective change yeah does it sometimes change in people's hearts yes and when it does something very precious is spoiled and something very important is lost for Saul what was lost was the kingdom and I don't think the parallel there is necessarily he lost his salvation his life work was lost he lost his family, he lost the respect of his friends He lost his friends. A couple of weeks ago we talked about covenant relationships between David and Jonathan. That was the paradigm we used. But you need to know that Samuel and Saul were covenant friends. This prophet and this king submitting both to God at one time in their lives, doing incredible things together for God, and something shifted in Saul's hearts. He lost his friend. Ultimately he lost his life. Saul had a root of pride. Number two, he had a change of heart. That's why this comes as a warning to me, to us. Number three, again, this is just my things that occurred to me, and it has to do with where I am in my life. The third thing that I think explains how Saul started well and didn't end that way, was that he had an inability or an unwillingness to respond to what I will be calling this morning the invitation of descent. Now, I'm drawing this point, this speech of descent from my understanding of spiritual formation and the spiritual journey as described by a guy I mentioned a couple of weeks ago named Richard Rohr in his book, The Wild Man's Journey, Reflections on Male Spirituality. And while his book is kind of patterned for men, his understanding of spiritual journey doesn't just apply to men, so I think it applies to men and women, and I'll try to adjust some of what he says so we can all enter into this cycle. He explains it this way. The language of the first half of the life journey is the language of ascent. It's the earnest and necessary idealism that characterizes all healthy young men and young women. It's the heroic language of winning and building and succeeding, accomplishing and conquering, of discovering your strength, which, by the way, is a very good thing. It's, in fact, a holy thing. Those things they use. Sometimes you discover these things in school. I watch some of our boys and my daughters, and they discover these things sometimes in sports, the building of a business. These are good things, and coming with it is this language of ascent, but that's only the first stage of the journey of life. And some of us don't understand that. had no one to explain that. You see, he says, in the second stage of the journey of life, the spiritual journey, the language of assent that works so well in the first stage can actually become dangerous. The rules that helped us in stage one become toxic in stage two, resulting in egocentricity, climbing at all costs, misuse of power in a frantic attempt to maintain assent. What does that sound like? That's Saul. the great spiritual teachers says Rohr enter into a different kind of wisdom for the second half of their journey and Saul could have entered into this but he didn't or couldn't or wouldn't second half of the journey marked by what Rohr calls the language of descent requiring a depth of humility and dependence you couldn't know in your youth the language of descent is learned most often in midlife and here I am, normally through suffering or just some experience of powerlessness. For me, for us, for many of you, it's just getting in touch with your limitations and the inability you have to keep ascending. And now I'm not quoting Rohr here, but this invitation to descent you need to get is an invitation to a deeper place, to a deeper place of substance and wisdom and interior strength. It's the stuff of which good and wise kings are made. Good and wise fathers and mothers are made. It's the kind of king that David desperately needed at this time in his life when he was in his ascent, killing his tens of thousands. Remember a few weeks ago? Maybe it was months ago now. But David, we were doing the David and Goliath thing. And we met Eliab, David's older brother. And we met Jesse, David's father. And we met Saul for the first time then too. One of the things I said about David in his ascent, in his coming into all of this, he had incredible faith, but he needed a big brother. He really needed a big brother, but not Eliab. And he needed a good father, but not like the one he had, Jesse. And he needed a king because warriors without kings are loose cannons. But what he got was Saul. Roar, in fact, says it takes wise old kings and mellow old grandfathers to teach the young Turks the way of patience, compassion, and humility. But if the invitation to descend is not received, or the language of descent is not learned, we inevitably move into a long day's journey of accusing, resenting, negativity, and paranoia. You become the bitter old man, the bitter old woman, jealous, angry, full of envy, Saul. When midlife no longer allows you to ascend, far too many people either shut down or keep running. The price for that is a world of men and women who do not age well and offer nothing of help to the young. They are emotionally, spiritually, and intellectually unavailable. They are the parents, the priests, and the leaders who, if irrelevant, and many of these people are irrelevant, we laugh at them. This is the guy who wears the gold medallion, who marries a woman half his age and has a toupee that he actually thinks looks good. Sorry. Everybody knows you're bald. But if they're not irrelevant, and Saul wasn't, Saul had a position of power that he was desperately trying to hang on to, they're not irrelevant, they become dangerous. I will pin you to the wall. Saul who because he had a root of pride because he had a change of heart and because he had an inability to respond to this invitation of descent into the noble wisdom of a king he could have been a great king because of all that point four he missed an opportunity and it's an opportunity I don't want to miss and I don't want you to miss and I don't want our church to miss and the opportunity he missed was this. He had the opportunity to bless and build and father and mentor and encourage and celebrate and then release David. And for our purposes, I would use David as a metaphor to build and to release and to bless the Davids among us. And please hear the metaphor as I've used it before. This is not speaking of the young men among us. Davids among us are the young men and the young women who are in their holy ascent, discovering their strength in the kingdom of God, who need kings and fathers and mothers who will bless them and call them and challenge them and punch them once in a while. But... You know, in the scheme of things, Saul's jealousy and envy did not thwart the plan of God for David. So if you didn't have the father, the mother, the king, you know what? God's, you're going to find, you didn't thwart it. It made it tougher. It made it tougher. David, we're going to talk about David going in caves and some of the agony of that. Ultimately, Saul's envy and jealousy devoured him. But think of the joy that he missed. This is the opportunity that he missed to help this kid, to bless and build and release this kid, to celebrate this kid, to leave a legacy through this kid. But to do that would have required something that Saul didn't have. He just didn't have it. And what he didn't have, among other things, was humility. And he didn't have the perspective that this kingdom wasn't his. I can pretty much promise you, I just guarantee that Saul never prayed this way, thy kingdom come. I don't think Saul ever prayed this way. Hallowed be your name. I don't think Saul ever prayed this way. Thy will be done because to Saul, it was always about his kingdom and his name and his will. It was all about him. And he ended up a pathetic old man with a shriveled, jealous, envious heart. I want to close with a word from me on behalf of all of our leadership here at Open Door to the David among us. To the Davids who may go here to Open Door, but I'm really not concerned about, well, I am concerned about Open Door, but it's bigger for me than that. I want to talk to the Davids. I want you to, I'm telling you to give this tape away. I hope this word lands on Davids who don't go here. I want to say something to the Davids. Part of our vision statement here at Open Door includes a stated desire to identify, call, bless, and release the next generation, the Davids, of young men and women here at Open Door into the ministry here. And I don't mean onto the staff here. I mean in becoming teachers and business people and going into life as kingdom people and blessing that and building that and seeing you do 10,000 more than we could ever do. But one thing I can tell you for sure is this, that blessing and releasing and honoring the Davids can't possibly happen if in the hearts of the leadership here right now would be a spirit of Saul. Because the spirit of Saul would just crush all that and hold all that down and be threatened by someone else's emergence. So on behalf of the leadership right here, right now, I want to say something to you. If in some years to come, we here at Open Door begin to hear a song being sung in the streets, that goes something like this. You know, that old group of leaders that, you know, can't hardly walk up onto the stage anymore. They really did well. They're really faithful, but it's just nothing compared to what's happening now. My pledge to you, and I hope it's a pledge, this is my prayer. It's my prayer. It's like a prophetic thing into the future. It's what I want. it's what we want. My pledge, my prayer is this, that when we begin to hear that song, we will not only not resent it, but we will rejoice in it. Indeed, I need to tell you, we expect it. We expect it. I want to say this to the Davids, the men and women, the young men and women, we expect you, the next generation, to take what you have seen and heard and learned, hopefully some good things from us and to go further, to see more, to do more. We expect you to do more, to go further. Some of you might say, well, that feels like a really heavy weight. Then feel it. Then feel the weight. And our pledge to you is we're going to help you and we're going to lift you and we're going to bless you. You know, I go to conferences from time to time and I try to expose myself to things that are kind of out of my comfort zone, out of our comfort zone. And I was at one a couple weeks ago, and I came away going, you know, the things that we talked about in this conference, I wasn't a speaker, I wasn't a tender, that speak to the needs of the church and how we're going to reach the next generation. I just need to tell you honestly, some of the things we talked about weren't even on my radar screen 10 years ago, weren't even on my radar screen 10. I couldn't see them. You know who's going to see them? Some of you. Some of you are going to see things that we don't see. We need to help you see them, and we need to release you when you do. and some of you will do 10,000. I had a conversation not long ago with one of my kids. I can't even remember one. I think it was Chris. It doesn't matter which, but we were talking about ministry and going into vocational ministry and the conversation was about would you ever be interested in vocational ministry? I think our whole life is a ministry, but also vocational was the conversation. And he said, well, I could never do what you do. and we had a little talk about that and the whole point was you're not supposed to do what I'm doing and I hope you don't have a paradigm of ministry vocational ministry that's this here's a word to the Davids here's a word to the Davids from somebody who doesn't want to be a Saul and I don't think I am and I don't want to become one but here's a word to the Davids from me break the mold break the mold change the wineskins do it different And in fact, to reach your generation, you're going to have to do it different. In fact, this reminds me of the time that David met Saul. Remember that? This was several months ago, David and Goliath. David was going to go and face the Goliath. And Saul's suggestion was this. Go out and face him, but here, use my armor. In other words, do it the way I did it. Do the ministry the way I did the ministry. Here, take the armor. And David's response was incredible that he would have the guts to say this. he said Saul and I'll paraphrase here he said Saul your armor is really good and it works well for you but it doesn't fit me and he went out and found five stones which was it's kind of a parable of doing it a different way now I don't know for sure but I have a little theory I think Saul's resentment of David began right there I don't know that but I think that Saul it would be like somebody coming to me saying I want to do the work of the kingdom but you know Dave not like you and if that bugged me and I would go No, let me tell you our job. Let me tell you our job as I wrap this up. Our task in calling out the Davids is not to give you our armor. You know, this might not work for the next generation. What we do might not work. Our job is not to give you our armor, but to help you find your own. But guess what? All of that requires becoming the kind of people and being the kind of leaders and the kind of people who are walking humbly and who are praying daily, Thy kingdom come, because it's not my kingdom. Thy will be done, because it's not about me. And it's the language of dissent. Let's pray as we close. Father, I thank You for the Davids among us, and I thank You for how You have put it in our heart and we don't even know how to do it yet but you put it in our heart to call out the Davids to bless them and equip them and release them and I pray in your name that you would protect us all along the way of our journey from the spirit of Saul that would crush the Davids among us and force them to move and live in caves and would just devour the hearts, our hearts. Be with us as we continue this journey of the heart, I pray in Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
