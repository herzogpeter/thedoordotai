I'd like to pray as we go to the Word and then prepare our hearts for the coming around the table. Let's pray. Father, I pray that, as I always do, that the power of your Spirit would be at work in the Word. But because of what we're doing particularly today, I pray that you, by the power of your spirit, would be involved in our doing of the word, the word that we have been dealing with for many, many weeks. I pray that be done in Jesus' name. Amen. If you've been with us these last few weeks and even months, you're undoubtedly aware of the fact that we've been involved in a series of sermons dealing with the issues of money, sex, and power. The first of the three arenas of life, of those three that we chose to deal with, was sexuality. Indeed, today we are kind of culminating that study. What you may not remember or be aware of is why we're studying money, sex, and power. And as we enter into this weekend that we are calling a service of consecration. I think it matters why we're doing this, not only the consecration, but the study itself. It actually began back in June, June 17th to be exact. It was our first Sunday of the summer in the Earl Brown Center, having been displaced from Robbinsdale. I think it's kind of significant that I'm kind of bringing this up again on a day that we're displaced from Earl Brown and we're back here. Because on that Sunday, the 17th of June, I was reflecting on the somewhat chaotic and often confusing movement that we were experiencing as a church. And this is the question I asked at the time. What's God up to in all of this? What is he doing? What is he saying? Where are we going? During this odd season of transition in our church's life where, on one hand, we can see the prospect of our permanent church home in Maple Grove becoming more and more real every week. and so that's very encouraging. On the other hand, we seem to be in a physical sense in terms of our moving around all the time, more uprooted, unsettled, and nomadic than ever before. So God, what are you doing? Actually, maybe a more important question was, God, what should we be doing in this odd season of transition from one place, from one season in our church's life into another? Well, the answer to that question, as most of you know, if you've been with us over this period of time was this, that we felt very clearly the Spirit of God was saying to us, Church of the Open Door, during this season of life, you need to be doing two things in one way or another. Number one, prepare yourselves for what it is I'm calling you to, and consecrate yourselves in preparation for what it is I'm calling you to. Now, that word, prepare yourself and consecrate yourself, didn't just kind of come out of the blue. It was born of study in the first three chapters of the book of Joshua, depicting an episode in the life of God's people that we thought was actually, in some very interesting ways, similar to our own journey. For the people of God in Joshua 1 through 3 are on the shores of the Jordan River, having wandered in the wilderness for many years. They were, we perceived, very much like us, on the threshold of and about to enter into an entirely new era of life and ministry as a people, a time and era that was full of promise and possibility of opportunity. So cross this Jordan, said the Lord to Joshua in chapter 1, verse 2. You and all this people into the land which I am giving you, and here's the incredible promise, and every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I am giving it to you. So be strong and courageous and go and move your feet. But before you go, while you're still on the threshold, still on the shore, before you enter in, I want you to do two things. They're very important things and it's important that they're done before you enter in. Number one, chapter one, verse 11 of Joshua, prepare yourselves. Number two, chapter three, verse five of Joshua, consecrate yourselves. In other words, people of God, and then we took it to apply to us, Church of the Open Door, examine yourselves by way of preparation in three vitally important arenas of life, money, sex, and power. But even those three arenas of life that we chose to focus on didn't get pulled out of the blue. They too were in the text. But when the spies went out in Joshua 2 to view the land, they came back to Joshua with this report, that the God that the people serve in the land to which we are going is a God called Baal. Baal, as you know, if you were with us for the study, is the God of the Canaanites. In the worship of Baal, we discovered in that study. It was marked primarily by a disordered relationship, amazingly, with these three arenas of life, money, sex, and power. They literally worshipped money, sex, and power, as if those things had the power to give them life, like a God would give you life. Which simply means this, at least we took it to mean this as applied to us, that what the people of God were dealing with thousands of years ago on the shores of the Jordan River is precisely what we are dealing with today as a church, as we stand on the threshold of where it is God is calling us to go. For we live in a culture that is obsessed with, that has a disordered relationship with, indeed, that worships three things, as if they have the power to give life, money, sex, and power. And so the word of the Lord comes to them and came to us with these two words. Before you go where I'm calling you to go, I want you to use this season of life to do two things. prepare yourselves and consecrate yourselves, for the work I am calling you to is great, and I will do wonders among you. Now, since June 17th, we have done our best to take that word from God, first of all in the arena of sexuality, to heart. It's why since June 16th, we've been speaking of with some unavoidable breaks, disordered sexuality. It's why since that date we've been calling the people of God to a rightly ordered view and life around sexuality. It's also why this particular week in the context of our communion service, we are going to end this particular focus and study of sexuality on a service of corporate consecration in the arena of her sexuality. This corporate consecration may be much like, I don't know for sure, but maybe like the service of consecration entered into by the people of God. When Joshua in chapter 3, verse 5, stood before the people in much the same way I'm standing before you now, In chapter 3, verse 5, saying this, let us consecrate ourselves, people of God. Join with me in doing this. And we're doing it in preparation for the wonders that God plans to do among us. And so, in Joshua chapter 3, the people did that. But I'm left with a question after I get that picture of Joshua calling them to consecration and then the people together did that. What does it mean to consecrate yourself? And how do you do that in particular? How do you do that kind of corporately? Well, to help you understand that and understand it so that you can really enter into it when we do it in just a few moments, I want to answer three questions very quickly. Why, what, and how? Question number one, why are we doing this? Well, the answer to that is really quite simple. It's not very mystical or mysterious at all. The answer to the question, bottom line, is this. This feels, what we're doing today feels like obedience to me. I remember the meeting we were in early we have a message team that kind of comes around meets with me every week around the message and what we heard last week and where we think we're going in the text and it was the very week that it became clear in Joshua these two things that we were supposed to prepare ourselves and consecrate ourselves that we said amongst ourselves we don't really know how this is supposed to look or how to do it, we've never done anything like this but somewhere along the line as we capsulate our study of sexuality and then complete our study of money and then power, on each one of those things, I feel like we're supposed to consecrate ourselves. We said that together. Not sure how, just that we're supposed to. Corporately, like they did in Joshua, we need to call the people to consecration. But the question that lingered was this, how do we do that? And after even we decided that we were going to do it, we still didn't know how. That kind of leaves you in a strange and tense place. but we did know what. So let me tell you what. That's the second question. What is consecration? In fact, it was when we discovered what consecration was and remembered what it was, it kind of helped us with the how, but I'll get to that in a moment. What does it mean to consecrate yourself? What are you doing when you do it? Well, at its most basic level, it means this, to set apart as unto God. More helpful and clear, I think it means this, to take what I think belongs to me and set it apart as belonging to God. Let me bring it down the road a little bit. We're dealing with sexuality now. The next deal we're going to, the issue we're going to deal with is money. Consider in a few weeks when we have a consecration service around money. And what that will be will be a service where corporately we take what we think belongs to us. What would that be then? Money? And set it apart as belonging to God. That's what it means to consecrate. The definition that is my favorite and most complete, however, is this. is to take that which has been formerly used for common or profane purposes. Stop right there. Common purposes aren't bad purposes. There's nothing sinful, but there's nothing transcendent about it either. It's just common, not bad, just common. Consecration is when I take those elements of my life that have been used for common and sometimes profane purposes, and then by an act of obedience and heartfelt sincerity and belief in the love and grace of God to offer them to God to be used in the service of that which is healthy, holy, and altogether good. It means to set it apart for higher purposes than I had ever dreamed those things in my life could be used. Imagine that. Just in your mind, kind of let hope rise in you. that the purposes of God, as I give the dynamic arenas of my life to God, can be used for the purposes of God. Those arenas of my money can be used for a higher purpose than common. Those arenas of how I use personal power can be used for a higher purpose than just common and certainly a higher one than that which is profane. And the arena of my sexual life can enter into a transcendent kind of purpose, higher than common and certainly separated from that which is profane. Let me just define it for you again. Consecration, so you'll understand. It's simply coming to God today in the arena of our sexuality and saying, Lord, what we have used for common and sometimes profane purposes, we now set apart to you to be used in the service of that which is healthy and holy and altogether good, but I'm still left with that third question. How do we do that? Especially how do you do it corporately? Now, I really get how you do consecration personally. In fact, I'm quite convinced, I know for a fact, that as we've gone through this series on sexuality, individually, personally, many of you have been consecrating yourselves. You haven't even used that word necessarily, but you've been adjusting and responding to the word of God by the work of the spirit in your life, And you've been taking dimensions of your lives and ways you've fought and changed them, bringing them under the order of God, setting it apart as unto God. And consecration personally has been taking place in many of your lives without you even using that word. But corporately, it just feels a little different to me, a little more awkward. I mean, when I began to think about how we would call the people to consecration, I thought, you know, I mean, what about visitors? I mean, what about people who don't understand this? What about people who aren't ready for this? I mean, I've been saying that many of you personally have been consecrating yourselves, but some of you haven't and been resisting, and you're not part of it. You're just not saying yes to God in this arena of your life. What about people like that who might be here today? I mean, what if we make people feel awkward or even offend them, make them kind of feel forced to do something they don't want to do? I mean, this could be risky, I began to think. What if we do it wrong? What if we do it poorly? What if the service is a dud? And I began to think, it was amazing, as I was trying to figure out how to do this, I began to come up with all sorts of reasons not to do this. As we tried to figure out how. But ironically, it was in the raising of all those questions about how to do this, calling of God's people to consecration, that I found and we found as a message team, the freedom and determination to do this service of consecration. Because here's what we decided. We decided that we would rather do this that we are about to do poorly than to not do it at all. For we believe that God will be powerfully involved and amazingly active in any attempts we make to from the heart say yes to him as a body, to set apart as belonging to him what we have treated as common or profane. So even if we do it poorly. And you know what? We're not gonna. But even if we do, we're still gonna do it. So today, I stand before you, and in my mind, very conscious that I am standing before you, much as Joshua stood before the people thousands of years ago. And as your pastor, I am calling you to consecrate yourselves as a body. Why? because we believe God told us to do this. By the Spirit, through our study of the Word of God, on Sunday mornings, Joshua 1, we heard the Word of the Lord say to us, prepare yourselves, church of the open door. And we heard the Word of the Lord come to us in Joshua 3, consecrate yourselves, church of the open door. That's why. The what of this, what does it mean to do this? What it means is that we are corporately saying yes to God, together, in the arena of our sexuality. It means that corporately we are recognizing that it's not just you and it's not just me. We do not live separated lives. This body of Christ thing and this community dynamic we speak of in the context of the body of Christ is a we thing. It means that we are choosing to take that which we have used for common and sometimes profane purposes, and we are setting these things. We are setting these things apart as unto God. And how are we going to do all this? Very simply, we're going to pray this. The service of consecration is going to be, in essence, a prayer. of consecration, one that we take very seriously this morning and are going to invite you into. This prayer of consecration will have four parts. In fact, our copies, we thought this prayer was so important and we were so careful to prepare it well and have it be an expression of the things that we've been preaching, the things we've been hearing these last several weeks, that we put copies of it in your bulletin. We think this event is so important that it's the kind of thing you might want to refer back to many times in the next several weeks and even months. Indeed, it's going to be on the screen as we pray through these four parts of the prayer. Let me just explain the four parts. I want to tell you what they are, first of all. The first part of the prayer of consecration will be confession. The second will be the prayer of intervention. The third is the prayer of actually of consecration. And the fourth is affirmation. Let me explain them. just so you know what we're doing and you can enter in. The prayer of confession, I think, will be self-evident. We're going to confess. The prayer of intervention involves the out loud desire to intervene on and break away from that which we've confessed. So the picture is this. We'll confess and that will be self-evident. The prayer of intervention is saying, God, about those things we confessed, we are desiring to leave them, break away from them. And you will hear Tom is the one who's going to pray that. He will be speaking of the breaking of soul ties and the breaking of generational sin. What's that about? It's about leaving something behind that we've confessed. The third part, the third part of the prayer is the prayer of consecration. This will be a prayer stating our desire not only to leave old ways, but to enter into and live new ways. So here's the flow. The confession, the desire to leave what we've confessed, leaving and breaking is kind of negative and hard work. Now we're looking forward. I now want to not just leave, I want to live a different way. That's the third prayer. And then the prayer of affirmation is kind of a culmination. It's asking God by his spirit to wonderfully bless our desire to leave the old and live in the new. Now, each of these prayers has been carefully prepared. And as I said, will appear on the screen. With opportunities to respond interspersed. And those places where you can be responding will be indicated on the screen by this phrase, Together we say. And together we will say four things. Interspersed. I just want to read them to you again so you know where we're going. The first in the context of confession will be this. All this we do confess, Lord, forgive us. In the context of the prayer of intervention, our response corporately will be, all this do we now leave? Lord, purify us. In the context of the third, consecration, the prayer of consecration, our response will Be all this. Do we desire, Lord, empower us? Inthe fourth, the prayer of affirmation, our response will be all this. Do we request? Lord, bless us. And I want you to know, so basically there's four things that we're praying for, and I want you to be able to enter it. Basically, what we're praying is, Lord, forgive us. Lord, purify us. Lord, empower us to live a different way. And Lord, bless us. One little word here to help you. We really debated about whether we would put this in your hands and put it on the screen. Because in a moment, I'm going to ask you to assume a posture of prayer. And for many of you, to assume a posture of prayer, it means you bow your head and you close your eyes. And I want to tell you that if that is what you feel most comfortable with and that is how you can best enter in, I want you to bow your head and close your eyes. If that's how you can be most engaged. Some of you are able, however, to stay engaged and be maybe even more engaged with this prayer. If you can see while someone else is praying the prayer, that you can see the prayer and be praying the prayer as someone else is praying it. That's why we're putting it on the screen. Let me liken it and help you with this a little bit to a worship song. There are many worship songs, I think you can tell, that are actually prayers. And as you see the words, you know, your head's not bowed, your eyes not closed. I wonder if you know that you're praying. I wonder if you even know that. Maybe sometimes it does connect. But the ability to see those words and speak those words, prayer words, helps you even more to engage. So they're going to be on the screen to help you do that. And now as Joshua stood before the people thousands of years ago and called the people that he loved to consecrate their lives in preparation for where they were going. I, your pastor, stand before you and call you to consecrate yourself with me. And now I invite you at whatever level you are able to authentically enter in, beloved, to enter in. Assume a comfortable posture of prayer. If you want to kneel, you can do that. Sitting is fine. As I said already, eyes open, looking at the screen. Engage that way is fine. Head bowed, eyes closed. Engage that way is fine. It doesn't matter. I would like you to join me in prayer. I'd also like Jan and Tom to come. Lord, hear our prayer. The people of Open Door, gathered in this place, we pray this. Dear Father, in what we believe is an obedient response to your Spirit's prompting, to consecrate ourselves this day, to say yes to you in the arena of our sexuality, as a body of believers, we begin with this confession. We confess that in both word and deed, we have treated as common and sometimes as profane, which you have declared and designed to be healthy, holy, and altogether good. We confess that we have often believed the lie that our sexuality involves nothing more than skin to skin, that it involves nothing more than a biological urge or a physical function, completely ignoring, sometimes because we just didn't know the deep engagements of our souls and spirits in the context of physical expression. And together we say, all this do we confess. Lord, forgive us. And we confess that we have bought into the spirit of the age that says sex is just sex and have by that become quite comfortable redefining and living in sin. We confess that like our culture, we have treated sex as the ultimate goal rather than a celebration of the ultimate goal, being often unwilling to do the hard work of emotional and spiritual intimacy that sex is designed to celebrate in the context of covenantal marriage. And together we say, all this do we confess, Lord, forgive us. And we confess that we have not loved each other well, so that sometimes, even in our marriages, we see one another as objects we can use for our own personal gratification or agenda. And we confess that our sexuality has become disordered, and that by our lust, we have often abandoned love, being willing to use people as one might use things. We confess the sin of adultery, homosexuality, pornography, abuse, and the disdain, even hatred of the masculine and feminine. And finally, Father, we confess our lack of providing a healthy and holy model for our children. And together we say, all this do we confess. Lord, forgive us. our father we give thanks for the sacrifice of our lord jesus christ we thank you for its cleansing power which is promised when we confess our sin we now turn to you for strength and direction to live the kind of life you've always intended for us Holy Spirit we ask that you would empower us to leave behind and to heal from the effects of our sin we declare that it is our heart's desire to leave behind and live in the freedom from unholy bondages or soul ties the freedom of ancestral generational sin which has affected us in future generations from strongholds which continue to negatively influence us from the ways we've allowed the world to mold and to shape us, from the many times we have forsaken true love for shallow substitutes, from how we have perverted your original design for our sexuality. This we declare, our desire to leave these things in response to your grace lavished upon us in Christ Jesus, our Savior and Lord. Together we say, all this do we now leave. Lord, purify us. Holy God by the power of your spirit we now choose to consecrate our sexuality to you we consecrate our relationships past, present and future to be ordered and reordered by your wisdom and perfect will for us. Together we say, all this do we desire. Lord, empower us. We consecrate our marriages and ask for the mystery of your divine ways of loving to be reflected in us. We consecrate ourselves on behalf of our children and future generations desiring for them holy and pure expressions of their sexuality. Together we say, All this do we desire. Lord, empower us. We consecrate our senses to you and to your holy watch care. We consecrate our bodies to be expressions of your holy ways of relating physically to each other. We consecrate our souls to you to be fully filled with your spirit. We consecrate our spirits to you to be guided and filled with your life and love. We consecrate ourselves to you, male and female, to be reflections of you, our creator. Together we say, All this do we desire. Lord, empower us. To receive the blessing, I would like you to stand. And if this helps you engage, I would just encourage you to extend your hands as a child receiving from your Father, God our Father, the blessing. And now, dear Father, having heard our confession and strong desire to leave old ways and to live in new and living ways, we ask your blessing and that which we are offering to you today, our sexuality. Father God, we ask that you bless our marriages. May our marriages by your grace and power be vivid reflections of one flesh reality and joyful intimacy. Bless the marriages in this room with laughter and love, stability and strength, purity and integrity, providing in them an environment of sanity and safety for our blessed children. And together we say, all this do we request. Lord, bless us. And Father, we ask that you bless our singles. May they walk in the fullness and joy of their masculinity and femininity. May they enter into the delight of all you have made them to be and all you have called them to do. May they, by your grace, experience a full measure of intimacy with you and with other men and women. bless all our young people father junior high, high school and college age who have made the decision to save sexual intimacy for their future husband or wife God bless their desire to live in purity, integrity and fidelity and together we say all this do we request Lord bless us and father finally we ask that you would bless our children in future generations when ways they may not see right now or even be able to understand will be the beneficiaries of this consecration we recognize that you love the innocence of children and lovingly embraced and blessed them when they came to you well father bless them now bless them with healthy holy and altogether good expressions of their masculinity their femininity and their sexuality and may this blessing remain both now and forever and ever and together we say all this do we request Lord bless us and may this blessing remain forever and ever and ever. Amen. You may be seated. We're going to go now to the communion table. And as we do, I'm going to ask the communion stewards to come and take their place now. As I do, I just have a few words to prepare us. As we enter in this morning, I would like to invite you, especially in light of what we've just done and in light of what we've been speaking of these last several weeks and months, to bring to your senses the reality that the one who has prepared this table that we are about to partake of, that the one who has made this table possible is Christ himself who is our groom. And there are many ways. You've heard me teach on this before of relating to Jesus. And the Bible speaks of he is the potter, we are the clay, he is the shepherd, we are the sheep. But the analogy I would invite you into, again, in light of what we're doing today and have been doing these weeks as we come to the table, I would encourage you to envision him as the groom today. And we, the church, are his bride. And to enter into the reality that as we have his bride just prayed this prayer of consecration, by that prayer of consecration, sincerely entered into, you, bride of Christ, have adorned yourself. Do you realize that? You have, that prayer prepared you as a preparation for great things we're going to do. No, leave that alone. It's preparing you for the groom. I invite you, beloved, to come today to the table as the bride would be coming to the groom. And as you come, in the language that we have been using in this series, as the bride to the groom, come this way with a desire to enter in and a willingness to open up to what we call around here at Open Door, the furious love of God that has been made knowable and accessible to us by Christ who is our groom. Beloved, as you come and take the elements, I would have you picture yourself as the bride coming to the groom, the groom who has fought for us, the groom who has shed his blood to win us, who at the table simply desires this. Remember me. Would you let the groom speak that to you as you come? Just let him speak this. Dear bride, remember me. Remember me now. Tonight when you go out with friends, remember me. Remember me. Remember the groom who fought for you to win your heart. let's go to the table I'll have just a few words of instruction on the floor Thank you.
