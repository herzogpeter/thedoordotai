And preparing ourselves today for the table, mindful of the fact that over the last few weeks we have been studying Jesus and coming to know Jesus as our rabbi, I have a question that I think pertains to this, to Jesus as our rabbi and to the table as well. The question is this, who is welcome at our rabbi's table? The rabbi's table being today this table. Are you? Welcome. Am I? What about him? What about her? Last month, it's interesting, I was told last month of a person who had come to our church and come forward for prayer to one of our altar team, our prayer team, people weeping. Weeping because she was convinced that she wasn't worthy to take communion that particular week because she hadn't yet finished the fifth step in her Alcoholics Anonymous program. And when I heard that, it made me wonder, what is it about the fifth step that might make you worthy? Indeed, who actually is worthy? Are you? Am I? It's interesting, as we're studying Jesus these days and coming to know him as our rabbi, we've already come to know that there were a lot of things he did and said that got him in trouble. Well, we're going to hear a little bit more about that again next week. But very few things got him in more trouble, particularly with very religious people, the Pharisees and the Essenes in particular, who we met last week, than who it was he invited to and included at his table. Because he continually, and maddeningly for some, he continually invited and included the wrong kind of people. Many of you may remember that in Jesus' day, with the kingdom of God expectation that they had, which we talked about in detail last week, that one of the primary pictures they had of what the kingdom would be like when the kingdom of God would fully come was that of a banquet. That was one of the pictures they had of a great feast, indeed a messianic feast to be specific, not just any old kind of meal, but there was a symbolic significance connected to the kingdom of a messianic feast, but always the question was this, who gets invited to this feast? Who belongs at the table? Well, Jesus' answer to that question didn't always sit well with certain people, because it seemed to be that he would welcome anyone. But it sounds more open than it actually is because to clarify the anyone he would invite, it would be anyone who really wanted to come to his table. It's kind of like how we call this Talmudim, his disciples that we've been discussing the last few weeks. Because of some research we've been doing, we found out that rabbis in Jesus' day would not just accept anyone to be their Talmudim. They would have to qualify. And after having gone to Talmud, the best of the best of the best would qualify or try to qualify, come to a rabbi and wonder if he was good enough. And most of them heard, no son, you're wonderful, you love God, you know the Torah, but go find another job, go learn your family trade. Once in a while, someone who was good enough would hear these magic words like, hachorah, come follow me. And maybe if you're good enough, you'll become like me. Jesus was a different kind of rabbi who walked around saying things like this to anyone who really wanted to follow him, thereby becoming like him. Lechakorah, come follow me. And so he walked up to a group of fishermen and said, follow me. These not good enoughs, come follow me. He'd take anyone. As it turns out, some people actually believe that he meant that, I'll take anyone. Because in Matthew 9, verse 10, it happened that as he was reclining at the table in the house, many tax gatherers and sinners came, who evidently believed he meant it. I'll have dinner with you. And were dining with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees, who had a very rigid and narrow idea about who was pure enough to have table fellowship, not only in the kingdom of God, but with them as well, saw this, they began to grumble and say to his disciples, Why is your teacher, your rabbi, eating with people like that, tax gatherers and sinners? Indeed, in Luke chapter 4, these same Pharisees concluded that if Jesus was having dinner or table fellowship with people like that, that he himself must be a gluttonous man and a drunkard himself. Now, keep this in mind, what I've already told you, that part of the reason for the tension around table fellowship was that table fellowship was more than food and drink, for it was tied, as I've been saying, to the symbolism of the messianic banquet, the great feast at the end of the age, and the constant question around that was who's included, who's invited, who's welcome, who's worthy. Most Pharisees and Essenes thought they knew who was worthy, pretty much them. So Jesus tells a parable into all of that. designed to do what parables do, to kind of make people shake and knock them off center and make them consider the possibility that what they think right now isn't maybe true. Luke chapter 14, he tells a story about a certain man, beginning in verse 16, who was giving a big dinner. There's the thing, the big feast. Again, it's more than food and wine. This is always any table fellowship. Had symbolic kingdom, messianic connotations. He was given a big dinner, and he invited many. And some of them, especially at the beginning of this invitation, were special people. At least they thought they were special people. Important, they were A-list people, like the Pharisees and the Essenes would have thought of themselves. And all of the people that the certain person who was throwing this party invited at first had said, yeah, we will come at first. And it's amazing to me how this parable fits into what we talked about last week, how many, many people upon first hearing the message and the mission of Jesus would say, oh yeah, I will follow you wherever you go. But as Jesus began to clarify what he meant by what he said, they all, many would fall away and follow him no more. That same dynamic is in the parable. These A-list people invited say yes at first, but then these invited guests begin to kind of fall away and discover that they have better things to do than come to this certain man's party. Oh, wow, says one, verse 18. I just bought a piece of land. I need to see it. Then another, I just bought five yoke of oxen. Need to try them. Still another, I just, I'd love to come, but I just took a wife. She wants me at home. All of which tells you something about this parable and what it tells you about the people is this. They obviously weren't very impressed with the hosts. Because if they were, if this was someone they really wanted to be with, you know it's true. This parable is really very simple. If someone that you really love and think a lot of invites you to a party, I mean, you change plans to go to the party. But if you really don't want to go that much. You just kind of come up with all sorts of lame excuses. This response reveals how they felt about the host. Because you changed plans to go to someone you cared about, who you respected, who you wanted to be with. With all that in mind, I have a parable of my own to help you kind of illustrate or understand the parable Jesus is telling me here. I don't know if you know, but the Super Bowl's this week. I mean, you maybe lost this, but the Bears are in it. Vikings aren't. And I know you're not going to believe this, but truth is, I got an email this week from Lovie Smith. And Lovie Smith is the coach of the Chicago Bears, for those of you who live in a cave. Or don't care at all about football, which is entirely possible. And then the email said, Dave, Dave, you know, we're having a little party down here in Miami, and I got round-trip tickets for you, your family, and some friends. Putting you up at the Ritz with tickets to the game. In fact, we bought a luxury suite. Dave, come sit at my table. You know what I said. You know what I said. I said, Lovey, I'd love to come. But I bought a piece of land. Need to see it. You know, I just bought a car. Need to wash it. Now, you know that's not true. In fact, what you know is not true is anything I just said. None of that is true. I don't think Lovey Smith even knows me. His loss. I sounded like my daughter right there. you see this parable that Jesus is telling is a parable designed to turn the question and it reminds me it gets me back into some of the teaching we've done about Jesus as a rabbi and how young girls and boys would go to Beth Talmud remember that? that was the middle stage of education where they would not only memorize the scriptures but they would learn how to think and we talked about the rabbinic art of asking questions with questions and the use of parables and in the telling in the simple telling of a story that a child could understand. He is doing something masterful because he knows the question. Everybody's asking relative to table fellowship is who belongs, who's worthy, and he's turning the question and he's making it his because the question now, according to this parable, is not who belongs, but who wants to come. And that depends entirely on how you feel about the host and how you feel about the party. So here's my question. As you prepare to come to this table, how do you feel about the host? How do you feel about the one who's throwing this party? Because, you know, the truth is, if you don't think much of him, if you're not kind of nuts about him, if you're not a little blown away that he invited you to this party, maybe this party's not for you. And it's weird that in a talk where I'm trying to throw open wide the doors to say anyone who wants to follow this rabbi can, and anyone who wants to come to his table can. I'm also at the same time saying some of you maybe shouldn't because if you don't think much of the host, you don't belong at the table. Back to the parable. The host then says, the people I want at my table are only the ones who want to be there. It's really very simple. People who might actually be grateful for the bread and for the wine because they're hungry and they're broken. The people I want at my table are people who are coming saying, boy, could I use some grace? Oh, man, could I use some mercy? And the host says, that's who I want, people who want the meal I have. Where do I find those kind of people? Because these others who think they're all so pure are coming up with excuses and don't even want to be here, don't think much of this meal at all. So he came up with an idea and said to his servant, I know where to find people who might be grateful. Go out at once, verse 21, Luke 14. To the streets and the lanes of the city, go out into the hedges and bring in here some people who might be breathlessly grateful for this meal, the poor, the blind, the crippled, and the lame. Stop right there. This reference to the poor, crippled, blind, and lame is not random. I mean, it sounds like, you know, he's just kind of saying all these kinds of people. But you remember the Essenes? We talked about them in detail last week. They had a very specific set of qualifications for who was welcome at the Messianic table, but also at their table, and a very specific list of the kinds of people who were not welcome at the Messianic table and at their table as well. And among the people who were specifically listed as not being welcome at the table were the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame. The point is, Jesus does this on purpose. Indeed, Jesus then presses the issue. And you know, when you go out and you tell, you invite these poor, crippled, blind, and lame people who might be grateful for some bread and might be grateful for some wine and some grace and some mercy, don't just invite them, compel them. It says in verse 23, go out into the highways and along the hedges and convince them that they really are invited. Why? Because these people won't believe I really want them unless you say, yes, I do. You need to tell them I'm serious. Yes, you are welcome because nobody else will welcome them. And when they get an invitation to a lavish banquet, these people, their first instinct will be to say, you got to be kidding. You must be mistaking me with someone else who's worthy. So compel them because they won't believe the party's for them. They won't even believe it's me who's asking them. They'll think it's a trick. They'll think it's somebody pretending to be Lovie Smith. In fact, what you need to do is help that sweet one, that dear one, who didn't feel worthy to come to the table because she hadn't finished her fifth step. you need to just gently say, you can come today. Because if you need some grace today, that's who he wants at his table. So back to the question, who's welcome at the rabbi's table? Actually, anyone who wants to be there. But not all want. To be there, which ironically means, again, here I go, in this talk where I'm opening wide the door to come, what I just said means not everyone is welcome to the rabbi's table. Not all are worthy, in some sense, to come to the table, but it's just different people than what we thought. And see, I thought of two kinds of people who probably shouldn't come. And here's the deal. As I say this, it feels yucky because I want everybody to come. and so does the rabbi but there's two who shouldn't maybe one would be the kind of person who doesn't really care too much for the host if if when the rabbi says come to you you say yeah whatever um if you got a whatever in you you know maybe you should think twice about coming to this party because like the party's for people who think the rabbi is something else. And you know what? If you got a whatever, I don't even want you to stay away from the table. I want you to change your mind. But change your mind before you come to the table. Because this table is for people who are kind of nuts about the rabbi. It's another kind of person who maybe shouldn't come to the table. It's the person who doesn't like and maybe even resents the kind of people that the host has invited. You know, the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame. Because if you don't have a heart for those kind of people, they're going to be at the party because the host invited them. And if you don't like them, you're going to hate this party. Think about it this way. In the parable, I wonder if those who turned the host down with those lame excuses, I've got to go look at my land. After the party happened and they saw who actually came, I wonder if they were actually relieved that they didn't go when they discovered that poor, crippled, blind, and lame people had actually gone to the party. Oh my, you know what that means? That means that we would have been around the table with people we can't stand, with people we believe aren't worthy to be at our table. and here's the irony of this whole thing the masterful spin of the parable the simple simple story that goes deeper and deeper because if that is the spirit it's ironically that spirit that thinks the blind and poor and lame are unworthy is what makes you unworthy to come to this table in fact that's exactly what paul says in first corinthians 11 when he says, you have judged the body wrongly. Some of you are full, taking care of yourself. You let the poor just have nothing. And there's these divisions. You don't see each other for who you are. All of you needing grace. And because of that, some of you are sick, even die. What a mess you Corinthians are. Because you've forgotten the Lord's table and who he's invited. So back to the question. Who belongs at the table? Who's worthy to come? Well, actually, that's really an easy one. Nobody. I mean, you need to get that one right now. You need to get it down right now. Nobody is worthy to come to this table. But you've all been invited. But that invitation to come raises a question that speaks to the question that we've been asking all morning, who's welcome, who belongs. It's this. And ask yourself this question before you come. How do you feel about the host? How do you feel about the rabbi? Are you grateful? Are you just a little blown away that someone like him would want someone like you at his table? Well, if you are just a little blown away by that, then come and eat the bread and drink the wine. The rabbi welcomed you at his table. Oh, one more question that will help you answer the question for yourself. Do you belong at the table? It's this. How do you feel about all these other losers who are going to come to the table today? you know, these poor, crippled, blind, lame people. I don't see anybody. If you could see their heart, if you could see spiritually crippled, poor, blind, lame people. Let me ask you a question. Are you glad that they're here too? Are you glad that the people you see in this room are here with you? And some of them are desperately needing this bread and this cup and this grace and this mercy to know that they can come and be with the rabbi. If you're really good with that, if you're okay with that, in fact, it makes your heart sing that other losers like you can come, then you qualify to come. And come and eat bread and drink the wine, enjoy the party. Because to you, the rabbi says, you're welcome at my table. Achari, come, follow me. The rabbi says, come. Thank you.
