Open your Bibles with me to the book of 1 John. First chapter, beginning again this morning in the first verse. I'd like to pray as we begin. Father, I pray that by the power of your Spirit, you would give life to this Word. This is my prayer, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, that I might make known with boldness the mystery of the Gospel. I pray it in your name. Amen. Last week, by way of introduction to our study of John's first epistle, I indicated that even with a rather casual reading of the text, the entire epistle, three themes emerged quite obviously as being significant. The first was this, that God is life. Three times in the first two verses, John speaks of life. He calls it the word of life, manifested life, eternal life. He's speaking of it as a life that was from the beginning in verse 1, It was with the Father in verse 2 and then made visible to us. The second theme is that God is light. We saw that in chapter 1, verse 5. The third theme is that God is love, chapter 4, verse 8. Those last two themes we're going to spend quite a bit more time on as time progresses and we move through the epistle. But what's clear from the very beginning is that what John is most excited about relative to these three themes is that this life and light and love of God is not for him simply a distant, nebulous, philosophical concept. But that life and light and love of God, those things are in fact for him something that is indeed within the realm of human experience now. You can touch this life is what John is excited about. You can actually walk in this light and experience this love now. The life and light and love of God are all things that are knowable, touchable, accessible. Now, Jesus said all that this way in the Gospels. The kingdom of heaven is within your reach through me. In other words, Jesus is saying that you can live your human life under the reign of God. You can have that experience now. You don't have to wait to heaven to experience that. This kind of life is accessible. It is touchable. It is within your reach. Now, John says all of that this way. Chapter 1, verse 1. What was from the beginning? What we have heard and what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the word of life. This life was manifested. It was made visible and we have seen and bear witness and now proclaim to you this eternal life which was with the Father and was made visible to us. what we have seen and what we have heard is what we proclaim to you, and we're proclaiming it to you in order that you may have fellowship with us. Last week I defined that word fellowship as not just so that we get along. The word is partnership or participation. And so what he's saying there is this. The reason I'm proclaiming to you what I have seen and heard, what I have experienced and handled with my hand concerning the word of life, the reason I'm telling you that is that you can participate in it too. You can experience it as well. last week I extended to you an invitation it was an invitation to simply desire that kind of participation in the life and the light and the love of God simply to desire it you didn't have to understand it you didn't have to be able to explain it I wasn't asking if you were effectively walking in any of those things the invitation very simple at a base level was simply to desire to desire to stir up thirst for life and light and love. And if you had that desire, I promise you, that would be enough to start the journey through 1 John. The reason that would be enough is because desire is a powerful thing. For what you desire, you will pursue. You will seek. And if you seek, you will find. If you seek with all your heart. John Eldridge, in his wonderful book, I highly recommend it, entitled The Journey of Desire, says this about desire. This may come as a surprise to you, he says, but Christianity is not at the core an invitation to become a moral person. It is not a program for getting people to shape up or to reform society. It has a powerful effect upon those things, to be sure. But when transformation comes, it is always the after effect of something else, something at the level of our hearts. At its core, Christianity begins with an invitation to desire. Now, I want you to think about that because there are some who believe that to be truly Christian, you need to kill desire. They may not say those words, but their whole way of living is this. The only way you could possibly live a holy life, a circumspect life, is if you just kill all your desire. The religionists of Jesus' day and John's day would be a prime example of that. And religionists of our day would be prime examples of that as well. They would abandon desire and replace desire with knowledge and performance is the key to life. It ends up being a soul-killing kind of spirituality, a lifeless religion of duty and obligation filled with do this, don't do that, don't do this, don't go there, don't say that. And if you think about that kind of life that is embodied and defined in what you don't do, the truth is everything you don't do is stuff that a corpse could not do. Corpses don't beat their wives. Corpses don't drink. Corpses don't swear. Corpses don't lie. But they don't have life. They don't have life. Jesus frightened the religionists of his day because he came along appealing to desire. He literally tried to stir it up. He didn't try to kill it. Killing desire is not the way. To the weary, he spoke of rest and said, you know what, you can experience a different thing. I invite you to rest. I invite you to desire rest. I invite you to desire something other than what you have. To the lost, he spoke of finding their way. To a woman, Jesus met at the well, whose sexual lifestyle had given her a reputation, who was on her sixth lover when she ran into Christ. To her, he spoke of thirst. And if, you know, we hear the story, so we think, well, of course you did. If you were really there, you'd think, and you saw the woman, I think you'd think, well, thirst, don't talk to her about thirst. Her whole problem is her thirst. She needs to kill her thirst. Jesus came to her and, in effect, said, no, your thirst is good. I want to stir up your thirst. What you happen to be drinking is poison. And, dear lady, if you don't believe that it's poison, then try another lover and try another one after that. What you're drinking is poison, but I have come to stir up your thirst, and I have water that you know not of, living water. Come with your thirst and drink of me. Last week I extended an invitation to thirst, to simply desire the life and light and love of God that John is speaking of and saying that he has experienced and tasted and been drinking of. This week I want to extend an invitation, past desire, into the life itself. This morning I would like to extend an invitation into what John calls the word of life, into what he called the life that was manifested in Christ, into the eternal kind of life that is being spoken of in 1 John 1. Now, just by way of teaching and kind of wading through this stuff for our foundation of understanding, at one level, I think it's obvious when I invite you into this life, this eternal kind of life, word of life, Life made manifest in Christ. What I'm really doing is inviting you into Christ, who is the life. The life, who John says was made manifest, this eternal life that was with the Father is, you all know as you're reading the text, is Christ. Last week, in fact, I said that this eternal life is not so much a what as it is a who. It's Christ himself who is the life. 1 John 5, 11 says this, and the witness is this, that God has given us eternal life, And this life is found in his son because he is life. Now, I can just hear some of you listening to me thinking, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know all this. I learned this in Sunday school. I learned this in confirmation. I mean, this is really basic stuff. And not only that, I mean, I know the next verse. 1 John 5, 11. I know 1 John 5, 12. It says, he who has the son has life. He who has not the son does not have life. And I have this son because I made mental assent that he is the life. I kind of got the answer right on my confirmation thing. And so now I have eternal life, this package that I see, eternal life as being this commodity that I possess. I have it. I have this thing. And the reason I have it, the reason I know, is because I believe the right thing about Christ. And I do the right thing as much as I can, as often as I can. I believe the right thing and I do the right thing. Beloved, believing the right thing about Christ matters. In fact, it's going to be a major theme of 1 John. And doing the right thing matters. The whole issue of obedience is going to be another major theme in 1 John, but here's the deal. When you, by faith, step into this life that I am talking about and telling you is found in Christ, when you put your confidence in him for your life, he brings with him into your life more than a list of behaviors, more than a moral code, more than doctrinal precepts. What he brings with him is life. I wish I could say it better. Eternal life. In fact, the way I've been picturing it in my mind is a life force. He brings a life force. Why does he do that? Well, because that's his plan. No, no. Well, it is his plan. But it's not because it's his plan. It's because that's who he is. He can't possibly come into your life. You can't possibly step into his life without experiencing life. It's because it's who he is. It's not his plan. It's his identity. he is the eternal life that was with the father he is the eternal life that was made visible to us so we could see it and hear it and touch it and know it and today I am inviting you into it inviting you into an eternal kind of life that's found in Christ now just to give you some sort of outline to hang your thoughts on this morning there are two things about this eternal kind of life I'm inviting you into that I want you to know about. The first is this, that this eternal life I'm speaking of is not just a future hope. Though it does involve an eternal thing, it is not just about a future hope. It is about a present reality. I don't know if you've noticed it, but for the last couple of weeks, every time I've, or most of the times, I've mentioned this thing in verse 2 that says eternal life. I haven't just called it eternal life. I've been referring to it as an eternal kind of life. There's a reason for that. You see, I think that when most of us think of, eternal life, we think of duration. How long it is. Eternal life is eternal. And when we speak of having eternal life, generally we're speaking of something that kicks in when we die. Most of our concern around eternal life is, do I have it? Or don't I have it? Will I go to heaven when I die? Do I have the ticket? Will I make the cut? Do I know what I need to know? Have I prayed what I need to pray so that when eternity kicks in, when I die and eternity starts, that's kind of our thinking, I just need to know I'm covered. I submit to you that the eternal life that John is talking about in 1 John 1 and the eternal life that I am inviting you into this morning is not just about duration of life that kicks in when I die, but that it is in fact primarily about a quality of life, a kind of life that you can experience now. Eternal life, point number one, is not just a future hope, it is a present reality. I want you to think about this. The reason, in fact, John is so excited at the beginning of his epistle about what he has to say, and it really is clear that he's excited. I don't know if you've read some of the other epistles, but almost all of them start with some sort of greeting, some sort of identification, I'm Paul, love you, God bless you, and then he starts with his thing. He doesn't start with anything. He just kicks right in to this thing he is very, very excited about. And it's very clear that the reason he's excited is because the eternal life of God that was with the Father, that was from the beginning, is knowable. That's why he's excited. It's touchable. It's accessible. Now, I've seen it, he says. I've heard it. I've experienced it. And the reason I'm proclaiming it to you is because you can experience it too. This morning, I'm inviting you into life that can be touched, experienced, and known to an eternal kind of life that you can know now. Life to the limit now. John 10.10, Jesus says it this way, I have come that you might have, here's the word again, life and life to the full. Not just so that you know you'll go to heaven when you die. That's a result of everything that I want to bring. What I want to bring is life to you now. That leads me to the second thing. By way of just foundation laying for our understanding that we need to know about this eternal life I'm calling you to this morning. It's this. That the fullness of the experience of this eternal kind of life is stepped into and experienced as we partner with the Father. In other words, the way we experience this thing is in partnership with the Father. Find that in verse three. To read the whole verse, we've kind of spent some time on this already, John says, what we've seen, what we've heard, we proclaim to you in order that, first of all, you may have fellowship with us, you may participate and see this as well. And then he says, indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. What he's saying here is this. Again, this fellowship there is not so that you know you're just in a good place with God. The fellowship there is the word partnership. It's participation. I'm telling you this stuff so that you can know what it means to partner with the Father. The way for you to experience this stuff, the way for you to see it and handle it is to enter into this life, partnering with him for that life. In the simplest terms possible, I'll say it this way, the fullness of this eternal kind of life I'm inviting you into is entered into and experienced as we learn through a variety of means to participate with the Father, to partner with the Father, to cooperate with the Father as he desires to transform us. Now the good news about this partnership with the Father, as obscure as it might sound on the front end, the good news is this, it just isn't that hard. And the really good news is you just don't have to be that smart, which is really good news for me. Even I can do this. What does it mean to partner with the Father? What is this that I'm identifying right here as the key to experiencing this life? How do I access it? Well, as I even just kind of evaluate my own heart and look at the journey I've been on in my own faith, like a lot of other things, I think it begins with desire. You may not say these words, but the desire would, in your spirit, sound something like this. God, I need more than a ticket to heaven. I don't want to sound ungrateful. I am very grateful that I know that when I die, I'm going to heaven. But here's the truth about me, Lord. I need help for today. I need your life to help me do my life because to tell you the truth, I don't always do so good. Some of you could be up here and say, in this, I don't do so good. I'm not doing so good. My marriage is a mess. And I'm really glad I'm going to heaven. And I'm glad I have that security. I like hearing sermons that tell me I'm going to heaven. And I got the ticket. I'm glad. I'm glad. But boy, it would be really something to think that I could have life now, the kind of life that would help me with my marriage and teach me what it means to love my wife and love my husband. Boy, God, my anger. I don't even want to talk about my anger. I just know I'm going to heaven. No, my anger is out of control. I wonder if there's a kind of life that I could come to and I could partner with you in that would help me with my lust. Oh, we don't even talk about that. We just go to heaven when we die. And what about peace? Oh, I hear about peace in there. That'd be nice, a little peace, a little joy. That'd be good. I'm going to heaven when I die, but joy, I've never tasted joy. Right there in verse 4, it talks about joy being made complete. Just the thought of partnering with God, cooperating with God, participating with God in such a way that I could be able to do my life in a different way. At least it's intriguing. The question still is how? How do you partner? I've got the desire now. How do you do it? Well, the fact is there are some very simple things that can help us with this partnership. So simple, in fact, that I fear that when I say them, some of you will say, oh, that's just too simple. And you might even blow it off. I don't know if you'll do that, but I was doing that when I studied this week. The things I thought of that I do, that I think some of you do, and know maybe instinctively to do, that help you with this partnership are so simple. I thought I've got to give them something more profound. I couldn't think of anything more profound. The simple thing is the profound thing. you see there are things that we can do there are practices that we can enter into and some of us do it already and you don't even know and what they do is they help us be present to god the god who lives in us there are practices that we can do that give him access to our hearts and as we give him access to our hearts he gently changes our hearts just give him access Keith Meyer, Pastor Keith, he spoke a couple times this summer and one of the things he's very fond of saying these days and I just love this, I just love this quote. He says this, the most significant thing that we can give to God is not our money, it's not our time it's not our effort, it's not our talent. The most significant thing that you can give to God is your attention. Stop right there. I mean that's one of those things you just blow right over and you know, it's a good voice, no, just stop right there. Do you think that if you gave God your, what kind of effect do you think that would happen if he had your, just if all he had was your attention? Keep your money, keep your time, keep your talent, keep it, keep it all. Just give him your attention. You'd be transformed. You'd be transformed. I sometimes think we start doing stuff to avoid giving him our attention. Oh, there's some simple things. The one most obvious I thought of, and this is a great illustration because, you know, you should probably say it's a great illustration. I shouldn't say it's a great illustration. But this one's, I think, great because we just did it. Worship. Worship. You know, when we worship, which is something we just did, it was a practice. You come every Sunday, and we practice this every week in worship. You know what? We give God glory. We give God praise. We give God honor. It's a very good thing. You know what else you give them if you're worshiping? You give them your attention. Not always. I mean, you know, sometimes some of you are in here and you're connected and you've even had experiences yourself. You're an authentic worshiper, but you come on certain Sundays and you just couldn't get into it. I'm in three services. I worship all three times. And I'd be honest, there are certain times, all three services, I give God my attention and he's got it all three. And there are certain times where one he's got it and the other one he didn't. And blah, blah, blah, blah. But I'm telling you, I'm going to just assume that you've tasted enough of what authentic worship feels like to know what it feels like to give God your attention. And if in worship you gave God your attention, and by the way, one of the ways you can tell he doesn't have your attention is if you're critiquing the way worship is going. And the way I know that is because whenever I do that, oh, I don't like this song, it's a slow song. Oh, I don't like this song, it's a fast song. It's just rock and roll. You know what? Just give God your attention. Just give God. And you know what happens to you? I know, and it happened to some of you this morning. when you gave God your attention, what started happening to you? He started moving on you. And he started speaking to you. He started reminding you. Maybe all he reminded you of was how much he loves you, how valuable you are. And maybe he started moving on you with some conviction, stuff you've been avoiding and not even thinking about. And in the middle of worship, he got your attention and he said, Dave, that thing, yeah, stop it. That thing, yeah, yeah, go to that person and say you're sorry. I'll tell you, all you did it was for 20 minutes. And you know what it had? a transforming effect. You know why? He got your attention. Happens in prayer. I loved it. Last week or two weeks ago, Dallas Willard was with us. He talked about prayer on the weekend service and he defined it this way. Prayer is just talking to God about what we're doing together. The doing together is the partnership. You know, when he did that sermon on prayer and he said particularly that thing, all it is is talking to God about what you're doing together. I thought of many things and it went into many arenas in my life, One of the things I thought of, delightfully, was this. I can do that. I mean, I'm an idiot, but I can do that. I don't know all these complicated things, but I can talk about what I'm doing in my day. I can invite him into my life. I know what I'm doing today. I know what I'm scared about today. I can invite him into that. I know what I'm struggling with today. I know what I'm not doing real well today. I can invite him into that, to talk to God about what we're doing together. Lord, I invite you into my life, Into every aspect of my life. Here's where I'm frightened. Here's where I'm struggling. Here's where I'm happy. Here's where I bully. Here's what I have to do today. Here's who I have to meet today. Here's where I have to go today. Partner with me. Would you partner with me? Because I don't want to do this by myself. You know what? I'm learning how to do that all day long. You know what I know about me? I'm just not that disciplined. I'm not that smart. I can do that. I can do that all day long. and you know what it has? a transforming effect just give them your attention and there are practices we can enter into that give them our attention and we begin to experience in that life life this eternal kind of life that I'm inviting you into this morning is number one not just about our future hope it is a present reality And number two, the present reality is experienced, fully entered into, as we learn to partner with the Father. Okay, that's the teaching, the foundation. Now let's start to apply it. I want to ask some questions. First question is this, kind of a personal question. It might make you a little uncomfortable. It's okay, it's this. Is what I'm describing to you about this eternal kind of life something that you are experiencing? Is it something you've experienced? Have you even had a taste of it at all? Some of you have. Some of you are right now. Some of you would be more saying, I've tasted it. I want more, that kind of thing. The sad truth is, however, that many, many people who even claim to be Christians would call themselves Christians have never tasted of this kind of life I'm speaking of. We live in a country where fully 94% of the people in it say they believe in God. 74% of the people who live in this country claim to have made a personal commitment to Christ. Stop right there. Isn't that encouraging? 74% confess to a new birth experience. 74% claim to made a personal commitment. 34% a new birth experience. That's a lot of people. Let me ask you a question. Do you see that much life in this country? Reverend James Montgomery Boyce, pastor of First Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, asks this question. Why is today's church so weak? Why are we able to claim more conversions and enroll more church members than ever before but have less impact on our culture than ever before? Why are Christians indistinguishable from the rest of the world? What is going on? Mike Iaconelli, at a very discouraged time in his life, in the December issue, 1992 issue of the Wittenberg Door magazine, wrote this, and before I read it, I just want you to know, he was writing this at a very discouraged time in his life. Later on, he kind of looked at this and said, this is not what I believe, this is my discouragement, but the power of the words are that this is the effect that being in a Christian community for years and years had on him. Here's what he says. In these last four decades, my faith has truly taken a beating. Then tells about how from his conversion as a boy at 10 years of age, he always believed, and now this is the quote from him, that if I was a Christian, then people would see a marked difference in my life. And that the longer and closer I walked with God and partnered with him, the greater and more visible that difference would be. that difference is not oddness, but attractiveness. That people would be able to see something different that was appealing. Now at 50 years of age, having seen so many mentors stumble and fall, never to recover their faith, so many casualties, so many losses, I just don't believe that anymore. I still believe that Jesus changes you. But my definition of change has changed. Whatever the change is, it is not so much outward where people can see it as inward. Inward change is very important. But he's saying it's invisible. It's technical, known only to God and no one else. In other words, this eternal life we're talking about, if you have it, is something that God invisibly grants to you. If you pray the right prayer, keep the right list, affirm the right doctrine. But he won't affect your life. He won't touch your real life. And we end up with kind of a split. And some of us, you know, you wouldn't say this, but there's this, I got my spiritual life, and then there's my, you know, my real life. And they're separate. And if I were to ask you, how's your spiritual life? You probably think of how your devotions are going, or how many hours or minutes or whatever you're praying. Well, I missed a couple days of my spiritual life. And it's totally separate from, we live in a kind of a dualistic thing. if the gospel that we preach only provides for us a ticket to heaven and does not have the power to have an effect on my real life then personally I'm not talking Dave Johnson the pastor I'm just talking about me the person who's got to live my life then if that's all it is then I have a problem with that and it's not, I got a problem with that like I'm scolding you. I have a personal problem with that. Here's the problem I have with it. I need more from God than a ticket to heaven when I die. Now, God, I don't mean to sound ungrateful at all. I am very glad that I have security, that I'm going to go to heaven when I die. That's very, very good. But the truth is, I got to get up tomorrow morning, and I got to go to work, and so do you. And I have a family, and I have people I have to interchange with. I need help with my life. I need help with my real life. because I don't always do so good at my life. Glad I'm going to heaven, but I could really use some peace. I'm glad I'm going to heaven, but joy just seems so elusive to me. I'm glad I'm going to heaven, but boy, it'd be nice if there was some love in my family or my home or wisdom for raising my children or how to handle a boss who's crabby or a job that's unfulfilling. I'm glad I'm going to heaven. We're almost left with this idea of spiritual life and life with God as living the rest of our life, kind of hanging on and I hope I make it through. Then I go to heaven. It all kicks in then. Beloved, Spirit of God, just communicate this. When Jesus offers us eternal life, He is not just offering us a ticket to heaven. He is offering us his life in order that we can do life. The life that he offers us in order to do life just happens to last forever. So it is eternal. But I'm talking about an eternal kind of life that we can taste and touch and see and walk in now. And that's the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen. Eternal life, point number one. Point number one. Eternal life is not just a future hope. It's a present reality. And the fullness of that present reality is tasted as we learn in a variety of ways to partner with the Father, to do our lives with Him, just dance with Him and let Him lead. The problem, says Dallas Willard in his book Divine Conspiracy, is that many today have settled for what he calls barcode faith. I love this little situation. I'm just going to read this thing. Barcode faith. He says this. Think of barcodes now used on goods in most stores. The scanner responds only to the barcode. It really makes no difference what is in the bottle or package that bears it or whether the sticker is on the right one or not. The calculator only responds through its electronic eye to the barcode and totally disregards everything else. If the ice cream sticker is on the dog food, the dog food is ice cream, so far as the scanner knows or cares. The theology of Christian trinkets says, there is something about the Christian life that works like the barcode. Some ritual, some belief, some association with a Christian group affects God the way the barcode affects the scanner. Perhaps there has occurred a moment of mental ascent to a creed or an association entered into with a church. God scans it. Forgiveness floods forth. An appropriate amount of righteousness is shifted from Christ's account to your account in the bank of heaven and all our debts are paid. We're saved. We're saved. And we walk around saying we're saved. How do you know? Well, I prayed the prayer. I affirmed the right doctrine. I joined the right group. I got the barcode. And when I get nervous about whether I'm going to heaven, I check, oh, there it is. I prayed it. I said it. Yeah, I believe it. Okay, there it is. I have eternal life. Thank you. This is a better side right here. come on you had your chance okay you know you taking a picture was nowhere near as distracting as me okay anyway go ahead that's great me hello how on earth do i get this back what was i talking about Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A little more from Dallas Willard. The payoff for all of this comes at death when God scans the barcode of our right belief. Life now being lived has no necessary connection with being a Christian as long as the barcode does its job. Now, you hear that, and some of it, you may resonate, but some of you think it's really far-fetched. And nobody really thinks that way. I was thinking about that. And the problem for me was I had a recollection of a conversation I was in with a friend many years ago. And I'm glad it's many years ago because I don't think this way anymore. But we were talking about a mutual friend who at the time, we really cared about him, but he demonstrated no interest at all in things of the Spirit. And there was no indication in how he lived his life that he thought Jesus had the best possible information on how to do life because he was paying absolutely no attention to the way Jesus said, here's how life is lived and here's how life is lived to the fullest. He was living his life exactly the way he wanted to do it. In our conversation, we said this. Is he a Christian? We wondered, is he a Christian? Do you think he's a Christian? Of course, we concurred. He prayed the prayer. We were there at the youth rally when he walked forward. I even signed the card. I saw him sign the card. He's got the barcode. He's all set. The real question, Willard concludes, is whether God would establish a barcode type arrangement at all. If he did, it is we who are in danger, in danger of missing the fullness of life offered to us. Can we seriously believe that God would establish a plan for us that essentially bypasses the awesome needs of present human life and leaves human character untouched? Would he leave us marooned with no help from him in our kind of world, with our kind of problems? Can we believe that the essence of the Christian faith and salvation covers nothing but death and after? May it never be. And if it is, I got a problem with that. I don't have any time to scold God, but God, I got to tell you, I need more from you than a ticket to heaven. I'm glad I have a ticket to heaven. I'm very grateful. But God, dear God, I need help with my life because I don't always do so good. My real life. I could use some peace and I could use some joy. Oh, that'd be nice. The kind of peace that isn't contingent on the circumstances and the kind of joy that I could still experience maybe when all hell is breaking loose. I don't know where you are in your life, but the older you get, if nothing else cures you of thinking you can control your circumstances so that you can have peace or control your circumstances so you can have joy, if nothing else cures you of that, age will do it. I mean, some of us learn it quick, But the truth is, I think some of us are pretty capable. There's some pretty intelligent people, pretty capable people physically, emotionally, whatever way you need, intellectually. And you can control your life. You're controlling your destiny, and you've got the job you want, and you've got the wife you want, and you get people doing what you want, although you're in control. And when you're in control and you're getting what you want, you feel peace. You feel joy. But some of us aren't that intelligent, and we aren't that capable, and can't do that, and even the ones who are, just live a little longer. Just live a little longer, and after a while, you'll realize that even with all your intelligence and all your strength and all your capacity, you can't control the environment so that you always have peace, and wouldn't it be something? I mean, is it really possible that you could cooperate with God, that God would partner with me in such a way that I could actually experience peace, even though the circumstances around me, is that a real thing? I need help with my life. I would like, I'm interested in that kind of life. see when people come to Jesus with that kind of desire and say God I don't want to be you know pushy here but I need more than a ticket to heaven I need help with my life you know what Jesus responds to that with great delight and here's what he says to us he says David I want to do so much more than to get you into heaven I have come to give you life I have come to help you with your life will you partner with me in doing life. Let me wrap our thoughts together by bringing you to 1 John 3, 9. Now this verse says something on the surface that looks kind of troubling, but it's going to pull all our thoughts together, I think. It says this, no one who is born of God practices sin. That sends a shudder through me. It almost sounds like if you're born of God, you don't sin, and now I've sinned, and so I must not be born of God. I'm going to do more on this verse later. I'm not going to totally unpack it now, but the key word there is practices, to habitually, intentionally think of ways to get better and better at sin, that's what it means to practice. If you're a football player, you practice to get better and better. If you're doing things to get better and better at sin, you're not born of God. No one who's born of God does that. Why? Well, because people who are born of God have a list that says don't do that. No! That's not why people who are born of God don't practice sin. Here's why, next part of the verse, because God's seed abides in you. The word seed is very interesting. the Greek word for seed is sperma. Our word is sperm. Can't even believe I'm saying that word in the pulpit. Sperm. Kind of enjoying it actually. That's a word that's full of life. That is a life filled word. The sperma of God. What that means is this. The genetic makeup of God. The life force of God. Beloved, this eternal kind of life made manifest in Christ that John says we can touch and see, experience and know is so powerful and so real that when you receive it, when you desire it, when you ask God for it, the very life force of God, the genetic makeup of God invades you, resides in you, recreates you, and begins to transform you as you and I partner with him. And you know what he does the transformation with? He does it with life. He does it with visible life. He does it with an eternal kind of life transplanted in you, Coming now from you as we learn to cooperate and partner with God in every part of our real life. Let me explain it this way. Illustration I've used before. I've been told all my life that I look like my dad. And I do look like my dad. In addition to looking like him, I act like him as well. I have mannerisms and expressions, movements, certain sounds in my voice that, quite frankly, I'm not even aware of. And many of you probably don't even notice it. I mean, you've met my dad. Many of you have met my dad. He's been in this pulpit. But where I really hear it is every once in a while somebody from Chicago who sat under my dad's ministry for years and years and years will come and visit Open Door here for some reason. And they'll come up to me afterwards and they go, say, what's the weirdest thing, Dave? You know, I had to close my eyes a couple times. And I closed my eyes and I could just hear Bill. I could hear Bill through your voice. like his voice. And I'd open my eyes and use this gesture and just look like him. And I'm going, that's so weird. I don't want to look like my dad anyway. But the fact is this, that I sound like my dad is something I'm not even aware of. I mean, somebody else would have to spot it. I'm not up here trying to look like my dad. I've never ever done that. No, I don't have mannerisms that I go, he kind of does this thing here. I've never tried. What would Bill do? I don't do that. One of the reasons I look like my dad is because I got the life force in me. If someone, for some bizarre reason, wanted to look like my dad and act like him, I suppose they could try. My dad was a pretty cool guy. And he was in the ministry, and there were people sat under him, and sometimes there would be people who wanted to go into ministry, and he was kind of a father figure in some ways, and you kind of see him doing my dad and kind of having some of the same gestures and sound in the same way, but I always had a distinct advantage over them. I had the life force in me. They didn't ever have it. I was just way ahead of them. If the goal was to be like my dad, I was way ahead. I had the life force in me. Not only was I born of him, that I have the genetics for that, but I lived with him. I was just with him. He had access to me, and I had access to him, and I cooperated with him. Now, if he was here right now, he'd say, when? When did you do that? I'll tell you the more I think of this illustration the more it plays out as being a very parallel journey to my journey with my God and my Father in Heaven because the truth is this there were times when I resisted my human father and I thought he was the goofiest guy and I'm not going to say nothing to him and then there was another time when something happened to me and I would see my dad in a whole different light and all of a sudden he looked like the wisest man on earth and the life he was living was a life that looked pretty good to me but the truth is this even as a son as a son who had that life of my father in me even when I was pushing and pulling and pressing the truth is this in my mind my dad my dad was the man even when I in my spirit he was the man he was all that you know what my dad had most of the time I was growing up not all the time most of the time he had my attention and you know what that did to me? it formed me now you can get formed in a good way you can get formed in a bad way but he had my attention and that formed me wrap it up beloved the eternal kind of life that I am inviting you into this morning is not just a future hope it's a present right now today reality and all the fullness of that reality can be tasted as we learn in a variety of ways to partner with the Father, to cooperate with the Son, to dance with the Spirit, to do our lives, our real lives with God. And as we learn to do our lives with God over time, the family resemblance becomes uncanny. Before you know it, you're going to begin to look like him and act like him and talk like him, and you're not doing what would Bill do, what would Jesus? You're not, you're just, you've been with him. You've got the life force inside of you, and you've given him your attention, you've given access. Access to him, access to your heart, and he's begun zu shape you and change you. You're not even trying. You've just been with him for so much, for so long, that you're starting zu look like him and act like him and talk like him. Mannerisms. You even have certain mannerisms that you may not even notice, but other people do. Little things like kindness. This is almost imperceptible. You're more patient. All of a sudden, that peace thing that you thought was so elusive, this feel peace and love and joy. You know what you're experiencing? Life. Let me close with a question. Does this eternal kind of life that I'm inviting you to appeal to you at all? If it does, then here's what you need to do. Get a piece of paper on a pencil. This is very, very profound. Here's what you do. Ask for it. Just ask for it. Jesus says, ask and you will receive. Seek and you will find. knock and the door of this eternal kind of life will be opened up to you. It all begins with desire. And desire is a powerful thing. For what you desire, you will pursue. What you pursue, you will seek. And if you seek, you will find. If you seek, with all your heart. I invite you to life. just for a moment I want you to be quiet with this word just close your eyes and bow your heads just a moment of quiet be with God and tell him what you want ask for what you want from him I thank you God for life I thank you God for life eternal that we can spend eternity with you forever but I thank you that the eternal life you offer us is a life that we don't have to wait for when we die it's one we can experience right now and I thank you God that you even want to partner with us that is such good news that you want to partner with us in the things that concern us and scare us and excite us right now We invite you into our real life. And as we do, our prayer is that you would just transform us. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
