Galatians chapter 5, verse 16. In fact, let's do what we did last week and start in verse 13 to get the whole context here. For you were called to freedom, brethren, but don't turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word in the statement, you shall love your neighbor as yourself, but if you bite and devour one another, take care lest you be consumed by one another. But I say walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. For these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you before that those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. I want us to pray, but I need to confess something before we go into this. It would be a tremendous travesty in my mind if we would be talking about something like the work of the Spirit, the walking by the Spirit. And for me to preach a sermon that wouldn't be in the Spirit. I'm going through something inside of me that I don't fully understand, and I'm feeling real disconnected. And you know what? I think that it's as important for you as it is for me that this makes sense and that the Spirit of God somehow energizes this. I am right on the verge, if I didn't just bring this to you, of doing this whole thing about the Spirit in the flesh. Would you pray for me? that there would be divine energy. There are times when I feel real zippy, and you know that. You're here every week. You know that. There are times when I feel real unzippy. I feel real unzippy. And when I feel unzippy, you know what I do? I try to stir it up. And we'll just have a big flesh thing, and I don't need it, and neither do you. I pray, Father, that the power would be from you, that through the frailty of human words, your spirit would be heard and understood. In Jesus' name, amen. we know this that the text breaks down into four basic categories first of all the command verse 16 then the conflict verse 17 then the contrast in verse 18 through 23 and then the conquest in verses 24 through 26 first of all the command the command is very clear it is simply this walk by the spirit how is it that we are to live a holy life when the law has been taken away and paul is speaking of freedom living without any restraints externally he says this here's how you live holy, you walk by the Spirit. We found out that that meant a moment by moment, day by day, walking according to, by the means of, the Holy Spirit of God who I already have. We were very clear to make some distinctions. Walking by the Spirit does not mean walking with the Spirit. I don't put my hand in the hand of the man and walk along with him next to me. We sang a song a little while ago where it said that God is next to me. That's not true. I hate to violate the songs we sing, but as we were going through it, I just recognized the Spirit of God is in me. And what I am commanded to do here is to walk according to the power that He says I already have. We have said over and over again as we began to move into this text that the essence of Christianity, that which separates Christianity from every other religion and every other brand of Christianity that is false, is simply this, the indwelling Spirit. The indwelling spirit is what the prophets in the Old Testament dreamt of and prayed for and looked to. It is what Jesus promised and is what that early church experienced. It was the indwelling spirit. That is what made all the difference because that gave them the power to begin to do what they were called to do. First, second Peter one, three through four says this, his divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of him who called us for by these he has granted magnificent and precious promises that you might become partakers of the divine nature the divine nature i have god alive in me walk according to what you already have by faith the second thing we discovered though as we went through this text as we began to understand what it meant to walk by the spirit was this that i am called to walk by the spirit but there is a conflict going on. And the conflict is between the flesh and the spirit. You see, the flesh sets its desire against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. The flesh was the time defined for us in Romans chapter 7 verse 5, that which is natural. For while we were in the flesh, the flesh there means simply this, he was without God, he was in an unsaved condition, he was a natural man without the Spirit of God. Natural man is incapable of living or walking according to something he doesn't have. He doesn't have the Spirit of God in him. The natural man is incapable of walking according to something he doesn't have. Therefore, the natural man lives according to or draws on all that he does have, and that is the flesh, his own self-effort. Life for him is in the natural realm. Everything he tastes, touches, and feels, everything he possesses, that's all there is. That's life for him. We discovered the fact that when I live my life in the flesh, when I live my life according to natural principles, and everything that is life for me is what I taste, touch, feel, and possess, that when those things get threatened, I have to protect them. You see, joy for me is found in what I have. Joy for me is found in what I possess. Joy for me is found in what I can accomplish in the flesh. And when any of those little things are upset, my joy is upset, my peace is upset, and I have to take it for myself. Therefore, the works of the flesh. The conflict that is being spoken of in verse 17 is exclusively directed to the indwelt believer, one who has the Spirit of God, because though we have the Spirit of God and we are not natural people, we are not people without the Spirit of God, though we have the Holy Spirit of God living in us and the power is available to us, very often we live according to the flesh. we live our lives drawing on and walking according to principles that are totally natural we live as if that which is life for us is what we can taste, touch, feel possess, acquire do and on and on and on the desire of the flesh therefore we defined was simply this bringing me back to a position where instead of walking according to the spirit of God in me I begin to walk just like a natural man And I begin to walk according to that which is natural, that which is flesh. And life for me, even as a believer, is how much I do. Life for me becomes how much my ministry is expanding. Life for me is trying hard. We found the Apostle Paul in that very condition in Romans 7. Romans 7, he says, I try hard. That which I wish to do, that which I want to do, those are the very things I don't do. And he was trying so hard to do everything that God had commanded him to do, but he was doing it in his own power. And he was just, it would be as if he would say, I just want to be the best apostle there is. And he was trying like crazy to do it. But nothing was coming. It wasn't working. And everything he wished to do, he couldn't do. Romans 8, the victory came, and the victory was simply this. What he discovered was he wasn't trying hard enough. No, that wasn't it at all. What he discovered was a glorious truth, and that is this. He discovered that all the things that he was working and wishing and wanting to achieve in the flesh, God already did. God already did. And the warfare for him changed from striving and trying to earn something that God already did to simply resting in and believing that what God had done was enough. And he had to believe it. And then the Spirit of God began to move through him. Tremendous release. Tremendous release. So he had a command, walk by the Spirit. But we also were aware that there's a conflict going on. And as a believer, when I begin to strip away all the externals that control my behavior and begin to simply rely on the Spirit of God in me, there's a conflict. The flesh moves against the Spirit. Then we move last week to the contrast, verse 19 through 23. Last week we looked at the works of the flesh. The works of the flesh are evident, verse 19. And they are this, immorality, impurity, sensuality, and on and on. Idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying drunkenness, and carousing, and things like these. I'll say this. Whether you're a Christian or not, if you're living your life according to or drawing on the power you have in your flesh to do anything for God, then you are incapable of producing anything but this. If you are drawing on your own ability to perform, to do whatever it is that God's called you to do, you are incapable of producing anything but this. These things will be there. You say, well, I'm not drunk, and I'm not carousing, and I'm not all wrapped up in immorality and impurity. You know, one of the things that's interesting in the Greek is that these are plural things. It doesn't mean that you'll have all of these works, but one of these things somewhere along the line will be working in you if you're working in the flesh. They will be there. You are incapable of anything else. Because if life for you is anything other than Christ, if life for you is how you do, if life for you is this church, if life for you are your kids, If life for you is your job, then when those things get threatened, outbursts of anger, enmity, strife, jealousy, disputes, dissensions, all those things will begin to well up in you because life is being threatened. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace. Some things I want you to notice right now as we move into this section here, the fruit of the Spirit. We're going to spend some weeks on this. Today I'm going to take one. The fruit of the Spirit is love. We're probably going to bunch them a little bit together more as we go on. I'm not going to take each one each week. We're going to do more than that. But this week we're just going to take love. But there's some things I want you to know as we get into it. First of all, as we look at the fruit, you need to understand that these are diagnostic. These are diagnostic. If there is no love in you, if there is no joy in you, if there is no peace, if you're constantly striving, If patience is something that is absolutely not part of your character, not part of your life at all, you don't even know what the feeling feels like to be patient, kindness is something that's gone out the window, goodness isn't there, these messages are not going to be proddings to try harder to be patient, try harder to have peace, try harder to love. These aren't going to be those at all. When the fruit of the Spirit is indicated or laid at your feet, the thing that we need to grasp is that the fruit of the Spirit is diagnostic. Walk by the Spirit and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh. Walk by the Spirit and the fruit will be there. It indicates when I have a lack of love, when I have a lack of peace, when I have a lack of patience, it indicates that I am beginning to draw my life from something other than God, that I am trying to find my life in something that cannot give it. And so when I look at these things and I see these things as not being in my life, I realize I need to get back to a focused life, a yielded life in terms of the Spirit of God. Something else I want us to notice about the fruit of the Spirit. I think this is a common misconception, but many of us don't realize that this is a singular word. It says this, while there is a long list of fruits given here, One ofthe things you need to understand. Is it says this. The fruit of the Spirit is. The fruit of the Spirit is. One would think that it would say this. The fruits of the Spirit are. As if it were plural. Here are the fruits. There's one fruit it's love. There's another fruit it's joy。 There's another fruit it's peace. There's another fruit it's patience." It doesn't say that. It says the fruit of the Spirit is. It's a singular. It's a singular. It's a singular for a very good reason an awful lot of Christians look at the Christian graces. Like a supermarket fruit stand. Okay, think of that. You're walking through a fruit stand. I'm over at Cub, okay? And there's all these different fruits. And it's wonderful. And these are the Christian graces. I feel particularly loving today. And I look at the fruit of the Spirit. And I walk through that little list. And I come to love first. And I feel particularly loving today. So I pick up this nice loving orange. It's wonderful. Or maybe today you don't feel terribly loving. But you feel very joyful. Joyful. So you go and you pick up a nice joyful plum. It's wonderful. But if you don't feel terribly like having an orange. but you just feel like having a plum. You don't worry about love today. You just go for the joy. It's wonderful. You just kind of pick what you got, pick what you feel. You kind of go along the fruit stand and pick whatever you want. Maybe some of you are particularly disciplined and self-controlled in terms of your personality. So you're really high on self-control. You're really high on self-discipline. So you go for the pineapples every time and you leave the love away and you leave the joy alone and you don't go for anything else. You just kind of pick whatever you have. What we need to know is when we talk about the fruit of the Spirit, we're not talking about personality characteristics. We're not talking about personality quirks. It just so happens that the general flow of my life is that I'm a pretty loving character. I am. I am. It's just the way I get along with people pretty well. It also happens to be that the general flow of my life is I'm a pretty joyful person. But, you know what? There's an awful lot of ways in which I realize that there are ways in which I stir that up in me. I just get tired of feeling lousy, so I'll go start dancing around and act silly. And I go, ho, ho, get everybody to laugh around me and everybody feels better. That's not necessarily a fruit of the Spirit. I'll tell you something else that's a part of my characteristic, and that is this. I lack patience like crazy. Patience is not a part of my personality. Peace is another one that doesn't come easy. So what I do is I go for the love and I go for the joy and peace and anxiety. I reserve the right to worry and I reserve the right to have anxiety and call the things that I see in my life the fruit of the Spirit. What we're talking about when we talk about the fruit of the Spirit is a quality of life, is an overall quality of life that is mine if I'm living my life according to, drawing my life from the Holy Spirit of God and nothing else. We talked a few weeks ago about how the joy is stolen. I shared with you from my own heart concerning how even the ministry here began to take an elevated position in my life. And all of a sudden, life for me was the church. And all of a sudden, life for me was how many people were here. And all of a sudden, life for me was how we were growing. And all of a sudden, when those little things that became life for me got threatened, all the joy was just sapped right out of me. I was even struggling as I was coming into the pulpit, wondering if the reason I'm feeling a little lack of peace is because life for me is preaching a good sermon, you know? And if you don't do really good, then, you know, what is life? It's real subtle. It's real subtle. The fruit of the Spirit, it just stares me in the face when there is no peace. It says, David, don't try to have peace. you're not drawing your life from God and God alone something else has taken my place because if you're walking by the Spirit if life for you is me the peace will be there the joy will be there the love will be there the glory of the Spirit walk is not that by nature I am patient the glory of the Spirit walk is that I have patience even though it's not my nature and I think if we don't understand that at the very beginning we're going to feel very comfortable counterfeiting this fruit of the spirit and not knowing it I can't claim a work of the spirit in my life if having a loving disposition I reserve the right to be anxious and worried all the time never mentioning the fact or indicating that life drawn from the spirit also produces not only love and not only joy but peace as well some people work like mad Some people work like mad and they're just so big on self-control and discipline and the problem for them is very often they have very little joy. They have very little joy. I want to tell you something. You need to be confronted by the Spirit of God this morning if you are one of those people who are really disciplined and really self-controlled and it's all right there and it's all just perfectly organized but there is no joy and there is no peace. You need to be confronted by the Spirit. The work of the Spirit, the walk of the Spirit, The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, all of those things as one. The fruit of the Spirit, if I could say it just in a sentence, is an all-round quality of life that evidences the reality of God's power in me because I'm walking according to, I'm drawing my life from the Spirit of God and nothing else. With that in mind, let's look at the fruit. We're going to look at love today. That's the only one we're going to have time for. Four things I want to look at real quickly. First of all, I want to define it, because that needs to be done, because I think we counterfeit love all the time, just like we counterfeit all the fruit of the Spirit. I want to look at an example. I want to look at the command to love, which is really going to get under our skin a little bit, and then the source. How do I do it? First of all, a definition. The reason I want to define this and define it clearly is because just like anything else, love can be counterfeited. It is something that every one of us are aware of, and when I say it, you'll see it in yourself. I see it in me. It bothers me like crazy. I expose myself to myself when I say things like this. But very often, that which even in my own life I call love isn't love at all. Love is a giving thing. Very often the things I do that externally look very loving are really a taking thing. The reason I act nice to you, the reason I do nice things for you, the reason I give you a big smile, you know, the reason I put my arm around you is basically because I want to have something from you. I do that with my wife. My wife, this week as I was going through this, I sat down with her and talked to her about the difference in terms of what real love is and what a work of the Spirit is in our marriage and what the kinds of things I would do for her that really have an incredibly tight string. And you see, if that thing isn't kind of given back to me, then all those nice things I did, I just get resentful and angry. Very often our expressions of love are born out, not of love, born not out of a work of the Spirit, but born out of some desperate need to be loved, so I do all sorts of things. And if it isn't returned in equal measure, all sorts of tension. Or I play the martyr. Have you ever played the martyr? I do so many things for you. Play the martyr. Can develop all sorts of sick dependencies. Some of the problem in catching the glory of what love here is is that we have a lot of misunderstanding. Love is just throwing around that word. One of the problems in preaching on love is that it's overdone. I mean, even from the pulpit, we just talk about that all the time, and people just kind of click it off. I'm too familiar with it. But the thing about love is that we use it different ways, and we use it in different circumstances different ways, and we use it with different people, and it means different things. I can stand before you and say this, I love my wife. Do you know what that means? But see, the thing is, I love spaghetti too. I love spaghetti. I love my wife. I love spaghetti. I love football. I love Cracker Jacks. I love grass. I love my kids. But you know what? I think that you are able, maybe, to make a little transfer. He means something different every time he says it. When he talks about his love for his wife, there is a certain kind of love that a husband has for a wife that is different for the kind of love the husband has for her spaghetti. Right? And there is a different kind of love that he has for football and for his kids. I can illustrate that very well. If I'm watching football, for instance, and there's 25 seconds left to go, and the Vikings are down by four points, so they need a touchdown to score, and there's only just a few seconds left, and they've only got another play to go, and my wife falls on the street and breaks her leg and she starts crying in pain, I leave the football game and go see her, right? No, your love, it's a different kind of love, you know? lots of different kinds of love we mean different things lots of misunderstandings because of the secular word world and the way the secular world uses that word you ever go to a bookstore i love going to bookstores and you have these little coffee cups you have these little pithy sayings and and there's all these little sweet pastel colors on all the coffee mugs and these little plaques and you kind of go through the plaques and they have these love is plaques you know love is a warm puppy most of the time these things are so saccharine they just make you sick you know I go there for a joke you know love is a warm puppy oh isn't that profound love is an itch here's a good one love is an itch you cannot scratch isn't that beautiful here's the one it just I hope you have a bag. Love is never having to say or sorry. Remember that one? So I get this idea, you know, love is a warm puppy. The fruit of the spirit is a warm puppy, right? No, that's obviously wrong. We get all sorts of influences. I was listening to a song, Warren Jones keeps me abreast of all the popular songs. He's our janitor and he brings his big box of tape recordings with him, you know, and he plays them. He doesn't think I hear. I hear. And I just get all, I get caught up with all what the kids are listening to. There's this one song, popular lyrics, profound, brings you right down to the foundation of living. How did we fall in love? How did we get in a mess like this? How did we fall in love? What are we going to tell our friends? Yeah, that's wonderful. That's really helpful. It helps me come to grips with what love is. It's superb. Now, I really understand love. Love is something you fall in. And when you fall in it, it's a mess. And it's such a mess, you get so embarrassed, you won't tell your friends. The fruit of the Spirit is love. The fruit of the Spirit is love. But what is love? What is that? Okay? The next thing the pastor does after he tells the funny stories, and everybody laughs and knows that there's differences between love, Now we go to the scriptural understandings and the scriptural uses of love. And you're about ready to turn that off too because you've heard that a million times. There's different words for love, right? Eros, phileo, and agape. I want you to open your heart to this and maybe see some things you've never seen before. You know what eros love is. I'm not going to go deeply into this, not because I'm afraid of it, but because we're going to be starting a series in Proverbs on eros love. And it is very appropriate in certain kinds of situations. That is, in the confines of marriage. Wonderful expression between a man and a woman. A gift from God. Eros love, erotic love, sexual love. With the right restrictions is tremendously fulfilling and joyful. The second kind of love. So we know about that. Basically, it is egotistic. It's about getting my needs met. Phileo love is the second love. We're familiar with this one as well. Phileo love is fundamentally friendship kinds of love. relationship kind of love. It's that of an acquaintance. It incorporates romantic feelings. It incorporates sentimental feelings. Warm and gooey things. Don't you love those? I loved it when I spoke at camp this last summer and watched all the phileo going on around me. It was incredible. It was incredible. All the warm and gooey things. Wonderful things. Have you ever seen that? Boy meets girl. That's phileo love. Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. Incredible thing about phileo is this, that it is based on mutual feelings. mutual gratification mutual agreement it is based on it is dependent on phileo it is dependent on us feeling the same way if you like me I'll like you if you like me a lot I'll like you a lot and that's just the way the relationship goes boy meets girl girl meets boy boy says the girl I like you she goes I like you I like you a lot I like you a lot I like you a real lot I like you a real lot I love you I love you on and on and on it just gets better and better and better and they always agree and they always like each other and everything's wonderful. They like the same colors. They like the same flavors. They like to go to the same places. It's great. And it escalates tremendously fast. The problem is this. Because it's based on a mutual agreement, it de-escalates just as fast. And as soon as we disagree, all of that lovey-dovey stuff goes right down the tubes. It is dependent on mutual agreement. One of the problems with phileo love is this. Phileo love, by the way, is a wonderful expression. It can be very deep between friends. The problem is this, that very often the unity of many churches is based on phileo love. You know, the feeling of emotion, the feeling of warmth that you have with another human being, there is nothing wrong with that. But very often, if our unity as a church is based on a mutualistic kind of thing, totally mutualistic, that we always see things the same way, that we always say it the same way, that we always look the same way, that we always act and talk the same way, then our uterine is based on all these mutual things. It's great. Very often people come to our church, and they visit, and they walk around, and it's warm and affectionate, and they feel this love, and they say to me, and they say to other people, Oh, Open Door is such a loving church. It's such a warm church. It is. And that's a good thing. The Word of God says, Let brotherly love continue. I believe that is even a work of the Spirit. The problem is this, is if our unity is based on always agreeing and always seeing it the same way, that means my love has strings. I'll be warm and affectionate toward you as long as we agree. As long as you see it my way. As long as things are going the way I want them to go. And as soon as there is a disagreement, you want to find out if our love is mutualistic, is dependent upon mutual agreement, then disagree. you'll find out real fast how deep that affection really goes just have a different perspective and you'll find out really fast I'm afraid that some people's relationship with God is even based to some degree on a philetto love a dependency that is always being returned their love very often is sentimental basically romantic they play soft music and it puts them in a mellow mood you know it's great I love to be in a mellow mood I love soft music There's nothing wrong with that. And I love to even get into a spirit that is really sentimental when it comes to my relationship with the Lord. But very often, if our love for the Lord is basically a mutualistic thing, then when something goes wrong, or I have a question that isn't answered, or my job isn't secure, or my wife isn't happy, or the kids don't seem safe, that commitment I had, whatever it was, just goes right out the window. Because when the questions came, the mellow music and the sentimental attitude wasn't enough to shout out the pain that I was feeling. Eros and phileo love are good, they're fine. But they are not the fruit of the Spirit, necessarily. They are not the fruit of the Spirit that's being spoken of here. The fruit of the Spirit here is agape love. Again, you're ready to turn that off. You've heard it a million times. I think we've got some real perversions in terms of our understanding of what agape love is. Let me explain what I mean. Agape love is most of the time defined for us and for me, and I have dealt with it on this level this way. Agape love is the supreme love. It is the love of God for the world. It is the love of Christ for the believer. It is a quality of self-sacrifice. You've heard that, haven't you? It is a quality of self-sacrifice. It is what I do for you when you don't like me, and I just do it anyway. It is not so much... Here's the one I've heard all the time. Agape love is not so much an emotion as it is a decision that I make. I decide to love you. I decide to love you. I decide not to feel an emotion, but I decide to put your interests in front of my interests. You know what? That definition, there's nothing wrong with that definition. That definition technically is correct. I just don't think it's enough. I think it's given us a wrong impression. Maybe it hasn't given us a wrong impression, but it has given me a wrong impression. I want to tell you what I mean. Just picture this. My understanding of agape is such that if my wife came up to me this afternoon and looked at me in the eye and kind of stood across the room and said, Dave, I want you to know I love you with agape love. You know what my response would be? This just indicates how perverted my understanding of agape is. I go, what did I do wrong? What do you mean? Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me? Because agape love has become that kind of love that is kind of sterile. I don't like you. I don't really like you at all. I don't have anything in common with you. I don't have any affection for you. But because agape rises above that and does nice things for you, I will do nice things for you. And David, you're a jerk. And I don't like you, but I agape you. I agape you. That means I'm going to stay with you. And I'm going to cook your dinners. And I'm going to help you with the kids. And I'm going to stay in the house. And it just warms my heart. Just blesses me like crazy. And then I've heard the illustration. And it comes like this. You know, that's the kind of love that Jesus has for us. John 3, 16. God so loved the world. God so agape, the world. Doesn't mean he liked the world. I understand that. It doesn't say God liked the world so much he sent his son. It says he loved the world. He made a decision to love. I want you to know something, however. The love that God has for the world, the love that God has for you, the love that sent Christ to the cross, is not somehow detached from emotion. It is not some sort of thing where he goes and he goes, I really don't like you. You really just make me sick. I don't like anything about you, but because I'm such a good guy, I'm going to go to the cross. That is not the fullness of agape. The fullness of agape is this, that Jesus, God, loved us, and emotion was there, and he went to the cross. The essence of agape love is this, he gave and he gave and he gave, and he felt emotion, and he felt warmth, but he didn't expect anything in return. That's the essence of agape. I want to tell you something that is a love that only the spirit can produce in me because that's not in me I can fake that other kind of agape you got that how I perverted the meaning of agape I can fake that I can look at some of you and have something stir in me that I just don't like you I just don't like you you rub me the wrong way but because pastor talked about agape and it's selfless self-sacrifice I will do something in your direction that is loving a loving act I will do for you okay I will come and shake your hand and smile inside. I'm going nuts. You know, make me sick. I don't like you at all. But I'll do this living act. There's no blessing in that. That is, I think, flesh love. That is flesh love. That is some external performance that I am putting on for you to convince you that I am able to rise above. Some of your marriages are based on that. You kind of have this spiritual thing that you kind of put up with your husband and you call it agape. Or you put up with your wife and you call it agape. Agape love is a real warm affection. It is a deep love that gives and gives, knowing that it may not be returned. Jesus went to the cross with that. Romans 5, 7 and 8 says this. For a righteous man, one would hardly die. For a good man, one might even consider dying. But God demonstrated his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. God demonstrated his love. What did that mean? What did that mean? That meant tremendous emotion. that meant a brotherly, caring kind of thing that results when I respond to his gift in Abba-Father relationships. But he gave with no strings. He gave saying, I'm going to love you and I'm going to care for you and it's going to be an emotional thing but if you don't return it, I'm still going to give it. If you don't return it, I'm still going to give it. The only way you can do that kind of love, the only way you can extend that kind of love is if life for you is Christ. If life for you is what my wife gives back to me, then I can't do that love. If life for me is what people think of me, then I can't give that kind of love. There's no way. Because basically life for me, when I'm living it in the flesh, life for me is self-gratification. So everything I do that looks like love is ready to get. Everything. Everything I do that really looks like love is ready to get if it's in the flesh. I see that in me all the time. I see that in some of my relationships with you from time to time I see that in my relationship with my wife I said before, we sat down this week and I talked about, and I tried to get out a little bit some of the feelings I have of the things I do even around the house with my wife that really are designed to get her to do something back for me and you know what it does in me? let me just share, this is again a little testimony it's hard to describe these concepts they come to fruit when I just tell you how I deal with them when I have some expression of love for my wife that's got a string whether I'm even I'm not even always aware of it I don't go aha I've got this plan I'm going to get my wife to do something I want I don't come in the door that way it just begins to be the way I live you know life for me is happy home what happens to me is when I when I find out I've got a string on the nice thing I'm doing for my wife I find out this way when it isn't reciprocated I have an incredible turning inside of me it's just she didn't give it back she's not responding oh my goodness it's ruined in the evening. All that stuff I did, that flower I bought, what a waste of money. I'll tell you something. You had strings all over that flower, didn't you? You had strings all over that little bouquet. All over that good attitude you walked in the door with. You had strings all over it. It was totally dependent on her going, oh, swooning in my arms and going, ha ha, let's go. You know, it's all sorts of strings. Now you know a little too much about me. But you know what? It is not freedom. It is not freedom. It is bondage because I'm in bondage to that person responding and giving it back. If life for me is Christ, I can give and I can give and I can give and it doesn't matter if it's brought back. I want to tell you something. No, that is beyond me to do. The example, this is going to make it even more overwhelming when I consider the fact that this is a commandment. Love each other. The example, Jesus when he went to the cross, God so loved the world that I already gave you that. his love was not detached from emotion he loved me and he loved me in a condition that he loved me at a time when I wasn't responding to him and even now when I disobey him the love is still there and it isn't with strings the example would be Christ the command that's another thing I want to nail you with we see the definition we see the example the example is Christ you could go all through scripture to find that The command is something I just want to lay on you. A new commandment I give to you that you love one another. Do it. Do it. Thou shalt. Thou shalt. Command. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul, and mind. And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Three people. Love the Lord thy God. Do it. Command. Love your neighbor as yourself. Three things. My neighbor, my God, and myself. I got to love. Got to do it. Okay, I'll try hard. Here's another one. Love your enemies. Give to them without strings. Give to them. Make movements of reconciliation to them without the strings of them saying, okay, we'll have peace now. That is not in me. In the flesh. The final question is this. How do you do that? How do you do that? What is the source for that kind of love? The answer is obvious. The Holy Spirit. You've been saying it for three weeks. The fruit of the Spirit is love. The fruit of the Spirit is love. If you're walking by the Spirit, you won't have any problems with love. It'll just be there. I want to add some things here, and I hope this will help you come to grips with some things right now, real quick. There are kind of two kinds of people that approach these texts, and we approach them two different ways. There's one person who looks at the work of the Spirit and just kind of says, well, the Spirit's going to move on me, and when the Spirit moves on me, I'll do what He wants me to do, and if He doesn't move, then I'm not going to do it, and it's great. You can't strive, and you can't work to do any of these kinds of things. you've always heard I'm sure the illustration of the fruit tree have you ever seen a fruit tree producing fruit he sits there going you know and an apple comes you know no it doesn't happen you know you just sit there and a fruit tree if it's an apple tree it gets an apple right just happens and so we get people responding to that wonderful illustration that it has truth in it okay there is truth in it and so we respond to that by sitting in a corner and I look back there at Wilbur Jacobs and he's sitting in a corner all by himself you poor guy and I say well but what are you doing nothing there motionless just moving there and you go I'm producing the fruit of the spirit and if it isn't there it isn't there I'm just waiting for the spirit to come and he's going to work for me and this love is going to come out it hasn't happened yet but I'm waiting I'm waiting and it'll hit me kind of floaty people you know they just kind of float it's great they sing mellow songs again they wave like fruit trees in the wind you know it's great we call them the laid-back brethren hang loose. Just kind of wait for it to happen. I'm going to leave it all to the Lord. I'm going to leave it all to Him. The problem is very often these kind of people who just wait for it to kind of hit them and it'll come and I don't know what. If love isn't there then maybe the Spirit doesn't want me to love that person. The problem is this, that they leave to Him what God left to them. Meanwhile, there's another kind of person. In the business administration offices of our land, there's another type. and he says things like this you don't just float give me a break you don't just float you got to get some discipline in your life you got to get some organization in your life you got to get up in the morning you got to get out your Bible you got to get out your notebook you got to open it up and you got to do it you got to work and you check, check, check and you check, check, check and you really do it and you may not know this you may not be aware of this but the people who are real disciplined and orderly and they structure their life and they manage the work of God with all sorts of growth principles they get real upset with this. They just get real upset with it. I know, it's hard to believe, isn't it? And you know this guy who floats along a little bit and just kind of waits for the Spirit to hit him with something and if he does, he doesn't. If he doesn't, he doesn't. He gets all upset with that disciplined guy. Calls it the flesh. He's fleshy. He's fleshy. He's doing it in the flesh. He's just all wrapped up. I got some good news for you. Some great and glorious news. They're both wrong. They're both wrong. and the problem is they're both partly right they're both partly right you see the love that is being spoken of here that is produced by the spirit is not a love that is somehow separate from my will it is not somehow detached from me don't tell them there is no way that God is going to love you through me without getting me involved you know I love you in the Lord but I hate your guts that kind of thing God is not going to love you through me without me getting involved by an act of my will somehow saying Lord this is a need I have in my life your spirit is in me produce that it is not going to happen without me being involved in some way but we need to also understand that that love is not going to be produced by your striving and trying and working going to some seminar and learning about what love really is and then I'll have it good illustration of this and I close with this I can tell you everything I know about courage in about five minutes all my life I've been blessed with friends who knew about cars. And they'd come and help me. In college, it was a guy named Steve Swenson. He was a whiz with a car. And this one morning, my car, there were many mornings like this, but my car wasn't starting and I couldn't get it going for anything. It just wouldn't work. And he got tremendous delight from making me do things that were absolutely laughable because I didn't know any better. He would just tell me to do things. He'd give me the screwdriver and the car wouldn't start and he said, here, take this screwdriver. So I took the screwdriver and I held it and he said, put it here. And I put it in there and he says, no, put it down there. So I put it down there and I touched this thing he told me to touch. And I had an experience. Some of you think I've already had this experience and you're right. Some of you have wondered if I needed that experience and you were praying for me that I would. Well, I have. I had it in college, you see. It started down to my toes. It began to work its way up through my body and it appeared on my head as tongues of fire. And I spoke with an unknown tongue. Ooh, ow, ooh. It was great. And he said, it's your fuel. I said, what? What do you mean it's my fuel? He said, it's not your spark. You see, if God won't start, it's either your spark or your fuel. It isn't your spark. You know what? Waiting for the Spirit to kind of spontaneously combust, somehow spontaneously produce love in me is like living my life with gas and not spark, and no spark. Somewhere along the line, there needs to be a surrender of my will that recognizes in me a lack of love, that recognizes in me that though I am under grace, there's a command before me, and that is this. Love your neighbor as yourself. Love. The fruit of the Spirit is love. And there needs to be a surrendering in my will. The spark of my will ignites with the gasoline the power of God to produce the movement. But I want to tell you something else. Cranking it out constantly, trying to do it right, trying hard is like trying to run a car with spark and no gas. You're not going to get very far. Your battery is going to get run down. It is not either or. It is not just the Spirit. It is not just me. It is both and. Which is it for you? By nature. I think there are dispositions that lean one way or the other I do which is it for you are you a disciplined striving intense worried trying hard to obey person worried all about your inadequacy and sinfulness and shame always repenting and never feeling free well stop it start believing God for who you are and get some fuel into your spark because you're going to burn out if you don't and if you're that laid back variety waiting for love and joy and peace to kind of fall on you you need to see that you need to add some fuel to that and realize that God has called you to love and by an act of your will you say Lord Jesus you're in me begin to produce that in me Thank you.
