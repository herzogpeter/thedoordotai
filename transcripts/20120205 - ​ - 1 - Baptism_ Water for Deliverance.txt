Let's pray as we go to the ministry of the word this morning. Lord, I thank you for the work of your Spirit, the moving of your Spirit among us already in the context of worship. We've used it already to open our hearts to you and the things you have planned for us, for that work to continue, I pray, through the Word and use it, God, I pray, by the activation of your Spirit to prepare us for coming to the table and coming to the cross and coming to the prayer team in just a few moments for prayer. And I pray it in your name. Amen. Well, before I get to the Word this morning, I have a brief announcement to make that is actually designed and it's going to bring us and to and prepare us for the Word this morning and for our coming to the table and for our coming to the cross and to the prayer team people for prayer. Because on March 11th, just a few short weeks from now, we're going to have a baptism service here at Open Door immediately following the 11 o'clock service on that weekend. And it's a service that we think is really important. This baptism thing we think is really important in a community of faith like ours. And if you're interested in being baptized on that weekend, you can register a couple of ways. You can get a hold of Al Shuck or Julia Shermers. You can also register online if you'd like to participate. But in planning an event and thinking about that coming up, we're kind of aware that a lot of people may not know why a weekend like that, an event like that is really important or what it fully means. this baptism thing. So Dave, I was asked a couple of weeks ago, actually, would you be willing to do what Steve Weins did last year around this time on a weekend like this when he brought a teaching on baptism designed to help us understand why this baptism thing is so important and what it actually means. So we'll understand what we're doing, actually, when we enter into these things. I said, okay, which is why I want you to open your Bibles with me this morning, if you have them, not to Colossians 3, which is where we've been, but to Exodus 14. On this weekend, on this Sunday, where we are going to deal with a story in the life of God's people that may be among the most commonly known stories in all of Scripture, the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt from Pharaoh and they're crossing through the Red Sea into a different kind of life, no longer slaves as they cross through this sea on dry land. They are now free, not just redeemed. That happened when they left Egypt. When they cross the Red Sea, they are delivered from something else, from something more, which makes this talk this morning much more than a teaching about baptism. And I want you to enter into this. It's a teaching, actually, on deliverance. Even more than that, it's a teaching that kind of evolved for me, and I didn't even see it until I kind of got into this. This is a teaching on, actually, spiritual warfare and the conflict that is involved when deliverance is possible. And all of that I'm trusting God will use to prepare us for our coming to the table and our coming to the cross and are coming to the prayer team, people, for prayer. And all of it begins with these words. In Exodus 14, verse 1, now the Lord spoke to Moses saying this, tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp before Pihaharoth, word I practice saying all week long, between Migdal and the sea, and you shall camp in front of Beelzefah opposite it by the sea. For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, and he will say this in a mocking way, they're never going to get free. They're wandering aimlessly in the land and the wilderness has shut them up. They will never be free. Thus I will harden Pharaoh's heart and he will chase after them and I will be honored actually through Pharaoh and all his army and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. And they did know that. And the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people and they said, what is this thing we have done? We have let Israel go from serving us. That's a bad idea. We want them back. So he made his chariot ready and took his people, all his people with them. Verse nine, then the Egyptians chased after them with all the horses and all the chariots of Pharaoh. That's significant. His horsemen and his army, they, and they overtook them camping by the sea beside Biharath, in front of Beelzefah, and as Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel looked, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they became frightened. So the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord, verse 13. But Moses said to the people, very significant thing, don't be afraid. Do not fear. Stand by and see. Literally, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you do see today, and you feel their presence, and you're scared to death, you will never see them again forever. For the Lord will fight for you while you keep silence. Then the Lord said to Moses, while you're crying to me, tell the sons of Israel to move, go forward. And as for you, Moses, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. And the sons of Israel will go through in the midst of the sea on dry land. Verse 21, then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord swept back the sea, the sea back by a strong east wind all night and turned the sea into dry land. So the waters were divided and the sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on dry land, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right and on their left, a pretty scary sight. Then the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all of Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen, went in after them into the midst of the sea. And it came about at the morning watch that the Lord looked down on the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and brought the army of the Egyptians into confusion. He caused their chariot wheels to swerve, and he made them drive with difficulty. So the Egyptians said, let us flee from Israel, from this place, for the Lord is fighting for them against us. And the Lord said to Moses, stretch out your hand over the seas, so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen, and the waters returned. And covered the chariots and the horsemen, even Pharaoh's entire army that had gone into the sea after them, not even one of them remains. A powerful story, actually multi-layered in its meaning that speaks to and reveals the power of God to, among other things, not only redeem the people of God from Egypt, but also, and this is the picture, when they left Egypt, they were redeemed, but this is a picture of God's power to continually deliver his people from things that even after they've been redeemed, which is the symbolic meaning of leaving Egypt, even after they've been redeemed, would continue to hound them, intimidate them, threaten to enslave them all over. Again, I'm talking about recurring things. And as I say that word, some of you know exactly what I'm talking about because you know about in your own life recurring things. you've tried to cope with them in a variety of ways and for a while you thought you were free especially when you kind of got redeemed when you kind of left egypt it felt like you were free from your fear was amazing it was gone and your anger you were free from your lust and your anxiety your bitterness that addiction but then like pharaoh some of those things came roaring back because they wanted you back. You tried to run. You tried to hide. Lots of discipline, trying hard, even some therapy, all of it good, but none of it seems to work, at least not for long, so that now you, we, like the people of God in Exodus 14, are backed up against a wall that nothing short of the supernatural power of God to part the Red Sea and make a way for you to make a way for us will have the power to set you free from that which pursues you, intimidates you, and threatens to enslave you all over again, all of which is kind of embodied in this picture of Pharaoh coming after them again. So the story of God's people, get this, on the shores of the Red Sea, about to cross the Red Sea, is a story of, among other things, deliverance. And the conflict that is involved, I would call it spiritual warfare, that is involved in that deliverance actually happening. It's a picture also of a people coming to the end of themselves. If God doesn't do something miraculous, we have no hope. It's a picture also of that time in your life or maybe times in your life where you need to decide to separate yourself from your old life, the kind of life that came with your life in Egypt by walking through these waters that cleanse you, less the imagery to baptism, but ultimately waters that deliver you from an old life. But you need to decide at some point. Am I going to walk through these waters? Am I going to follow that way? Do I cross over into a different kind of life? But to decide that, you'd need to desire that. You'd have to want to actually be free from those things that still enslave you. Now, the imagery of water here as embodied in the Red Sea is significant, and it's where kind of the imagery of baptism comes from because Moses and the people are going to be delivered through water, and it's actually a picture of baptism. The Apostle Paul says that very thing in 1 Corinthians 10, verse 2, when he says that as these people were passing through the sea, they were being baptized in the sea. And water, by the way, has interesting imagery in the Old Testament. The ancients looked at water in a number of ways, but one of the ways they looked at it was that it was a picture of danger and death. They even referred to it as the abyss. And there weren't many more frightening places to go than into the abyss. So this imagery of going toward and through this thing that usually symbolizes danger and death to be delivered through that is a picture of being delivered from danger, being delivered from death. So this scene here of the people crossing the Red Sea is kind of a picture of baptism, or what baptism is a picture of, which not only sheds a little bit of light on this story, but that dynamic sheds a little bit of light on baptism as well, as to what baptism actually means, what we're entering into, what we're saying when we say, yes, I want to go into this water and come out alive. Because most of us see baptism, and we see it rightly this way, as a powerful picture and a powerful symbol of what happens to us when we became redeemed. And at one level, that's exactly what baptism is, that I went from death to life. We say it here a lot of times that we were more than sinners who needed forgiveness. We were dead in our sins. We were dead people who needed a resurrection. And baptism is a symbol of that. It's a picture of that. It kind of helps us enter into that. And when we get baptized, we're saying, that's what I know happened to me. When I said yes to God, I came from death, which is what it feels like when you're under the water. And I've said this many times, if I put you in the water and leave you there, you die. But when we pull you up, it's a symbol that you have been raised to newness of life, alive. But now, with this story here, Exodus 14, it's that and more than that. Because baptism, as we connect it up to this story, is also a statement. It's as if you're saying when you get baptized? This. I was dead and now alive, but now alive, what I see this baptism meaning for me is this. I'm saying, not only am I alive, but I don't want to go back to my old way of life symbolized in the life of Egypt. Indeed, I want to be delivered from the things to which I was enslaved, like anger and lust, forgiveness and pride, not just alive, I want to be free. But to ever actually experience freedom, it's going to take more than getting dunked in water. I mean, that's a symbol of something important. You have to decide to walk through that water, to follow that way, to cross over into that kind of life. But to ever decide that, you'd have to want that, which begs this question. do you want to be free from the things that enslave you like anger and lusts unforgiveness and pride do you want to walk through that water follow that way that Jesus way cross over into that kind of life which is precisely the question that the people of Israel were having to answer on the shores of the Red Sea, even after the water parted, do you really want to go there? Do you want to be delivered? Really? Which actually is also precisely the same question that some of you and we are having to answer too, which makes this story a story that's a lot about a lot more than baptism, it's about deliverance. And it's about the warfare that is involved when people get set free. Now, to help you think about that and kind of sort all that out and maybe help you identify where you are in this story of Exodus 14, let me give you three elements of this story that I think will be helpful, maybe even liberating as we go to the table and go to the cross and in a few moments come to the prayer team people for prayer. But again, know this. It's not just about baptism anymore. This is about the battle for you and for me. We're all in this. Three elements of this battle. First thing you need to know is this. The pursuit of the enemy, as embodied in Pharaoh in this story, is real. Indeed, what I would say to you is this dynamic of Pharaoh wanting you back, the enemy wanting you back, You can count on the pursuit of the enemy toward you. That's something we talk about a lot. It sounds a little scary, actually. We need to talk about it from time to time because it's real. When I was a kid, I heard this little phrase growing up, this little ditty that was actually quite comforting and sweet, and it was this. God loves you, Dave, and has a wonderful plan for your life. Filled me with great hope that I would never have a problem. him. Here's a flash for you. God does love you, but Satan hates you and would love to destroy your life. Satan hates your life. He hates your joy. He hates your peace. He hates your marriage. He hates it when you repent, because when you repent, in turn, you become even more alive, thus dangerous to his causes. He hates your humility. He hates your ministry. It's personal. And just like Pharaoh, he wants you back. Not just to kill you. In fact, it's very important in this story where you see Pharaoh wanting to get the people back. He didn't want to kill them. Now, if he killed some along the way, he didn't care because he doesn't like these people at all. He wants to enslave them. That's what he wants. So it'd be like saying, oh yeah, you're out of Egypt. Sure, you're saved, but you're going to live like a slave your whole life because you will never get free from this stuff that enslaved you in Egypt. You're still a slave to it now. And three of the strategies that the enemy uses to accomplish this is revealed in this story are these. Number one, he rises up with anger. We see that in verse 5. Number two, he mocks you with ridicule. We see that in verse three. Number three, he intimidates you with fear. We see that in verse seven, the ridicule of the enemy. And these are voices that many of you, I am, very familiar with. You see it in verse three, chapter 13, 14, 14, verse three, when he says, in effect, do you think you're free? You think you're redeemed? Fact is, remember that verse? You're wandering aimlessly in the wilderness. Look at them. They don't know where they're going. And the wilderness has shut you in. You think you know what you're doing. You think you know where you're going. You think you're a follower of Jesus. You're wandering aimlessly. Sure, you got redeemed. But what did that get you? You're no better off than you ever were before. And the ridicule comes. And the anger he has is over his loss of control, particularly of you. See that at the end of verse 5. What is this we have done, Pharaoh says, that we have let Israel go from serving us? He hates that because he can no longer use you for his purposes. And so, again, he wants you back. And one of the fundamental ways he tries to get you back is by means of intimidation. And that's in the story too. Dial into this. It's all on purpose. Because Pharaoh comes toward the people of God who have been redeemed out of Egypt, but they're not entirely free yet. He comes with all his horses. That's what the text says. Very intentionally. All his chariots, all his people, all his soldiers, all of them, it says in verse 7. and the purpose of that is to intimidate and the purpose of intimidation is to fill you with what a lot of us are full of sometimes fear and to convince you and me and us that we can never get away you will never get away you will never be really free you've got nowhere to go so just give up and surrender to this thing you're enslaved in. Surrender to Pharaoh. And I just do not believe, beloved, that there isn't someone, maybe several people, right here, right now, in that very place. By the power of the Spirit, through this word, I want to fight for you. Right here, right now. And even call on intercessors to begin praying toward that end. Because all of that brings me to the second element of the story I want us to see. And that is this, the power of God to make a way. Verse 13 and 14 of Exodus 14 are wonderful words. Because Moses said to the people, don't be afraid. Because if the enemy is coming at you, what you feel most right now is fear. And so Moses the prophet, and I'm not Moses, but I am standing here in this place as that kind of person saying, don't be afraid. Stand by and see, stand still and see The salvation of the Lord Which he will accomplish for you today For the Egyptians who you have seen today You will never see them again forever For the Lord will fight for you While you keep silence Get the picture here Because they've come to a place in their life And some of you are there Where nothing short of the supernatural power of God Will do any good They are absolutely cornered between that proverbial rock and a hard place, between Pharaoh and a wet place, the sea. But here's the deal about that. And this is not always true, but it's often true that if they had not been desperately cornered and pressed, they would have never crossed the sea. They would have just kind of stayed on the shore. They would have never pursued a different way had they not been pressed and pursued in a desperate place. The point being this, that sometimes it really does require, not always, but sometimes it really does require a desperate situation to bring about the deliverance that we need. Indeed, some of you all the way down to the ground know that this is true. Some of the greatest deliverances and breakthroughs in your life came when you were being pressed. They came when you were desperate, having come to the end of yourself, and the end of your marriage, and the end of your job, and the end of your kids, and the end of your strategy, and the end of your way of doing it and controlling it. Because now what's all that did in you, that kind of coming to the end of things, what it did to you, it's a horrible feeling, but it ironically made you pliable because now finally you're eager to leave this strategy that isn't working anymore for you. You're ready to follow. You're happy to obey. And it's interesting, you guys, how it all happened. I mean, in the story, how the waters actually did part because many of us picture this, at least I do, like the movie, where Moses, actually it's Charlton Heston, takes a staff over the water and the water begins to part. But this is a very important part of the story, and just that the Spirit would activate your mind and your imagination in the sanctified way to see this. It says in verse 21 that a strong east wind began to blow all night. And in symbol, the strong east wind, this is the wind of God. So, and some of you know exactly what that looks like, what that feels like. The wind of God began to blow, and it blew all night, which is significant too. Because what that means is the wind of God is blowing, but it's night, so it's dark. So they're watching and waiting all night in the dark, and they couldn't see. So they're wondering, what's the wind doing? I don't know, is it a good thing or a bad thing? and by the way it's like that sometimes where the wind of God is blowing and maybe you can tell it's the wind something's going on and it feels like a moving of the spirit among us but when the wind begins to blow if you've ever experienced this it's almost as frightening as it is exciting because you don't know what the wind is doing. Sometimes strong winds destroy things. Hurricanes destroy things. So what will the effect be? Will it be good? Because you can't see. It's nighttime, and sometimes when you're in a spot like that, you want to run. Maybe just surrender. I mean, the enemy's coming. I can't see what's going on. and it feels like God's moving, but all these things are happening at once. God is moving, but the enemy's coming. I give up. I'll go back to Egypt. Let me just get out of this not knowing place. A little advice. Verse 13, stand still. Don't move. And see. In other words, wait. Because it's not until the sun comes up in the morning, And that's symbolic to this. Sometimes the night lasts more than a few hours. Sometimes we're in a night time that feels like a season in our life, but it's not until the sun comes up in the morning that the people of God could see, that the action of the wind of God, when you wondered what was going on, was that he was making a way for you because it was in the middle of the night when you couldn't see God opened up the water. But you didn't know because you couldn't see. And I don't know any people. I just don't know any people Who have walked with God For any length of time Who don't have nights like that Seasons like that From time to time Indeed some of you may be in a night like that right now Indeed beloved Speak in ways that I won't be able to entirely Explain but We've had more than a few indicators From people among us who are intercessors Who are noticing And we're noticing it too that we as a church are in kind of a night like that right now. And what I mean by that is, among other things, there is a sense that the wind of God is blowing among us in a new way and in a fresh way. I've heard it from just numbers of places, but when the wind of God is blowing, there's also a sense of, I don't know what it's doing. I don't know where it's going. What's it gonna be like? With the wind of God blowing, which is a sense of God's moving, there's an equal sense of there's spiritual warfare going on right now among us in ways we can't see, but we can sense here's the word, especially if you can't see. Stand still and see. Wait. Which leads to the third and final element of this story because sooner or later the people of God need to decide, will we go forward through the water or not? Get this. God parted the Red Sea. That was a supernatural thing. God parted the Red Sea. They couldn't do that. And God destroyed the Egyptians, all of them. They couldn't do that. But they had to walk through. They had to go forward. They had to make a move, and that wasn't easy. Think. Could you walk through that? Would you? Walls of water on every side. Symbolism of water, danger, and death. It parted with walls. Yeah, that'd be not a problem. Listen to me. It takes a lot of faith to walk into a miracle because powerful, supernatural workings of God's spirit is not like waving a magic wand. It takes a lot of faith to walk into God's provision for freedom. Hebrews 11.29 says, By faith they passed through the waters of the sea. By faith they were delivered from a life of slavery and fear into a whole new way of living. It wasn't without struggle because they had to move. Which brings me to the culminating word because for some of you in life-altering ways, today is the day you need to decide. When we're standing on the shore of indecision, I'm pressing you to decide. Not to get baptized with water. That comes later, maybe. But to walk into these waters, to follow this way, this Jesus way, and to bend your knee to God, to cross over into a different kind of life, a different way of life. And if you're even identifying that thing from which you want to be free, and if that scares you just a bit, then listen. And let this get your hopes up. Listen to the message of the table to which we are now going to go and listen to the message of the cross at which some of you will kneel because the message of the table and the message of the cross is this, that God has made a way for you to cross over, for you to be free right here, right now. So walk into it. come to it, return to it, decides. Holy Spirit, come, I pray. With power to deliver, I pray. Let's go to the table. Thank you.
