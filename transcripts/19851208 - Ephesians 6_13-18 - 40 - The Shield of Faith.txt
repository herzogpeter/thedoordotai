We are just about done with our study in the book of Ephesians. And there are so many dimensions in the book of Ephesians that we have not even touched on that it would probably boggle the mind. I am fully convinced that we could finish it and I could start all over again and go through it again and preach it entirely different. There are themes that, just because of time, we can't go into. One of the things that was dawning on me this week, as I was putting together the next piece of armor that we were going to deal with this morning, is the fact that the book of Ephesians is a book of contrasts. And we don't even see the contrasts until we come to the sixth chapter that's dealing with the warfare of the believer. In a book that is so graphically defining the believer's riches and resources and privileges, it is really a contrast and even a conflict, kind of ironic, that in that very same book we would be studying in depth the tremendous issue of Christian conflict. The book of Ephesians begins for us in the heavenlies and it ends in chapter 6 dealing with hell. It begins with the angels and it ends with the demons. It begins with God and all His glory and the fullness of Him in our lives. And it ends with Satan. It begins with high and holy privilege that is every believer's right and every believer's resource. And then it ends. with the tremendous conflict and pressure that is being borne upon that same believer to not conflict comes tremendous conflict. We have learned the fact that the greater the reality of our belonging to the kingdom of God and the more that is a thing that we are living and breathing and are sensitive to, it seems that the more we come alive as believers to that, the more we also come alive to the opposition of Satan in our lives. When we're sitting on the sidelines, the concept of warfare is something that is a little bit distant. We think of bad things that happen in our lives, and we call it warfare. But that kind of warfare that believers experience when they're becoming more and more sensitive to the realities of God alive in them is something that if we're not prepared for it can be very, very frightening. and sometimes very disillusioning. So after Paul has said everything he's got to say in the first five chapters concerning our riches and our resources and the blessings that are bestowed upon the believer, he now says this, you better get ready for conflict. If you are going to embrace those things, you better get ready for conflict. If you are in the process, in fact, of stripping off the old, putting on the new, beginning to speak the truth in love, learning what it means to be filled with the Spirit, learning what it means to walk in wisdom and not in foolishness, learning what it means to walk in light and not in darkness, then you better know that you are going to be withstood, and you are going to be sidetracked, and you are going to be thwarted, and you are going to be opposed. You better know that. But you better also know this, believer. You are not left helpless. We have the resources we need. But we are in a war, and we do have an enemy, Satan, the opposer. the adversary therefore believer take up the full armor of god verse 13 that you may be able to resist in the evil day and having done everything to stand firm let's pray as we begin father i think it's a terribly subtle but very real trap that every one of us have the potential of falling into and that is coming to church and singing the songs and reading the scripture and praying the prayer and preaching the sermon and saying all the right words and even believing them and even still doing all of it in the flesh. And I pray, Father, with great earnest that Satan would be absolutely bound as we open your word so that we would at this time hear something far more than words, far more than even right words, but that, Father, we would sense a moving of your spirit in our hearts, the truth that rings in us because it is of God. I ask your absolute control upon the time we are about to spend in your word. In Jesus' name, amen. We are not helpless. Therefore, take up the full armor of God. And we have begun to discuss those things, and we have begun to put on the pieces of armor that we need to do. First of all, verse 14, gird up your loins with truthfulness. We've been calling that the belt of commitment. Put that belt on and prepare yourself for war. We've done that. We did it. Everybody's there. Everybody's ready to move on. The next thing we had to do, same verse, verse 14, after you've got that belt wrapped around you and you're ready for the war, you need to understand that even though that is necessary, that belt of commitment is not enough to win the war. You need to put the breastplate of righteousness on. Again, we taught the fact that that righteousness that you place on your chest here that protects your feelings and your thinking. Remember the Jew had the idea that in here was where they had their thinking. And protecting the feelings and the thinking, if you are going to put a breastplate of your own righteousness on, you are going to get blasted. The righteousness, the breastplate of righteousness that you place on yourself is that which has been imputed to you by Christ. And then last week we talked about preparing your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace. And you've got to have your feet prepared. And we talked about the hobnail boots that those Roman soldiers would wear so that they could stand firm when the battle came. And they didn't want to be slipping all over the place. And the shoes that are given to the believer that helps him stand firm when the battle begins to move against you are the shoes that are made of the gospel of peace. And that is simply this, that believer, God is at peace with you. Who will bring a charge against God's elect? God? No. He's the one who justifies. Remember, he's on your side. He is an ally. And by faith, you put those on and stand in them and rest in them prepared for a war. We are now ready to move on to the next three pieces of armor. And I want you to notice some very subtle changes that are important for us to pick up. We need to do a little bit of teaching here in order for us to get the real impact of what's happening right now. I want you to look at verse 16, and something is changing here. In verse 16, it says this, in addition to all, in addition to everything else we've already mentioned, taking up the shield of faith. Now, that little phrase I want us to focus on is this, In addition to all, taking up. Stop right there. In addition to all, your King James Version says, and above all, taking the shield of faith and the sword of the Spirit and the helmet of salvation. One of the things you need to know that it does not mean, it does not mean that these next few pieces of armor are any more important than the ones we've already talked about. It is not a qualitative kind of thing. What it is meaning is simply this, that in addition to having the belt on, and in addition to having the breastplate on, and in addition to having the feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, in addition to all those things, I want you to do some other things also, in addition to, above all, you're ready for these next three pieces of armor. But I want you to notice something else also, because something does change here. There is a little bit of a thrust kind of difference that we need to pick up. It might seem subtle, but it is important. The verb changes here. Again, this might sound like a seminary class, but I think it's important for us to grasp. The verb changes here, and it does change the meaning somewhat. In verse 14, when we're talking about the pieces of armor that the believer is to put on, it says this. It says, Having girded your loins with truthfulness, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and verse 15, and having shod your feet, That is past tense. Those are things you have already done. Okay? The concept there is that that belt is on and it stays on. The breastplate is on and it stays on. The feet are shot and they stay shot. Those are not the kinds of pieces of equipment that you put on and take off and put on and take off and put on and take off. Those things, believer, are to be part of your life day in, day out, all the time. Leave them on. Having done that already, we move on. Let me give you an example. The belt of commitment. The belt of commitment. We spent several weeks on that, it seems. That belt of commitment that you put on that prepares you for the war. That is not a thing that you put on and take off and put on and take off. You don't go around committing your life every three weeks. You make a commitment to Christ, and then you begin to move on. You begin to grow. I believe that hearing sermons on life commitments every single Sunday can get just as tiring as hearing sermons on salvation every Sunday. If you've already been saved, you're going to get tired of hearing salvation sermons every Sunday, aren't you? If you're already committed, you're going to get a little tired of hearing sermons on commitment every Sunday. Those are things that are to be put on, and you don't take them off. You put them on, and you begin to move on. I think we need to understand something about commitment, And I think even in the church, we have treated commitment as though commitment were something above and beyond the call of duty. If you're committed, you've really moved to maturity. I believe that when we're talking about people who are committed to the warfare and fully committed to Christ, we are still talking milk when we are talking commitment. We have not moved to maturity yet. That commitment to Christ that opens me up to everything he has for me is simply the thing that moves me into maturity. Hebrews 6.1, Paul says this, and he's saying it in a very frustrated way to the people who he's writing to in the book of Hebrews. And he says this, listen, it is time to leave the elementary stuff. I've been talking to you about commitment, commitment, commitment. Put it on and leave it on so that we can grow. so we can move on from there. Commitment, friends, that belt is elementary. Having put that on, having put the breastplate of righteousness on, having your shoes shot, leave them on. Verse 16, now take up active verb changes. Taking up. Not only does the verb change here, paying off the verb is far more active. The thrust is this, And let me try to use words to help you catch the picture. There are times in your lives when the battle really heats up, and there are other times in your lives when there's kind of a lull in the battle. Things are kind of flowing. The things with the family that usually just cause a lot of tension, and you really need to apply all the principles, and you're really trying to work it out. Sometimes it really heats up. And then there's other times when things are really flowing, and you feel like you're really growing, and everything you're trying is working. It's wonderful, and you're kind of coasting along. It's great. Well, I want to tell you something. it's important that we realize that when things are flowing and when things are going, that you don't dare take off that belt and you don't dare take off that breastplate and you don't dare take off your shoes. But the funny thing about lulls in the storm, the funny thing about lulls in the storm is that they don't last. They never do. And when the battle begins to heat up, having the belt and having the breastplate and having the shoes, when the battle begins to heat up, take up the shield of faith and take up the helmet of salvation and pick up the sword of the Spirit and begin to really wage the war. There is a difference in the battle as we're dealing with these kinds of issues. There isn't an issue where one of these things is more important than anything else, but the battle has changed. It's intensified when I'm picking up the shield and I'm strapping on that helmet. I wonder if you have the picture. It's real important that you do it. When the fur really starts flying and the arrows are really swarming, what do you do? Cry. Feel sorry for yourself. Oh, nothing works. This whole Christianity thing is a crock. Why any complain? No. What you do when the arrows really start flying and what you do when the troubles just seem to begin to overwhelm you, that's when the battle is really flying, believer. And that's when you, what? Pick up the shield, strap on the helmet, take up that sword and get going. let's examine we're going to look at two pieces today one pretty much in depth and then we're going to introduce real briefly even as our conclusion the helmet of salvation and I trust this morning that maybe as some of you are really going through it that you will find some comfort and strength in this and maybe for those times that are to come for you and you are in a lull I guarantee it won't last and that battle will rage again and it'll be for your heart and for your mind. And these truths are going to be embraced. The shield of faith. The shield of faith. This is wonderful. As I was studying this and anticipating bringing these things to you, I just get goose bumps because goose bumps. Goose bumps. You should be up here. What do you picture when you think of the shield of faith? What do you picture? You know, again, Paul's looking at a soldier and he's got all these things in his mind and the first thing I thought of when I thought of the shield of faith was I thought of that little round disc that Kirk Douglas wears in Spartacus. It's going all over the place and he's fighting and the guy's swinging the sword and he kicks it up and he's down on the ground and he's holding it up there and the guy's beating on it. Right? Little shield of faith. The word of God is so exciting because it's real specific the kind of shield this is. That is not the kind of shield that is being dealt with right here. The Greek word there is specific. It is the Greek word thurion and that is a very specific kind of shield. This was not a disc that one would wear on his arm. This shield that is being spoken of here was a great big huge chunk of wood. It was about four and a half feet tall, about two and a half feet wide. It was made of solid wood and often it was covered on the front with metal. Sometimes it was covered with leather that was soaked in water. And what would happen in those days when the Romans went to war, not only would one soldier just carry one of these things. And by the way, they could just about fit their whole body behind this thing. If they were made today, people were shorter then, the theory goes. But if it was made, you could get your whole body right behind this thing. It would just absolutely protect you and nothing could pierce it. But what the Romans did in those days, they would put these shields side by side. I think then of the body of Christ. All of us together, the shield of faith, and that thing, that monstrosity, would just begin to move down the street. You know, boom, boom, boom. It was just awesome. Side by side, nothing could get in. One of the commentators was dealing with this word thurion, and they were saying that it absolutely struck the same kind of fear into people's hearts as if a Sherman tank would turn the corner and come at you. It was the same kind of powerful weapon for the Romans. Side by side, moving, formidable weapon. And that's what it looked like. It's purpose. I think you can probably already figure it out. When the arrows were coming, they would shoot into that thing. If they were metal covered, they would just kind of bounce off. If they were leather covered, soaked in water, the arrows would go in and they would be stopped or they would be quenched. They would be quenched. You see, in those days, the archers would take an arrow and they wouldn't just shoot the arrow, but often they would take the arrow and they would wrap material on the end of that arrow and they would dip it in a thing called pitch. And pitch was something that would burn very hot and very slow. It was kind of like a tar. kind of feeling. And they would shoot that arrow, and hopefully it would hit something near the soldier, or it would even hit the shield. And when it made impact, that pitch would just splatter all over the place, and it would get on the grass, and the grass would start on fire. Or if they were shooting at a building, the building would start on fire. Or if they were shooting at people, the people would start on fire. And you don't fight real well when you're burning to death. So it was a wonderful weapon. What did the shield of faith, not the shield of faith, but what did this Thurion do, but when those arrows came, the wet leather would just quench those things out. Nothing could penetrate. In this text, you'll miss those fiery darts, those flaming arrows full of pitch that get all over everything and just begin to burn up your life. If you want to be able to withstand those times when the arrows are flying and you're burning up, you better take up the shield of faith. the evil one is going to throw them I don't even need to give you examples of that I don't think I would invite you even now to begin to use your mind a little bit and reflect on your own life and consider those areas in your life where even this morning as you came to church and maybe you didn't even want to be here and you don't even know why you're here now because the arrows are flying all over the place and the last place you want to be is here what are they for you? What are those fiery arrows that are shooting at your life and burning you up? And maybe even right now, as I said, you know all too well just how tremendously effective those fiery missiles of the evil one are because you have sensed it over and over and over again in your life as you've just felt defeat and defeat and defeat. I don't know what it is for you, but I know what he shoots at me. For some of you this morning, it's the fiery dart of discouragement. Discouragement, that elusive, I don't even know why I feel discouraged, I just feel discouraged. Fiery dart, I'm burning up. That fiery dart, here's a good one, of guilt. Again, that vague sense of guilt, I'm a believer, I hear the promises, I just, I'm not able to embrace them for some reason, I don't feel free from my sin. I don't feel free, I don't really feel forgiven. Fiery dart of guilt. Satan lies at you and lies at you the fiery dart of loneliness. The fiery dart of failure. And I'm not just talking about failure in a spiritual sense. That's one dimension of failure. But a failure, let's say, in a career. Failure in life goals that you have for yourself. And you just feel like a failure. The fiery dart is flying all over the place. The fiery dart of peer pressure. Of family tension, it seems like no matter what you do, no matter how you pray, no matter how you care, no matter how you go out of your way to deal with your children, there's still a rebellion and a lack of communication. Fiery dart of family tension, the fiery dart of financial tension. You can talk all you want, Johnson, about God providing, but I just lost my job, and I'm going to lose my house. That's a fiery dart. That's a missile that is threatening even now for some of you to consume you, isn't it? The fiery dart of losing your job. The fiery dart of temptation. That kind of temptation, that lustful desire that for some reason or another you just can't get rid of and it plagues you all your life, some of you. And it leads to sin and that leads to defeat and all that means is the fiery dart came in and just destroyed you, ate you up. Burned you up. And I want to tell you something. Just because of the experience I have in the warfare, I know this, that when those darts really start flying and they're coming in waves, I need something more than quick reflexes to deflect them. I can't just be kind of dodging those things. Let's be honest for a minute. Again, I hope I'm developing this picture of these troubles as they come into our lives so that you have a picture of it. I really think that if the arrows are coming one at a time, there's a real tendency on my part to think I can handle it. You know, the arrow's coming, I can see it's only one. I dodge it, it goes by, made it. You know, give you a lot of Norman Vincent Peale, a lot of positive thinking, you know. Hey, I can handle it with that. Well, I'll just think positive and I'll get over this travail. Give you a lot of good psychology and that'll help you. Get through it and then it will. But when they come in waves, and they do, don't they? When they come in waves, all the positive thinking in the world can't deal with that. I need something more. i need some kind of protection i need a four and a half by two and a half plank of wood that i can stand behind and sit behind and have my lunch and have all those arrows coming and burning and being extinguished i need something more secure i need a bulwark behind which i can find some sort of strength the shield of faith the shield of faith let's examine that the shield of faith explain it again I got to paint a picture for you here we've got Satan over here and God over here and Satan's job is to what? we know this from the warfare his job is to lie and deceive and to trip you up and to get you to fall back into former ways of living and former ways of thinking and his job is to continually come at you with lies that look like the truth Satan's got his brand of truth God's got his brand of truth Satan's got his brand of love God's got his brand of love Satan's got his brand of giving which is really taking God's got his brand of giving and on and on and on it goes when I am confronted with the options that Satan gives me and the options that God gives me I have a choice I either choose to believe what Satan is telling me or I choose to believe what God is telling me you got that so far? it's muddy as can be isn't it right now just hang on to that if you're taking notes you want to write that down I choose to believe what Satan tells me or I choose to believe what God tells me. The shield of faith that protects me against the lies that Satan is going to throw at me is when I stand over here and say, I choose to believe God and you are a liar. I want you to write something down if you're taking notes. It's a statement that is going to be the thread throughout this whole sermon. Who I believe, Satan or God, who I choose to believe will determine what I do. Okay? Who I choose to believe, Satan or God, will absolutely determine what I do. Let me explain that. God says this to me. David Johnson, you are in Christ. And since you are in Christ, you are holy and blameless before God. You are forgiven. You are loved. You are accepted in the Beloved One. You are an heir. You are a son. And everything that pertains to Christ pertains to you. Ha-ha! And Satan says, who are you kidding? Who are you kidding? Look at your past life. I know what the Bible says, and I know you go to church and feel warm and gooey, but look at your life. Look at what you've done. You're coming to church, and you've gone through all sorts of things, and you've made all sorts of mistakes. And the Bible talks about forgiveness, but you don't feel forgiven, do you? You're not forgiven. God can't forgive you for what you did. You've gone through adultery and fornication, and you've gone through divorce, and you've been messed up with drugs and alcohol and all that kind of thing, and everybody knows that everybody at church is all put together, and you'll never fit in here. Satan throws it and throws it and throws it. What does God say? God says, you are forgiven, you are accepted, you are valuable. I affirm you. Satan says, no, you're not. Who do you believe? I think how you live tells you who you believe. We've got believers, and every one of us fall into this, who walk around kind of flogging themselves. You know, oh man, I'm just a miserable person, and yeah, oh yeah, I know I'm saved, oh yeah, I know the Lord loves me. You don't believe that. Oh yeah, I know I'm forgiven. Who you believe is going to determine how you act. You are forgiven. You are accepted. You are valuable. You do belong. and we still live with those vague senses of guilt, those senses that we're unworthy, those senses that not only are we unforgiven, but we are unforgivable. Any of you feel like that? Not only don't I feel unforgiven, but I don't feel like I'm forgivable. I think that is beyond me. And some of us even get into this perverse kind of cycle that says basically this, when I feel a little bad about myself, I kind of feel good, because I don't deserve to feel good. I don't deserve to feel free. my track record's too loud lousy and Satan's throwing that at you and throwing that at you who you believe who you choose to believe is going to determine in this look at where I'm at right now and say listen Satan you are a liar I'm going to stand in the promises God says this about me and I choose to believe it and that frees me up to serve him because it isn't because I'm so great it isn't because I know so much it's because he says this is what I am and I believe it that's what it means to walk by faith because every one of you I don't care how mature we are spiritually every one of us if we were to look at ourselves we would have to disqualify ourselves it's only in Christ that I have any of those things and I believe it and so I serve with power let's look at how this shield of faith deals can protect us when the arrow of temptation comes I can take you right back to the Garden of Eden for this particular example God says this to Adam and Eve if you want to have fullness of joy, if you want to have fullness of fellowship with me, if you want to really know the fullness of God for all of eternity, for all your life, and all your sons and daughters too, do this. And one thing I want you to refrain from, because it's about your ability to have fullness of life, I want you to refrain from that tree. I want you to refrain from that fruit. And immediately, there's God, that's what he says is truth. Satan comes along with his lie and says, baloney the truth is this david johnson the truth is this adam and eve god is here to spoil your fun god is here to to be a basically a killjoy the fruit is wonderful the fruit is wonderful take it take it it's good for you the bottom line is this what is it who you believe determines what you do doesn't it god says don't satan says do who i believe is what i do Satan says it's good I take it I believe Satan that's exactly what happened to Adam and Eve think about it in your own heart in your own life when it comes to lustful kinds of temptation the truth is exactly again the same who I choose to believe will determine what I do every time you know I used to think maybe some of you are here too because I used to struggle with this concept of you know believing God and living by faith And I used to think that if I was really sincere and I would kind of sit there and go, Oh God, I believe in you. I'd kind of feel warm and gooey and even cry on Sunday when the sermon was really good. And I would think, Oh Lord, I'll believe in you and I'll really have faith and you'll just take all these lustful desires away. Never worked. Never did. Never just flipped away. And I have come to the realization, biblically even, that as long as I am in this fleshly body, this beachhead, Satan is going to land on it from time to time, and he is going to pull me in certain directions. God says, David Johnson, let that marriage bed be undefiled. Cling to your wife, love her, protect her, and David, within that matrix, within that pattern, there is fullness of joy. Satan comes along and says this, Johnson, don't be a chump. Look what you're missing. The truth is this, Dave. God is a killjoy. He wants to spoil your fun. The fruit is great. The bottom line is, who do you believe? Right? Because who you believe determines what you do. The shield of faith is choosing to believe what God said is true. That in this particular dimension of my behavior, I am going to find fullness here. And Satan is going to dangle all sorts of nice little fruits out there. And every time I grab him, I find out it's a lie. Shield of faith. when I choose to believe God. Let's look at how this works when you're dealing with financial tension. Okay? Financial tension. Nobody here has this problem, so I don't know. God says this about financial problems. God says this, I will supply all your needs. Not only will I supply your needs, but I'll supply your needs according to the riches that are in Christ Jesus. Not out of the riches, doling out a little bit here and there, but according to. in comparison with if you're near water, and it'll come back to you. Johnson, give, and it'll be given unto you. How? Good measure. I like that. How will it be given to you? Good. It'll be given good to you. Press down, shaken together, and running over. I've used this illustration many times. It's a biblical one, but you know what that means. It's like the cornflakes that are all fluffy to the top. This kind of giving. When I give, his promise is he'll return. How? Press down a little more. Press it down a little more. press it down, shaken together, right down to the bottom, and then running over still. Satan says those promises are fine, but they won't work in a recession. Right? Serving are wonderful until inflation reaches 15%. Then they won't work anymore. Or until, again, you lose your job. Did you know that a church can't grow in a recession? And did you know that the church can't go anywhere and we can't make any major decisions and your family can't make it again when inflation reaches 15 or 16 percent. Can't do it. You know how I know that? Because Satan says so. Satan says again those promises are fine when the money's rolling in. Satan says those promises are fine when all the things you want are there, when the house is nice and the car is new and all those things. And when the house is nice and the car is new and the kids are fine and you've got nice clothes and all this kind of thing, then you sit back and go, oh, my God has supplied all my needs. Isn't this wonderful? But what if you lose your job? I want you to think on that and I want you to think of how the promises of God fit into that stark reality again this is even dealing with our our tendency to take spiritual things and go yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but not really believe them think on it for a minute let's just imagine something happens even in our country and go with it with me a little bit and something happens in our country such that we cannot keep our jobs and we have a congregation that is reflecting society that just isn't able to provide for itself, and things are going bad. And get even worse than that. We can't support this building anymore, and we just can't afford to keep it, and we're going to have to move out, and we can't support any staff people, and we can't support missions the way we want to, and on and on and on. We lose it all. Oh, my goodness. What would we do then? What do you think would happen? I'll tell you what I think would happen. What I think would happen is that we would find out in ways we don't even see now, because we have such a wonderful resource going on right now, that we would find in ways we don't even understand now that our God can supply all our needs, even in that. I want you to look at it. Look at what we have. This is a beautiful building. The nice lights, the nice pews, everybody's here. Everybody looks nice. It's wonderful. We're even talking about it making it more wonderful. And we have a library and a nursery and we have a youth ministry and we have a pastor and all these neat kinds of things. But take them all away. Take them all away. And I don't believe for a minute, unless we're here for the wrong reasons, I don't believe for a minute that with all of this gone, and with all of our staff possibilities gone, that we will have lost anything of what makes us what we really are. And I believe that if all that happened, again, we would find out in ways we don't even understand now that our God can't supply all our needs. You know what I believe? I believe we keep on growing, and I believe we keep on meeting, And I believe counseling would still go on, and youth ministry would still go on, and Pastor Johnson would still go on. And all along the way, if that kind of thing happened, Satan would be saying, come on, your God's not supplying your need. You lost the building. Your God's not supplying your need. Look at this. Your God's missiles, wham, wham, wham, all the time. And all the way along the line, you know what we'd have to be doing? We'd have to be doing this, the shield of faith. I believe God. I believe God. He is supplying our need. We're still here. The things that really matter most, we see now like we never saw before. And we keep on going and we keep on growing. And I believe that is victory. Hebrews 11, that wonderful chapter. We're going to spend a lot of time on that when we get to that. I think most of you know we're going into Hebrews after we do Ephesians. The hall of fame for the faithful. You remember all those people? I want you to note again, who they believed determined what they did. By the way, you're going to see here that also faith is a verb. Faith is something I do. It's not something I kind of sit back and go, oh, yeah, I believe that. Faith is something I do. When I believe something, I do something. I don't just sit there and nod my head. Verse 4 of chapter 11, it says this. By faith, Abel did something. By faith, Abel offered a better sacrifice. God said, Abel, I want you to do it this way. Satan said, ah, it doesn't matter. Cain believed Satan. Abel believed God. verse 7 excuse me it says this by faith Noah being warned about the things not yet even seen did what God said he built an ark again what did God say God said do it this way and can you imagine the missiles that must have been flying at Noah you're a chump again you're in the middle of a desert what are you building an ark for don't do it don't do it give up quit nobody's listening to you all sorts of self-doubt all the time by faith Noah being warned about things that he didn't even see yet began to act as if they were who did he believe? God or Satan? He believed God and who he believed determined what he did he built an ark Abraham same thing in that very next verse talks about leaving the place where he was comfortable and going into a strange land and for the rest of his life living as a stranger and an alien in a strange land by faith he did what? he went God said go he went Satan said you're an idiot who did he believe who he believed determined what he did Romans chapter 4 Abraham we see him again he had a promise of a son and if anybody had missiles shooting at him of doubt and discouragement it had to be Abraham because at this point in time in Romans 4 when we're picking him up he is 100 years old Sarah's womb has long since been barren but he's been promised a son verse 20 says this he was 100 years old Sarah's womb was barren, yet with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief. But you know what he did? He grew strong in faith. You know, sometimes I think that we ought to pray once in a while for some adversity, because you know what it does? It makes us grow in faith. When we can handle everything that's happening to us, we get into this disgustingly sick habit of really thinking we can handle it all. And we never see God move. He didn't waver in unbelief, but in that time when he still didn't see the promise fulfilled, he believed and he grew in his faith. And the reason he grew in his faith was going on into the next verse. It says, because he was fully assured that what God had promised, he was able also to perform. Believing God is the shield. Gideon, same thing. God said, Gideon, go to war. What I want you to do before you go to war, though, is get rid of all your resources. Get rid of all your resources. Get rid of everything that's going to make you trust in yourself. Get rid of it all. Satan says, get in, you're an idiot. Doing what God says is fine. But again, in a recession, you know, when things are rough, you're crazy. You've got to do it yourself. You better count your money before you make any decisions. When Abraham went into a strange land, he didn't count his resources first. When Gideon went into battle, God said, get rid of your resources first, so that you fully trust me, so that when the victory is won, You know who did it. It wasn't you. It was me. The shield of faith is believing God. I choose to believe Him. Instead of all the darts and all the doubts and all the discouragements that Satan's going to throw at you and me every time we begin to move out in faith. He's going to tell you all the reasons why it can't be done. You know what? People who don't believe God, and I'm saying that term in the way I've been describing it, choosing to believe God, people who don't believe God never win the war. Never. you may be a believer all your life and you may be on your way to heaven and that whole trip but there are believers I am absolutely sure who never ever know the taste of victory because they believed God despite what they saw because if you don't believe God you know what you're not even in the war see I believe again this picture of this big these walls moving down into the warfare and the arrows flying and they're all being taken care of they're all being quenched because I choose to believe God and not all the things I feel and not all the things I see. But it is absolutely possible for believers to stay out of the range of those arrows, isn't it? It's possible to stay up on the hill and watch the battle down there. Oh, yeah, it's getting pretty hot down there. Hang in there, guys. You know, have faith. To play it safe all your life, to stay out of range, to never take a risk, to never do anything unless you know for sure it's going to work. Because you're always working on the resources that you have. So you never go out on a limb where you've got to trust God. I want to tell you something. You'll never see the victory that way. You never will. Not only, friend, does lack of faith make us shrink back and never see the victory, but there's something even more serious about that, and that's this, that in the middle of that 11th chapter of these examples of people who stepped out when they didn't see and stepped out when all the answers weren't there, but they knew God said to go, so they went. Right in the middle of that, God indicts lack of faith. He says in verse 6 of chapter 11, Dear friend, listen, without faith it is impossible to please God. I believe with all my heart that we've been called as believers to live in the middle of a war with flaming missiles all around. And I don't think we can play it safe, but I don't think we can lose either if we choose to believe God. And I think that we need each other even in that because there are times when I begin to stumble and I begin to grow weary in belief and I begin to think it isn't worth it and nothing's happening and so do you. And our marriage is beginning to come around but I don't know if it's worth the work it's taken. And I'm really starting to get through to my kids but I don't know if it's worth the work it's taken. And our church is beginning to grow and we're starting to touch people who've got some real pain but I don't know if it's worth the work it's taken. Well, I tell you, I don't want to live any place but where the arrows are flying. But I'll tell you something else. There's no way I want to go out where the arrows are flying unless I'm really believing God. because I'll get drilled and so will you. I got to tell you one more thing and then we're going to close. There are times in my life and in yours that I am out in that valley and I'm in the pit of that warfare and the arrows are flying and they're all on fire and the fire is splattering all over and I'm behind the shield and Lord, I'm believing you. And Lord, I'm believing you. And I don't see it, but I'm going to believe you and I'm going to keep on serving you. And I'm doing well. and I'm growing and I'm living again right on that cutting edge of faith and I still get discouraged. You know? And it's still there and I'm still behind the shield and I still get discouraged. But maybe I've even got to redefine that word a little bit. Discouragement. I'm not afraid to say I'm discouraged. That's okay if that's where I'm at. But it's a little bit different than discouragement because when I'm standing behind that shield and the arrows are flying and I'm still believing God, it isn't even so much that I'm discouraged says, I'm just plain tired. I'm tired. Lord, I keep fighting and nothing breaks. Lord, I keep giving and nothing comes back. I keep caring and I just feel like I keep getting blasted. Galatians 6.9 has a word for you, dear friend, who's in the middle of the war. It says this, dear believer, don't grow weary in well-doing. The word is weary, isn't it? It isn't even discouraged. It's just tired. I'm tired i'm running a race and my knees feel like rubber don't grow weary in well-doing did you get that well-doing this is speaking to someone who's doing well who's trusting god who's stepping out who's in the middle of the war they aren't sitting on the sideline praying for someone else they're in there but it never eases off and doesn't seem like anything breaks and every time you begin to make progress it seems like you take a step forward and two back a step forward and two back a step forward and two back. 1 Kings 19. We talked about Elijah a couple weeks ago, and I kind of got down on him because he didn't believe God. I have a feeling maybe he got weary. You remember the story? For some of you who don't remember, the story is basically this. Elijah had just won a tremendous victory. This prophet of God moved in against 450 prophets of Baal all by himself, alone believing God and every one of those prophets died. The reason they had to show down was because rain hadn't been in the land for some three years. And after this great victory and all those prophets of Baal died and the fire came down from heaven and consumed that altar, they started running for home because the rain was coming right now. You're talking victory. That was a good Sunday. People came forward that day and he went home and all of a sudden and he got a phone call from Jezebel. And Jezebel says, Listen, Elijah. Listen, pastor. Listen, Sunday school teacher, servant, whoever you are. I didn't like what you did with those prophets of mine. And you are going to die tomorrow. And I'm going to make sure it happens. And if it doesn't happen, I'm going to die trying. Wonderful victory. All by himself, 450. One phone call. Bam, it's over. He's running for cover. And I want to tell you something. I sympathize with him a little more than I did two weeks ago. Because I have a feeling what he was saying when that phone call came, or whatever it was, however that communication came, from Jezebel to Elijah, it was basically this, Lord, come on, give me a day off. Give me a day off. I just had this incredible victory, and we were right on the line. Give me a break. I want to sit back and enjoy it and savor it and soak it in a little bit. We wound up under a juniper tree praying to die. And he started arguing with God, and he says, I'm the only one left. No one else in the whole kingdom loves you. Just me, I'm the only one. And God says, get up off your rock. Boy, I saved that one. There are 7,000 around you who love me and who are mine. But you know something, Elijah, that isn't the point. When you stood in front of 450 prophets of Baal, you were alone then, but you had me. And you were standing behind a shield. Thank you.
