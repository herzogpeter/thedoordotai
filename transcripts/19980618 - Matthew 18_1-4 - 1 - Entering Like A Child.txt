I know there's a lot of distraction right now with people sitting and people leaving, but someone that I have a lot of confidence in and respect for gave me a word that she wrote down during our worship and felt like it needed to be given to our people. And it may not apply to everyone, it may apply to everyone, but where it lands, just hear it. The word she got was this, I am doing a mighty work among you, but the enemy is right at my heels. Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Pray earnestly and diligently for this church. A war has been declared here, and I am a jealous God, but I will not forsake you. Seek me. Turn your ear toward me alone. I have you in my care. That's a good word. that is a good word there's things that go on that everybody doesn't know about and there is a war going on and it's constant and at different levels that applies but it applies Matthew 18 verse 1 it's been a while since we've been in Matthew isn't it the holidays kind of interrupted it Last Sunday, my wife and I and a group of other people from the church were at a conference in California, a Larry Crabb conference. It's good to get back into the flow of things again and into our study in the book of Matthew. Because we're kind of getting back, it's been a while, I want to remind you of the fact that we find ourselves in the middle of a section that started in chapter 16 and it's going through chapter 20. In this section, Jesus is using this period of time to be preparing his disciples for two things. Number one, for his departure, because the cross is imminent, he is about to die. And number two, he is preparing his disciples for their ministry when he is away. There are certain vital things that they need to know about kingdom life, kingdom truth and reality, in order for them to function with power and clarity. Literally, this section, chapter 16 through 20, is a picture of Jesus discipling the disciples. In chapter 18, verse 1, the next phase of their learning unfolds. is set into motion by this particular incident. Let's start reading in verse 1. And at that time, the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And he answered that question by calling a child to himself, and he set that child before them. Other accounts indicate that he set the child next to him. Luke says that he put the child on his lap. And he said to them, Look at this little kid on my lap. Truly I say to you that unless you are converted and become like children, that word converted means to be turned around and become like children you won't even enter the kingdom of heaven whoever then humbles himself as this child i hold on my knee he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and he took a child and he put him on his knee you guys want to talk about greatness let's talk about greatness you want to talk about status and position let's do that and he put picked out of the crowd or out of the group of people in this house the most unlikely picture of greatness that any of them would have had. And he stuck this little child on his knee and he said, there, take a look. That's what greatness in the kingdom looks like to me. And the disciples are looking around a little bit confused, thinking, him? That's a picture of greatness? I even think the child is looking around a little bit confused. Me? This is greatness. But Jesus is with steel in his voice and in his eyes saying this, listen disciples, all of the necessary ingredients of greatness in the kingdom of God are in this child. And right now you need to know that you don't have them. Because in order for you to have the qualities in this child that qualify him or her for the kingdom, you'd have to be converted. You would have to be turned 180 degrees around. You are not there right now, at least in the attitude that you've got right now. It's not a kingdom attitude. What is going on here? What is it that Jesus is trying to communicate? What is the principle? Well, I'll say this, that whatever the principle is and whatever the ingredients that Jesus is trying to pull out in this diagram or this illustration of a little child, whatever it is, it's absolutely vital for the disciples to get. And not only that, it's absolutely vital for us to understand as well if we are concerned about living in the kingdom. The way we are going to get to that principle that Jesus is delineating here, we're going to break the text into three parts. Three parts, it is always three parts. I was ordained before the foundation of the world that the way you get to the truth is three ways. The first thing we're going to look at in some depth is the incident itself, when they came with the question, who's the greatest? The second thing we need to look at in depth is the confrontation that Jesus makes when they come with the question. That's going to be verses 2 and 3. And then fourth, just kind of wrapping our thoughts up, is going to be the culmination or his answer to the question, who really is the greatest in the kingdom? Let's pray as we begin. Father, I pray that you would put every one of us in a position where we see the truth about ourselves. And God, as you have really dealt with me about this passage, I pray that we would all be able to enter into it, that in the truth of my humanity, it's far easier for me to relate to the question of the disciples. Where I live very often, I'm afraid, is real caught up with how am I doing? What's my rank? How do I look? Who's the greatest? Me? And I have, and I think we have, a lot harder time identifying with the child and even what Jesus meant by that. And God, it is not with flowery speech or convincing words that we are going to be converted or changed, turned around, made to think differently. It can only be by the power of your spirit. I pray that you would take the truth of your word. I pray that you would take the revelation of your word and power it by your spirit to be about the business of converting all of us to children. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Let's look at the incident first of all. The incident, they came to Jesus. They wanted to know who the greatest was. They're feeling real good about themselves. They're obviously feeling real good about the kinds of things they've been doing. They've been arguing about themselves. Who really is the greatest? This question that they pose to Jesus reveals some things about them that we need to see. The first thing that this question reveals about them to us is this, that these disciples are an awful lot like us in that they are born performers. They are born strivers. They are people who, like you and I, have this little grid. Their mode of operation, their grid for perceiving truth, is that you earn your value, you perform to get it, you strive to find your place. Even when you get into church, and even when you get saved, and even when you're doing the kingdom things, there really are ranks, there really are little places you fit, and you want to know how you're doing. You see, these disciples, like many of us, got their sense of value, and they get their sense of meaning the old-fashioned way, they earn it. You see, when they come and they ask a question like that, who is the greatest in the kingdom, what's underneath that question, and the heart from which that question is coming is saying basically this, I really want to know how I'm doing. Why is that? Because I'm a performer. How's my performance look to you, Jesus? Am I doing well? How's Peter doing as it relates to me, James, am I doing better than someone else? Not only does it reveal, this question does, does it reveal that they are basically performers, but it also reveals that they were keeping track of their performers. They were keeper trackers. Verse 1, he says, who then is the greatest in the kingdom? In the account in Mark, the parallel account, what it indicates is they had been arguing about that. They were discussing among themselves who was the greatest. And one of the things you have to get in your mind here is they were coming to Jesus for him to settle the argument. We've got all these opinions. We want you to tell us who is right. Now, it's very important that you get this and contrast it. The disciples are not coming to Jesus with an honest question, saying, you know, Jesus, we're really thrilled about this kingdom stuff. These kingdom realities are overwhelming us. And with a humble heart, we really want to know, what does it mean to be great in the kingdom? How is greatness measured? Because everything we've seen and understood about the kingdom so far seems to counter what we've always thought. So just tell us, what does kingdom greatness really look like? They didn't come to Jesus with a blank slate waiting for him to give them the answer. They all came with an answer. Every one of them had a different opinion. Every one of them had already done the inventory of the 12. They had already ranked everybody who was there. They had argued about, because one guy had one opinion, he's greatest. Another guy had another opinion, he's the greatest. and they're coming to Jesus not to really get an answer to it. They want Jesus to settle the argument. Tell us which one of us is right. They all had a different opinion. They all had a different way to grade. Peter had an opinion. James had an opinion. Some people had an opinion about Peter. Some people had about James. It depends on your grading system. Some people would look at Peter and say, Peter has probably got the front position on this greatness stuff. After all, he walked on water. He seems to speak a lot. He has an awful lot of authority. There was one point at which Jesus said to him, flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but God in heaven revealed this to you. He spoke the words of God. This guy is incredible. In Matthew chapter 10 verse 1, he was called the protos, the first in rank. First was Peter. So Peter's probably the guy. If not all 12 thought Peter was the first or the greatest in the kingdom, I think there was at least one who thought Peter was the greatest in the kingdom. and that would be Peter. After all, I did walk on water. But see, there are other people who've got a different grading system than Peter. They're looking at Peter and going, you know, he did walk on water, and he does some interesting things, but he also almost drowned. Okay? I mean, that's a negative, a plus, minus, okay? You're kind of even there. It's a wash. Sorry. And yes, it's true that God, Jesus said to you that flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you, at God, and you spoke the very words of God, but just in a few minutes later, you were trying to stop the whole redemptive plan. You interrupted Jesus going to the cross, and he had to say to you, get behind me, Satan. He never said that to me. So I don't think it's Peter. I think it's John. John was a disciple that Jesus loved, and he was probably just this gentle, caring, loving guy. Maybe he was a little mushy. I don't know, but he was okay. And somebody who's got a different grading system would look at it. It wasn't John. it wasn't Peter, it was James. James had passion. He cared about things. It was all out here, and you knew where James was at. And if your grading system valued passion, then you had James, the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. But if you had a different grading system, you would have seen a different thing about James. What you would have seen about James is that he got a little angry. There was always kind of a tinge to his voice. He was always wanting to call, fire down from heaven and burn him up. Ah, no, no. Maybe it was Andrew. See, I got a different grading system. These up front type guys drive me a little nuts after a while. It's not, it's the Andrews. The behind the scenes, gentle, quiet, just bringing people. And, you know, some of you are going, yeah. Because that's your grading system. Yeah, you know, that's how you do it. Yeah, it's really the Andrews. Who's the greatest? We do that too. We got our own little grading systems. We are keeper trackers. And by the way, it's important that you keep this in the context of kingdom stuff. This is in the context of the church. The disciples aren't coming to Jesus as a bunch of pagans off the street. They care about the church. They care about the kingdom stuff. We just want to know where we rank in the kingdom. We know we're in. How are we doing? We do that. Who's the greatest in the kingdom? You don't talk like that. Who's the greatest Christian? What's your definition of a great Christian? Well, obviously it's a missionary. If that's your grading system, that's what you think. And if you are a missionary, you feel good about that. If you're not, you feel inferior because of that. Who's the greatest in the kingdom? Maybe it's a minister. Maybe it's some sort of up-fronter. Maybe it's some miracle worker, some gift operator. Maybe it's none of that. Maybe it's like you're like the Andrew person. You kind of get sick of the up-fronter type people. You know that isn't necessarily what greatness is in a kingdom. So it is the nice person. It's just this quiet person. And you, yeah, that's the greatest. he's the greatest and we argue amongst ourselves we're too mature to have these conversations but we have them at night when you can't go to sleep you have them I don't but you probably do that make it bigger than that make it about movements the fundamentalists are the greatest in the kingdom everybody else has a piece of truth But the fundamentalists, they are the greatest in the kingdom. I'll allow that there are other people in the kingdom, but they are the greatest. No, it's not. It's the evangelicals. No, it's not the evangelicals. It's the charismatics. They have the whole thing. No, no, no. It's the Baptists. No. Why? Are you all Baptists? I'm from that whole. Okay, forget it. It's the Lutherans. It's the Catholics. It all depends on what your grit is. It all depends on what your system of grading is. And you have an idea. Maybe it's the Bible thumpers. They're the greatest. No, it's not. It's the social activists. You know, we've been bugged by those people. They really are the greatest in the kingdom. Who is it? And so the 12 come to Jesus like we would. Only, again, I think we think we're too slick for this, but it happens. He's confronting a dynamic that does happen. And we come to Jesus and we say, well, you tell us, Lord. We want you to know that we are so submissive to your lordship, and we are so honoring of your authority that we will just come to you, and you're God, and so you settle this issue for us. Tell us who is the greatest in the kingdom. What they're really asking is this. Hear this. What we want to know is who among us is doing the best job of gaining our own life. That's what I want to know. Oh, yeah, I'm a Christian. But yeah, that's all fine. Grace for salvation, sure, sure, sure. But I want to know how I'm performing now. How am I doing at gaining my own life and gaining my own status and position in the rankings of the kingdom of God? Then the confrontation. Verse 2, And he called the child to himself and set him before them and said, Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you won't even enter the kingdom of heaven. this is a major confrontation first thing he's saying to them is this in terms of the waves i see this coming in waves you know as it even dawns on them you know what he's saying to them the first thing he's saying is this first of all you guys are asking the entirely wrong question the question is not who's the greatest in the kingdom the question is who has entered the kingdom and now right now i'm going to put a little child on my lap and i'm going to tell you this the answer to who enters the kingdom, by putting the child on his lap, he was saying to them, it's someone who is 180 degrees different than you. And the reason I know that is because he uses the word convert, which means to change. Unless you change, unless you turn in terms of your thinking and your perspective of what greatness is, you won't even enter the kingdom of heaven. There are some qualities that this child has. There are inherent qualities in this child that you don't have, that you need to look at real hard in order to even enter. In fact, for you to enter, two things need to happen. You need to be converted and you need to humble yourselves. Major confrontation. If John Madden was calling the play-by-play on this, I know I run the risk because some of you don't watch football. I can't imagine that, but if John Madden's calling the play-by-play on this, and Jesus goes, whap! That's what he does. The disciples just got whapped. I think to really get the force of this confrontation and what Jesus is saying, though, we need to, as much as we possibly can, become the disciples. I don't know if that's possible, but I think you can enter into it just by the dialogue we've already had because we have some of these same questions, some of the same postures in our own spirit. So let's become the disciples and think about some of the ways in which we'd respond to what Jesus said. And as I just let the impact of that confrontation fall on me because something that wasn't very pleasant for me this week and even later in the week because the sermon was very hard for, it didn't break. That's the term around the office. How's your sermon doing? It ain't breaking yet. What that means is it's not ready to preach. My heart's not moving. And one of the problems is because this is a major confrontation on me. The truth is, I, in my living, identify much more with the apostles than honestly the child and what those characteristics are. The first response, I think, to this word would be shock. Absolute shock. Unless you become like this child, you won't even enter. It didn't even enter their mind that they weren't in the kingdom. No, Jesus, you don't get it. That's nice. I mean, I like these little dialogues about who gets in the kingdom. We did that in Matthew 5. That's really neat. But you probably didn't hear our question. We weren't wondering about who was in. We're in. We know that. We're wondering who is great in the kingdom, already in. So don't say this stuff like we're not in. That's weird. being the performers that they are, I think some of the things they're doing in their minds is they're beginning to catalog all the right behaviors that they do, all the right beliefs that they have, all the right thoughts that they have that prove that Jesus is wrong, that they really aren't outside the kingdom, that they really are in the kingdom. After all, Jesus, we do demons. We've done demons. We've healed people in your name. We've preached the kingdom. We've declared your deity. I mean, there's all sorts of people all over the place who don't even think you're God, and we do. I mean, put that right in the church context. You know, there's all sorts of people out there who don't even believe that Jesus is God, and we do. So, I mean, if we're not in the kingdom, who is? Very quietly, very gently, but with the authority of thunder. If you're not in who is, here's who is, someone who has the qualities of this child. By the way, if nothing else is accomplished at this first entry level, this shock level, if nothing else is accomplished at this level he's at least got their attention. Whoa! I think from shock they would move to confusion. Confusion. What in the world would be the qualities of this child that I would somehow have to have in order to enter the kingdom? What does he have that I don't have? Or what do I have that he doesn't have and maybe what I have is some sort of baggage that I need to get rid of? What could it be? And I'm looking at this kid now. What is it about him? let's look at the kid little child the greek word for child there is paideon and what that indicates to us it is helpful because it means a child anywhere from a toddler age to seven years old seven years old seven years old right about there that put him from a toddler up to maybe somebody in second grade at the very oldest first or second grade put him a little preschool to second grade so he takes this little child out and he sticks him on his knee and says this is what the kingdom looks like. And I'm looking at him and I'm going, okay, what is it? He's cute. Maybe that's what gets you in the kingdom, being cute, okay? I put a dimple here. I don't know. What is this? He's, I, you know, I think of children and children are innocent. Oh, yeah, okay. He's a first grader. Innocent, okay? I mean, if it was a little tiny baby, I could deal with, oh, innocent. guileless oh they're so soft this first grader i got a first grader and a second or a kindergartner you know it's got to be some maybe there's something about his behavior that i need to adopt maybe i should become more innocent like a child maybe i should become more guileless like a child just adopt his behavior i mean start looking at his behavior it's a little child's behavior kids at that age, they obey all the time. They listen to everything that mom and dad say. They believe easily. They submit. Don't they? At that age, first grade, kindergarten, preseason, they are so selfless at that age. It's just... Always appropriate. And my kids, you know, at that age, they're always, they just kind of walk next to you, and if you stop, they stop, and if you go, they go, and if you want to talk to somebody, no problem, and they they just look adoringly up into your eyes. Hi, Dad. You're my hero. I think we get our theology from pictures, you know? You ever seen those pictures? Growing up in Sunday school, I saw them, and there's these little pastel colors, and it's on the wall I'm looking at. Jesus with the children, and it's all soft, and they're in a meadow, and the kids are all around Jesus, and Jesus is looking, and they're all looking again adoringly at Him and going, oh. The only place that works is in a picture where we've got him frozen, you know? The kid that they put on Jesus' knee was a kid. He was a normal child, a regular kid. Get into this a little bit more. If we actually did that here, right now, today, and the kids hadn't left, and I kind of went to some of you over here, and I said, okay, come on, let's let your little boy go and bring him on up here. You would panic. You would go nuts. you would go berserk because you know what he's going to do when he gets up here. He's going to act like a kid. He's not going to look adoringly at Pastor. He's going to pick his nose. He's going to, you know, do that. I had the funnest time sitting over here during worship. And, you know, this is my third time through this. And I know what I'm going to say now. I was watching some of you with your kids. Yeah, some of you were having a terrible time. Oh, you're trying so hard to worship, and he's pulling your glasses off. You know? Oh, it was terrible. That cute little guy, isn't he something? All the adults are adoring Jesus, and the kids are kind of slouching their chairs. If we brought one up here, eventually, he'd be scared for a while, so he looked like that. But after a while, he started acting like a kid. So is that what it is about a child that I need to emulate? Being like, no, it can be his behavior. You know the truth about kids? Sometimes they do believe, and they believe easier than adults. And sometimes they do have faith. And as parents, you've sat at their bedside sometimes and learned lessons about God and simplicity and innocence from your children. And that moves you. And sometimes they make your heart sing, don't they? and other times they don't. But you know what that's a picture of? The childlike behavior, what that's a picture of is the disciples. It's a picture of you and me. You know what? Sometimes you believe. It's easy. It's innocent. It's like a child. It feels good. Sometimes you obey, and it's just because it came from the heart, filled with the Spirit. Sometimes it's just there, and sometimes it isn't. So if I'm looking at this child and I'm trying to figure out what it is different about that kid than me, it can't be behavior because our behaviors are the same. Sometimes wonderful. Sometimes real frustrating. There's got to be something else. We've got to dig deeper. And as I look at that child, and if the disciples were, something would begin to dawn on them that that child had or didn't have that they had or didn't have. and there was something that that child had as a way of life that as an adult i didn't have and that was this that child was absolutely dependent that child was absolutely vulnerable without a source as an adult one of the things i love about being an adult is that I am independent. I am in control. I am self-sufficient. I am not vulnerable. In the ways, in the areas that I am vulnerable, I will work my head off to not be. And if I can't overcome it, I'll hide it as much as I can. So you don't see it. I'll cover it with intellect. I'll cover it with money. I'll cover it with car, with clothes. I'll cover it. kids sometimes are scared if dad isn't right there I hated being scared don't you hate being scared don't you hate being confused I hated that and all of a sudden it dawns on the disciples what the characteristics of the child are that allow them to be in the kingdom and then function in power in the kingdom and you know what that shock of his confrontation that turned to confusion then turns to resistance because now I'm looking at this kid and it doesn't feel so, oh, isn't that nice being a child? Yeah, I should be more like a child. The qualities he's dealing with, you don't want. I want to be independent. You know what? I've spent most of the energy of my life, the disciples would say, and so would you and I, getting independent, getting self-sufficient so I can protect myself from anything and anybody. Oh, yes, I'm a Christian, of course, but really our relationship with God very much is adding God to our life. And I'm even talking to redeemed people. In terms not of, if you get down to my heart, I am dependent, but in terms of my living, it's God got kind of added here, you know. And I'm really cranking it out myself. The shock turns to confusion. When I realize what characteristics Jesus is really talking about, it turns to resistance. And I want to tell you something, that that resistance to dependence began in the garden. it's part of our humanity let me do a little teaching to you and bring you back to our very identity as created beings I'm going to bring you back into the garden, into Genesis in the beginning, God created and when he came to the point of creating man and woman, he said this about his creation of humanity, he said man has been created in the image of God, he is created in the image of God, what that means is that all men on the face of the earth, all around the earth, pagan or not, are bearers of the image of God And what that means is there is some way in which every single person on the earth has a likeness to God. They bear the image of God. The question you have to ask is, in what ways are all people like God? Let me tell you just a few ways. Number one, God is a person. So is man. God has personality. So does man. I have a personality. You might not like my personality, but I have one. So do you. What do I mean by personality? What I mean by that is this. I am built differently than a rock. You are equipped differently than an animal or a dog, your pet. You have different equipment. You have the capacity to love. You have the capacity to hate. You have the capacity to be in relationship with other people. You have the capacity to reason. You have the capacity to think. You have the capacity to choose. I want this, I want that. You have the capacity to feel emotions. in all of those capacities you are like God because God can do all those things. And you are a bearer of the image of God in that arena. And by the way, I hope that feels good. It ought to. That brings a certain dignity to every single human being, lost or not, on the face of the earth. They have dignity. They are image bearers. Some of them are fallen and never redeemed, but they are image bearers. In what way am I different from God? In the creation. Here's one significant way as it relates to our study this morning. One of the most significant ways that I am different is this. God is independent. What that means is God needs nothing outside himself to exist. He is independent. I am not independent. I was created dependent. And in that creation, here's God, independent. He needs nothing outside himself to exist or to be full. I was created in the image of God, and I was an image bearer. And like a mirror, I have all the qualities of God in me, and the personality and love, and all of those things are there. But the difference between me and God is this. I am dependent, and it is in this dependent relationship that life and love and joy and fullness comes. When man rebelled against God, you know what he got? His independence. He said this, I want to be like God in every way, and that means I want to be independent by myself, and I want to make it on my own. A little theory I have. We see man rebelling against God, and we think, somewhere along the line, Adam and Eve decided, I don't like God anymore, and I don't want to be part of God anymore, and I just want to go over here and do my own thing. I don't think that's what happened. I think Adam and Eve are going, yeah, I love God. God's great. He's, boy, oh boy, source, our creator. I'm going to worship him on Saturday or Sunday or whenever we do that. That's going to be great. I don't mind God. I don't like what I rebel against is dependence. I just hate dependence. And he went over here and he said, God, we'll be great friends, but I'm going to do it myself. So he got his independence, and he got his control, and he began to strive for self-sufficiency. And from that position of control, self-sufficiency, and independence, man asks questions like this. Who's the greatest? How am I doing? How's all my striving working? What do I rank? That's at the core of all that question. Same question was being dealt with. Same sin was being dealt with in Jeremiah 2, verse 13, where God, through the prophet Jeremiah, said, I have two sins that I need to deal with you about. The first sin is this. You have forsaken me, and I am the fountain of living water, and in relationship with me, you got water, and you were able to drink and live and feel your humanity to its fullest. But you have forsaken me, and then you have gone, it says in that 13th verse, to dig your own cisterns, to dig your own wells. And what that means is you have left this dependent relationship and gone over here to do all sorts of good things still. You're still doing all the God stuff, and you're going, God, you're really great, look at what I'm doing for you. But see, I'm in control now, and I'm doing my own thing, and I'm digging my own well, and I've got a problem with that. God says you're talking like you're not in rebellion to me what you're in rebellion is to his dependence and you'll never know me unless you're dependent on me there's a problem you need to know about God says in that 13th verse after he says the sin that you do is you forsake me you dig your own wells the problem is this after you dig your own wells your wells leak your wells leak let me give you a little advice about this you're dealing with people who are digging their own wells the problem is this and by the way this fits whether it's a non-redeemed person who is in a secular sense digging his own well getting his own life and his own value by his own striving or it's a Christian who's forgotten this position of dependence and has gone his own way and is building his church his own way his in the flesh digging his own cistern way the thing is this when you start digging your own well you know what it feels like? it feels great it feels great because it's satisfying all the human needs you've got to be on your own. I'm digging it. It may not be good, but it's going to be mine. You know, here we go. I'm digging it. It's feeling great at this level. I got a word for you. If you're in relationship with anybody who's begun to dig their own well outside the power of dependence on God for what's going on, don't try to talk them out of it. Don't lie. It's working. But guaranteed, when you out of dependence on God begin to dig your own well, somewhere along the line it's going to start leaking water. and then when it starts leaking water, you know what you're easy to get to? Brokenness. It isn't working. Sometimes people never get to brokenness and dependence on God for their life because their wells dry up or they leak. You know what they do? They dig another well. Well, that one, I just did it wrong. Let's go over here and do it again. Try another one and they go from this to that to that and maybe a bigger house or a car or whatever. Need another degree, that'll do it. I'm not telling you not to buy a house or get a car or get a degree but if that's what you're doing to get your value it's going to leak, I guarantee it Isaiah the prophet said the same thing through God, God through the prophet Isaiah when he said in chapter 50 verse 11 you guys are in darkness and instead of coming to me for the light you're lighting your own fire there's a problem with lighting your own fires and digging your own wells you're going to have to live with them and when you light your own fires it doesn't give very much light and when you dig your own wells it leaks you know what people who light their own fires and dig their own wells ask questions like this who's the greatest how am I doing how does my well look how bright is my fire you know the more I think about this and I'm honest with my own spirit, this whole concept of real dependence on God is something, I don't even know what it means. I got a word for you, Jesus says, if you're ever going to enter the realities of the kingdom, you're going to have to become like a child who realizes at the core, their only hope is Jesus. If I don't have him, I die. And it's not getting to God so I can do the good thing. It's getting to God so I can live and whatever happens from there, fine. Whatever doesn't happen from there, fine, but this is where I live. So to go from shock to confusion to resistance, I got a question about the resistance. How do you break the resistance? Let's say you've come to a point where you really see that, boy, that's where I am. I hate dependence. That just, it goes against my humanity. I hate that, my humanness. Well, it says in the text here, you're going to have to humble yourself. humble yourself and become like a child. So everybody get ready, go. Ready, go. Humble yourself. That's what that means. Okay. You ever see anybody act humble? They're not humble. They're acting humble because they heard a sermon that says you need to be humble. So they go, they leave acting humble. Don't act humble. I hate that. I can't stand being around people who are acting humble. Being around broken people is kind of nice. You see, that's the key, isn't it? You don't, you can't, I don't think you can choose the behavior of humility. And I'm afraid that in the evangelical community and in our church and in me is this capacity to act humble and not be humble. So I have to ask one question. Where does the resistance get broken? It gets broken when I humble myself. Now I got another question. How does the humble humility come? The answer to that is it comes through brokenness. Now I got another question. Where does brokenness come from? well I think in the context of our lesson today brokenness comes when you see your sin number one and then you see your helplessness to do anything about it a lot of people have seen their sin and they go dig a well to try to get rid of their sin okay I'm a mess I'll try harder I'll memorize a little more what I need to do is see my sin all my motives the real reason I do what I do even the good things I do even the demons I cast out even the healing I bring even the preaching I do and get in touch with some of the internal real reasons I do that that is digging my and when I see the sin I realize I'm helpless to change that that produces brokenness brokenness comes when I begin to get in touch with all the ways in which I light my own fires and dig my own wells there are some obvious ways that you and I light our own fires and dig our own wells there are ways that you're aware of You could probably say, you know, I do that there. There are other ways that we light our own fires and dig our own wells that we're not even aware of. They've just become part of how we live and how we function with each other. I've got a word for you. When you begin and when I begin to get in touch with some of the hidden ways I light my own fire and dig my own well, and some of the hidden ways in which I act independently of God in the name of God, when I start getting a glimpse of some of those things, you know what? It produces more than humility. it's devastating. Let's say that's where we're at. We're past the shock, we're past the confusion, we're past resistance, we've come to brokenness and we've said, Lord, I really recognize that in my fleshiness, in my humanness, dependence is so scary to me. Lack of control, I want to be in control and I've come to the point where the resistance is broken. I really don't want that anymore. I really realize that there's a longing in my soul, a longing in my soul in some paradoxical way. I run away from this, but there's a longing in my soul to be dependent, absolutely dependent, getting my life from you and nothing else. But you know what? While now I want that, I don't know how to get it. How do I become a child? How do I do? Try hard. No, I'm digging a well again. All right. I'm digging a well to become a child now. How do I become a child? How do I live in that dependence? Interesting word in this text. It says you have to do two things to become like a child. Be converted and humble yourself. Humbling yourself comes through brokenness when you see your sin and you can't do anything about it. The word to be converted, it's in the passive in the Greek. Now what that means, and the reason that's an incredible blessing, is what the passive means is that means you can't do it. You can't convert yourself. It's a passive which means the action of conversion is done to you. And conversion here, don't let this word mean some big salvific thing necessarily. Conversion just means to turn. And we are turned when we are saved, when we come into relationship with Christ. But you know what? You need to be transformed your whole life. Being transformed into the image of a son means you spend the rest of your kingdom life turning and turning and turning and turning and being converted and converted and converted and converted and turned and turned and turned. And it comes through brokenness. And I come to God and say, God, I really want to be a child. The resistance is gone. I've been resisting you for a month, and I've been digging my own well, and I am tired of it, and I want to submit, and I want to be a child and independent on you, but now I'm at a point where I can't. I need your power released in me to turn me. That's what salvation is called. That's what transformation is called. That's what regeneration and renewing is called. That's what spiritual growth is called. That's what sanctification is called. he turns you and he converts you and he transforms you the last thing is the culmination in verse four whoever then humbles himself as his child he's the greatest in the kingdom now i'm answering your question you want to know who's greatest the one who humbles himself and becomes like a child which means the one who becomes dependent and the one who lives like that dependent is going to come in and then they were going to experience the reality of the kingdom. What that simply means is this. Whoever enters the kingdom is the greatest. That's what it means. Whoever becomes a child, he's the greatest. It means everybody's the greatest who's in the kingdom. It means nobody's the greatest when they're in the kingdom. Let me ask you a question. How would a Pharisee respond to that? Somebody who's striving and earning their own value. How would they respond to that? They'd be a little irritated, I think. Because what that means Does all the good spiritual fasting, giving, praying that they did mean it's not going to help their rank in the kingdom? In fact, the Pharisee may not even be in. How would that word that there's nobody, everybody's the greatest who's dependent on God and says my only hope is you, everybody, how would that sound to a broken, helpless, hopeless person who sees their sin and goes, God, I can't do anything about it unless you do something? How would that sound to them? Sounds like good news. Let me put it in an illustration I think we can understand about who's the greatest. When he says who's the greatest is the child, and that means everybody's the greatest if they get in by becoming dependent on him as their source. What it means is the thief on the cross and Billy Graham are both the greatest in the kingdom. The thief on the cross and Billy Graham are both the greatest. And that's kind of a weird thing, and some of you might even be ticked, because here's Billy Graham, and he's been preaching all his life and telling people about the kingdom, and through his ministry, people have been saved. Thousands and thousands and thousands of people have been saved, And now this thief over here got saved, but he kind of did it at the last minute under the carpet there and right at the wire. And how in the world can you say that he's the greatest? Billy Graham is obviously greater in the kingdom than him. That's baloney. No, it's not baloney. Jesus says it right here because the thing that qualifies people for the kingdom is not that they preached all their life. Even if they preached good and people got saved. For him personally, for you personally, not one thing you do, even in the kingdom context, qualifies you or places you in a position that is greater than anybody else. Because the thing that qualifies Billy Graham, the thing that qualifies the thief on the cross, is the thing that qualified the child. And that is this, Billy Graham with all his sermons, the thief with all his evil work, both came to a point in their life where they said, my only hope is you. My only hope is you. Great. In the kingdom. this word started in Matthew 5 where Jesus said blessed are the broken for theirs is the kingdom blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness which isn't theirs they can't get it themselves they're the ones who are in the kingdom blessed are those who mourn over their sin and realize they can't in the flesh do anything about their sin they're the ones who are going to get comfort theirs is the kingdom you know why broken hungry mourning people get in the kingdom because they're just like children it may be this morning that you're among us and you've never entered into a relationship with Jesus you are not among the redeemed and in a secular sense you've been digging your own wells and lighting your own fire and some of your digging of wells has been the digging of a well of success you're real successful in your business you've gotten good grades maybe you got a lot of money and that's kind of working maybe but you know deep in your soul with all the stuff you've got you're aware that something's leaking. It isn't giving you life. Some of you have, in a secular sense, dug your well, and it's been not with success because you tried that well and it didn't work because you weren't successful. And so you kind of went the other way. You couldn't get acceptance. You couldn't get love that way. So you dug your own well this way, and you went to drugs and alcohol and sex and all sorts of rebellion, and you dug that well, and it kind of felt good for a while. But you know what? After a while, you looked at that, and you go, oh, boy, this is leaking. This is leaking. I got good news for you there is a well that you can go to and the water don't run dry we kind of get dried when we get off on our own and we start kicking in our own fires again but the word for you if you're digging your own well is this truly I say to you unless you're converted and become like a child you'll never enter the kingdom, you'll never enter life come to life. Come to Jesus and say, my only hope is you. You know what he's going to do? He's going to turn you. He's going to turn you. I think there may be even more of you this morning who, like me, are among the redeemed. But like me, you're being made aware of the ways you dig your own well. And you light your own fire. And like me, if you're honest, you can see how you relate better to the disciples who want to know how you're doing more than the child who just in simple dependence is getting their life from Jesus. You're digging wells and light and fires that aren't secular, they're spiritual. I got a word for you. Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he's the one who's greatest in the kingdom. So I would call some of you too dependent for the first time. This text, however, would call some of you back too. dependence. Become like children. Let's pray. God, I think in our spirit, every one of us longs for what we were created for. We really do. Those unredeemed, those redeemed. But we really do stumble. We are like children in the behavior sense that we get this sometimes, we don't get it other times. But God, by your spirit, would you just gently move among us? Just gently move among us. Maybe the way Jesus did when he brought a powerful, heavy confrontation in a very gentle way by putting a child on his lap. God, in some other way, maybe bring that dynamic to us. Reveal to us the ways that we're like the disciples, wanting to know how we're doing, surrounding ourselves with behaviors and proof that we're okay. Reveal to us the ways in which we're digging our own wells and lighten our own fires so we can be called back to dependence where you want to fill us with water and you want to give us light. Bless this word in our hearts and our lives as we leave in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
