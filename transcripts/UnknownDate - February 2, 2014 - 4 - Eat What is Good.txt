When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the Apostles' hands, he offered them money and said, me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit. Peter answered, may your money perish with you because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money. You have no part or share in this ministry because your heart is not right before God. Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin. Then Simon answered, Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me. And also from Isaiah 55, 1 through 2, Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters. And you who have no money, come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost? Why spend money on what is not bread and your labor on what does not satisfy? Listen, listen to me and eat what is good and you will delight in the richest of fair. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Well, in that text from Isaiah, Did you catch the invitation? Did you hear it? Did you really hear it? Eat what is good. Eat what is good. If you and I could sit down at the coffee shop of your choice, and we could have a conversation, I would most likely ask you a series of questions. And one of the questions I would love to ask you is, when is the last time you felt really satisfied to the depths of your soul? And I wonder how you would answer. And if you were smart, you would say, you go first. Right? You go first. Because it's a vulnerable question, isn't it? It's an intimate question, actually. and it's a question that actually can drive us to some pain. Eat what is good. The prophet invites us. And this text that Dave has been so masterfully leading us through in Acts chapter 8 is all about two different kinds of leaders and two different kinds of powers that invite you to eat two different kinds of things. do you see that two different kinds of leaders brokering two different kinds of powers offering you to eat two different kinds of things first of all you have philip and remember where we're at in the story that the church that has been born in the beginning of the story in acts which was marked by signs and wonders and the favor of all the people has now been scattered from Jerusalem. And from Jerusalem, a guy named Philip went down to Samaria. And in Samaria, you have people that don't really know a whole lot about the scriptures. And so, you know, when Simon the sorcerer comes, they're like, yeah, give me some more of that. And when Philip comes, they're like, yeah, give me some more of that. And so Peter walks down to this city where everyone is eager to eat whatever it is that it is offered to them. And Peter with the heart of a shepherd goes in the words, or Dave echoing Peter's words, not everything is good. Sometimes you got to sort the fish, and I love, I have loved Dave's shepherd's heart for the church these last couple weeks. Have you not loved that? It's like his heart to say, not everything is good to eat. So a good leader helps us discern what it is that we're eating, what kind of power that it is that we're tapping into. So first of all, we read about Philip's power. It's from God's spirit, and it's redemptive in nature. It sets people free. Philip understands this power comes from outside of himself, and he is merely a channel through which that power flows. So let's read about it again in Acts chapter 8, verses 6 through 8. The crowds from Samaria listened to Philip. They saw the miraculous signs that he did, and they all paid close attention to what he said. An evil spirit screamed and came out of many people. Many who were disabled or who couldn't walk were healed. And so there was great joy in that city because when the Spirit of God shows up and there's a demonstration of that kind of power, the result is healing and freedom and what? Joy, thank you, joy is the result and the characteristic of the Spirit showing up with power. Joy. Then you have the contrast in the very next verse of Simon's power. His power is different. It's manipulative in nature. It traps people in himself because I think he's come to believe that he's the source of that power. And before you wag your finger at Simon too much, that's a very seductive thing for any leader. and the line is very, is razor thin. And believing that the power comes from somewhere outside of yourself and believing that the power somehow comes from inside of yourself. Let's read about Simon. A man named Simon lived in the city. For quite a while he practiced evil magic there and he amazed all the people of Samaria. He claimed to be someone great. And I don't know how that goes. Like, does he send emails to people? Come to my thing because I am someone great. Send. he claimed to be someone great and all the people listened to him from the least important of them to the most important so there was something very captivating about simon it wasn't he wasn't just a person who ministered to or appealed to a small group of people really smart people followed him all kinds of people followed him they exclaimed this man is known as the great power of god Whoa, he amazed them for a long time with his magic or with his illusion. So they followed him. What does it mean to be led by a person who gives you illusion? Something that looks good, looks shiny, looks nourishing, but at the end of the day makes you sick. And question, how do you tell the difference between a leader who's empowered by God's spirit and a leader who's empowered by a manipulative spirit? Because frankly, they're both pretty captivating and pretty compelling. And sometimes it's easy to tell, but many times it's not. And that's the nature of illusion. It looks real until you get a real good taste of it. And when you notice you're sick, it's too late. So what are the marks of a leader who manipulates and controls? Well, there's a book that was written about 20 years ago by a guy named Dave Johnson and Jeff Van Vondren, two guys that are well known to Open Door, called The Subtle Power of Spiritual Abuse. And if you've ever been in a religious system or a family system that is abusive spiritually, you need to read this book. We still carry it in the bookstore. And so some of the marks of a leader that manipulates and controls, many marks are in this book. I'm going to pull out a few. One of them is that they power posture. Their posture is they are in authority, and they're going to remind you of that at all times. I'm in charge, and if you start infringing in on my role, I'm going to let you know about that. It's very important to them that they polish the outside of the cup and of the dish. They are the people that like the important seats, and they are the people that like the important titles, And they're the people that like to remind you who's in charge and set the rules. I was talking to Dave about this a few years ago, actually. And he goes, you know, Steve, there's a difference between authority that's given to you by position and authority that's given to you by God. And he pauses and looks me right in the eyes. We were driving, so I didn't look at him because I didn't think I was driving. And he goes, you want that one, the one that's given to you by God. That's the authority that you want. A leader that's marked by manipulation and control is really occupied with performance, her own or his own, and especially yours. You're valuable only to the degree that you move his or her product forward. And you don't make him or her look bad or his or her system look bad. You for sure can't expose a problem in that system. If you expose a problem in that system, guess what? You're the problem. You become the problem. There's unspoken rules in a system like this. Rules like it's better to be nice than to be honest. Rules like I'm the pastor, you can't disagree with me. Rules like how things look is more important than how things are. I remember listening to Dave's messages from years and years ago, and he said, you know, it's like most of the churches that we grew up in, there was an invisible banner hanging over the altar. And the banner said, around here, how things look is more important than how things really are. So get in line. And don't talk about what's not good. Make it look shiny and happy. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. We're great. Doing great. How are you? Doing great. How are you? Doing great. All right, let's go. And then in the car, you fight all the way home. A leader who manipulates and controls claims to be the only person who knows the truth. You ever been around someone like that where it's like, whoa, whoa, you kind of get the picture that we're the only place in town that has the truth. And don't go there, and don't go there, and don't go there, and don't go there, and don't go there. And if you do, we'll never talk to you again. That's not food that is good. a leader who manipulates and controls ends up using, devouring, and then discarding people. And some of you have been in systems like that. And you end up feeling alone, totally defective, and outcast. So, what are the marks of a leader empowered by the Spirit? That's kind of what I want to talk more about, frankly. Let's return to Isaiah 55. Verses 1 and 2. Come, all of you. You could stop right there. Couldn't you? Come, all of you. But we're not going to stop there because it gets way better. All of you who are thirsty, come and drink the water I offer you. You who do not have any money, come. Buy and eat the grain I give you. Come and buy, but not just grain. We're not going to stop with grain. Grain is nourishing, but it doesn't taste that good. Come. Buy wine and milk. Now we're talking, right? now this meal's getting better. You will not have to pay anything for it. And then the question, why spend your money on what is not food? Why work for food for what does not satisfy you? And then the prophet says, listen carefully to me. Then you will eat what is good. You will enjoy the richest food there is. I think a leader that's empowered by the Spirit of God, a leader that understands that the power comes from outside of herself, and she's just a channel, that kind of leader ends up being surrounded by hungry and thirsty people. You ever notice that? Messy people. The people that don't have a lot of money end up flocking around leaders like that. Because the invitation is, come, all of you. We have a table that is set and a place is laid for you and nothing will be held back. Because at the table around which we gather, there is enough for all of us. And you don't have to come with your money. There's not an exchange that's going to happen. I'm not going to give it to you if you act a certain way or if you are a certain amount of healthy. I'm just going to offer it to you because I tasted it and it's that good. Psalm 34, 8. Taste and see that the Lord is what? Think about it and ponder that the Lord is good. Do a Bible study and consider how good the Lord is. Get a mouthful. Swish it around in your mouth. Take it all the way in. And notice how it changes you from the inside out. And then bursting out of your mouth with joy will be, God really is good. I've tasted it. you know you've been around a leader that's empowered by the Spirit when that's your reaction. Not, wow, that leader is great. Now you may think that leader is great. You may say that she's great. But internally you've been changed because you ate something that you really needed that she couldn't manufacture on her own. She's a great cook. And a leader that is empowered by the Spirit invites thirsty people to drink and hungry people to eat and just says, come, just come, all of you, all of you, come. The table's big. The table's set. The table has a place for you, so come. What they actually offer is satisfying and nourishing because what they're doing, you guys, is they're taking you by the hand and they're saying, I'm hungry too. So I'm not going to lead you to my table. I'm going to lead you to the table. Psalm 23. The Lord is my shepherd. And because that's true, there is nothing that I need. Nothing I'm in need of. I have everything that I need because he leads me. This shepherd, he's such a good shepherd. He leads me to lie down in green pastures. If you're a sheep, what's green pastures? Food? Did someone say food? If someone didn't say food, I'll just say, Food! But it's the first food of spring. It's the first most nutritious grass that springs up in the springtime. The Lord leads me to the most nutritious, most delicious food. He leads me beside what? Still waters. Do you see the picture here? Food and drink. The Lord leads me there. Quiet waters because when sheep would go and drink in certain waters, if they were lost and alone, that's where ravenous wolves and other animals would wait for them and they would pray on them. And so he leads me beside quiet waters means he leads me to drink in ways that are safe, that I won't get used up, I won't get devoured, and it is beautiful. Wise leaders, leaders that are empowered by the Spirit, help people to discern how to eat what is good. When was the last time you were satisfied? When was the last time you sat down at a table and ate? until you felt like God really was inside of you and nourishing you from the inside out. The table is a place that we come to because we say Jesus is the food and the host. You know, it's like crazy. this is his table and he offers himself and he says eat drink I'm enough I'll satisfy and you'll be filled with joy I think Peter was a leader that was empowered by the spirit and the reason why I think so is because at the at the end of this maybe you maybe you missed this but I didn't Acts chapter 8 verses 20 and 23. See what you see here. Peter answered Simon, and this is tough, man. May your money be destroyed with you. You think you can buy God's gift with money? You have no part or share in this holy work. So he's just like, whoa! I mean, he is grabbing his machaira and he is filleting Simon. He is revealing his innermost motivations. Your heart is not right with God. I can see it. And then he says this. Turn away, Simon, from this evil sin of yours and pray to the Lord. And perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. Oh, I see that you're very bitter. I see that you're a prisoner. And then I imagine Peter's eyes changing. And I imagine him looking at Simon and saying, the shepherd that I follow, there was a day that he went back to his hometown and he was handed this scroll. He opened up that scroll and he read from the prophet. And what he said is, I've come to set prisoners free. So Simon, today may be the best day of your life. Today may be the day that you could get set free because, Simon, there is a place at this table for you, but you cannot buy it with money. You have to come and eat. So here's the question. In the little white space in between verse 24 and 25, I wonder what happened to Simon. He says, oh, Peter, pray for me that none of those things might happen to me. What if? What if something happened in Simon's heart? And what if he said, oh my gosh. I have offered people nothing but illusion for my whole life. It's time for me to change. And then what if Peter said, well, Simon, there's room at the table for you. Come. because if it's not true for Simon, then it's not true for you, and it's not true for me, and the glorious message of the gospel is it is true for you. You don't have to buy it. You don't have to earn it. You don't have to show up worthy. You show up to this table unworthy, a prisoner of sin, and you just go, whoop, okay, God, here I am. The last mark of a really good leader, a leader that's empowered by God's Spirit, is they have people in their life that say, oh my goodness, I see that you are very bitter. You're a prisoner of sin. You need to turn away from that sin. And a leader that's empowered by the Spirit goes, you're right. I need to come to the table. The shepherd needs to come to the shepherd's table. And so it is we come this morning. You know, there's actually theology in where we put the table. Do you guys know that? Look at where the table is in this room. Where is it? Say it out loud. Front and center. Same level. I'm not in between you and the table. You don't have to go through me. I need the table just as much as you do. Dave needs it even more. so you guys what if we could eat what is good what if it was all right there everything you needed to turn from sin, to turn toward God, to be forgiven, to be filled with joy. What if it was all right there? Question, who's hungry? Who's thirsty? I got one word for you. Come. Amen. Thank you.
