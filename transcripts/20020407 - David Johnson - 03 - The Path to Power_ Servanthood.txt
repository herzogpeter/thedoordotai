Thank you, Matt. Let's pray as we go to the Word. Father, my request and desire is that you would use the Word that we're going to examine this morning to prepare us for our coming around the table and our encounter with you there. I pray that in your name. Amen. The way of preparation for our coming to the table this morning, in the spirit of the season, actually, that we're in as a church, as well as we've all kind of recognized that as we anticipate where we're going, both physically in our move to Maple Grove and where it is we're going spiritually, this is a season of preparation and consecration. And also in keeping with this series we're in right now, particularly, specifically examining the issue of rightly ordered power, all those things in mind, I'd like to ask you to turn your attention with me to the Gospel of John this morning, to the 13th chapter, an incident in the life of the disciples and their interaction with Jesus that I believe speaks to and invites us into all those things. It invites us into and speaks to preparation and consecration. It speaks to and invites us into rightly ordered power, and it certainly invites us to the table that is the Lord's. Reading from the New International Version this morning, beginning in verse 1. It was just before the Passover feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. The evening meal was being served, And the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. But Jesus knew some things. Jesus knew, among other things, that the Father had put all things under his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God. And knowing all that, that he was about to suffer and die, knowing that Judas would betray him, he knew some other things as well. Sitting at that table, he knew that Peter would deny him. He knew that all of the disciples who were at that table that day at the critical moment would leave him and flee. In the middle of all of that, knowing all of that, he did the most extraordinary thing. Verse 4. He got up from the meal. And just so you have perspective, the meal that we're speaking of here is the Passover meal. It is the meal that he then translates into his meal, the last supper. He is turning the Passover meal into the communion supper that we are going to celebrate right in the middle of the meal, knowing that these friends of his would all turn from him. He took off his outer clothing, wrapped a towel around his waist, poured water into a basin, and began to wash his disciples' feet and drying them with the very same towel that was wrapped around his waist. to just add some nuance in the fullness of expression relative to what was going on in this room and the tension that I think everybody probably felt. I would add a piece that Luke chapter 22 provides for us. Luke is a parallel passage to John, including a piece of information that John does not include. It's this, just prior to Jesus rising from the table, putting the towel around himself and washing their feet, A dispute had arisen among the disciples as to which one of them was regarded as the greatest. And there's some speculation as to when this dispute started, where they're already sitting at the table. Most believe that they walked into the upper room, and they were kind of bickering among themselves. And there was jockeying for position and arguing even about where people were going to sit. The meal began. The bickering continued. Put it together this way. Just be Jesus. as all this stuff is kind of buzzing about. In his own mind, he knows that he is about to suffer and die. He's sitting there. Maybe he even at one point would make eye contact with Judas. Just look at him and know that Judas would betray him. Look over at Peter and know that Peter would deny him. Three times would deny him. All of them would leave him and flee. Hearing them argue, watching them jockey for position, fighting about who would sit where. I can just even hear in my mind Peter kind of mumbling under his breath about why John always gets to sit next to Jesus. It's important to notice, if you're going to get into the text, that it was precisely at that moment, when they were at their worst, that Jesus rose from the table. The way I construct this is without a word, I think, he rose. He didn't say a word. They're continuing to... Took off his outer garment, wrapped a towel around his waist, poured water into a basin, began to wash their feet. Notice now Peter's response when Jesus begins to do this in verse 8. He protests, never shall you wash my feet. What's that about? Lots of speculation. Lots of possibilities and theories as to what it was that created the resistance in Peter. I thought of two possibilities. If this was, you know, a full-blown sermon, not a communion devotional, I would have thought of three, but I've got two. And it really is speculation. It's kind of my best guess at getting into Peter's spirit and wondering what humanly he must have felt. One of my speculations is that maybe part of his resistance was that when he watched Jesus, the King of Glory, who he thought he was and knew him to be, took off his clothes, wrapped a towel, and bent down. It didn't fit Peter's picture. It certainly doesn't fit mine of what a king looks like. It doesn't fit Peter's picture. It certainly doesn't fit mine of what a king would do, how a king would act. Again, he took off his outer garment, wrapped a towel, dried their feet with the towel. The guy's half naked. I mean, we tend to romanticize these scenes. I mean, I don't know what you have in your mind, I, but if you picture it, I play things like a movie, and I'm watching Jesus wash their feet, and I'm watching it like a movie, And I'm going, oh, if we did that, if we did that here, and I took all my clothes off, wrapped it all, would you be okay with that? I don't think so. My wife would not be okay with this. Neither would I. Got to get into the scene the way it really went down. I think there's something embarrassing about what Jesus said. I think there might just be something in me that would look at him doing this, and I'm saying, get up, Jesus. Get up. I mean how are we going to sell this guy as king I believe he's the king But he doesn't look like a king And I really know he's a king But we got to sell this guy to the world I can't sell this This is not the image they're going to buy He looks like I mean he looks like a prostitute Who washed his No I'm not saying he was a prostitute I mean that's a goofy thought I'm not saying he physically looked like but the position he's taking is the one she took. You remember that? When that woman who was referred to in the text as not anything more than a sinner, she was a sinner. Everybody knew what that meant. She was a prostitute. Responding to the amazing grace of God and the fact that in her spirit she knew that this was the anointed one of God, stood behind Jesus, the text says, with tears streaming down her cheeks, Jesus noticed her. She fell at his feet, washed his feet with her tears. The Pharisees went nuts when she did that. But it wasn't even so much about her. She was making a spectacle of herself, and it was humiliating. She was humiliating herself at Jesus' feet. But they were just using this as a way to get back at Jesus because he was allowing all of this, allowing this sinner to touch him. But be Peter, one of the disciples. You know, it was kind of embarrassing what she was doing and awkward. But there was one thing that did ring true. At least everybody was in the right place. Everybody had their right place. And what I mean by that is this. She's bowing down at his feet. I mean, that's, it was humiliating how she did it. I wish she hadn't done it in front of all these Pharisees, you know, maybe behind closed doors someplace. But he's receiving the praise he's due. Everybody's in the right place. She's bowing down. He's standing, as it were, on the throne. I get that picture. This time, he's bowing down at our feet. It's like he's in the place that she was in. I don't get that. It's humiliating. She humiliated herself. Jesus, you're humiliating yourself. Get up. I don't know. I wonder if that was in the pot of Peter's resistance. I think to fully understand the tension here and maybe why Peter was resisting this whole thing, what Jesus was doing in order to get that, I think we need to understand foot washing in that culture. We have foot washing services. Some of you have been part of a foot washing ceremony or seen one. They're powerful in their symbolism and imagery. They're very, very moving. If, in fact, we were to have up here right now a foot washing service, the act itself would be seen by, I think, everyone here as a noble thing. If you saw me wash someone's feet or someone washed my feet, many of you would begin to weep and you would get into the symbolism built into that effect. Because of 2,000 years of history after Jesus did this, there is a nobility about that. That would not have been the initial response. When the disciples saw Jesus do what he was doing. Jesus wasn't having a foot washing service. There wasn't any soft music playing. There wasn't a bulletin to follow. What he was doing was in the context of the flow of their normal life. See, foot washing was something that happened every day there. See, everywhere they went, they walked. And what they wore were sandals. And they walked on dusty, dirty roads. And if dust and dirt was the only problem, it wouldn't be that big a deal. They shared these roads with animals. You stepped in what? Oh, ee, ee, look at that. see someone has to wash the feet washing the feet in that culture was not some wonderful high lofty oh it's so sweet symbolic gesture it was a daily necessity see somebody's got to wash the feet see somebody's got to clean the toilet see somebody's got to sweep the floor take out the trash indeed at the front door of most homes in Jesus day would have been a basin and a towel. It's just part of the furniture. Everybody would, and the first thing you do is have your feet washed. The question is, who washes your feet? First thing that comes to my mind is wash your own feet. Give me a break. You wash your feet, I'll wash my feet. Stay away from my feet. It's a deal. We have a deal. And I'm sure many people wash their own feet, but generally in the culture, it wasn't that way either. The job of washing feet goes to the servant. The job of washing feet goes to the slave. Let them do it. It's why they're here. They serve. We get served. Here's the deal. Here's the deal in the culture. You wash my feet, I'll let you live. The servants, if you're really into what their role would be like and how they would move amongst the movement of people, would be the kind of person you probably wouldn't even see. In fact, the servant would be doing their job best. I just wonder if the servants get back and they have their little serving training. Servant training and their training is the less you are seen, the better job you're doing. Be invisible. I think servants were invisible. In fact, I can see. Can't you? Large group of people comes to the house. The servant washes their feet and they're all involved in conversation. Could you see having your feet washed and just be in a conversation? You don't even see the person. They're like a non-person. I think most of us would feel noble if we didn't notice them and thank them and in fact if it was me and I had my feet washed and I was in conversation and I noticed them and I said thanks very much I would feel better about myself and a little superior to my friend because they're so callous they didn't notice them they weren't even nice to them I was nice to them I gave them a tip maybe at some very tender moments of deep reflection and contemplative prayer all by myself I might have wash over me even an awareness of the servant's nobility and dignity not only in what they do but in who they are but I can tell you one thing absolutely for sure even if I ascended to this great level of appreciation of servants and servanthood I can promise you this I would never want to be them I would never want to be like them which brings me to what I speculate about possibly being the second reason Peter found in him some resistance to being washed by Jesus in this servant role that Jesus took so I wonder if instinctively even beyond words even beyond his own consciousness I wonder if instinctively he knew that built into receiving this kind of gesture from Jesus who he knew to be the king, there was built into that a call to do the same kind of thing. I wonder if he instinctively knew that built into it there was a call to become this kind of person that I just don't want to be, to walk a path that I just don't want to walk. By the way, Peter was going to walk a very interesting path in his obedience to and following of Jesus. And not long after this text, it reveals Jesus says to him, Peter, Satan's going to sift you like weeds. One day, Peter, there's going to come a time in your life where you are bound and taken where you do not want to go, and you're going to go, and it's all going to be because of your servanthood to me. But on the front end, that's not a path I want to walk. I just wonder if that's part of his resistance. Peter was a fisherman. You knew that. I don't know what status fishermen had in that culture. I can't imagine it was very high. Jesus represented to Peter, among other things, a way out of a low status. Jesus was a king. He spoke of that. I believe that. Jesus had a kingdom. Not only was it words and talk about a kingdom, but it was a kingdom of power, and the power Peter had seen. Sick people got well. Dead people got raised. Lepers were healed. Demoniacs were set free. This kingdom was real. And one of the things we heard from the very first day about his introduction of kingdom life was that we could have a part in it. It's part of why they argued about who would be the greatest in this kingdom where there would be authentic, real power. No longer a lowly fisherman. I'm going to be somebody. But then the one who is the king took off his clothes and wrapped a towel around him. He descended, in terms of social rank, he descended to something lower than a fisherman. Not only did he do it, but I just wonder, is he calling me to it? Well, sure enough, in verse 12, look what happens. So when Jesus had washed their feet and that was done and taken his garments back and clothed himself, he reclined at the table again and began to talk. And he said to them, do you know what I've done to you? You call me teacher and Lord and you're right. I am the master. I am the king. If then I, the Lord and the teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. You were right, Peter. There is in this a call. You receive it. There is a call to give it. For I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you. Truly, I say to you as a slave is not greater than his master, neither is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them. Question. What would it look like in our culture, in our DNA, this Sunday afternoon in this neighborhood we live in to wash someone's feet? What would be the equivalent of that today? I mean, I think I've made it clear that washing feet was not a ceremony. It was part of everyday life. So what is the part of everyday life thing that would be the equivalent of this? I don't know for sure what it would be, but I'm pretty sure the equivalent for us would not involve washing anybody's feet. Nobody's feet would be involved. Why? It's not part of our life. In fact, if somebody invited you over for dinner this afternoon And you walked in the door And after you took your shoes off They fell down on the floor, pulled off your socks And slopped water all over it You would not by that be blessed I would not by that be blessed I would be freaked And remember something I had to do somewhere else Again, I make reference to the fact That we have foot washing services We have foot washing ceremonies I think they're wonderful They're powerful in symbolic effect but it occurs to me that it's possible we could have a foot washing service and still not be foot washers. So my mind trying to grapple with what it could be, my mind goes to menial tasks rooted in real life. Things beneath dignity. Like cleaning a toilet or sweeping a floor or changing a diaper. Not of a baby. Babies are easy. Oh, that's my baby. I'm happy to do this for you. I'm such a servant. That's too easy. Changing a diaper of a dying parent or changing a diaper of a dying spouse. He stooped to serve. I don't know if that even gets close. I don't know if those are equivalents. But for me, you see, the most powerful part of this scene which reveals what I think foot washing at its deepest, most profound level is really all about is that he washed their feet, whatever the equivalent of that would be, now I don't know, but the key is that he washed his feet precisely when they were at their worst. That's where this picture comes to life. Jesus, knowing that he was about to suffer and die, he was going to have a bad day. Jesus, knowing that Judas would betray him, Peter would deny him, all of them would leave and flee, Jesus fully aware that at this critical moment in his life as he was anticipating his own suffering all they could think about was their place of power in the kingdom they were arguing amongst themselves it was precisely at that moment he rose from the table I would have kicked them all out he took off his outer garment put on a towel kneeled down at their feet and washed them clean. So ask the question again. What does it look like to wash someone's feet? Well maybe it looks like this. Extending mercy and grace and forgiveness in a tangible serving way to people who just plain don't deserve it. People like you and me. You see, it was while we were yet sinners. It was when we were at our worst, Christ died for us. Christ washed us clean. I think most of you know that in the context of our study on power, We began two weeks ago to talk about what I referred to as the path to power. To rightly ordered kingdom power. The kind that doesn't destroy, it builds. That doesn't tear down, it creates. That doesn't hurt, it heals. And two weeks ago we indicated that such a path to healing, building, creative power really does exist. But that the path to power in the kingdom of God is an odd path. It's an unfamiliar path to most of us, full of paradox and apparent contradiction. For we noted this, that if you're really on the path to authentic kingdom, rightly ordered power, it will quite often feel and look like the wrong path. Because it doesn't always feel or look very powerful at all. we referenced Philippians chapter 2 the path to power embodied in Jesus who although he existed in the form of God regarded equality with God not a thing to be grasped but emptied himself taking on the form of a slave and like a slave became obedient stop right there like a slave became obedient when I think of slaves and obedience what I think of is this that's what slaves do that's what slaves they obey slaves that say things like this yes sir no sir yes ma'am no ma'am how far did he take his obedience he took it to the point of death even death on the cross and my first reaction to that is this you know if I get out of my Sunday school thing and I get into what obedience that cost really looks like the thing in me says that's taking it a little too far he took it he took his obedience a little too far. But here's the deal. It's what we learned two weeks ago. It was precisely because he walked that path of emptying himself, taking on the form of a slave, becoming obedient to God, that he walked that path that sometimes looked like weakness. It was precisely because he did that that God gave to him the name. The name that is above every name. that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow and every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father and that is power. Every knee will bow. That is power. But the path to power didn't look very powerful. The path to power yields real power. And it is going to, as we walk it, yield real power in the church. It is life-giving, resurrection, redeeming, healing power. But the path itself is the way of the cross. It is the way of the servant. It is the way of obedience. The path to power is the way of the basin and the towel that is on the table here before me. The basin and the towel. Odd symbols. of power. Twice in the last several weeks, this being the third, I felt prompted by the Spirit to share with you a picture that came to me in prayer. It was, as you know, if you've been here and heard me speak of this already, the weekend of our consecration service around the money. It was early in the morning and I was praying about the service and trying to prepare my own heart, praying through the Our Father. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. I couldn't get past thy kingdom come. For reasons I don't fully understand, I began to weep. And then I got a picture. It was a physical picture that I hope becomes your picture. And wonder with me what it means and how it's going to get fleshed out. Remember maybe in years to come when you'll get a flash of, you know what, that's what Dave talked about. I just saw it. The picture was of our building in Maple Grove, and it was full of light. It wasn't a physical light. And while I understand that light is symbolic of many things in Scripture, to me the symbol of the light in my little picture on that morning as other things were going on was very clear that it was a symbol of the power of the kingdom of God being actively present and moving and emanating from us as a church. But with that picture came a question. The question was this. How is this kingdom power to be made visible to the community and the city and the nation and the world? Well, my first thought was, well, maybe we should make a sign, announcing to the community, maybe buy some TV space, announcing to the community that we're the power of church. And with this power, we're here to fix you. Because we're so powerful, we're going to use our power to correct you and save you and confront you and use our power to wow you and maybe entertain you. No, the word was very clear. And you who've been here the last few weeks know what it was that came to me and it was for us. know our message to the community, however it is we're going to announce it, and it won't be with words, it will be with what we do. The message is this, we're here to serve you, for we are among you as those who serve. That's why we've come. That's why we're taking up all this space. And that will be the path to whatever kind of power we have in the community. Now to that picture that I've given to you twice before, today I want to add a symbol to it. It's why I even brought the picture up again, because to that picture, I want us to add a symbol provided for us in John 13. And the symbol is the basin and the towel. So, church of the open door, hear the word of the Lord coming to us through John 13 on April 7, 2002. Open door, you are to be a people of the basin and the towel. That is my call on your life and on your community of faith as you go to Maple Grove and express your presence. And as your presence is known in that community, that is how the power will be released as you pick up the basin and the towel. By the way, this is not a new path. But for many of us, it's an unfamiliar path. Please keep in mind that it was Jesus' path. as we gather now around the table I'm going to invite you to do two things number one, come come to the table and receive be one of the disciples, be Peter, pick a disciple don't be any of those, be you be the disciple that you are at the table and come and let him wash you I'm not asking you to come and be redeemed I'm asking you to come and let him wash the dust off your feet. The dust that has accumulated from this week. The dust that accumulated on you from sleeping last night to this morning. The dust of the thoughts that distract you and condemn you and make you feel like you don't have any right to come. Let him come and wash you. Through the symbols of the bread and the cup and the basin and the towel that you see here, let him renew you and love you and forgive you, recognizing fully that some of you today may be at your worst. You know, with that in mind, I would add a third reason. See, I came up with a third. Why Peter might have resisted. I wonder if part of Peter's resistance is consistent with some of your resistance to coming to the table and meeting with God. Because maybe right now you're at your worst. I wonder if Jesus, when he began to wipe their feet, they for the first time heard how petty they were being. And just thought, oh, God, I am not deserving of this. And you remember what Jesus said to him? If you don't let me wash your feet, you have no part of me. And he said, oh, then wash my head. And wash my hands. You got to get past your I don't deserve it. Can I give you a flash? Nobody here deserves it. Not a single person. Come and let him wash you. Come and let him love you. Second thing I want you to do today, as we come to the table and let our Redeemer wash our feet, and then you walk away and go back to your seat and enter into the worship and listen to God and then from there go home and greet your friends and be with your family and then go through your week. Here's the second thing I want you to do. I want you to begin to wonder what it means and wonder what it might look like in your real life, not in some church service, what it might look like in your real life to pick up a towel. What it might look like in your real life to be a person of the basin and the towel. With that word, let's now go to the table. Thank you.
