Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14. with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge in order that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. Now to him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we could ask or think according to the power that works within us, to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Let it be. Amen. Let's pray. Father, I ask for your filling, for your absolute control, that in fact your spirit would enlighten and energize and empower us with truth, that we, some of us, for the first time would turn on the ignition of power in our lives. Amen. How to be filled with all the fullness of God. That's the theme of Ephesians chapter 3, verses 14 through 21. And it's so important. Three weeks ago as we began this text, this particular passage, I told you that this is the locus crucius, that this is the key point, that there are very important passages in the Bible, but this is one of the keys, and I believed it then. But I've been living in it for three weeks, and I'm consumed with it now. If nothing else is grasped in the whole year we spend in Ephesians, and we don't, this has to be grasped. If this is missed, it's no point in going on to chapter 4. In this beautiful book, this book of Ephesians, we have discovered the lofty and glorious position of the body of Christ, the church. We have discovered the church that Peter calls the perfection and glory of God, discovered as believers that we possess all things that pertain to life and godliness. Even above the angels we are exalted so that they look at us and wonder at the glory of God and the grace of God, how he could do such a thing. We have discovered that we are a special and glorious people, that we have been purchased by God through the blood of Christ, the forgiveness of our sins. We've been accepted into beloved. We are sons of God. We are forever his possession. We are sealed in the spirit. We have an inheritance that is incorruptible and undefiled that will never fade, reserved in heaven for us. We are priests. We are kings. And we are taught and led and ruled and loved and made alive and built up and blessed by the Lord Jesus Christ himself. We are possessors of the unsearchable riches of Christ. We are rich because we are his. And it's all wrapped up in that second chapter, the 22nd verse, where he says this, You believers, you are the habitation of God. God lives in you. And that was the task of the Apostle Paul in the first three chapters, and we spent a lot of time there taking what he was teaching us and applying it to our lives and painting a picture of who the believer is in Christ. That God has chosen us, that he has taken our lives and chiseled us out of the rock of meaninglessness and gave us meaning and gave us something to live for. We're in Christ. The story is told of an artist that was called upon by the government to create out of a piece of stone the bust of Abraham Lincoln. And as he was doing all his work and he was just about ready to complete the work of art, A cleaning woman was called in when he was finished to clean up all the shavings after his work was done. And the woman came in, a very simple woman, and she looked at the piece of stone and all the things around it, realizing that there just was a piece of rock there before, and now she saw this face of Lincoln. And she goes, that's just amazing. And with the look of amazement, she goes, how did you know that Abraham Lincoln's face was in that rock? How did you know that? What a God is our God who could see in our flesh something that would bring glory to him. How did he know that in this piece of clay, how did he know that in this rock there was a servant of the living God? He has chosen us and he has made us priests and he has made us kings and he has made us heirs of the kingdom. That's who we are. We are rich because we are his. Those three verses told us who we were. And if we've got a problem with self-image, we've got a problem with understanding who we are in Christ. Then he goes on to chapter 4 and 6 and he tells us how we're supposed to live. But before he tells us how we're supposed to live, he tells us this in chapter 3, 14 through 21, you've got to turn it on. It's got to be turned on somewhere. We have seen our resources at the beginning of this study. And we are seeing what we're supposed to do with those resources in chapters 4 through 6. But in right here, 14 through 21, we couple them together. We put them together and we turn it on. We've likened it to a car. I felt that illustration has been a little inadequate, but it's the only one I could come up with until now. Chapters one through three, we've been having for ourselves describe the engine, the apparatus, the power plant, how this thing works. All the parts are there. All the things we need are there. And it's powerful and it's full of high octane fuel. And chapters four through six is like the map. This is where we're supposed to take this car. And right here is where we turn it on. We've seen the fact that it's possible to know all about that engine, to know all about where I'm supposed to take it, but never turn it on. And therefore, it's absolutely useless on a practical level because there is no power. And that's why Paul prays in verse 14, for this reason, I bow my knees before the Father, that you, believer, would begin to use the resources that God has given you. But there's something else to compare this text with to illustrate the importance of it. And that is to see this text in the light of one of the saddest stories I think there is in the entire Bible. And that is the story of the people of Israel, who having been brought out of the land of bondage and death, that Egypt, having been brought out of there, having put right in front of their face all the promises of God, the promised land, the land of Canaan, promise to them all you have to do, people, is believe that it's true, take the land, walk in and possess it, believe and obey, believe and obey, that's all you have to do, it's yours. those people having been brought out of Egypt, having been given the promises of God, wandered for 40 years in a desert, dying and dying and dying, all the time complaining, much like us. More than anything in the world, they wanted to move into Canaan. More than anything in the world, they wanted to see the power. More than anything in the world, they wanted to see the promises of God concerning them to be yea and amen. They wanted to see them true. But they wandered fruitlessly and limply and weakly through the desert. And there was no power and the promises didn't come about. I think the parallel is clear. I do not believe that God took us out of the marketplace. In those earlier chapters, he bought us, redeemed us, bought us out of the marketplace. I do not believe that he has taken us from death to life so that we can spend the rest of our lives floundering aimlessly in a powerless, limping wilderness. He brought us out to bring us in to the fullness of God. The fullness of God. Exceeding abundance. The power of God at work in me. Every one of us want it. Every one of us yearn for it. That's why we're here. We talk about it all the time. We talk about the great value of being a Christian, and we try to tell everybody we know. And yet too often, we are just like the children of Israel. We spend a whole lot of time talking about Canaan. We spend a whole lot of time talking about the promises of God, and few of us seem to be moving into that and claiming it. I believe too often we are just like the children of Israel And have the potential, as did they, to spend our entire spiritual lives walking around aimlessly in a wilderness. The resources are there. The power is there. And all of heaven is waiting to shower upon our lives the power of his spirit. And we know it all. But we never turn on the power. The power. What is the power? Now, we're going to be talking these next few weeks, and we have already for a couple of weeks been talking about the things that the power are, what exactly the ingredients are of this power, this thing that turns it on. And there's these five steps we've already talked to you about. We're going to talk about the strengthening of the inner man. That's one of the keys. The indwelling Christ. That's another one of the keys of turning on this power. The incomprehensible love that's going to be demonstrated in our lives. That's one of the power. That's one of the keys to the power. But I want to tell you now, as we begin again to move into this study, that the power to be strengthened in the inner man, the power to have that indwelling Christ rule my life, the power to have that incomprehensible love being shed out of my life, the power to do that comes only when the Holy Spirit of God has control of my life. That's power. And that's what we need to catch. That's what we need to catch. And you know something? I can't teach you that. What a joy counsel was for me and those who came with. I have felt in my life many times when it seemed like God's hand, literally, I don't want to get mystical about this, but God's hand was on my life. It was on my life. And I felt it when the Lord directed me here. It was so scary and so unknown, and I didn't know what God had for me when he brought us here. but I felt his hand upon my life. And there have been times in my life when as I've felt that hand on my life, there's been times when I've kind of felt him squeeze me a little bit. Well, last week I got squeezed a little bit. We had to privilege those who went to sit under the ministry of Dr. Stephen Olford. And he was speaking of this power, and I don't think it was a coincidence. He was speaking of this anointing of the Holy Spirit. And he said things like this. I remember one illustration, and it just rang in my heart and I said, "That's the thing that too often is missing." He said, "Why is it that I can go to the mission field and I can go into the bush of Africa and see some simple man who just a few months ago or years ago was absolutely illiterate and he can take this word of God and he can open it up with these people listening and I can sit in the back and I can hear and he has no Greek and he doesn't know Hebrew and he doesn't have the lexicons and he doesn't have the commentaries, all those things that, those are the things that give it power, garbage. And he speaks, and I weep, and I worship, and I laugh, and I sing, and something is happening. What is that? That's power. What was it that took a Peter who cringed and cowered at the giggle of a little girl? What was it that later made that same Peter stand right in front and face to face with the very same people who put Jesus Christ to death and said this, You crucified him, and this same Jesus whom you crucified, God has raised him up and made him both Jesus and both Lord and Christ. What made him do that? Power. Authority. The anointing of the Holy Spirit. The filling of the Holy Spirit. He was a man possessed. He was filled with all the fullness of God. The power was at work within him. John Calvin, tremendous statement, said, "The great sin of the Old Testament times was God's people's rejection of Jehovah God. The sin of the New Testament times is a rejection of the Son of God, and the sin of the church age is a rejection of the Holy Spirit. There is no fullness." And then whenever we begin to talk about the Holy Spirit, and I'm very much aware of this, But we begin, little flags go up. We're talking about the Holy Spirit. We're talking about fullness. We're talking about power. And immediately we think about excesses, don't we? We think about excesses. And then we want to shut it all off. I want to tell you something. We should worry about excesses. But excess, because excess is simply the flesh. And the flesh is sin. And I don't want anything to do with it. But I want to tell you this, that without the Spirit's filling and without the Spirit's anointing, there is no fullness. And there is no power. And we will be in a wilderness as a church, and we will be in a wilderness as individuals all our lives unless we catch this. So Paul prays that that power in the life of the believer will be turned on. And in chapter 3, verses 14 through 21, he gives us this sequence of things that, as the sequence has gone through, the power is fully ignited. And you remember that it's a progression. It is in the Greek what we call a hena purpose clause, and it means that one thing happens, and that is contingent, and that happens, and then another thing happens. And the second thing happening is contingent upon the first thing happening. In other words, I can't go to step two without hitting step one. I can't go to step four without hitting step three. I cannot go to step five without going one, two, three, four. Okay? There's a progression here. It's a sequence. And the first in this sequence to fully ignite the power was two weeks ago when we discovered that the first dimension of this sequence is when the believer begins to focus on the inner man, the building up of the inner man, verse 16, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner man. The focus is on the inner man as opposed to the outer man. The outer man, again, is the physical you. You got up this morning and you face the outer man. You brushed the outer man's hair, you brushed his teeth, you washed his face, you shaved it, you put makeup on it, you did all these wonderful things. You went downstairs or into the kitchen and you fed it. Some of you exercise it. You take care of the outer man, and that's very good. We spend a lot of time trying to build it up, trying to keep it strong, trying to make it stronger for a very good reason, because we want to be a full functioning person. I don't want to be limited because my body isn't in shape. I don't want to be kept from doing things that I potentially can do, so I keep my body strong, and I feed it, and I exercise it. That's good. There's one problem with that. Because while all of that is very important, the fact is this. No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, no matter how I try to keep myself restored and keep myself strong, and keep myself growing all the time and building up, the fact is this. That the outer man is dying day by day, and that's why Paul says, if we want to have an abundant life, if we want to have a full life, if we want to have a godly life, we need to focus on what's really important in our life, and that's the building up of the inner man by the Spirit of God. We need to feed it with the Word. We need to exercise it by obedience to the Spirit. And as we obey the Spirit, we exercise that by obedience to the Spirit. Every time we obey the Spirit and yield to His leadings in our lives, what we do is we exercise the spiritual muscle. That spiritual muscle is built up. We gain strength. We're being built up in the inner man all the time. And the beautiful example of that was in 2 Corinthians 4, where Paul was going through a very tough time in his life, and he was talking about being afflicted. I don't feel very good. He was talking about being persecuted and perplexed and struck down, But, verse 16, we faint not. Why? Because while I'm getting it on the outside, Jesus is giving it on the inside. Because while the outer man is decaying day by day, the inner man is being built up, is being renewed day by day. Tremendous truth. Tremendous picture as this outer man descends, the inner man, for the believer, can ascend and gain strength. But that comes as we focus, as we yield to the Spirit so that he will build up that inner man. That's the first step. That's the first step. Focusing on the inner man. We've taken one step. And last week, two weeks ago, we asked that you would pray concerning that, that you would begin to focus your attention upon building that very important, that essential, that priority in your life. But that leads or results in another one. In order that. The second step here is this. not only focusing on the inner man, but focusing on the inner heart. Read verse 17, the first part, "In order that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith." "In order that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith." Now, what does that mean, Christ dwell in your hearts? It almost sounds, if you pay attention, like we've got a theological problem here, because we're already talking about people who are the habitation of God. We've talked all through Ephesians about being one in Christ, about Christ living in my life. You've told us that over and over and over again. And now this verse says, after you're strengthened with power in your man, the result of that is that Christ will dwell in you. That's something wrong. The problem is simply that the English is deficient here, and it helps, this is one of those areas that it really helps to go to the Greek. And let me give you a little lesson that's not to, I want you to understand what's going on here. The Greek word there for dwell is katoikesai. The word is made up basically of two words. The first word is kata, which is a preposition. The second word, the verb, is oikeo, which means to be at home. Now, one of the things that happens in the Greek is when I take a preposition like kata and link it with a verb, what it does to that verb is it intensifies the meaning. So the way this can really be read is this, in order that Christ may dwell or really be at home in your hearts. You got that? Very important. that Christ may really be at home in your hearts, that he may settle down and be at home. You know what bothers me about that? I don't know if it hits you, but it's the realization that Paul is requesting this because very probably at the present time in those lives of those believers in whom Christ was living, he wasn't at home. think about he was there but he wasn't at home I want you to think about that about what that means that we can have literally Christ living in us that we can be the habitation of God he is there but because of how we're living but because of how we're acting the attitudes we're holding because of our disobedience he's not at home he's not at home he doesn't feel good he hasn't been able to settle in he's there there's no doubt about that, that he's there and he's brought with him all the power of God, all the glory of God, all the riches of heaven. He's brought that with him into my life. But what I do when he comes into my life, I take a little room in my life and I stick him in that room and I keep him right there. And my friend, what that is called is called quenching the spirit. He has come with power. He has come with all the resources of God. I stick him in a little room and he can't do what he's dare to do. That's quenching the spirit. He's there, but he's a guest. That doesn't even work. Calling Jesus a guest in my life, because I would treat a guest very well. What I would do with a guest is I would pamper him, and I would take care of him, and I would give him the best china, and I would give him the best food. We don't treat him like a guest. Very often, we invite him into our lives, and we treat him, okay, we treat him like a friend. Have you ever had a friend like this that you didn't really like, but he was loaded, and he could do little favors for you, so what you'd do, you'd be his friend. And when it was convenient, you'd be nice to him because you wanted to get something from him. We treat him like that. I don't want to be crude, but I think sometimes we treat him like a little pet. It's a nice pet. It's a beautiful dog, and I keep him in a little room, and on Sundays I put a leash on him, and I bring him, and I show the neighbors. We bring our whole family to church. Oh, isn't this wonderful? As my thoughts begin to progress, and I just evaluate my own heart and how I've treated the presence of Christ in my life, I think that sometimes we treat him like a little ornament in our lives, like a nice piece of furniture. You see, along with all the nice things I have, I've got Jesus too. I've just got it all. I've got nice furniture, I've got a nice house, I've got a nice car, I've got a nice job, I've got a nice wife, nice kids, I've got Jesus too. One more, you know, it's another thing I've got. Many years ago, a little book was written by a man named Robert Munger. It was called My Heart, Christ's Home. I'm sure a lot of you have already read it. Very simple book, a little allegory. And it took people's lives and it made it, he likened the person's life or his heart to a house. And this house was just full of all little rooms and Jesus comes into that house. Therefore, this house that Jesus comes into is the house of a believer because Jesus has come in and taken up his residence in that home. and the allegory goes and these this this person who owns the house begins taking jesus on a tour of the house of the life and they go into the library they go to the library the door and in the book that the library was likened to the mind the brain what we feed the mind the things we read the things we see the things we dwell on and he went into the library and as they approached the library the owner of the house knew what was in there and that some of the things of jesus walked in he would fill it with himself and all of the things that he had would probably have to leave. So he just kept the door shut. He said, that's the library. Let's move on. Kept the door shut. Then he moved on to the dining room. And the dining room was likened to the appetites, the desires, the things you really hunger for, the things you really want in your life. And on the menu, as they approached that door, on the menu, the owner of the home knew that what was really on that menu, even though he talked real spiritual on Sunday around Jesus, you know, this new inhabitant, he talked about higher things. What was really on the menu was riches and wealth and power and prestige and all those things. And he thought, if Jesus moves into that room, he's going to fill that room with himself, and my desires are going to change, and I know he'll do that for me, but I'm not sure I want him to. So that door stayed closed. He moved into the living room, and this was a little bit different. The living room didn't have any doors. The living room was where the action was. All the people were there. The people were talking, and the activity was there. And Jesus was in this room, even had a picture of him on the wall in honor of Jesus. Isn't that wonderful? But what happened in this room was that Jesus would sit in the corner and all the activity was going on and he was just absolutely ignored. The conversation would go on and it was as if he wasn't there. And the only way I can liken this to us so that we can grasp it is if I was, John, you and I spent the day together and you were in my car and where we drove, you drove. And when I went to work, you went to work. And when I washed the car and got the gas, all the things I do during the day, you were there. And you talked to me and you gave suggestions, and you gave directions, and there were suggestions and encouragements along the way. And all the time I absolutely ignored you. In fact, you got in my way, and I'd step on your toes and bump you. I don't know how long you'd be my friend. But that's the picture. And I wonder how often, as believers, the presence of Christ in our living room is just ignored. And we never recognize his presence. We never consciously recognize his presence. And I'm not here to dump a big guilt trip on you because guilt never motivates properly. It motivates, but it's not the motivation for the believer is that he's present and he's brought all the power of God with him. And I want to turn it over to him so something can be done with this mess. But I do want to say that while guilt is never a motivator, I wonder if sometimes it's an appropriate response when I think of the fact that Almighty God has chosen me to take up his residence in me, and I've just ignored him. Something needs to change. Finally, they move to one more room. And after they've gone to all the rooms, and after they've seen all the doors and all of them shut, there's only one thing left, and the only reason it's noticed is because of the smell. Something stinks. It smells like something died. And they see that it's coming from one door, and this one, the owner gets a little bit fanatical and says, don't you dare go in there. This is one that's mine. It's all mine. I may eventually give you all those other things, but this is the place where the hidden things are. And every one of us have a house, a room in our house like this one, don't you? The place that when the company comes, you throw all the trash into that one room, the laundry room or something, and all goes in. When the company comes, mom and dad and all the kids know that wherever you take the company, it's okay, the living room is sharp, the bedrooms are all clean, everything's clean, but don't you dare go in that room. You open that door, look out. People are going to see how you really live. It's a mess. And when I was a kid, my little hidden place was under the bed. And Mom would say, clean the room. I'd clean it. Right under there. It was great. The hidden place. Christ goes in there and says, I want that room too. But in this kind of situation where he's there and all the doors are closed, he's there, we are the habitation of God. And he's come with all the power of heaven. But he's not at home. He's not at home. He can't settle down and be at home. He's like an ornament. He's like a pet. I'll tell you, the problem with this is absolutely immense. The problem with that, and this is, I believe, the reason why the people in the world are able to observe the church and what they see as a limping church. the problem is immense and I believe it must be dealt with now for some of you today for some of you today the problem is this that when the Holy Spirit of the living God came into the life of David Johnson his chief function after that was to settle down and be at home dwell there and he is not satisfied to just be there. He says to me and he says to you, David, I want to own you. I want to possess you. I want to control you. I want to monopolize you so much so that after a while you are so possessed and so controlled and I so own you that people begin to not even see you, that you begin to lose yourself because what they're seeing come through you is something of Jesus. Let your light so shine before men that they may see. That's full man. That's full man. Last week, the council, I heard a story. I don't remember anymore who it was who said it. There were a lot of speakers. But they were talking about a certain crusade. in the Chicago area, and they were going to have a citywide crusade, and names of speakers were coming up, and they didn't know who to go with, and D.L. Moody's name was suggested, and one of the people complained about that and says, why do we have to have D.L. Moody? I don't see why D.L. Moody has to be the guy. It's not as if he has a monopoly on the Holy Spirit, you know. And one elderly gentleman, obviously with a lot of wisdom and insight, stood up and says, it is obvious that D.L. Moody does not have a monopoly on the Holy Spirit. That is not the point. the reason D.L. Moody has such power is not because he has a corner on the Holy Spirit the reason D.L. Moody has such power is that the Holy Spirit has a monopoly on him he is controlled absolutely and there's power absolute control that's what he wants and that's how he's able to settle down and be at home and that's why Paul said I am NOT my own I've been bought with a price he owns me that's the fullness that's the abundance that's the power that's it but I dare say that there are a lot of people believers even here right now this very moment in whom Christ dwells in whom he is not at home in whom he has not yet been able to settle down or even begin to settle down and be at home and I think that's a frightening thought I think that's a sick thought that Jesus having chosen me would come in and I would lock them out and I would quench them. Then I would wonder why I'm not moving into Canaan. Then I'd wonder why, oh, this Christianity doesn't work. I want to talk to you young people for a minute. Some of you have grown up with this and in some ways you have a disadvantage because so did I, so I know all the junk that you're in place. And you know it all and you've received Christ. And I remember the time when I hadn't grasped this yet. No one in the world could have convinced me that I hadn't received Christ. That would have been something. If someone threatened that, I would have fought. I know Jesus. He's there. I know it. And I did, and he was. But I also knew that he wasn't at home and he wasn't in control. And I stuck him in a little room because I was too busy trying to be cool and have everybody accept me and like me because I was so funny. But there wasn't any power and there wasn't any joy and there wasn't any peace at all. And it was something everybody else was talking about and I thought it was pie in the sky. Christ is there, but he isn't at home. Moms and dads. Moms and dads. Been here for years. Maybe you're new. But you keep up the front and you're raising the kids and you're not even open enough with them so they know your inner struggle. But it's all so phony and it's all so churchy and it's all so stale and you're wondering why the kids don't respond to Christ in a powerful way because there's nothing evidenced in you that way. And we still come to church and we still teach the class and we're still on the board and Christ is there but he isn't at home. He hasn't settled in and we wonder where the power is. It's something the pastor talks about and it's kind of ethereal and distant and it isn't really real but he's paid to talk like that so he does. And a couple other fanatical types do that too. your neighbors might call you Christian but maybe they wouldn't call you godly you know what I don't really think that most of us in some sort of rebellious way say no I'm not going to I don't care I don't like God most of us some of us are but most of us aren't fighting that kind of battle most of us what we do is we say seven out of ten ain't bad you know he's got seven areas in my life three are mine that that's the game we play and there's really no reason to change because even though i don't see the power and i don't see that thrill and that that that leading of the spirit and that just joyful life of i hear talked about again even though i don't see that i kind of figure i never will because i've lived this way for 40 years why change now I'm just gonna close with this I can't make anybody catch this this is something the Holy Spirit has to touch our hearts somewhere along the line somewhere along the line we say yes I'm I'm ready. Let my heart be his home. Come and settle down and be at home in me. Somewhere along the line, maybe when we get frustrated enough, we say, I want to quit floundering in the wilderness. And I believe it's at that point of yieldedness that the cleaning begins. It doesn't happen bangle, done. Remember a couple weeks ago, one shot and we're good for the whole day. It begins a process. It begins a process whereby I walk room by room into my life and I say, Lord, this hurts. I want you to fill that room and it's full of my junk and I want to empty it of me and I want you to fill it with you. I take them to the library where all my books are and all the things I feed my mind with and I say, Lord, I love those things. And you do. Walk in the Spirit and you won't fulfill the desires of the flesh. Remember that? But it doesn't say the desires will go away. I love those things. That's why they're there. But they're quenching in this power, this fullness of God. You're not full there. it's empty of me and i want to fill it with you i walk into the dining room and in the living room and we do all that and then he says something stinks johnson and then we go to that hidden room where i keep all my hatreds and all my jealousies and all my pride my temper and yielding is saying lord i love those too that too I want you to be at home in me so that you can do in me what you came to do the result is that in order that Hena Claus blah blah blah in order that we may comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and then I begin to know what the love of Christ really is. Begin to be filled with all the fullness of God. The theme that went through the council this last week, every sermon was with the motif of simply this. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to seek the Lord. It is time to seek the Lord. And again, you young people, I don't know where you're at. And you may be waiting for Gary to do something for you to turn you on. You may be waiting for Jim to come and turn you on. I want to tell you right now, it is time to seek the Lord. And you moms and dads and you college age and all you other people, we may be waiting for something from me or from our elders to kind of get everything going. It is time to seek the Lord. And I am praying that God will bring upon our church a revival of the Holy Spirit with power in our church, starting with me and then starting with you and starting with our elders. And I don't care who. We have five who said, this is what I want. Christ, I want you to be at home in me so that you can do what you came to do. It is time to seek the Lord. Thank you.
