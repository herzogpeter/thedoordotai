Let's pray. Lord, I again thank you for this class and for the desire that you've put in their hearts to learn and for the faith that you've put in our hearts to believe. It's your doing and we praise you for it. And thank you for the opportunity that we have to come together and to learn and to study your word and to grow in our faith and in our understanding. pray Lord that your spirit would really be with us tonight we want to cover some things that are very very important to our faith and things that if they get hold of our life really have a changing transforming effect and so Lord I pray that you would let your spirit be here cause your spirit to be here and anoint what I say and stir up questions and help us to openly and honestly investigate this stuff. And not just in an intellectual way, Lord, but in a way that would really hit us in our heart where we need to be hit. We ask this in your name. Amen. We've covered the doctrine of inspiration. And we have covered... Can I get you to do that again? It's already running, but halfway through, would you change the tape? For the wonderful tape people whom we love, and we want to say hello to the people who are listening by tape. That if you are sitting alone and feeling lonely and down, all of our thoughts and hearts and affection are with you. There, know that. Even though you're listening to this probably four years after this class occurred. I may even be dead by the time you're listening to this. That's an awesome thought. All right. Another very pleasant thought. Let's not think about that. we've covered the doctrine of inspiration, we've covered the attributes of God, we've covered the doctrine of the Trinity, and we did all that in the last several weeks. Tonight, I want to talk about the person of Jesus Christ, and what Jesus Christ accomplished for us on the cross of Calvary. In some ways, of course, we've already been presupposing the doctrine of the deity of Jesus Christ, that Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man. when we talked about the doctrine of the Trinity. But we didn't cover that in any kind of detail, and I'd like to do that tonight, especially because that tends to be a belief that is frequently challenged by other groups. It's a belief, the belief that Jesus Christ was man and God, is a belief that unbelievers have a lot of trouble with, and it's a belief that a lot of believers have a lot of trouble with. In fact, I think it's pretty accurate to say that among a lot of believers, there is a subtle tendency to subordinate Jesus Christ to the Father, to see him as something less than fully God. And so I want to cover this here. We didn't cover this. We're starting this last week, do we? Okay. The Orthodox position, the belief that the church has always held throughout its history is that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man. He's fully God and fully man. You can find, I mean, it's easy to prove that early Christians believed this, not just in biblical times, but after biblical times, though the belief itself wasn't formalized until the Council of Chalcedon in 357, 7 or I'm forgetting the exact date. And I would never allow any of my students to do that, but I forgot it. But in the 4th century, early to mid 4th century, the belief that Jesus Christ was a full human being and was fully divine. And this is opposed to a number of views that people can have about Jesus Christ. The orthodox view is opposed to the idea that Jesus Christ was just a prophet. He was a prophet, hello, but he wasn't just a prophet. The Islamic faith believes that Jesus Christ was simply a prophet, someone anointed by God and used of God, and they have a very high view of Jesus Christ in terms of a prophet, but still he's only a prophet, nothing more than that. Well, the church has always held that Jesus Christ is much, much more than just a prophet. He's also much more than just an angel. Jehovah Witnesses in one way or another believe that Jesus Christ was Michael the Archangel, who was made into a human being. And other heretical groups throughout church history have held that Jesus Christ was some kind of angelic figure, but wasn't divine, something less than God. And the Orthodox view is opposed to that. There have been some who have wanted to hold that Jesus Christ is fully divine, but he is so not as the Son of God, but as the Father. They have taken away or destroyed any distinction between the Father and the Son. And that also is a view that the church has been against. Jesus Christ is fully God, but that doesn't mean that he is the Father because God exists in more than one way at the same time. He is the Son of God. And finally, the fourth view is the orthodox view of Christ. It is against the view that Jesus Christ was some kind of a hybrid. And what I mean by that is that he wasn't partly God and partly man. He was fully God and fully man. And that's sometimes a hard thing to hold in your mind at the same time. And there has always been tendencies of people to say that Jesus Christ was sort of half God and half man, which means he was neither God and neither man. That's what I mean by saying he's a hybrid. But the orthodox view has been against that. And I want to give the biblical basis for the evangelical view of Jesus Christ. First of all, concerning his humanity. He was a full human being. Whatever else you think about Jesus Christ, you have to know that he was a full human being. In John 1.14, it says that the Word was made flesh. Flesh is simply the term that John uses for human. He was made flesh. God became a human being that's it in a nutshell God became a human being the word which in the beginning was God was made flesh in Hebrews 2.14-16 and in Hebrews 4.14-16 we have phrases like this Jesus Christ was in all respects made like us in every respect yet without sin Christ was like us. Everything that it means to be a human being, Christ was. Now think about that. He was a human being. God becoming a human being. That means that he felt like humans feel, he ate like humans eat, everything that's a part of being a human being, He was. He thought like humans thought. There was times when he wrestled with things, like in the Garden of Gethsemane. He asked questions. He was a full human being. God became a full human being. I just gave you some of the human characteristics. The significance of that is this. It's found in Hebrews 5. It's found in a number of other places too. but the significance is this. This is God who has become a human being. And so Hebrews tells us in chapter 5 that we don't have a high priest that's beyond our suffering, that's beyond our infirmities, that can't understand us, precisely because God was made a full human being and Christ was in every respect made like us. Jesus Christ is one of us. And so he knows what it's like to be a human being. And whatever it is that you may be suffering or whatever it is you may be going through, whatever confusions you have, all the hassles that go into being a human being. Aren't there a lot of hassles that go into being a human being? I think so. I'd rather be an angel sometimes. But Jesus knows those things and he can understand those things. Without that, there's a tendency to think that God is way up there and we are way down here. And it just takes a tremendous phone call to cover the distance. But as a matter of fact, God has become one of us. The Bible calls Jesus Christ our brother. God became our brother. It's pretty good stuff. So Jesus Christ was made a full human being. There's always a tendency. There's two tendencies here. The one tendency is for people to make Jesus Christ non-divine by making him human, saying that since he's human, he can't be God. The other one, and this is very common among evangelicals, is to say that since Jesus Christ is divine, he really wasn't human. He really wasn't human. And we become offended if we start to think about Jesus Christ asking questions or having any kind of doubt or having any kind of temptation or anything like that. We get a little nervous because, hey, he's too holy for that. Well, he didn't sin, but he wrestled with sin the way we do. He struggled with temptation. That's what the temptation was all about in Matthew 4, when the devil would tempt him. In fact, the Bible says twice in the book of Hebrews that he learned obedience by the things which he suffered. He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. He was a full human being, just like we were. We're always trying to tidy that up a little bit. I think some, now I don't want to get into this controversy, but I can't help myself, but some of the stuff that was going on about the last temptation of Christ, I don't know if you saw that movie or not, but all the people that were picketing that stuff, well, I didn't see the movie, but I did see excerpts from it, because a professor at Bethel brought it into class, it was a class on censorship, and showed the offensive parts of it, so I saw the worst of it. And it seemed to me that the movie actually was just portraying Christ in very human terms. That Jesus, his last temptation was thinking, "Wouldn't it be nice to get off this cross, and to get married, and to share love, and to raise a family, and be a normal human being? That would be a nice thing to do." But in the end, Christ abstains from that temptation and dies on the cross. But Christians were offended at the very idea that Jesus Christ would think about such things. things. And there was one scene in there where he was making love to Mary Magdalene. But the thing was, Mary was his wife at the time. And it seems to me that that would be a pretty human thing to do, is to think about, you know, gee, it would be sure nice to get off this cross and do that. I think that Jesus really understands what it is to go through temptation. He went through temptation, and that's part of how he empathizes with us. His divinity. Here might be good to look up some passages. Who's got Bibles? Okay, would you look up John 14, 7 through 9? And would you look up Matthew 28, 9? You know, what's really hard is I look at this overhead projector, and when I look away, all I see is a big green dot. I can't see it very well. Who else has a Bible? Would you look up 1 Corinthians 1, 2? And who else is the Bible? Anyone? Oh, would you look up 2 Corinthians 12, 8, and 9? And one more verse. Anyone? Oh yeah, I'll just... I'll take my word for what it says. Okay. His divinity. His divinity is shown in a lot of different ways. A lot of ways are very overt. A lot of ways are very subtle. We can't go through them all, but I'm going to give you the most explicit statements. In Matthew 11, 27. and 28, Jesus talks in a way that he commonly talked, but we don't really notice it or see the significance of it all the time. He says that no man knows the Father except the Son, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and he to whomever the Father will reveal him. Jesus saw himself as being the Son of God in a very unique sense. Now, in one sense, we're all sons of God, children of God, but Jesus saw himself as Son in a unique sense. He saw himself having a special relationship with the Father that no one else shared. That's why he never says, Our Father. He refers to my Father, and then he refers to your Father. And the only time he uses the phrase, Our Father, is when he's telling them how they should pray. This is how you should pray, Our Father who art in heaven. But Jesus has a special relationship with God. He sees himself in terms that really supersede that of an ordinary human being. John 14, 7 through 9. What is that? Go ahead. That's an incredible verse when you think about it. We've referred to that verse before. Jesus says, Philip says, Jesus, show us the Father you've been talking about and preaching about. And Jesus says, Philip, have I been so long with you and yet you don't know me? If you see me, you see the Father. You want to know about God? Look at me. You want to know about God's love? Look at me. You want to know what God thinks about you? Look at me. Everything you're ever going to need to know about God, you find in me. Colossians 2.9 says, The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. Now, an angel could never say that. A prophet could never say that. If anyone less than God said that, it would be blasphemy. What would you think of me if I said that to you? Everything you want to know about God, look at me, my character, my being, my love. That's the same as God. That's why Jesus is always saying things like this. Whoever receives you, receives the Father. I mean, whoever receives me receives the Father. Whoever rejects me rejects the Father. Whoever has the Son has the Father already. If you love me, you love God. I mean, he's equating himself with God. He is God in visible form here on earth. And this is why you find throughout the Gospels that Jesus is worshipped. Jesus is worshipped. 1 Corinthians 1-2. This passage is significant for this reason. It doesn't seem like it would be a particular... I should probably leave a sign because you have to keep on adjusting that, don't you? It looks like a pretty incidental passage. You wouldn't really notice it. But the thing I want to draw out there is this. Paul is referring very casually to the Corinthian church. And he says that the Corinthians, like all Christians everywhere, are those who call upon our Lord Jesus Christ. They call upon our Lord Jesus Christ. The phrase call upon in Jewish culture was synonymous with worship, was synonymous with prayer. Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. It says in Joel and a number of other places throughout the scripture. Paul here, in a very incidental way, simply characterizes all believers in the early church as those who call upon, who pray to, who worship the Lord Jesus Christ. If Jesus were an angel or prophet, that would have been completely taboo. What about 2 Corinthians 12, 8, and 9? Who had that one? Paul's a monotheistic Jew. Monotheistic Jews believe that only God is to be worshipped. Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord, and you shall have no other lords before him. Jesus responds to Satan in Matthew 4 by saying, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve. Quoting Deuteronomy, I believe it's 6. Only God is to be worshipped. And yet here we find Paul, this monotheistic Jew, praying to the Lord Jesus Christ. He's got a thorn in the flesh, and he says, Three times I prayed that the Lord would take it away. But the Lord responded, My grace is sufficient for you, for when you are weak, then I am strong. And then Paul says, So I boast in the strength of Christ. The point is that Paul is praying to Christ, and that's something you only do to one who is God. What about Hebrews 1.6? We didn't get to. Hebrews 1.6 says this, That when God brings in His first begotten into the world, he says, let all the angels worship him. Hebrews 1.6, let all the angels worship him. That's an important point because you find throughout the Bible that angels are forbidden worship. If you look at Revelations chapter 19 and Revelations chapter 21, twice we find the apostle John falling at the foot of an angel to worship the angel. And the angel says, don't do it! Don't do it! It's an absolutely taboo thing to worship an angel. because you only need to worship God. But when Jesus is born into the world, the Father says, let all the angels of God worship Him. So while angels are forbidden worship, angels are commanded to worship Jesus Christ. You see, Jesus Christ is certainly more than just a mere human being. Matthew 4.10 is the passage that says, you shall worship the Lord thy God and Him only shall you serve. And I just had to throw in one more, and that's John 5.23. And there the Lord says basically this, That all should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. Basically he's saying this. You know the attitude you have towards God, the Father, have it towards me. Because I'm God incarnate. If anyone other than God Almighty said this, you should have the same attitude towards me as you have towards God, it would be utter blasphemy. So Jesus is, while he's a full human being, you can't ever take away that fact. He's one of us. Feels like us. Thinks like us. while he was here on earth, in any case, yet he is also God incarnate. A couple other passages that just drive this nail in a little deeper. And I'm just going to review these. If you have any questions about these, please feel free to raise your hand. The Jehovah Witnesses believe that Jesus is less than God. He's basically an angel. And so they have a lot at stake in trying to get rid of these passages that I'm referring to you. Like, for example, wherever it says that they worship Jesus. We didn't read that Matthew 28 one, did we? Did someone have that? Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot that. 28 verse 9. There they see Jesus. They repeat the same thing in verse 17. Here Jesus says, all hail, and they fall down and worship Jesus. It says again in verse 17 that they worship Jesus. The New World Translation translates all these phrases, obeisance. They did obeisance to Jesus. And most people don't know what obeisance is, so that leaves them out of the hook there. The word is proskune, which literally does mean to prostrate before. And it could, in some cases, be used with regard to kings. People would prostrate themselves before the king and say, all hail. But what's very important is that when it's used in a Jewish context, with regard to anything divine, it always means worship. So, for example, in Acts chapter 10, when Peter comes to the household of Cornelius, Cornelius proscune, bows down to worship Peter because Cornelius thinks he's the Messiah. And Peter gets all freaked out and says, Don't do that! Because to a Jew, to proscune, was an act of worship. And so Peter forbids it. The angels forbid it. The same word is used, proscune, in Revelations 19 and Revelations 21. So the term means worship, but that's their way of trying to do it. They just want to say that people kind of bowed down and said, you know, oh, Messiah. Because they, too, agree that only God is to be worshipped. Colossians 1, 16 and 17 and 18 basically says this. And you can just take a note of this and look it up on your own. That Jesus Christ is before all things. And he is the creator of all things. he is above all things calls him creator and the supreme lord of everything I go into this a lot more in detail when we teach a class on cults and we deal with Jehovah Witnesses and stuff but as long as we're on the topic in the New World Translation the way they get around this verse is by inserting the word other four times they say Jesus Christ is before all other things and by him all other things were made and he is above all other things. And the reason they do that is because clearly if Jesus is before all things, he himself is not created. If he creates all things, he himself is not a created being. Otherwise, he wouldn't be the creator of all things. One thing would not be created by him and that would be himself. So they insert the word other four times in those two verses. Now the word other is not in the Greek. The word other in Greek is heteros and it's not found in that passage. It's not found in that chapter. But they insert it because it fits their doctrine. you know what, you don't have to know Greek to know this stuff every translation that's ever been translated except the New World Translation is as clear as can be on this kind of stuff they're the only ones who have ever come along and tried to distort it and they confuse people by saying, well the original Greek says when it doesn't say that, how is it that you could have 1900 years of Christian scholarship of brilliant people who know Greek better than they know their own language and miss these points I don't get ticked off at Jehovah's Witnesses. I get ticked off at the Washington Tracks Society. They make me very angry because they know what they're doing. They know better. It was only... Now you can know it because there was such an uproar when this translation came out and so many people who do know Greek just pulled their hair out that now they put brackets around the words which they insert. They still insert them, but there's little brackets around them to say, you know, that, well, we think this is implied. It's not implied. Okay, John 1.3 also says that in the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. Verse 3, without Him was nothing made that was made. All things were made through the Word. God is the creator of all. Hebrews 1.2 also talks about Him being the Lord who laid the foundations of the world. In fact, in verse 10 it calls the Son. In verse 8 it calls the Son God. And in verse 10 it applies the psalm that's given to Yahweh in the Old Testament applies it to Jesus Christ. A strong passage referring to the deity of Jesus Christ. Other things, he's the judge of the world, Matthew 25, 31 forward. Jesus Christ is portrayed as being the judge, 2 Thessalonians 1, 7 through 10. He's again portrayed as the judge who's going to come back and judge the living and the dead. But every Jew knew that there's only one creator and every Jew knew there's only one judge, and that is Yahweh. So what you find is in the New Testament, People applying divine titles to Jesus Christ. The deity of Christ is proven in a lot of other ways. We can't go into it all right now. I don't want to belabor this too much. But let me give you one example. In Malachi 3, verse 1, the Lord says that He will send His messenger and His messenger will prepare the way before Him. In Isaiah 40, verse 3, it makes it even more explicit. that there will become a messenger who shall prepare the way before the Lord, Yahweh, translated in Greek, kurios. What you find is the Gospels seeing that prophecy as being fulfilled in John the Baptist. John the Baptist is the one who is to prepare the way before the Lord, God, Almighty, King, which clearly shows that they saw Jesus Christ as being the one who spoke that prophecy, the Lord who spoke that prophecy. The Lord says, I'm going to send a messenger before I come. John the Baptist comes. They say, this is the guy, clearly showing that they saw Jesus Christ as being Yahweh, Yahweh in flesh. Here's another passage. We've got to look this up maybe, I think. Well, just take my word for it. Check it up. Never take anyone's word for anything. It's like you're probably the last person in the world to do that. Check everything, okay, but check it at home. In Isaiah 44, verse 6, and in Isaiah 48, verse 12, you have the Lord saying this, Yahweh. He says, I am the first and I am the last. Before me was there no God formed, neither shall there be after me. That incidentally is Isaiah 43, 10, actually. I didn't put that one up there. And that's an interesting verse because that's the Jehovah Witness battle cry, but in that verse it says, no God is formed after me, and they think Jesus is a God formed after me. I've got to quit picking on them. You've got me on a roll here. I just, everything I say, I'm always thinking, oh, here's why they're wrong again. I've got to get them out of my mind. No, I'm only piecing. I love to do that. I love to talk to your witnesses. I mean, they don't even come to my house anymore. They come to our street, but they always go around my house. I don't know why. Isaiah 44, 6. Yahweh says there, I am the first and I am the last. I am the beginning and I am the end. Showing God's eternality. His eternality never began, never shall end. What you find in the book of Revelation is Jesus saying these very same words. In 17 and 18, Jesus says, I am the first and I am the last. I was dead, but I am alive forevermore. Jesus, the Son of God, applies to himself the very words that Yahweh distinguished himself with in the Old Testament. There's only one who is the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last. Only one. He says so And yet Jesus the Son of God Says those things about himself Clearly showing that he is the one God He's God Almighty You find the same thing in 22.6 And 12 through 13 And also in verse 16 I don't want to look all these things up right now But the point there is that Jesus Speaks the words of Yahweh In clear Indistinguishable ways He couldn't make it any clearer a couple other verses just to drive this home I obviously want you to be very convinced in the deity of the Lord I don't want to spend the time to look these up they're not very disputable but in John 1.1 it says in the beginning was the word, the word was with God and the word was God I know, I know it's the article in there and the word was God I love having a resource person I could tell you what Joe was to believe but I like to have somebody who has some background with it It's like I can tell you what one of Pentecostals believed because I used to be one. And so I got their stuff down pat. No one knows it like someone who's been on the inside. Okay, but I don't want to go into this too much, except they say that their translation has, in the beginning was the Word and the Word was a God. It is an impossible position to argue with because they're wrong. There's a rule in Greek called Cowell's Rule, which basically says, given the structure of that verse, you can't possibly get a God. It's true there's no definite article before God in the second instance, but that is totally irrelevant given Caldwell's rule, which is a very well-established rule. The other thing is that throughout the book of... In fact, almost half the time in the New Testament when God is referred to, there's no definite article before theos. Theos is the word for God. See, the argument here is that because there's no the before God when it's replied to the word in John 1.1, Therefore, it means a God, not the God, but a God. Yet, the Jehovah witnesses themselves three times in that same chapter, like in 1.13, where there's no the before God, translate it God with a capital G. 1.13 says, we're born not of the will of flesh, nor the blood of man, but by the will of God. Clearly meaning God, capital G, but there's no the before God. But there, all of a sudden, they know it means capital G. Why didn't it mean capital G in John 1.1? Because they didn't want it to be in capital G in John 1.1 because they don't want Jesus Christ to be God. Oh, there's a lot of things about it we can't go into now. Some of the time. But the bottom line is that you've had centuries and centuries of people translating this, people who know Greek incredibly well. We don't even know who translated the Washington Tract Society. But all of a sudden, they're going to overturn all the scholars of church history and come up with the correct translation. Immediately, that should make you suspect. Romans 9.5, Paul says Jesus Christ is the great God over all, blessed forever, amen. Again, we could get into that, but we don't want to. Titus 2.13, Paul says, waiting for our blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God and Savior of us, Jesus Christ. Our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. Paul calls Jesus Christ our great God and Savior. They try to get around that by inserting a word in the Greek too. They inserted there, and it's not in there. Boy, do they get me mad! John 20, 28. Oh, this is where Thomas rises from the dead. Jesus comes to Thomas. Thomas is saying, unless I see him and put my hand in his side, I won't believe. And then Jesus appears, and then Thomas says, my Lord and my God. And Jesus says, blessed are you, for you have seen and believed. But blessed are those who haven't seen and still believe. Jesus recognizes what Thomas says as a confession of faith. To believe in Jesus is to believe that he is our Lord and our God. Finally, Colossians 2.9 says, The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. The Bible clearly sees Jesus Christ as being fully God and fully human. Fully God and fully human. And there's nothing contradictory about that. who would be so presumptuous as to say that God can, if God so chooses, become a human being? And do that without stopping being God. This is one of the things that's significant about the doctrine of the Trinity. If God can in fact exist, and God eternally exists in three different ways at the same time, and that's not that paradoxical, it is paradoxical, but it's not contradictory. If God can exist in more than one way at the same time, there's nothing to stop God from becoming a full human being and still being God. If you believe that God could only exist in one way at the same time, then you'd have to believe that God would vacate heaven to become a full human being. Who's running the universe if Jesus is God? But if God can exist in more than one way at the same time, there's no problem. And there really is no problem with that. It really is putting a limit on God to say, God can't do that. I forbid you to do that. It's not very wise. Here's the significance of this. This isn't just a neat little metaphysical trick. but this is really, I think, central to the Christian faith. Really is central to the Christian faith. It, first of all, specifies where our worship is to be directed. There's a place where God gives us to worship Him. We worship the Father as He's revealed in the Son in the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ is the central object of worship. And you really are robbing God of praise and glory when you worship some idea you have about God rather than worshiping the one in whom God became a human being. You see, the people on earth worshiped Jesus Christ when he was here. They worshiped Jesus Christ after he ascended, and so should the Christian church. That's why our songs in church tend to glorify the person of Jesus Christ. They center on the person of Jesus Christ. This drives Muslims, and it drives Jehovah's Witnesses, and it drives Jews crazy. Because they say, how can you worship a man? Oh, this is terrible. This is blasphemy. And it would be blasphemy if Jesus Christ were simply a man. But he's fully God and fully man. So all glory is due him. It also has a great impact on our knowledge of God and our relationship with God. The incarnation makes a profound difference on your devotional life, or at least it can. What I find a little bit disturbing is that A lot of times people, Christians, in their devotional life, they still have a very abstract view of God, a sort of ethereal view of God. They know the attributes of God, but God's sort of a theoretical abstraction. They don't have any kind of concrete picture of God, and so they're sort of praying to this force out there. And they wonder why their spiritual life is never energized or in charge the way maybe other people's spiritual lives are. What I have found is this. When I pray, I pray like I was a first century Jew who has seen Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee. When I worship, I worship like a first century Jew who sees Jesus in a concrete form. Jesus is alive. He's here. He's all around us. And he is visible, visualizable. Jesus Christ is the one place where you can get a concrete view of who God is. That's one of the benefits of him becoming incarnate. That's why Jesus says, if you see me, you see the Father. Why then do you ask, show us the Father? We can so often have so many aberrant views of God. All of us have a picture of God, at least subliminally. And usually it's a picture that's kind of put together as a mirage. Not a mirage, but what do you call it when you put together all sorts of pieces? a collage of our father or our mother or our grandparents, our experience, and we kind of just fuse it all together and we project it onto heaven and we assume God must be like this. So we have a picture, and that's why we feel condemned, and that's why we don't feel close to God. A lot of times when you find people who just don't feel like they love God very much and they're kind of always afraid of God and they never have victory in their life, if you start probing a little bit, you'll find that behind all that is a real dysfunctional view of God that no one would want to be around and no one could possibly love. But they do it out of duty. I love you, but they don't really love him. They just say they love him because they don't want to get spanked eternally. This is a dysfunctional view of God. And what needs to happen is for us to take the person of Jesus Christ, the place where God says, this is what I'm like. Here I unveil myself to you. And let that picture of Jesus Christ sear away all the false stuff we think we know about God. Because we don't know God except through the person of Jesus Christ. There he is right there. And so when I pray, when I have my devotion times, I picture Jesus. I ask the Holy Spirit, Lord, give me a picture of Jesus, and I want to hear from you, Lord. Talk to me. And the Lord comes, and I get a picture of that. And you can say, well, that's just your imagination. I don't believe it is just my imagination. The Lord uses, I think it's what the Bible meant by saying that we're praying in the Spirit. You see Jesus, and he talks to you, and he hugs you, and he loves you, and you can see it in his eyes, and you can feel his hugs. And when all that we know about God becomes concrete, that's when it starts to hit us. Only concrete things hit us. Theories don't hit us. Abstractions don't hit us. Nothing will change you except concrete reality. That changes you. The formula for a quarter pounder with cheese doesn't satisfy your hunger, though it might be perfectly accurate. You need a real quarter pounder to do that. So also you need the real Jesus, not just information about Jesus, but the real Jesus to come to you. And I'd encourage you in prayer and devotion. Sometimes I just put on some music and sit and say, Lord, let's just spend some time together. I want to rest in you. I need to rest in you. And the Lord comes, and I just let him love me and say all the words he wants to say to me and hug me. And that's how you get whole. That's how you get healthy. That's what feeds your innermost soul. If it's not true that God became a man, then we're left with just the vault of heaven. We have this abstract concept of God. And people can love God with an abstract concept. I think a lot of Jews in the Old Testament love God with an abstract concept. A lot of Muslims love God, and they just have an abstract concept of God. They love God insofar as they know him. But in Christ, we have God fully revealed in a way that's tangible here, now. And if you receive Christ, you receive the Father. If you know Christ, you know the Father. You love Christ, you love the Father. See the point of that? It's very significant. Do you have questions about that? Questions or comments about that? Actually, I don't think it makes a difference. I think in the end, Jesus says, pray in my name. And the way the church has formalized that is we pray to the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit. It's not that we pray one, two, three. It's that we pray again. Remember the difference between the vertical and the horizontal trinity? It's not that we pray one, two, three, but all of our prayers are to the Father. All of them are through the Son. All of them are in the power of the Holy Spirit. The whole Godhead is involved in everything we pray. So I realize that I'm praying to the infinite God, the God of the universe. I'm praying to the Father who is majestic and powerful and unknowable and unseeable. But I know who I'm praying to precisely because Jesus Christ, the Son, has made him visible. And everything I ever need to know about God is right here. So I'm praying to God through the person of Jesus Christ. And that, I think, is something the Spirit does. The Spirit's job is to point us to Jesus. Jesus tells us that in John 16. The Holy Spirit will come and he will lead you to me. He will speak of me. He won't speak of himself, Jesus says, Because he doesn't want to draw attention to himself. His job is to point you to me. And I think in prayer and devotion times, this is how he does it. To say, okay, I want to talk to Jesus. And the Holy Spirit will bring to our minds, to our spirits, the person of Jesus. And for me, it's very concrete. I usually see myself as walking along the Sea of Galilee. Or sometimes I'm up on the mountain. And there's Jesus. And we just kind of walk towards each other. And I can feel the wind, and I see the clouds, and I smell the flowers. And then I see the love in his eyes, and I see his smile. And I hear his words, and I feel his touch. And then he hugs me. And that's when it becomes very real for me. And I hear him speak those words, and so much healing gets done. And then sometimes he says, Greg, let's go someplace. We need to go someplace. And then all of a sudden I'll be back in my childhood someplace. And that's when Jesus starts redoing some memories. and starts reversing some of the wounds that were there. And I start falling in love with myself as a little kid because Jesus loves this little kid. And that is just so healing. And we just, you know, just time to sit and enjoy the Lord and then let him do whatever he wants to do. That's when, you know, that's when you're, for me, those are the times when all the stuff in the head becomes translated into stuff in the heart. And that's got to happen if you're going to be worth anything in the kingdom. I mean, if you're going to be growing in the Lord, the stuff up here has got to get down here. Most Christians know enough up here, although they have some screwed up ideas about things. But the problem is that even what they have up here, it doesn't get down to here. That needs to happen. The work of the cross is called the atonement. It literally means at-one-ment. The effect of what Jesus does for us on the cross, through his life and on the cross, is that he makes us one with God. And so I just want to run over this. The question is, what did Christ's life and death accomplish? Why did Jesus have to die? There's a tendency, it's really found in liberal churches today, but it's been around for quite some time. It started in the Middle Ages by a man named Abelard. A tendency to explain the death of Christ this way, that when Jesus died on the cross, what he was really showing us is how much God loved us. He wanted to show us how much God loved us, and he wanted to do that so that he would win our love back to God. But when we see how much God loves us, then we will in turn love God. And that's what the work of the cross does. And that's all that the work of the cross does. This is called the subjective theory of the atonement, because the main change is inside of us. We're sinners in the sense that we don't love God, And so now what God tries to do is change our insides by winning our love. It is true, of course, that the cross shows how much God loves us, and it's also true that the cross wins our love towards God. But what Christ did on the cross is also much more than that. There was a reason why he had to die over and above just showing us his love. He could have done that in different ways. His death wasn't superfluous, it was necessary. Hebrews 9.22 tells us that without the shedding of blood, there's no remission of sins. In some way, if we were to be forgiven and made right with God, Christ's blood had to be shed. So I want to go through the various things that the atonement means. The atonement happens to us. It doesn't happen in us. It happens to us. What Christ does is a transaction between the Father and the Son. We are the passive recipients of what Christ does. it's not that the cross does something inside of us that makes the work of the cross the work of the cross. It's something God does to us. He changes our state of being. I'll explain this as we go on. Let's review this. We saw two weeks ago when we talked about the holiness of God, that God is necessarily opposed to all sin. Galatians 3.10 says that cursed is everyone who sins. Or what does it say? Yeah, something to that effect. All who break the law are cursed. All who break the law, in the smallest detail, are cursed. If it wasn't for the cross of Jesus Christ, we'd all be accursed. Ephesians 2.3 says that we are by nature children of wrath. In our fallen condition, we're at odds with God. Romans 1.18 tells us that same thing, that the wrath of God is revealed against all unrighteousness. So something has to happen to change our objective situation, the position that we're in. What happens is this. By dying on the cross, God pays the price. We touched on this two weeks ago. God pays the price that his own sense of justice demanded. It's not that there's a moral law outside of God that God has to obey, as though God were a servant of moral law. It's God's own character that has to be obeyed. And so God, out of self-consistency, just can't pretend like he doesn't have an issue with sin when he does have an issue with sin. So what he does is he takes care of the sin question on the cross by dying. Mark 10, 45. This is what's meant when Jesus talks about things like this. I've come to give my life a ransom for many. The idea of a ransom, it's a payment. He wasn't paying the price to the devil as though God buys off terrorists. He was paying the price to himself. There was this debt that humanity owed, and so God himself absorbs the price within himself. Acts 20.28 said God purchased the church through his own blood. That also, by the way, shows that Jesus Christ is fully God because it says that God purchased the church through his own blood. 1 Corinthians 6.20 also says that we have been bought with a price. The Lord has bought us with a price. All these are ways of speaking. They're metaphors to denote the fact that what Jesus Christ did on the cross was he went to the extent that needed to be gotten to win our salvation, to satisfy God's justice, to make sinners compatible with an all-holy God. That's why the Bible says that Christ dies in our place. It wasn't just that he was showing God's love to us. He died in our place. Where we should have been, there he was. So Isaiah 53, verses 6 and verse 12 says, The Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. It was our sin that he was paying for. He died in our place. This is the end of side one. Do not fast forward the tape. Please turn the cassette over now to continue listening on side two.
