Today, however, I want to and feel it is very right for me to share my heart about a season that for me, and I think for you, but I know for me, has been very difficult, it's been very confusing, sometimes it has been very painful, but I do not believe, at least right now I do not believe, and I've struggled with this part, that it has been a bad thing. I think it has been a good season. The text I want to use as a platform from which to share my thoughts is Job chapter 19 verses 21 through 26. Job chapter 19 verses 21 through 26. And as you open your Bibles to that text, I want to set the scene for you, kind of set the context, so we understand the dynamic of what is going on in this chapter when we get to it. When we come to this place in chapter 19, Job is in the middle of his well-documented pain. He has described, Job is, in chapter 1, verse 1, as a blameless man, upright, fearing God, and turning away from evil. In a social sense, not only spiritually but socially, he has a significant status in the community. He is well-respected, well-revered. He is also significantly wealthy. By the end of chapter 2, this same man named Job has all of the things upon which he has humanly planted his feet, violently removed. His health is gone. His wealth has been shattered. His status is over. His children have all died. All of his human senses of security have been obliterated. Now, because we know the end of the story as it relates to Job's pilgrimage, we are aware of the fact that all of his agony works toward some very good things. The agony that we see through the 42 chapters of Job work into a deepening of his faith. They work out into a building of his character. Sometimes it worked out into a painful exposure even to Job himself of some arrogance he didn't even know he had, some selfishness and demandingness in his spirit that he didn't even know he had. But ultimately, all of the agony of Job for all of those chapters worked into and out into an intimacy with God that previous to this he had never known before. In chapter 42, verse 5, Job says this at the end of it all, Before I heard of thee with the hearing of my ear, and that was a good thing. I loved you and I knew you then, but now, after all of this, I see you with my eye. But when we come to chapter 19, None of the fruit of that intimacy is in view. It is certainly not in view to Job. He sees none of that end. In chapter 19, there is no light at the end of the tunnel for him. There is no promise of, there is no hope for release or healing. And in verse 21, he literally hits bottom. There is nothing left. All of his fight is gone, and he utters these actually pathetic, very unattractive words, pity me, pity me, oh you, my friends. Now listen to his feelings that preceded that expression. Back up in verse 8, it's as if we're reading his journal when he says, he, that is God, has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, and he has put darkness on my path. He has stripped my honor from me. He has removed the crown from my head. He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone. He has uprooted my hope like a tree, hopeless. He has also kindled his anger against me and considered me as his enemy, and I have no idea why. Down in verse 15, those who live in my house and my maids consider me a stranger. I am a foreigner in their sight. I call to my servant. He does not answer. I have to implore him with my mouth. People used to listen to me. Now I've got to beg them to pay attention. My breath is offensive to my wife. I am loathsome to my own brothers. Even young children despise me. I rise up, they speak against me. What a geek. As soon as I move, my bone, verse 20, clings to my skin and my flesh, and I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth. Pity me, pity me, O you my friends. With those words of despair, something in the heart of Job died. A light that had been shining brightly in chapter 1, growing dimmer ever since because of his pain, in this verse, goes out. A motor that had been running in his spirit stopped running. But in verse 23, something happens. In fact, in my Bible, between verse 22 and 23, there is a gap, a little white space. And in that white space, something happens to Job. And it is the kind of thing that I believe can only happen, most powerfully happens in these places of deepest despair. And it is this, that when that light in Job really did finally go out with pity me, pity me, another light came on. When something in Job really did die, something else at that moment began to come to life. A subtle but very real heartbeat. Maybe it was only one beat, but it was a heartbeat. And Job noticed it. And when he noticed it and he got his eyes on it, he knew at the moment it came, he didn't want to lose it. And so he begins to say this, I need a piece of paper. Verse 23, oh, that my words were written. I've got something I want to say that's very important in the middle of this pain. In fact, a paper is not good enough. A paper could blow away. I could lose it too easily. It could get tarnished, and I might not be able to read the words. Give me a book. I need a book. Oh, that these words were inscribed in a book. And you know what? A book isn't even going to be enough. I need something more sure, more eternal. I want to find a rock. I want a rock with an iron pen and lead. Verse 24, that with an iron stylus and lead. They were engraved in a rock forever. I want to write this on a rock. Here is what I know to be true. In spite of my feelings, in spite of the reality of my condition, I am not going to deny what I feel, but in spite of what I feel, there is something that I know. Here is what I know. As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives and at the last He will take His stand on the earth even after my skin is destroyed, yet from my flesh I shall see God. Paraphrase it this way. I know that my Redeemer lives and He will stand and one day, even if it is after I die, I will stand with Him. Write that on a rock. And the reason I want to write that on a rock is because I have this real strong sense because of what I'm in right now, that in 10 minutes, the reality of that is going to get washed away again by my pain. And I want to be able to look at something secure and real that isn't going away, an objective truth that can anchor me in my continued time of need. Write it on a rock. I know my Redeemer lives. I don't know much else, but I know that. What I want to do this morning with you is share some of the things that this past summer I wrote on a rock. Some of the things that this past summer I think God engraved on my heart forever. Before I go into that, I want to pray, and then we will. Father, I have been looking to this weekend for quite some time, wondering if it would look like it looks, if I would even be able to stand here. And I'm real grateful that I can. And I am grateful, God, for the powerful, wonderful things you're doing in our church. Not all of them fun, but I think they're good. I pray in your name that you would take this word and build your body. I pray in your name that you would go beyond any human word we could possibly hear, that we could hear from you your words, and that we could experience your work and the wind of your spirit blowing through this place and in our lives and our families as we leave. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. The script that I was handed for my summer sabbatical was different than the one I wanted. And it was different than the one I wrote. And I did write one. I had it all planned out. Now, it wasn't, I think, a shallow script. I think it was a deep script. It was a good script, the one I wrote. It allowed for and included deepening. By God, I wanted that. It allowed for and included pruning by the Spirit of God, a purifying of my spirit. I wrote in my journal, God, I want you to mature me. I want you to give me more depth. I need that if I'm going to continue at Open Door. In my mind, what I had set out for my sabbatical was some wonderful times away from the pressure of church to just listen to God and hear His voice. In fact, one of the things I told the elders early on was that I feel really strongly directed by the Spirit to quit all of my busyness, which I am given to, and just spend this whole time sitting at His feet and listening to His voice, experiencing the presence of God. And I desired, in fact, I expected a clarified call as it relates to my ministry and my whole life. I desired and I expected a rejuvenated and a restored spirit. Now, many of those things that I just described as part of my script for this summer, God did. But one of the things that didn't happen was this. You see, I had all of those things happening in a context of some sort of serenity. Seriously, after all, you know, it's the purpose of a sabbatical, as I said a moment ago. Its value is that you're away from all of the everyday pressures and away from that pressure stuff. you can kind of hear things maybe you don't normally hear just kind of reflect all of these lessons and all of these things that i really did desire were supposed to happen in the comfort of my own home it was supposed to happen in a fishing boat on lake malac someplace with the waves gently bobbing and me catching walleyes were supposed to happen under a tree with me looking into the heavens contemplating the meaning of life with a weed hanging out my a weed a real weed from the ground hello i'm back that's how it's supposed to happen on long walks i'm supposed to take long walks i love to run it was supposed to happen on long runs i'd be on long runs and and in the middle of the run god would talk to me and I would hear his voice and I would listen and I would say, oh yes good, thank you Lord. And he would affirm me as I sat under that tree and he would confront me and it would be okay God confront me, right? As I'm sitting in this boat reeling and confront me oh yes, I receive it now thank you. And all of it, I would grow, I would grow. That would be good. That was what I wrote. That is not what I got. That is not what we got, my family. now some of what we got some of what we experienced this last summer you know about because it was public in fact some of it was on the 10 o'clock news i've had friends say to me since since that event you know there you were big as life explaining why there was a big hole in your roof i saw your face some of you told me how you were in another room and you heard this obnoxious loud voice on tv and you know it was me what is he doing there my brother called me the next day he says dave saw you on tv look good good thing you run that's my brother he's a good guy some of you don't have an idea what i'm talking about it was july 17th at five o'clock in the afternoon on an otherwise sunny day that a violent storm roared through our neighborhood in Maple Grove, and our house was hit with lightning, a direct hit. Our entire family was in the house. In fact, we were in the room where the lightning hit. We were all in the kitchen looking out the window because it was such a violent storm. It was like, wow, look at this thing, kaboom. It resulted in a fire that did extensive damage. In fact, ironically, it did extensive damage to the room we were all gathered in. That kitchen looked like a bomb went off in it when we went back to look at it. I vividly recall just the moments and the hours that were kind of unfolding before us after that fire happened with all of Maple Grove kind of surrounding our house. In fact, I think pretty much all of Minneapolis was looking at that fire that day. Watching the house burn with firemen crawling all over it, having this ironic feeling that we had been protected. I remember as I was watching this house burn, being acutely aware that of all of the arrangements that we were going to have to make that day and for many days to come that would be very draining and very hard, one of the arrangements I wasn't going to have to make was for a funeral. That our entire family was in the very room, this violent lightning hit, and not a hair on anybody's head was singed. We felt protected. we became nomads at that point a family began to live out of laundry baskets we made eight moves in seven weeks with four kids and a smelly dog the present time just kind of update you where we're at in our life that way we are right now renting a home that we are trusting is going to become ours at the middle of october and that's where we are things seem to be settling down i hope this finally lands two weeks into this adventure that is two weeks after the fire my wife bonnie had her second surgery of the summer some of you know about that the first surgery was the result of a softball accident where we were on this co-ed softball team one of the open door teams and and i think she was the second batter it was the first game of the year at least the first one we but that she swung at the pitch, went into the outfield. A run scored, by the way, but not only did a run score, also she blew out her knee and broke her ankle with that swing. They tried therapy on her knee. They came to realize it was going to require surgery to reattach her kneecap. At the pre-op exam for her knee surgery, they found a lump on her throat. She went ahead with the knee surgery. They began to do tests on the lump on her throat, thinking that certain kinds of medications might deal with it. None of those things worked. It was determined that it needed to be removed surgically. The doctor began to talk a lot about cancer. Things in our life were not going in a direction that lent us to, that moved us to have much hope right now that things would go well in this. But the fact is, we hoped for the best. We braced for the worst. We got the good news, as I think most of you got, was that her surgery was a success. The growth was benign, and we went home to recover. But that was another piece of the picture because we didn't go home to recover. One of the pictures I have in terms of my wife's stuff was that she didn't go home. She went to a motel room, and our kids couldn't be there because there wasn't any room, and she did a recovery there. That was a hard piece. But you know what? I could go on and on with all the details of our summer. I know something because I've talked to some of you. Some of you had worse summers than us. You did. Some of you lost people. You lost people. We didn't lose any people. Some of you did. so without getting into all the details i want to avoid that the fact is this though there was a relentless kind of hammering of events that continually knocked us off balance some of it quite frankly became comical it got to the point where where i'm telling you for sure every single thing i touched especially me more than anybody else but if i touched it it would break promise a number of you opened your homes to us during this time very graciously now there won't be any surprises for you if you open your house i'm not going to tell you about something now you don't already know about but every home we stayed in we broke something significant a big thing i'm telling you this is the truth if if i were to mow the lawn and i were to pull the cord on the lawnmower i'd die to the lawn the cord would come out of me if i were to take a cup of coffee a little mug of coffee and and the the handle would fall off but it wouldn't fall off until I was over the white carpet in your living room. That's when it would break. If I were to borrow your fishing rod, it would break in two. It did. It broke in two. It broke right in two. It was the good fishing rod. If I were to use your riding lawnmower, it would hit a tree. It would hit a tree hard. If you left one of your cars in the garage when you left us to stay in your home, the tires on your car would go flat. They went flat. I didn't even touch it. My wife and I were in a motel room doing the recovery from her surgery. One of the things we remembered was, you know what, we're always going to remember this year's Olympics because it's the year you did your surgery and we were in a motel. And I will never forget watching the Olympics as this guy named Dave Johnson, picked by everybody to win the decathlon, is going into the tank. I'm going, I'm sorry, Dave. It's because it's the connection. I mean, things turn it. I mean, it was looking like the Lucy show in our house. I remember this one. We had gone up north for a weekend of rest. Everything we touched up there broke too. I finally put the dock, the boat in the dock and made the kids just sit in chairs and I tied my hands together. Read a book. No, just sit there. Don't even read a book. Last day, we're getting up in the morning. We're going to leave that morning. I'm up before anybody else. I noticed that the dishwasher hadn't run from the night before. I put some detergent in there. I close it. I turn it on. 15 seconds later, suds are pouring out from underneath. Pouring out. This is the Lucy Show. I'm looking at this and going, And you know in a week and a half, this is going to be very funny. But some of it wasn't funny. Even before the lightning, we had struggled with prolonged bouts with depression. I'm not given to that, but I was now. Something that I described in my journal, because I was searching for, what is a word that describes what I'm in right now? It came to this, claustrophobic fear. That's what it was. Frightening senses of abandonment from God. And maybe among all the things that were hard for me to handle was a growing conviction. I came to a point where I really became convinced that I had forever lost my capacity to clearly hear God's voice. Beloved, my agenda for the summer was to sit at his feet and listen to his voice. I thought I had been doing that. And in listening to what I even had ventured out into a couple of things in obedience, they blew up. And I became convinced I had lost my ability to hear God's voice. Other people could, I could not. And all of that stuff raised up a question in me. how in the world can I go back to open door? How in the world could I possibly give leadership? I was supposed to recover on the sabbatical. How can I come to church, stand in the pulpit, and point people to God when I can't find him myself? How can I preach when it feels to me right now that I have nothing to say? And the reason I felt like there was nothing to say was verse 8, because it felt to me like he had walled up my way so that I could not pass, and he had put darkness on my paths, that he had stripped my honor from me and removed the crown from my head. I felt that he had broken me down on every side, and that I was gone. He uprooted my hope like a tree. And it also felt that he had kindled his anger against me and considered me his enemy, and I had no idea why. Pity me. Pity me. Pathetic words. I never said those words. That was in my heart. But you know what? While more than once I came to that, more than once, in that, something happened. It wouldn't ever be like that, but something would happen, and a thought would dawn on me, sometimes in the most unlikely places, in a grocery store, turning a corner, a thought would dawn on me that I knew was true. I would have in my spirit rise this kind of heartbeat. I would say basically this. I need a piece of paper. I need a piece of paper. No, wait, wait. Paper will fly away. I'll lose that in my pocket. I need a book. I need a book. I need something more than a book, something more sure, more eternal, not as temporary. I need to write this thing on a rock. An iron stylus and lead. I need to write this on a rock. And the reason I need to write it on a rock is because this truth that just dawned on me and went way inside me and brought a spark of life may not be something I feel in ten minutes. But regardless of what I feel, I know this thing to be true. The first thing I wrote on a rock in the middle of this kind of stuff was this. Jesus is the sweetest name I know. Jesus is the sweetest name I know write that on a rock because Dave, tomorrow Jesus being a sweet name is going to feel a little distant to you write it on a rock because in your most grievous times that name of Jesus brought you back you know, I don't know if you've ever gotten to this point but we had come to the point where I, in my mind, I journaled this stuff out I tried to not believe I just thought, you know what? There's so much junk going on here, and there's so much stuff I can't figure out. If I could try to not believe and get rid of all this God baggage. But I couldn't. I couldn't not believe. And I think I know why. I don't know how theologically correct this is, but it works for me in terms of what I believe is in me, and that's this. His name is engraved on my heart. That name, Jesus. and I am forever his and I can't get away from him I can't get away from him and I may run and I do run and I may hide and I do hide and I may fall and fail and I do and I may explode with anger both toward God and toward people and I may flop on the floor like a fish like I say from time to time but that name Jesus always brings me back I remember a real poignant time between me and the Lord when I was kind of journaling out my anger right in his face, right to him. I was very careful to not write about God. I wrote to him, and I wrote my feelings to him. And I felt like I was almost in this same kind of scenario that Peter and Jesus were in John chapter 6 where a lot of the disciples were beginning to fall away, that text says. Jesus was not any longer the latest thing. He wasn't the great fad anymore, and many people were falling away, and his popularity had gone down. And Jesus looked at Peter and said to Peter, Peter, what about you? You going to go? And I felt the same thing in all of my stuff with God and with Jesus. I felt him say to me, okay, Dave, what are you going to do? What are you going to do with all this rage you feel toward me? Are you going to go? Are you going to go? And I remember just breaking with that, saying basically what Peter said, Lord, where am I going to go? Where else is there to go? You alone have words of life. You alone have words of life. Your name, I'm stuck. I'm stuck. Your name is engraved on my heart. Yours name is the sweetest name I know. Write it on a rock. I wrote it on a rock. Something else I believe, and it's one of the reasons on my end I feel his name engraved on my heart, I believe my name is engraved on his heart too. the second word i engraved on a rock was was one that came from my dad we were sitting around a table at perkins restaurant in coon rapids not far from mercy hospital where bonnie was in the middle of her surgery it was going to take a long time i wanted to get out of there so we did around the table i just began to ramble i don't know if you do this but when i was in this thing i tried like crazy to figure this out thinking if i could figure it out and explain why this is happening and what the end of it is going to be, if I can know what the end is going to be, I'll be okay and I'll endure this thing. And I was grabbing onto every little thing I could and I was telling my dad, well, I know what God's doing. He's deepening me and he's preparing me and he's humbling me and he's breaking me. And basically in my thought, in my mind, I was kind of thinking, well, if he's humbling me, I'll get humble. And I would, am I humble again? Am I humble again? You know what? The day of the fire, I was wearing a T-shirt that my brother gave me. He's a coach at Bethel College, and they have these Bethel football T-shirts, and on the back was their verse for the year. It was, Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt you at the proper time. That was on the back of my shirt with all these firemen walking around. Well, that's what he's doing, Dad. That's what he's doing, and so that's okay. You know what else I was doing is that during this time, I was so confused and unable to hear God's voice, at least that's what I thought at the time. I was connecting with Tom Johnson from time to time, saying, Tom, what are the intercessors hearing? The people who we trust as far as hearing God, the prophets in our church, what is God saying? I need to know because I can't hear right now. And he would share with me some things that the intercessors were hearing, and they were good words and encouraging to me, and we were on the verge of some very exciting things, and there was going to be an anointing, and I was going to be able to come back, and it was going to be an anointing but a different kind. And all those things were really good, and I was sharing all those things with my dad. And I remember his response. It was fundamentally this, Dave, those are really good words, and I believe them to be true. They resonate in my heart. It's right, but I want to give you another word. It's a word I got when I was praying for you the other day. It's a word that is in the word. It's Philippians 1.6. Here's the word, Dave. I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it. And here's the deal, Dave. The fact is that there's a lot of your future that you do not know. Even those words that I think are true, we don't know that for sure. We do not know if you're going to have an anointing from the Spirit of God that is going to enable you to stand in front of people and preach. You don't know that. So you can't grab onto that as your security. Oh, yes, that will be there for sure. You don't know that. And you don't know for sure that you're going to be ready to go back when you want to be ready to go back. And you don't know for sure, Dave, The church of the open door is going to continue to move into things that it has moved in the past and even into new things. You don't know that. And there's something else you don't know, Dave. As we sit around this table in Perkins Restaurant, your wife is on a table being cut open, and you do not know, you do not know that she's going to come back clean with no cancer. You don't know that. And not only do you not know that, Dave, but you don't know that in the fall that you're going to have a place to live. You don't even know whether you have a place to live. But David, I got a word for you. It's something you can know. It's something you need to write on a rock. I am confident. David, be confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it. He will complete it. He may not give you all these other things, but the work in you he will complete. Write it on a rock. I did. That word that was for me, I now stand before you to give it to you. and for the first time in five months I stand before you as your pastor and say to you I have a word for us, Church of the Open Door we do not know our future for sure we do not know the directions we are going for sure, what God has in store for us for sure, I have some inclinations I have some suspicions I have tremendous amount of hope about what God by his spirit is going to blow through this place but I do not know for sure what it's going to look like or be, here is a word for us to stand on and write on a rock through whatever our future together holds. It's this, I am confident, let us be confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in us will complete it. We will not be left hanging. Write it on a rock. Third thing I wrote on a rock this summer was this, I have a great high priest who is approachable, and one of the reasons he is approachable is because he really has felt my pain, all of it, and that makes him imminently approachable. Of all the things that happened to my wife and I this summer, one of the hardest things for us, for me, I know for me, was the times that I felt abandoned by God. Times when I no longer felt his favor. Times when I could no longer hear his yes. And I'm telling you, I pulled out all my identity in Christ verses, and I pulled out all my things about grace and who we are and why we are who we are and what makes us okay, and even after all of those things I tried to bombard my head with, they didn't help my heart feel his favor. I didn't feel his favor, and I didn't hear his yes. I believed with all my heart that God still spoke today. I just didn't believe he was ever going to speak to me. In fact, I remember at one point journaling about this, but I thought of the story of the prodigal son and how from this pulpit that story has been preached, often in different kinds of scenarios for different kinds of purposes. But you know the story of the prodigal son who goes off rebellious to his father, going to do his own life his own way, ends up in a lifestyle that is dissolute and disobedient, finally ends up finding that all of the things he thought in the world would satisfy him just ended him in a place of utter chaos and dust. came back to his father with a question in his mind, will my father receive me? Only to discover that his father the whole time had been outside looking for the son, and when the father saw the son, he ran for the son. And we have preached from this pulpit essentially this. That is who God is, and that is what he does. He runs to us, and he finds us, and he embraces us. And in the place I was at, I thought of that story, and I went, not true. It mocked me, that story did, because I have been trying like crazy to find him. In fact, I knew it was the agenda for the sabbatical that just said at his feet, it feels to me like he got up and walked away. Where is this God who runs to us? And as I would give vent to those kinds of ugly feelings and pit of the stomach kinds of feelings. I'd also catch myself feeling, oh boy, you went too far with that observation. And I began to wonder, has anybody ever felt like this? Did any man or woman of God ever feel this abandoned by God and this really abandoned by God and still ever be useful again? You know, right now as I stand here, I can think of a lot of people who felt like that, but then I couldn't think of anybody. I thought of Paul and Peter and James and John and Paul. The things I thought about Paul were this. I hear this in 2 Corinthians. He was afflicted but not crushed, perplexed but not despairing, persecuted but not forsaken, not forsaken. Dave, you are forsaken. Paul was the man of God. You don't get forsaken if you're really a man of God. You don't feel abandoned. You might feel persecuted. You might feel afflicted and perplexed, but never despair, not crushed, not forsaken. I did disqualify. and Dave you're supposed to go back in a few weeks and point people to God what a joke you can't find God yourself a man of God what a joke what genuine man or woman of God has ever felt as lost as you feel right now and I felt disqualified like pity me pity me didn't say those words but i was in verse 21 and something happened wait a minute wait a minute i need it i need a piece of paper i i know forget it let's for even forget the book let's go right to the rock let's go right to the i need to write this on a rock because i just thought of someone who felt as abandoned as i feel by god and you know who it was Jesus. I don't know. Why didn't I think of this a day ago? But I saw Jesus, and he's hanging on the cross, and he's in his agony and his pain, and from his lips he says out loud what my human heart felt, this, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And his cry to God in his humanity, just the cry of a human heart, had had a right to feel a little bit betrayed here. Didn't he? A little angry. He's on the cross because he obeyed. you know what when that thought dawned on me my feeling of abandonment didn't just go poof and go away but at the same time it did in some sense because i didn't feel alone because i had a high priest who felt what i felt and i could even go to him with my abandonment you know the first time in my life was then that i looked at that expression of jesus as something other than a theological statement. I've always dissected that as a theological statement. In fact, a couple years ago at the end of Matthew, when I did that series on Jesus at the cross, the cross of Christ, and we saw this agony of Christ, and I even described the agony of Jesus as he cried, why have you forsaken me, as a separating of the Godhead from itself, and that was part of the agony of the cross. This time I heard that expression not in his deity, but I heard it as Jesus hanging on the cross in his humanity, just in his humanity with the nails in his human flesh and these words coming from his human spirit expressing the agony of every human heart in the dark night of the soul who wonders, God, where did you go? And suddenly my experience of and my understanding of my high priest who has been tried in every way such as me and such as all of us, my understanding of that grew at that point because he even knew what it felt like to feel abandoned. And I want to express feel abandoned. You want to know something? When Jesus said, why have you forsaken me? When I say, why have you forsaken me? I never was forsaken. I never was abandoned. but I really did feel like it. But I got a priest that I can go to who's felt what I feel so I can say it all. I can say it all. Write it on a rock. I got a high priest. The fourth thing is what I'm going to deal with next week. I'm going to give it to you now. I wrote this on a rock. It's this. The way out is through. The way out is through. We'll deal with it next week. The fifth thing is this. A date. I wrote this on a rock. August 15, 1992. this personal thing this date is because that is the date that by the Holy Spirit of God he resurrected in me a shepherd's heart and the moment it happened I recognized and realized that that little part of me had quit beating for a while for a long time and I don't know all of the elements that began to shrink my heart up and make it begin to wither and maybe even to stop, but I think before March, the shepherd's heart in Dave Johnson was really under distress. August 15, 1992, I felt it beat again. And it was then that I knew, not because of a long list of sermons, that I would be able to come back and be this preacher or speaker who wows anybody, but because I knew that again, this heart of a shepherd was beating in me, I knew because of that, I could come back. Weak and wounded and broken and a mess, a shepherd's heart alive, I can be here. A little bit about how it happened. It was in a conversation with my brother. We're talking about a number of things. Near the end of the conversation, we got again onto some of the stuff I'd been struggling with and this feeling of, I can't imagine going back. It's not like I don't want to go back. I just, I don't have nothing to say. I don't know what to die. I don't know if I can preach and he got a little edge in his voice i think it was passion and it was concerning he said dave dave you know i've heard you ask that question all summer can i preach can i go back and i really understand it i i really embrace it it's okay but as you were saying at this time what dawned on me is was this i think you may be asking the wrong question at least now the question you see Dave isn't can you preach the question is this do you love the people the question is do you love the flock of God do you love the people of God I want to tell you something very few things have ever been said to me that have so quickly pierced my heart as that question David do you I can I can remember where I was in the room when he asked me do you love the people? Do you love the flock of God? Do you love the church? And then he said, because if you do, then you're the shepherd. If you love the people, then all this stuff, can I preach? Will I have something to say? All that, God will give you what you need when you need it. Do you love the people? Because if you love the people, he'll give you what you need. But if you don't, resign. So quit talking about whether you can do it or not. Do you love the people? And the answer that beat in my heart right then was yes, yes. I knew it was yes. God resurrected it. August 15th, 1992, I wrote it on a rock. Sixth word, final word, is this, grace. Amazing grace. Beloved, for a variety of reasons. Reasons that I did not have time at all to go into this morning, and I went into a lot. I stand before you today aware more of my need for grace than I ever have before. I am more aware of our need for grace, amazing grace, than I ever have before. Let me put it to you this way, in the form of a question. Ask yourself the question. Without amazing grace, who of us could stand? Without amazing grace, who could stand? Could you? Could anybody here? Up here or down here? Without amazing grace that embraces us sometimes even in our folly, who of us could stand? Well, I can tell you this. There is no way in the world that I could stand. I could never, if it were not for amazing grace, I would never have whatever it takes to stand behind this desk. This last week, it was John Ward just in passing conversation, told me many things that had happened while I was gone, and one of the funny, odd things was that this pulpit got broken. Can you see this? This thing's broken here. And nobody knew evidently how it happened, and somebody just came to pick it up one day and bring it up here, and it was busted. didn't even find the peace and i remember thinking during the week i hope my books fit on there it's all i really need and uh and we'll probably have to fix that thing i'd like to find that and put it back yesterday during the worship i was standing right over there and i looked up at this thing and i was thinking about my own condition and i thought you know what i don't think we should fix this pulpit i think this little broken pulpit's a real good reminder of something that we got to right on a rock. It's amazing grace. Because not only is this pulpit broken, but the guy who stands behind it is too. Amazing grace that you can stand. Amazing grace that we could serve. We had a bunch of shepherds up here who are the shepherds. You know, God gave me a shepherd heart. He resurrected it. But I am not the only shepherd here. This church is going to fill up with shepherds, men and women with shepherds' hearts. And it's only by grace that you can stand, and we all stand behind a broken pulpit because we're all busted. We're all busted. Let me close with a question. Anybody here need amazing grace? Now? Right now? Maybe saving grace? Maybe for salvation? Maybe you have never had any kind of encounter with a God that is alive, that even seems as alive as he seems to the people you've seen today on this stage, singing and worshiping and praying. And something in your heart is beating that says, I want to know that kind of grace that can make me new. A new creature in Christ, as Mike Block said earlier. There's grace for you if you want that, but I just wonder if there are some believers here too who need amazing grace for some arena in their life where they feel like they've been hammered to the mat and can't get up. If you do, if you feel like you need amazing grace today, here's the word for you. Draw near with confidence to the throne of grace. Because the one who is at the throne of grace is our great high priest who has been wounded in every way such as us, even right down to feeling abandoned by the Father. And when you come to this throne of grace, here's what you're going to get. I'm going to promise you what you're going to get when you go to the throne of grace. You will receive mercy and you will find grace at the throne of grace. to help in time of need. And you can write that on a rock too. Amazing Grace, write it on a rock. For me personally, August 15th, a shepherd heart reborn, write it on a rock. I'm confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it. Write it on a rock. Jesus is the sweetest name I know. Write it on a rock. Thank you.
