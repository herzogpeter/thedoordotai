Jesus looked up to heaven and said, Father, the hour has come. I have revealed you to the ones you gave me from this world. Now they know that everything I have is a gift from you, for I have passed on to them the message you gave me. They accepted it and know that I came from you, and they believe you sent me. Now I am departing from the world. Protect them by the power of your name so that they will be united just as we are. Now I am coming to you. I told them many things while I was with them in this world so they would be filled with my joy. I am praying not only for these disciples, but for all who will ever believe in me through their message. I pray that they will all be one, just as you and I are one, as you are in me, Father, and I am in you. and may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me. Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice, but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. So, before I get started with the message, I have to come clean right here at the start. I'm committed to keeping things real. This date for me to give the message was scheduled way back in April. Right away, I began to ask God what I should talk about. And almost immediately, and definitely more quickly than I typically receive an answer to prayer, I knew I was to talk about unity and love. My first reaction was, I don't want to talk about love. Keeping it real. Scattered thoughts quickly followed. What? Talking about love is so, I don't know, sappy. And the next thought, of course a woman would talk about love. Wow. I was more than a little shocked at my reaction, and I'm a little embarrassed to admit all of this to you, but again, in the spirit of keeping it real, I'm sharing. I have spent time with God over these past months to unearth the reasons for my strong reaction, and I'll briefly share them. First, I've been on a 29-year journey with God, and I realize even as I say that, the journey has been longer because I am older than 29. But I have known God for 29 years. I deeply love God, and I know at an experiential gut level the profound love of God. Even when I mess up, like with this love thing, I don't feel shame often. I say, yeah, I know, we have to work on that. It's not good. I often feel God's delight and pleasure so much that I feel like his favorite daughter. And yet, at that moment, in that prayer time, I instantly and subconsciously equated the word love only with romantic love. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for romantic love, but so far it has eluded me. So here I am, right in the middle of the prayer, now having this reaction to the word love, and it just goes from bad to worse. Now an 80s song floats through my head. What's love got to do with it? What? I hadn't heard that song for years, and now it has slipped into my prayer time. Okay, don't judge me. Well, for those of you who aren't familiar with the song, it asks a series of questions. What's love got to do with it? What's love but a secondhand emotion? What's love but a sweet, old-fashioned notion? Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken? And while I've not experienced lasting marital love, I have numerous examples around me, including my parents. They recently celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary. Yeah, it is something to celebrate. And if they were here, my father would pipe up and say, 62 years, because he celebrates and counts from the day that they met. I regularly witness their love for each other, including their enduring physical affection. It used to embarrass me, but it's quite beautiful. In spite of knowing that real romantic love exists, during that prayer time, I came face to face with the degree to which I've been influenced by the broader culture, a culture that elevates a highly sexualized, immature, and underdeveloped view of love. But more recently, I've had a more redemptive experience with a song. The ringtone and text tone that I assigned to my son about three years ago is from a song from Lord of the Rings. It's called Concerning Hobbits. It's a very lilting melody. It started as a joke between us because we're big Lord of the Rings fans and because hobbits are really small and Leland is not. He's six foot six. I heard the song on TV recently. I was in another room, and I had another one of those instant subconscious reactions, only this time I felt an almost overpowering affection sweep over me. I felt love and instant connection to my son, and I found myself automatically reaching for the phone to talk to him. So I felt like there was hope for me. Now I'll go back to the passages that Kristen read. While he still walked the earth, Jesus prayed for us, and the thought of that absolutely captivates me, especially when I remember the timing of his prayer, just before he's about to be arrested and executed. He prays for the disciples that he's sitting with, but also for all who will ever believe in his message, in their message, rather, and that's us. A consistent theme of his prayer was for unity among the people who would identify as his followers. Also included in the verses Kristen read is one of the most familiar passages in the Bible, 1 Corinthians 13, verses 4 through 7, which describes attributes of love. Having unity within any group of people requires this kind of love. What's love got to do with it? Only everything. First, though, some context about Corinth and the community of followers of Jesus living there. Corinth was a major urban center, one of the most culturally diverse cities in the entire Roman Empire. It was located on a very narrow neck of land, which was like a land bridge between the peninsula and the mainland of Greece. This kept travelers from having to sail around southern Greece, which was a treacherous route. It's also the reason that Corinth was one of the most important commercial cities in that time period. Although Corinth was controlled by Rome, the city was founded by Greeks And the Greeks in Corinth were well known for their idolatry, their divisive philosophies A widespread use of lawsuits to solve disputes And the extremely high level of sexual promiscuity Paul established the church at Corinth around AD 50, about 20 years after Jesus' death And we'll learn more about that when we study Acts 18 in about, what, 15 years? Yeah, yeah. So Paul spent a year and a half with the Corinthian church. And a few years later, while he was with another city and another church establishing it, Paul received some very disturbing reports about the Corinthians, especially about the immorality within the community. In response, Paul sent them this letter that we're looking at today. In it, Paul addressed theological issues, but the primary theme of the letter is conflict. These people were a handful. If you get a chance, read the book of 1 Corinthians, but read it all the way through. Even if you don't have time to do that, just look at your chapter subheadings. Wow, there was a lot going on in Corinth. So here's the back story. Corinth was infamous for sensuality. Even its name became a proverb. To Corinthianize meant to practice prostitution. That's because a thousand professional male and female prostitutes served in the temple. This was a key part of the worship of the city's primary deity, Aphrodite, also known as Venus, the goddess of love. But it wasn't love, it was shameless lust. This so-called prostitution, sacred prostitution is what it was called, those two words are not often linked together, sacred and prostitution, was also an important part of the city's commerce and a source of revenue. This sexually charged spirit of the city showed up in the church too, and it explains the kind of problems we'll cover in more detail. Added to these dynamics, people's roles were determined by social status, even within the church. wealthy, powerful people preferred political, philosophical, and religious ideas that supported their power base their infamous conflicts included differing views on eating meat offered to idols behavior at community meals, head coverings for men and women disorderly conduct during public worship services and a variety of mystical beliefs and practices they even argued about their preferences for who should teach about Jesus Although Paul founded the church, the higher status, more affluent members preferred Apollos. Apollos was a more eloquent speaker than Paul, who was, after all, a manual laborer, or so they thought. Paul was highly educated, but he laid aside his dependence on his pedigree in order to fulfill his call to Jesus. And we read about that in Philippians chapter 3 mainly. No surprise, the blue-collar workers in the church preferred Paul, the lower-status, working tent maker who volunteered as a teacher and a missionary. These folks were a hot mess. Opinions raged about topics around sexual morality, like incest, use of the human body, singleness, divorce, remarriage, celibacy, and sexual rights. Hmm, does that sound at all familiar? Like some of the same struggles that we focus on today. Our conflicts, other conflicts included the use of spiritual gifts, and that's what we will spend time on today. So now that we have the fuller story, let's look at the letter. Chapter 12 begins with Paul stating, Now, dear brothers and sisters, regarding your question about the special abilities the Spirit gives us, I don't want you to misunderstand this. You know that when you were still pagans, you were led astray and swept along in worshiping speechless idols. Now this is revealing. These new Jesus followers, some of whom were former disciples of Aphrodite, were having trouble letting go of their previous religious experiences. They likely associated some of the antics that were part of their former pagan practices with the exercise of spiritual gifts, causing lots of confusion. The letter continues, there are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same spirit is the source of them all. There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord. God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of us. A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other. The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up one whole body. So it is with the body of Christ. Some of us are Jews, some are Gentiles, some are slaves, and some are free. But we have all been baptized into one body by one spirit, and we all share the same spirit. Yes, the body has many parts, not just one part. If the foot says, I'm not a part of the body because I'm not a hand, that does not make it any less a part of the body. And if the ear says, I'm not a part of the body because I'm not an eye, would that make it any less a part of the body? If the whole body were an eye, how would you hear? Or if your whole body were an ear, how would you smell anything? But our bodies have many parts, and God has put each part just where he wants it. How strange a body would be if it only had one part. Yes, there are many parts, but only one body. The eye can never say to the hand, I don't need you. The head can never say to the feet, I don't need you. Now all 31 verses in chapter 12 involve a detailed discussion of the spiritual gifts. Some people were hesitant to exercise these gifts because they seemed to think that they didn't have the necessary abilities or credentials. Other people couldn't wait to use the gifts, but their approach reeked of pride. Still others had an elitist attitude, as though the gifts showed that they had a more advanced faith or that they somehow earned a higher calling than others. In verse 7, Paul was very clear about the purpose of the gifts. A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other. And in verse 11, Paul was equally clear about the distribution of the gifts. It is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts. He alone decides which gift each person should have. We learn in chapters 14 through 17 of the Gospel of John that these gifts from the Holy Spirit are manifestations of what Jesus told his disciples to expect after he was gone. As he completed his earthly ministry, Jesus devoted significant time to this important teaching, and Paul continues Jesus' teaching on spiritual gifts in letters to other churches, not just to the Corinthians. In his letters to the Corinthians, to the Ephesians, and to the Romans, Paul gives warning and instruction before and after naming the gifts. Now, I'm not going to name them here because I don't want the gifts to be a distraction. But in the letter to the Romans, Paul wrote, Because of the privilege and authority God has given me, I give each of you this warning. Don't think you are better than you really are. Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us. Just as our bodies have many parts, and each part has a special function, so it is with Christ's body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other. Don't pretend to love each other. Really love people. Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good. Love each other with genuine affection. And take delight in honoring each other. To the Ephesians, Paul wrote, I am a prisoner for serving the Lord. I beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling, for you have been called by God. Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other's faults because of your love. Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace. For there is one body and one Spirit, just as you have been called to one glorious hope for the future. There was one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who was over all, in all, and living through all. However, he has given each one of us a special gift through the generosity of Christ. And this will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ. Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth. Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church. He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love. Now, the common denominator among these three teachings is the underlying heart disposition needed in exercising any of the gifts. What's love got to do with it? Only everything. Now, while the Corinthians had the disadvantage of being shaped by the culture of the most corrupt city in all of the Roman Empire, all of us are prone to the same temptations, to downplay, deny, or ignore our gifting, to think our gifts are more special than other people's gifts, or we practice them with a lack of love. Paul continued his letter to the Corinthians with these questions. Are we all apostles? Are we all prophets? Are we all teachers? Do we all have the power to do miracles? Do we all have the gift of healing? Do we all have the ability to speak in unknown languages? Do we all have the ability to interpret unknown languages? Of course not. So you should earnestly desire the most helpful gifts. Then Paul makes a sharp transition in the second part of verse 31. He says, But now, let me show you a way of life that is best of all. Now that's an enticing statement. Let me show you a way of life that is best of all. Paul continues, If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn't love others, I would only be a noisy gong and a clanging cymbal. If I had the gift of prophecy, and I understood all of God's secret plans and possessed all knowledge, And if I had such faith that I could move mountains but didn't love others, I would be nothing. If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it. But if I didn't love others, I would have gained nothing. Prophecy and speaking in unknown languages and special knowledge will become useless, but love will last forever. These three things will last forever, faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love. Let love be your highest goal, but you should also desire the special abilities that the Spirit gives. So he's encouraging us to desire, own, and develop the spiritual gifts that have been given to us, but only with the understanding that their use has to be coupled with love. Love is absolutely critical for the members of a community to work together and be united and heartened focused. If love is missing, then it's just meaningless activity. Still, what is love? Often verses 4 through 7 of chapter 13 are read at weddings as the quintessential definition of love. They're sometimes almost read as a to-do list for the couple. And there's nothing wrong with this passage being used as an encouragement to love a spouse well, but we can now see that that was not the context of these verses. Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice, but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance. This actually appears to be a list of behaviors needed to address the conflicts that were going on in the Corinthian church. It's an extremely important and instructive passage, but it's not meant to be the complete, definitive, or conclusive word on love. So the question remains, how do we define love? The dictionary definitions of love include this. A profoundly tender, passionate affection for another person. Devotion. A feeling of warm personal attachment or deep affection. As for a parent, child, or friend. Sexual passion or desire. Synonyms include affection, appreciation, devotion, emotion, fondness, friendship, infatuation, lust, passion, respect, and tenderness. This just doesn't come close to describing love. These are important, but incomplete. Even if a person is looking at this without a focus on God, none of this even touches on the idea of transcendent love. but the kind of love that we read about in scripture is transcendent. It's sacrificial and more than we can sometimes take in, it's the love of God. In the gospel of John we read, Christ became a human being and lived here on earth among us and was full of loving forgiveness and truth. We have all benefited from the rich blessings he brought to us. Blessing upon blessing, heaped on us. For Moses gave us only the law with its rigid demands and merciless justice, while Jesus Christ brought us loving forgiveness as well. No one has ever actually seen God, but of course his only son has, for he is the companion of the Father and has told us all about him. Later, John pleads, dear friends, let us continue to love one another for love comes from God. Anyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. God showed how much he loved us by sending his one and only son into the world so that we might have eternal life through him. This is real love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his son as a sacrifice to take away our sins. Dear friends, since God loved us that much, surely we must love each other. No one has ever seen God, but if we love each other, God lives in us and his love is brought to full expression in us. We know how much God loves us, and we have put our trust in his love. In his letter to the Romans, Paul passionately declares, I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God's love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow, not even the powers of hell can separate us from God's love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below. Indeed, nothing in all of creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord. these passages describe the type of love that can only come from our maker our deliverer our redeemer our savior the one who knows everything about us and still declares that we are his friends. He is the lover of our souls. He loves not who we hope to be, but who we are right now. That's who he loves. What's love got to do with it? Only everything, everything. The love spoken of in these passages is the foundational orientation of the heart of God. as demonstrated by Jesus. We are called to that heartbeat, that same heartbeat. God sings and we hum along. God dances and we try to follow his lead. I know it's easy to feel inadequate when we think of people like Mother Teresa or the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. or others who worked for justice by acting on behalf of the underprivileged or the underrepresented. They had very public platforms. but our small acts of love ripple out. I'll mention one last song. I Dreamed a Dream from Les Miserables. This excerpt that I'm about to read tells part of the tragic story of a woman named Fantine. There was a time when men were kind, when their voices were soft and their words inviting. There was a time, and then it all went wrong. I had a dream my life would be different from this hell I'm living. So different now from what it seemed. Now life has killed the dream I dream. People often cry when they hear this song. It's not just because the song is sung well. I think the tears come from a deeper place because it touches on our own hurt and disappointment. If we've lived long enough, most of us have felt like Fantine at some point. We had a dream of what we thought our lives would be, only to one day realize that the dream has died and life is so very, very different than what we had hoped. No matter the type of relationship, whether it's a romantic love interest, a parent, a child, a friend, when we love someone but we're rejected, betrayed, the relationship ends, we still love that person anyway. Part of the pain we feel is because our emotions for that person are now untethered. The person is gone, but the emotions of love, affection, sadness, and anger are still with us. We just aren't sure what to do with the feelings that can no longer be connected to that person. What we cannot do is allow someone else's lack of love to make us unloving. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said, Let no man pull you so low as to hate him. Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do that. So we have to learn to lean into the pain and invite God into that vortex. As Dave so often says, the only way out is through. So we cannot ignore, deny, or medicate the pain. We have to invite God in. But we need to invite others in too. As Vicki Degner so beautifully shared last week, each of us has a story that we're living, and it includes joy and pain. Sometimes we need someone to hear our story. Seeing each other and listening to stories matters. Love says, I see you. You are not alone. You are not alone. Rebecca Higgins Reviewer: Denise RQ Every day movements toward each other, responding to each other with the resources of our time and presence matters. i've experienced this multiple times over the past few years, even real time right now. Just last week, I was in the hospital. I received love and care from so many people by way of food, flowers, prayer, encouragement. One special sister friend was by my side at the hospital. This same friend's mother once said that we look alike. We don't. She's white, with blonde hair and blue eyes. But her mother, in all seriousness, said, "Well, you two look alike." Well, love, not genetics, makes us family. Now, I want to make this specific to Open Door. As an elder, I carry you in my heart. The staff and elders here talk a lot about vision that articulates and shapes our focus on commitment to being in a transforming process. Dave talked about that when he talked about the discernment retreat. But why? For the sake of others, both here and beyond Open Door, into what Dave has termed in our study of the book of Acts as outside the friendly confines, into Samaria and a world of very different people, like sorcerers and the Ethiopian eunuchs that Dave is so obsessed with. Into a world that does things differently than we do. We need wisdom, discernment, and a whole lot of love in order to navigate challenges while keeping focused on the why, which is for the sake of others. Listen, there's so much to divide us. We have well-defined preferences that can morph into closely held convictions, which become a justification for turning away from and separating ourselves from those who think, believe, and behave differently. This behavior can quickly cripple a community, can cripple the body that Paul described in his letter to the Corinthians. Lovingly using these God-given gifts in our everyday lives, right in the middle of the ordinary, is an antidote, a cure. What's love got to do with it? Only everything. Lovingly using our gifts on behalf of others is the entire point. So, in closing, in a letter to a church filled with conflict that threatened unity, Paul shifted his focus to the fundamental role that love plays in the life of a community through its individual members as we learn to closely follow Jesus. About 10 years after writing to the Corinthians, Paul wrote to another church, this one located in the city of Colossae. He was still teaching and pleading the same message of unity. In this new life, one's nationality or race or education or social position is unimportant. Such things mean nothing. Whether a person has Christ is what matters, and he is equally available to all. Since you have been chosen by God, who has given you this new kind of life, And because of his deep love and concern for you, you should practice tenderhearted mercy and kindness to each other. Don't worry about making a good impression on them, but be ready to suffer quietly and patiently. Be gentle and ready to forgive, never holding grudges. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others. Most of all, let love guide your life, for then the whole church will stay together in perfect harmony. Let the peace of heart that comes from Christ always be present in your heart and lives, for this is your responsibility and privilege as members of his body, and always be thankful. Remember what Christ taught, and let his words enrich your lives and make you wise. Teach them to each other and sing them out in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing to the Lord with thankful hearts. And whatever you do and say, let it be as a representative of the Lord Jesus. And come with him into the presence of God the Father to give him your thanks. So we'll end where we started, with Jesus' prayer for us. Towards the end of that prayer, his hope again is for our unity. And he said to his father, I am in them and you are in me. May they experience such perfect unity that the world will know that you sent me and that you love them as much as you love me. Love is absolutely essential in order for the members of a community to be united in heart and focus, even when it appears that we have little in common. Even beyond the practical benefits of a unified community, much is at stake. Jesus' prayer reveals that people knowing and believing that Jesus came to earth because of God's love for the world hinges on our unity. It hinges on our unity. What's love got to do with it? Only absolutely everything. Thank you.
