2 Samuel chapter 12 verse 5 says this, Then David's anger burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan the prophet who had just told David a story about the man, As the Lord lives, surely this man who has done what you just described deserves to die. Incensed, indignant was David over someone else's sin. Being incensed and indignant about someone else's sin is what I want you to have in mind. and we'll come back to it. Last week, on what we've been calling for several months our journey of the heart, we were introduced to what we call the wandering heart of David. As embodied in the story of David and Bathsheba found in 2 Samuel 11 and 12 where David, fueled by what we call a spirit of entitlement, I deserve this, took what he wanted primarily because he could. And what he wanted in the story was Bathsheba. Thus plunging himself into a downward spiral of sin, deception, and ultimately murder, thereby raising for us this question, actually, too. First question was this. Whatever happened to this guy's heart? This guy whose heart we have been admiring and desiring for almost a year now. What happened to his heart to bring him to this kind of behavior? And the second question, in many ways more important than the first, was this. Could what happened to David's heart happen to mine? Could it happen to yours? The answer to that question, quite obviously, is yes, what happened to David could happen to me. could happen to you, which raised then another question we dealt with last week. In some detail, it was this. Are there warning signs along the way that David ignored, that we dare not ignore, that would indicate to us we're on the same kind of path that David was on, that the kinds of things that were happening to David's heart are happening to mine. Are there little things that seem like harmless things that can become big things. And the answer to that was also yes. Some of them we talked about last week were revealed to us in the text. Others were drawn more from what we kind of know about David generally and what we know about sin and how it works specifically. The first warning sign that we noticed as it relates to David and the drift in his heart was that David had withdrawn. Remember that? That at a time when David should have been engaged and involved, he was disengaged and uninvolved. That came to us right off the bat. In the very first verse, 2 Samuel chapter 11, verse 1, it says this, then it happened in the spring when kings go off to war that David didn't. Now, all by itself, that might not be a big thing, might even be a reasonable thing and something for which David might have had a perfectly reasonable explanation. But given what ultimately happens and where we know this story goes with David and Bathsheba and Uriah, her husband, now looking back, it's certainly a noticeable thing, an odd thing. I think that it's the first warning sign that something has begun to shift silently, invisibly, maybe to other people, something has begun to shift in David's heart, prompting the first of four questions. We began to ask last week that I want to raise again this week as we prepare ourselves to come to the table and also to come to the cross as a people. Four questions designed to help us identify and discern is what happened to David's heart happening to mine. First question was this, quite straightforward, coming off of the first warning sign we saw relative to the shift in David's heart. It's this, are you withdrawing? Or have you withdrawn from things that you need to be engaged in? Have you withdrawn without anybody being able to tell from things like your marriage, from your kids? Have you withdrawn from relationships that provide for you accountability? Because if you're desiring to go the direction that David is going, it would be a very helpful thing to cut yourself off from accountable relationships who might speak to you the truth. Have you withdrawn from those covenant kinds of relationships that call you to account because they love you? Have you withdrawn from the battle that life sometimes is or from your pursuit of an openness to God? Have you withdrawn? Just as important as that question is this question. Can you tell when you've withdrawn? Do you have enough self-awareness to tell when those shifts are being made? Because before it shows up out here, things often start shutting down in here. It's one of the first and maybe most subtle indicators that something has begun to shift in your heart or in my heart. You see, it was in the spring when kings go off to war that David, the great warrior, didn't do what warriors do. He didn't go. Second question designed to help us discern if we're moving in some of the same directions that David was going. Are some of the same things happening in our heart that was happening in his heart? Second question is this. Are you running red lights? Because David certainly was. And if you are running red lights this morning, you know you're running them, because David certainly knew he was running red lights when he was running red lights. As I said last week, this is not one of those gray areas. It's very, very clear. First and most obvious red light you may recall from last week came in 2 Samuel 11, the first red light that David ran. When David sent to inquire about the woman he saw bathing, word came back, and the word was this. She has a name, David. She's not just an object for you because you're the king and can have anything you want to obtain for yourself and have. She has a name. She's a person. Her name is Bathsheba. Beyond that, she's somebody's sister. Beyond that, she's somebody's wife. And oh, by the way, not yours. Those are wonderful warning signs. When you hear she's somebody's daughter, she's somebody's wife, David, somebody's wife, bells are ringing, Lights are flashing. David didn't care. The yellow light had turned red. He ran the red light anyway, and he could never say he didn't know the light was red. He could never say, oh, I didn't know, no, no. Here, very clearly, David, she's somebody's daughter. She's somebody's wife. I don't care. It's a pretty obvious question to ask at this point. Pretty straight and direct. Are you running red lights? If you are, you know. Second real obvious red light that David ran came when Bathsheba sent word after this coming together experience, I'm pregnant. Which actually provides a wonderful opportunity to respond to the red lights. Because I'm pregnant is another red light. It's time to stop. Which is what you're supposed to do when you see a red light. It's time to repent. It's time to come clean. It's time to face the consequences of your sin right now, David. But in the very facing of these consequences and coming clean, you can also begin to taste the amazing grace of God and the healing that your soul very desperately needs right now. So stop. Right now, but he didn't. He ran that red light as well, still thinking he can manage this thing, still thinking he can control and conceal this. He arranges for the death in a rather elaborate way, for the death of Bathsheba's husband, Uriah, making David now not just an adulterer, a liar and a manipulator. He is now a murderer, which raises the question we had last week, even to a higher level, whatever happened to this guy's heart and could have happened to mine? Well, you've got to keep asking yourself some questions. Well, let me ask you another question. If you're wondering, could it happen to yours? have you like David embraced the spirit of entitlement because if you have embraced the spirit of entitlement then what happened to David's heart is already happening to your heart that spirit of entitlement that says of your sin I know it's sin but I deserve this I'm entitled to this I know the rules but they don't apply to me there are a variety of reasons and we went into several of them last week that kind of empower people to embrace this attitude of entitlement. For David, we speculated, maybe he had it because he was the king. I'm the king, so I can have whatever I want. Maybe he had this spirit of entitlement because he had suffered at a different time in his life. He ran for his life from Saul for years in caves, and now I've gotten a different bond. I deserve this. Again, I find us being incredibly creative to find reasons to feel entitled because I'm tired, because my spouse doesn't meet my needs, because my boss is like that or my husband or wife is like this. The bottom line, after a while, the reasons that we embrace this spirit become boring in their repetition. They're really not that creative. The bottom line, however, is this. Once that spirit of entitlement takes root in the human heart, for whatever the reason. No one has authority over you anymore, not even God. It won't matter what God says. It won't matter what the Bible says. No one can confront you, not even your best friend. No one can challenge, correct, or call you back into life. You are going to do what you want to do regardless. It's a very dangerous place to be. It's a very dangerous path to walk. David walked that right into deep sin and incredible pain. And some of you have done the same and maybe are on the way as well. Fourth question that helps us discern where we are in this whole thing and if we're maybe having the same thing happen in our heart that happened in David's heart is this. Do you have anyone in your life? Have you allowed anyone in your life who knows you well enough, who loves you deeply enough to look you in the eye and say, David, no more running. No more trying to manage this. No more trying to conceal this. It's time to confess. It's time to repent. It's time to return. It's time to come home. And yes, there will be consequences, but there is also amazing grace, so please come home. Don't do any more damage. Don't do any more damage. Well, the answer to that question for David, did he have anyone who would speak into his life, was no until chapter 12, verse 1, when God sent Nathan, the prophet, with a parable, a story, a simple story designed to expose David's sin and hopefully bring about repentance, the kind of repentance that would ultimately help him experience the grace of God, but also bring healing, as I said, to the very damaged soul of David. The parable is found in 2 Samuel 12 verses 1 through 4. It's a simple story about a rich man with large flocks of sheep who needs a lamb for a dinner that he's giving, but instead of taking a lamb from his own flocks, he cruelly and arrogantly takes the pet lamb of a poor man living down the street who had but one lamb, takes his lamb, kills it, and serves that lamb to his dinner guests. David is listening to this story. And as he's listening, he's becoming incensed, indignant, outraged at such injustice. And now we come back to the verse I read at the beginning with no other explanation. It's in that context that I just gave you that this verse now comes. Then David's anger burned. Having heard the story that Nathan told, it burned greatly against this man. And then he said, as the Lord lives, this man deserves to die, to which Nathan says, David, you're the guy. Thou art the man. I'm talking about you. You are the rich man in the story. Now, there are many things in this story, in this particular place of the story that we were in last week and will be for a few more, that I think are worthy of notice. Many directions we could go, many applications we could make. This morning, only one application. Only one thing I want you to notice. What I want us to notice as we come to the table and come to the cross is how often David's response that I just read to you is our response. What I mean by that is this. I want us to notice how easily and how quickly we can become indignant, angry, and incensed over other people's sin. We're really good at this. And I'm right in the pot with you on this one. I want us to notice how aware, how perceptive, how discerning, We have incredible gifts of discerning when it comes to other people's selfishness. We could be in the process of being incredibly selfish, but I will notice quite easily yours. Incredible how perceptive we can be about other people's arrogance and other people's depravity and frailty and lies. And one of the confrontations of the whole thing is that we're often very, very perceptive in the middle of an incredible blindness to our own. Last week after I told the story of David and Bathsheba, raised the four questions that I just gave to you again designed to help us see where we are in this heart shift, a number of you came up to me and with some deep sadness said, you know, David, what you just described described exactly where I am right now or where I have been. David, when you talked about being disengaged and just kind of withdrawing from your marriage, it was a few years ago that I could feel myself doing that, and I had all sorts of reasons. I actually did. I felt, and when you said entitled, I couldn't believe you said that because that was exactly the spirit that was on me, and I started running red lights, and I was accountable to no one, and the consequences for that were incredible. But I would also tell you that God brought repentance, and I'm experiencing grace like I've never known before. And some of them would talk about their families that were healed and some of those people I talked to last week would speak of families that aren't healed, where the divorce happened and the consequences are incredible, but there's still a taste of grace. I'm being healed, believe it or not. And with tears they would be saying, thou art the man, you don't have to say thou art the man, I am the man, I am the woman. Just as many came up to me last week and said, You know what you talked about this morning? You described exactly my husband. You described exactly my wife, my dad, my mom. You described exactly my child, my friend, my boss. When you talked about them being disengaged, having a spirit of entitlement, running red lights, accountable to no one. Let me just tell you something. For all those who, and I don't remember who you are. Honestly, I don't have any names on this, but numbers of you came that way. It happens all the time. In and of itself, there's nothing wrong with it. You know what? We do need, some of us are a Nathan. We need to notice people that we love when they start to drift. And if I have friends like that, I'm calling them back. So I'm not saying never have this kind of discernment. The point I'm trying to drive home today as we come to the table and to cross, however, is this. Just notice, just notice, just notice. how easy it is for us to be discerning about other people's sin because the word today is don't do anybody else today. Just do you. Just come to the table and come to the cross with a kind of humility that would say, Nathan, you're right, it's me. I am the one who needs the body broken and the blood shed. I am the one who needs the grace that comes from this cross. And while there are other people as well, you know what, I don't have time right now. For everybody else, I need to just do me. In just a moment, we're going to participate together in the elements of communion. And we're going to invite you to come to the table and to come to the cross, physically to come to the cross, those of you who would like to do that. but to do it with your stuff, with your heart, to come with your frailty and your sin and your stumbling and your fear and if you can even exercise a discipline here and you might need a little bit of a discipline here, quit right now, quit right now praying for your spouse. Quit wishing, well, I wish they were here. No, no, this isn't for them. It's for you. Quit praying for your parent or your child or your friend. Do you bring yourself to the table and to the cross, knowing that when you do, coming with your heart and your frailty, when you do come to this table and to this cross that way, you will receive amazing grace. I want you to notice the cross. I'm sure you have. I guess they don't have to tell you to notice that. You probably did all by yourself. And the mirrors and the candles and... we've grown quite accustomed and those of you who are visiting might feel this a bit odd but it's just a wonderful thing that we've entered into over the last several months of during communion to have the table here on the cross here and to physically give people permission to come to the cross and do business with God and it's just a powerful thing to watch people or be one of the people who comes and kneels down and sometimes there's tears and we don't know what God's doing but you're doing business with God and it's a good thing and we brought different kinds of symbols at different times to the cross related to what we felt like God was saying to us that weekend. And this weekend, you see the mirrors. And it's a little odd. The point of the mirror, I think you'll get, is this, that I come to the cross and what I need to see is me. Nobody else. Just me. And I can look in the mirror and see me just the way I am with all the warts and all the flaws. And if I see myself the way I really am, I just even more need that thing that's right behind the mirror. I need that cross. and so we come with the humility that David didn't have now he would get this humility I didn't finish the story today we've got some more weeks on this but in this place he didn't have this humility that said you know what you're talking about me he was still busy doing everybody else so today this morning we put all that doing everybody else stuff we just put it down and we just come just as we are we're going to give you just a few moments here it's more meditation to just prepare yourself speak some things to God as you hear the word of God if it helps you to close your eyes and bow your head you do that whatever you need to do to just in quietness prepare your heart for the table and for the cross we invite you to do that now Holy Spirit by your presence and by your power come and give your gifts, call your people to yourself. In Jesus' name, amen. I'm going to ask the communion stewards to come and join me now as we enter into our time at the table and at the cross. You know, it was actually David, the psalmist, who said, if not for grace, who could stand? I'm doing a lot of research on that. The verse just came to my mind just now. I know it was David in the Psalms. But I have a feeling he said that with a kind of knowing that was very deep, if he said those words after the events we're speaking of these weeks. Again, we haven't told the whole story of his repentance and the things that followed that repentance. But you begin to experience grace when you face down your sin. If not for grace, who could stand? If it wasn't for grace, this invitation to the table, this invitation to look at our sin, who would respond to it? That's why we cover, by the way. It's why we hide, because we're so convinced of judgment and alienation and being cut off forever. The table says, come with your sin, and there is forgiveness. The cross says, come with your sin, but quit hiding. You've got to quit hiding. You've got to quit pretending. And it's then you get to grace. It's then you get to comfort. And so we invite you to come. Father, bless these elements. Even as I think of the pain that our sin sometimes causes us and people we love, I think of what this table costs you. So our sin costs you. And there are many emotions that flow from that. One is gratitude. Thank you that you've invited us to the table. Thank you that there is hope. Thank you that there's a place to go when we decide to quit hiding. Bless these elements. Give us freedom as we come. Some of us as we come home. Pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
