I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to 1 John chapter 5 as we enter today the final chapter of John's epistle where John in a masterful and full of compassion for his people way recognizing that they are struggling in their faith having been having had their faith undermined by some very convincing and intimidating false teachers false teachers that we met back in 1 John chapter 2 we even found out their names They were the Gnostics and the Docetists and the Serentians, the Separatists who were kind of separating themselves from other believers out of their sense of superiority. John is here fighting for these simple believers' faith and says to them this in the opening section of chapter 5. You guys, there is an obedience to God that is born of love for God and belief in his son as God that has the power not only to help you overcome these false teachers, but it has the power to help you overcome the world. So keep on obeying and keep on believing and keep on loving even when it doesn't feel like you're overcoming. Now all of that is going to be dealt with in the first 13 verses. I'm not going to read all 13 right now. Just the first five will get us into the flow of thought. Beginning verse 1 says this. Whoever believes, there's the belief component, that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And whoever loves, there's the love component. The Father loves the child born of Him. By this we know that we love the children of God. When we love God and observe His commandments, there's the obedient part. Believing, loving, obeying. For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. and his commandments are not burdensome. For whatever is born of God overcomes, there's the overcoming piece, the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith or our believing. And who is the one who overcomes the world? But the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. Now, before we get deeply into this text, I want to briefly remind you of where we have been so that we will have a better handle on where we are this morning, coming into chapter 5. I think most of you are aware that for the past several months, indeed, since the very beginning of January, born of our study in 1 John 4, we have been examining and affirming the centrality, priority, and necessity of living a life of love. Now at the risk of oversimplifying a body of teaching that was so extensive, the message of 1 John 4, indeed the message of this entire epistle has been this, That God is love, 1 John 4, 8. And that this God who is love has set his love on us, meaning this, that from the beginning he has been the initiator of this relationship. He loved us first. Even before we knew his name, he loved us first. Driven by his love for us, God has pursued us, was willing to pay an enormous price to win, reconcile, and redeem us. All of that coming with an incredibly glorious promise. It's this, that if we have the courage and faith to open wide our hearts, to believe and receive what we have been calling the last few months, the furious love of God, that that love will change who we are. Beloved, now we are the children of God, 1 John 3, 2. 1 John 3, 1. Do you see how great a love the Father has given unto us, that we should be called the children of God, and such we are. But the love of God believed and received changes not only who we are, it changes when we receive it, it changes how we live, it changes what and who and how we love. Now, the reason I'm telling you all of this is at least in part because it was my full expectation that when we came to 1 John chapter 5, that we'd be done with all this love stuff. We did a series on love. It lasted a long time, but we're done with chapter 4, and now we're done with love. No, we're not, I came to discover. In fact, when I finally let that in, that we weren't done with this thing on love, the text started making a little more sense. For as we come to work through 1 John 5, we discover that woven into the fabric of everything John is saying to these people here, that woven into the fabric of everything he calls them to and tries to encourage them with is this fundamental bedrock truth that we are loved by God. That if we have the courage and faith to believe that, to receive it, that it will change who we are, how we live, what and who and how we love. In other words, if you receive this love and step into it, really believe it, that it will indelibly mark us in discernible, visible, and knowable ways. Let me say it this way. I believe that John in 1 John 5 is saying, among many other things, this, that this is what a life looks like, that this is what a life is marked by when it is deeply rooted and firmly grounded in the love of God and love for God. Let's keep it simple, I hear him saying here. there are three things that mark such people. Number one, they are believing. Number two, they are obeying. And number three, they are loving. And if you get much more complicated than that, you're getting more complicated than you need to. Three things that mark us, believing, obeying, and loving. And beloved, it is by these three simple things that you will overcome the world, verse four. It is by believing, obeying, and loving that you will know for certain that you belong to God, verse 13. It is by obeying, believing, and loving that you will walk in confidence that he hears your prayers, verse 14, that he's with you in the battle, that he's partnering with you in the living of your life. So keep on believing and keep on loving and keep on obeying, even if right now today you don't feel much like an overcomer. Believe, obey, and love. Now, what I want to do today is examine those three characteristics, obedience, faith, and love. But what dawned on me as I was trying to figure out how to do that is this, that I couldn't separate those three dynamics and look at them one at a time. Like we look at obedience, and this is what it is, and this is love, and this is what it is. I couldn't do that because consistent with John's style of writing, at least here in this epistle, his style of writing is circular. And it's one of the things that's quite frankly, He's driven me crazy as I've tried to preach this thing. He says things over and over and over again. He's saying things in this chapter that he has said before and has said at great length. But he's bringing it up again. He's saying it again. One of the reasons is that all of these things are connected. You can't take obedience, love, and faith and separate them. They go together. Without all three, none of them authentically exist. Let me explain what I mean. I think we know that people truly born of God love God. You can't have one without the other. It's pretty obvious. It's pretty basic. If you are born of God, you will love God. If you love God, it's because you were born of God. You can't separate those two things. They don't exist unless the other one is true. They go together. So here it is. We love God. I am born of God, so I love God. But what is love for God? Well, when you think about what it means to love God, some of you think that it has to do with a warm and gooey feeling about God, kind of a soft spot you got for the big guy. and I'm sure there are some people who say oh sure I love God and it basically taps in them some nice warm and gooey feeling they have about God that's pretty much separate from the rest of their life John is saying here you can't separate any of this what is love? this is love verse 3 this is the love of God that we keep his commandments they go together obedience and love you can't have one without the other it works like this. The reason we obey him is because we love him. If indeed we love him, we will obey him. They go together. They feed each other. You can't have one without the other. If you don't have both, neither one exists in an authentic way. If you love him, you will obey him. If you obey him, it's because you love him. Now, I need to clarify something just to get it straight in your minds about what it means to keep his commandments. It says here that you will, this is the love of God, that you keep his commandments. And the word keep is a little intimidating. At least it is to me. Because what I hear, without knowing actually what it means, what I just hear on the front end, keep his commandments, I hear all of them all the time, every day, I've already blown that big time. And so obviously, I must not be born of God. And so I'm kind of stopping in this verse, and I'm kind of done. I've been disqualified already. It's very important that we understand what this word keep means. We dealt with this already when John dealt with this phrase in chapter 2. I bring it to you again. keep does indeed mean obey but more than mechanical compliance to a list of behaviors that we have to do because it's the law the word keep brings with it the nuance of watchful careful loving obedience in fact the way I was saying it when we were in chapter 2 is it means to hold as precious his precepts or hold as precious his statutes it's not just compliance to the letter of the law that keeps the law because it's the law. It's an entering into the spirit of the law that keeps the law because I love the giver of the law. It's a heart thing, beloved. It's a love thing. It all comes back to love. That's why I obey. The reason I obey is because I love the reason I obey. The reason I love is because he loved me. now one of the places that we see this spirit of obedience is in the heart of David I mean we could go many places to see this thing illustrated but David's heart is maybe one of the best places we could go David said things like this oh how I love thy law why because I love you that's why David who said in Psalm 27 verse 8 when thou didst say to me seek my face my heart said seek I will seek your face. The key there is there's a command, seek my face. But my heart said I will seek your face. See the letter of the law says you better do it. It's the law. So when it says seek your face, my letter of the law says okay, whatever that means to seek your face. I guess that means I should go to church. I should read my Bible. I should pray a prayer here and there. Better do it. Spirit of the law says, what do you mean I better do it? I want to do it. I want to seek your face. You know why I want to seek your face? Because I love your face. and I want to see your face. And quite frankly, it scares me when I can't see your face. I will seek your face. They go together, beloved, obedience and love. You can't have one without the other. If you don't have both, neither one exists in an authentic way. The reason we obey him is because we love him. If indeed we love him, we will obey him. That's why when people who are truly born of God here are passages like Titus 2 11 and 12 which says for the love of God and the grace of God has appeared to all men in other words the love of God has come to you you have received it you have believed it it has changed you not only did it change you but this love and grace that has come to you began when it came to you to teach you and when it began to teach you was this that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live sensibly righteously and godly in this present world and the letter of the law hears sensibly righteously and godly and hears that and goes oh i guess we should do it because it's the law the spirit of the law says when thou did say to me live sensibly righteously and godly my heart said that's what i want more than anything i want to live in a way that would honor you that would give me life see it's why when people truly born of god And hear the Apostle Paul in Ephesians 4 say, let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech, which is slander, let that all be put away from you, along with all malice. And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other. The letter of the law says, oh, I guess I can't be bitter. Better not be bitter. Okay, I'll do a kind thing here, because that's what the law totally misses, what it means to hold precious his precepts and keep his commandments. The spirit of the law says, when thou didst say to me, David, let all your bitterness go. Don't use it to protect yourself and defeat other people anymore. Along with all malice and guile and clamor and slander, let it all be put away. And I'm calling you to kindness that doesn't protect you. And I'm calling you to tenderheartedness and forgiveness. And when thou didst say to me that, my heart said, that's what I want. 1 John 5.3, This is the love of God that we hold precious, his precepts, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments, now here's the kicker on this end of verse 3 that's quite frankly a little puzzling, depending on your view of the commandments. They aren't burdensome, he says. Why is that? Well, I've already told you a little bit. Why? Because now the commandments change. Now they're what I do for love. But there was another reason that his commandments are not burdensome. And this is where I want to spend a bulk of the time here, because this is kind of some very important new ground kind of teaching, I think, in terms of at least how we're framing it. Reason number one that the commandments are not burdensome is because we love him. Reason number two that the commandments are not burdensome is because we believe him. And that word, belief, brings in the third component of this cycle I'm talking about, loving, obeying, believing. Let's look at that. We see it in verse one. Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Verse 5, and who is the one who overcomes the world? But the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. Now, if you're tracking with me, and in fact, if you're reacting to these verses the way I did at the beginning of the week when I was trying to make heads and tails of them, the question you would have is, how does that work? How does believing that Jesus is the Christ have anything to do with whether I obey him or not? And how does believing that Jesus is the Christ have anything to do with overcoming what John calls here the world? How does all that work together, Dave? You say it all ties together. It's all a cycle. How does that work? Well, here's how. As simply as I can say it. If indeed Jesus is God, if it really is true that he is what Hebrews 1 says he is, the radiance of God's glory. if he really is the exact representation of God's nature and that he upholds all things pertaining to life by the word of his power then it might just follow that he more than any other has the best possible information on how life works and how it can be experienced to the full. Let me say it this way. The reason his commandments are not burdensome is because they were not given to us to weigh us down to spoil our fun. That would be burdensome if the reason, if God gave the commandments this way. Well, that's a fun thing. I really don't want my people to have too much fun, so I'll tell them they can't do that. That's a burdensome commandment. And by the way, I think some of us instinctively think that about the commandments. You gave it to just kind of keep us from having too much fun because too much fun, if I laugh too hard, just isn't very holy. Beloved, the commandments of God were not given to us to weigh us down or spoil our fun. The commandments of God, the precepts of Christ, are designed by him not to weigh us down, but to set us free. To live life to the full so that we can love deeply and live abundantly. So we can sing and dance and laugh for joy. Jesus has said it this way, I am come that you might have life and that you might have it to the full. And when I talk about life, I am not talking about eternal life that just kicks in when you die. I am come that you might experience life to the full now. But all of that claim from Jesus that he offers us life, abundant life, presses a question. And the question is this. Do you believe that? Because if you do not believe that Jesus is the Christ, or if you do believe he is the Christ, but you believe he is the Christ in some sort of distant, fuzzy, theological way, like it's the thing you need to believe in order to go to heaven. In fact, you would fight to the death. Anybody who said that Jesus wasn't God, and you get all upset when you read these magazine articles that says, oh, I don't think they believe that Jesus is God. I think he's God. You get all indignant because that's what you have to believe to go to heaven. But you see no connection between who he is and what he says about life and how to live it to how you live. If all you see him as is someone whose name you need to believe in, almost like a little magic formula you need to know to go to heaven, but you don't see who he is as having the best information about how to do life, I promise you, you will not obey him. Why would you? What does he have to say to you about your real life? It's a very important statement I want to make. And if you're taking notes, you need to write this down. Because this is right at the core of everything I'm saying this morning. Central to our obedience to Christ is what we believe about him. Obeying and believing go together. You can't have one without the other. For if I believe that Jesus, who is God, really does have the best information on how to live my life to the full, if I believe that, then I will obey him. And I will be moving in that direction. And I will be holding precious his precepts. And if I am holding precious his precepts, if I am moving in the direction of obeying him, all it reveals is that I believe him. When he says, this is how you do your life, this is how you love your wife, this is how you love your husband, this is how you treat people, this is what real freedom is. And when I obeyed it, it simply means that I believed what he said. All that presses another question. It's kind of a confrontive question. The question's this, so what do you believe? do you believe that God is good do you believe that his precepts are right and true do you believe that his precepts his statutes his commandments as it were can be relied upon and trusted do you believe that the words of Jesus and what he says about how to live life in the kingdom of God represent the best possible information on how to experience life to the full and that by walking in them you will find things like joy and peace and fullness. Because if you don't believe that, you won't obey him. And if you don't obey him, it simply tells the whole wide world you don't believe him. By the way, this battle of belief began in the garden. This is an ancient battle when Satan said to Adam, Adam, hath God not said this and that? Adam, Adam, you know, God said you can do this, but you can't do that. I'm here to tell you, God's holding out on you. God isn't good. He can't be trusted. He knows that if you eat this tree, you're going to have really good fun. So, and at the bottom line of Adam's disobedience, and it's at the bottom line of every disobedience since then, yours and mine, is what Adam decided to believe about God. I guess he isn't good. I guess he can't be trusted. I'm not going to listen to what God said. I'm going to listen to this other voice. And everything fell apart from there. I remember one of the first times I kind of bumped into this whole line of thinking. It was several years ago, actually, when we came to Exodus chapter 20 in our study of the book of Exodus, the Ten Commandments. What I remember about that is that the part of the work I had to do in the Ten Commandments prior to examining the commandments themselves, before I told, you know, we got into, you know, thou shalt love the Lord your God, before we got into any commandment at all, was all the work we had to do on the front end to kind of work through our resistance to the commandments and our misunderstandings of the commandments. In fact, I went back in my notes this last week and pulled out that whole file on the Ten Commandments, and I spent two weeks before we did anything on the commandments saying, they're really not that bad, you know, like that. For the truth be told, many people do indeed, not always consciously, but see the commandments of God and the precepts of Christ as the spiritual equivalent of a sourpuss parent slapping the hand of a child, reaching for their favorite cookie, effectively saying, no, you can't have the really good things. That would be altogether too much fun. And the only reason, really, you can't have the really good cookie is because it tastes good, and I don't like you to enjoy yourself that much. Again, enjoying yourself that much isn't very godly. So no. And the obedient child says, okay. Where's the spirit of life there? There's no life in that. That's just death, and that's burdensome. And some of you live in relation to the precepts of God that very way. Everything you do in terms of obedience to God is, okay. And you feel like maybe I'm avoiding some huge punishment or something because I did it. But there isn't any life there for you. Which, by the way, this is very interesting. If you see kind of God and his commandments and Christ's precepts as this parent who just doesn't want you to have any fun and so always says no. What that does is it reveals some amazing things about what we believe about God and his son Jesus. Because what it reveals is that maybe we believe he isn't good. He can't be trusted. He's not to be believed. And that, quite frankly, he probably doesn't know very much about life and joy and peace. Now I'll go to him and I'll believe in his name strongly when it comes to my eternal salvation. I believe in Jesus. And you say he isn't God. Yes, he is. And I'll get real mad at you if you say he isn't because it's my hope for eternal life so I go to heaven. But the belief in him and what he says has no bearing on my life. He doesn't know about life. He just knows about helping me get to heaven. Let me ask you a question. Let's set it up with this. I think most of us believe that Jesus was holy. You know, just kind of get a picture of Jesus walking around and wonder what he looked like and what people's impressions of him were. Well, that he was holy. I think if you got a microphone and went out to a man on the street today, this afternoon, and spoke to someone who doesn't know God at all, doesn't love Jesus at all, has no concern. But tell me about Jesus. What was he like? He was what? What was he like? He was, I think, among other things, they'd say he was holy. Let me ask you the question. Do you believe he was happy? Do you believe that Jesus was joyful? Do you believe that Jesus had any kind of handle on how to live life to the fullest? Do you believe that there was anything about his personality or his stature or the way he walked through life or dealt with people that caused people to go, what is it about him? How come I want to hang around him? Or was he just this floaty, mystic, weird guy who did miracles, so let's get in on the miracle thing? I think Jesus knew, but I think one of the reasons these raw bone, I mean, listen to who followed him. They were fishermen. It's like today. It would be like today if the first impact Jesus had on a group of people would be dock workers. We're talking blue collar, you better show me the money stuff. You know, where's the beef, man? These guys were compelled by him. You know why? He taught him to fish. What do you mean he taught him to fish? Remember the scene? It's after his resurrection. I mean, this is how practical it got. They're fishing all night long. They're putting their nets there. They're putting their nets on this side, on that side. They don't catch any fish. They don't catch. They're the fishermen. Jesus is on the shore. He says to them, put your nets this time on that side. And all of them in the boat. Now, I'm making this part up, but I'm just kind of getting into my own tension around and all of them in the bowl look at him and go, what? Jesus, you're the savior of the world? Just keep being a savior of the world. You do your job, we'll do ours. I'm a fisherman. This is real life here. I don't think, excuse me, I don't think you know much about fish. We've been fishing all night. We've been doing this all our life. Who are you? I'm God. Trust me. Trust me. Throw your nets over there. They caught more fish than they know what to do with. And then they got real curious. You want us to trust you. Even in the write down, like the car I buy maybe, you're like, you want me to trust you. Well, if you can teach me about that, maybe you teach me to, could you teach me to pray? I mean, when you pray, Jesus, you say, our Father, and you talk to God like you know him. Could you teach me how to pray? And could you teach me how to be a dad? Because I don't have a clue, because I didn't have a dad. and I don't know how. Could you teach me how to be a mom? Could you teach me how to be a husband or a wife? Could you teach me how to be a friend? Could you teach me how to be free from some of my addictions? Could you teach me about life? I need you for more than a ticket to heaven. I think some of us, beloved, at an unconscious level, believe that if we follow Christ and obey his precepts, it's probably the right thing to do, but it won't be much fun. If we obey God and hold precious his precepts, you know, we probably won't burn in hell, which is a really good thing. But the downside is if you really follow God, your life is going to be pretty dull and pretty dry. You're going to miss out on most of the fun. If you follow God, there's really only going to be one flavor in your life, vanilla, hope you like it. And there are really only two colors if you follow God, black and white. Isn't it amazing? It just stuns me that people who say they know God end up so dull because it's so opposite of who God is. It isn't just black and white. Every color of the rainbow, every experience of life I have for you if you would believe me. Some of you think there's only one direction. Right. There's more than one direction. It's not all right. That was a joke. It didn't work in any of the services. Didn't work in one. But I do not give up. I believe, beloved, that to these perceptions of God and his law, all of heaven weeps. And among the things I think heaven says while it weeps is this, I have come that you might have life, and I've come that you might have it to the full. But if you don't believe that about him, you will not obey him. You know why? Because central to our obedience to Christ is what we believe about him. They go together, obedience. and belief. You can't have one without the other. Without them both, neither are authentically in existence. By the way, all of this is one reason I so love Dallas Willard's book, Divine Conspiracy. I mean, he got me in the opening line, in his introduction, the opening line of his introduction of his book is this. My hope is to get a fresh hearing for Jesus. I love that. especially he says among those who believe they already understand him in this case presumed familiarity has led to unfamiliarity unfamiliarity has led to contempt and contempt has led to profound ignorance about who Jesus is and what he calls us to goes on to say this very few people today find Jesus an interesting interesting as a person or a vital relevance to the course of their actual lives he's not generally regarded as a real-life personality who deals with real-life issues, but is thought to be concerned with some feathery realm other than the one we must deal with every day. He is looked on as a mere icon, a wraith-like semblance of a man fit for the role of sacrificial lamb or alienated social critic, but little more. One well-known scholarly picture of him, today held by many, has him wandering the hills of Palestine, deeply confused about who he was, and even about his crucial points relative to his basic topic, the kingdom of heaven. From time to time, Jesus would utter disconnected, though very profound and vaguely radical irrelevancies now preserved for us obscurely in the Gospels. Ben Willard raises this question. Would you be able to trust your life to such a person? Is this how he seems to you? Are you going to be inclined? I'm sorry, if this is how he seems to you, are you going to be inclined to become his student? To be devotedly following and courageously obeying him? Absolutely not. Who would? By the way, this is precisely why the heresy that John was fighting in this epistle is so dangerous. You remember the heresy he's fighting. I don't have time to dress it out for you completely. But the Serentians and the Gnostics, the separatists, that I mentioned at the beginning of the talk, and we talked about earlier in this series, from their self-proclaimed position of intellectual and spiritual even superiority, had begun to undermine belief and confidence in Christ as being truly God. And they began to postulate these high-sounding theories about the true identity of Jesus. He only seemed to be God. He was a very nice person, but actually the God part of him was a phantom. It was a vapor. He's just kind of mystical and spiritual, And the more blobby you can make him, the more unbelievable he becomes. And that faith undermined, undermines eventually obedience. Why is that? It's very simple. Because if Jesus really isn't God, why on earth should he have anything to say to me about how I live my life? He shouldn't. If Jesus really isn't God, if all he was was a vapor or a phantom, why should I pay any more attention to him than I would to anybody else? Well, I won't. And that's precisely why much of 1 John, that I'm not sure we've always been able to capture, I've grabbed onto it a few times, is such a fight. This is a polemic epistle. It's why he began the epistle the way he did. Chapter 1, verse 1. What was from the beginning, what we have heard with our ears, seen with our eyes, handled with our hands. Why is he saying that? He's saying that to all of the false teachers. He is not a vapor. I have seen him. I have heard him. I have held him. This God, this Jesus is God, and I know him, and he wasn't a vapor. He was really fished. He knew how to do life. It's also why in this section we're in, beginning in verse 6, the part that I didn't read, John in verse 6 to verse 12 is doing what Dallas Willard is doing in his book. He's trying to get a fresh hearing for Jesus. I want you to know who Jesus is. Verse 6. This Jesus is the one who came by water and blood. Jesus Christ. Not only with water, but also with water and with blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three that bear witness. The Spirit and the water and the blood. These three are in agreement. If we receive the witness of men, by the way, if there are three people who say something happened, we would say that that is true. Then the witness of God is greater. and the witness of God is this that he has borne witness concerning his son and the witness about his son is this that he is God and he is the life so you can believe him by the way there's some you don't even want to know how many hours I spent what is the water, what was the blood what was the spirit and we could go on and on and on and there are many debates about that I think the water speaks of his baptism and the confirmation of Jesus at that point the blood I think speaks of his death and resurrection the spirit, the empowerment that confirms all of the life and work of God. But the point of all that, whatever the debate about what the water, blood, and spirit is, is this, John's urgency is you have to believe. Your confidence in who Jesus is cannot be undermined because everything falls apart from there. And by the way, maybe one of the best places where it talks about Jesus was confirmed by the water as the sun, one of the things that happened in the baptism of Christ was the Spirit came on him, as you know, and the Father spoke of the Son saying this, this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. And then some incredibly important words for our study. Listen, he said this, listen to him. Why? Because he has the words of life. And I'm not just talking about what you need to know about him to go to heaven. If you want to know how to do life and live it to the full, experience now the kingdom of heaven, listen to him. why is he fighting for that why am I fighting for it this morning here's why because central to our obedience to Christ is what we believe about him obeying and believing go together you cannot have one without the other without both of them together neither of them exist one final question pulling it to a close why is believing that Jesus is the Christ the necessary ingredient for overcoming the world added question to that what does he mean by world I mean world is a pretty big thing to overcome whether you're speaking of it literally or figuratively what do you mean by overcoming the world well the fact is I think it was in chapter 2 yes it was in chapter 2 that we talked about this before it's important that we understand what John means by the world it comes from the Greek word cosmos and while there are several usages of it in scripture in John's usage of it he is a speaking of it with reference to a system. It is a system of thoughts, ideas, and activities dominated by Satan. Chapter 5 verse 19 says that the whole world, cosmos, lies in the power of the evil one. This system of thoughts, ideas, and activities offers a version of life that looks to be true, but it is false. It looks to present itself as life, but it is death. It offers what looks like joy, but it yields ultimately sorrow. It appears to be lasting and substantial, but it is passing away. This system, according to 1 John 2 verse 16, is driven, fueled, and characterized by three things. You probably know them. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life that says, I am basically the center of the universe. The word lust is important to understand. It's the Greek word epithumia, and all it means is strong desire. And I'm going to say something about strong desire, this word epithumia that might surprise you coming from a preacher. Here's the word. There is nothing wrong with epithumia. There is nothing wrong with strong desire. God made me and you with strong desires. And part of my strong desire, when rightly directed, brings me right to the one who made me. My desire for life is designed to bring me to God who can teach me about how to do life and be a dad and a husband and a lover of friends. But this world system, dominated by Satan, approaches your strong desire and makes to your strong desire a promise. The promise is this. I can give you what you want. I can satisfy your needs. I can quench your thirsts. I can fulfill your strong desires. Here's how. Indulge your flesh. Say yes to every urge you feel and call it freedom. You're free. Indulge your eyes. Indulge your ego centrality. You really are the center of all things. You really do deserve. You really are entitled. You're really getting ripped off. Now, on the front end of that message to my spirit, it just sounds like a sweet deal. And I've heard that message and so have you from my first breath. It's the world we live in. I hear it on TV. I'll hear it this afternoon. In subtle ways that come at me, in ways I don't even know what's coming at me. And there will be times probably even this afternoon that I won't even know it. I'm believing it. I like the word indulge. I love that word. It sounds like freedom to me. Indulge. Because you're free. You can do what you want. It's America. Good. And I like being told that I'm the center. Partly because I have the sneaking suspicion that maybe I am. I love being told that I can have what I want, when I want it, wherever I want it. But you know what? It does not take deep thought to play that out into life. Just even a little bit to find out that it begins to fall apart. Just play this way of life out into your family, workplace, school, or church. Imagine with me just for a moment being in a family or a workplace, school or church, and sadly some of you won't have to use great powers of imagination because you may be in a family or workplace. Hopefully not a church, hopefully not a family, but you may be in one like this where everyone in that family or church or school, whatever, is driven and fueled by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life, where everyone in it is indulging their flesh, indulging their eyes, where everyone in it is living as if they are the absolute center of the world. Well, as I begin to play that out and wonder what that would feel like to live in, it all of a sudden doesn't sound to be as much fun. Indeed, it sounds a little scary. Indeed, I want to tell you what that is. That sounds a lot like hell. You know, one of the things, the basic tenets of 1 John that we've been talking about is God is calling us into eternal life now. Well, I want to tell you something. Not only can we get a taste of heaven now, but you can get a taste of hell now too. And some of you doubt tasting it. All of us have tasted it. And it all comes down to what you believe. Who are you going to believe about where life comes from and how life works? It's a scary thing to live in a place that's driven by lust of the flesh, eyes, and the pride of life. Because in a system like that, in a family like that, it's every person for himself. you're entirely on your own. If you're in a family where I'm the center and I'm going to do what I want when I want, well, you know what? You're never going to know if you're loved. Never know if you're really loved because you're always going to be a little suspicious that the reason you're getting loving attention is because they want something from you because basically everything's for them. You can't ever be confident that anybody's going to stay. Why? Because as soon as they get a better offer that feels a little better, that might be a little prettier or have a little more money, they're off. Why? Because it's my needs and my desires and my wants and I am the center of the world. And I will do what I want when I want. Because I'm taking care of me. Welcome to hell. Imagine now a different scene. Where a group of people are by faith living a different way. Listening to a different voice. Believing and obeying a different master. Just get a vision for this. And by the way, something's going to resonate in you because I think God made us for this. Imagine being with a group of people, being in a family, my goodness, being in a church, a workplace or school, where the people in it just know that they are loved by God, that they are the children of, beloved, we are the children of God. So sing and dance and laugh for joy. We belong. And who? Because they know that. Love God back. Not only love him, but they believe in his son, Jesus. And because of their love for God and belief in his son, they're just doing everything they can before God and among the people of God to put aside all bitterness. Oh, you guys, let's just put it down. Why? Well, one, he said two. And I believe that how he says life works, works. And they're beginning to put aside all wrath and anger and clamor and slander. Slander, the way I use words and information and slant it a certain way to protect myself and heal my wound and make sure somebody else gets theirs. Oh, God, let's not let that in here. Put that aside. And all malice and, Lord, with the people of God, by the power of your spirit, teach us to be kind and tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even while the world says the way to be happy is to get people back. Do you think the happiest people on earth are the ones who are getting everybody back? I promise you they don't sleep well. Just telling you. Do they get them back? Maybe. But they don't sleep well. Forgiving one another. How do you do that? Even as God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you. It doesn't mean start living in denial about your malice. It starts facing it down and confessing it and seeing it and not calling it something else. That's what it means to live in the light. We talked about that at the beginning. Let me close with this question. And what would it feel like to be living in a family or going to a church where people were just really kind of absorbed about living like that? Well, I think it feels just a little bit like heaven now. Every day, all day long? No. But you can get a taste of it now. Final word. Just conclusion. John's message here in chapter 5 is simply this that there is an obedience to God born of love for God and belief in his son as God that has the power to overcome the world the world system and all of its lies in such a way that we who are born of God can live a different way no longer driven and dominated by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life. We really can live by love. Love that is from God. Love that is for God. And love that is for people. So keep on believing. And keep on obeying. And keep on loving Jesus, who is the Christ. Why should I keep on believing, obeying, and loving Jesus? Here's why. Because in him there is life, verse 11. And this is the witness that God has given us this life. And this life is in his son. He who has the son has life, an eternal kind of life right now. Thus saith the Lord. Let's pray. Father, I thank you for your word. Through John, empowered by your spirit, may it bear much fruit in our families, schools, workplaces, gatherings for lunch this afternoon, in our church. I pray these things in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, Amen
