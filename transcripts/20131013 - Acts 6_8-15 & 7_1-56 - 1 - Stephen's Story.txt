Music And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders in his signs among the people. but some men from what was called the synagogue of the freedmen, including both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen. But they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the spirit of which he was speaking. Then they secretly induced men to say, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God. And they stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and they came up to him and dragged him away and brought him before the council. They put forward false witnesses who said, This man insistently speaks against this holy place and the law. For we have heard him say that this Nazarene Jesus will destroy this place and alter the customs which Moses handed down to us. and fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the council saw his face like the face of an angel. The high priest said, Are these things so? And he said, Hear me, brethren and fathers. At which point Stephen launches into the longest sermon in the entire book of Acts, which we don't have time to read. And when they heard it, says verse 54, they were cut to the quick. But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. And he said, behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man is standing at the right hand of God. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Last week, if you were here, you might remember that in our dealing with the first seven verses of the book of Acts, the sixth chapter, we met this man named Stephen. He was identified last week as being full of the Holy Spirit and faith, full of grace and power too. A Hellenistic Jew is what he was by racial origin, ethnic background, just like the Hellenistic widows who were being overlooked in the daily serving of the food, which we dealt with last week, worse. even himself, like the Hellenistic widows who were being overlooked because as a Hellenistic Jew, Stephen as well was in some sense being overlooked as well because as I explained last week, these Hellenists, though they were quite cultured people, were not natives. They were not the native Hebrews. So the native Hebrew widows were getting the food. The Hellenistic widows weren't and that was a problem. The Hellenists were from Greece, as we indicated last week. So even though they'd come to faith in Christ, they were now in the church. It was kind of a disturbing reality that they weren't being seen. They didn't quite fit in this early church, which is why these widows weren't seen. They weren't natives until one day, precipitated actually, by this event where they kind of noticed, whoa, we're not seeing something here that needs to be seen. These widows weren't getting their food. the apostles started doing something they hadn't done before because they didn't know they needed to do it. They needed to start looking for some people that were outside the circle of who they were familiar with, which is always a stretching experience when you realize you've been not including some people who needed to be included in order to help solve this problem, actually, of serving these widows their foods because they were being left out. But because this ministry of serving the widows was not a minor matter to the apostles. It was not a menial task to them. They knew they needed people. It says in verse three of good reputation, who were not just of good reputation, but were people full of the spirit and of wisdom. So when they actually started looking for people like that, and they started looking for people like that outside the circle of the people that they commonly looked at, the first guy they saw, and I think it was the first guy they saw, because he's the first guy on the list of six who they identify. First guy they see is this guy named Stephen, along with six others, all of whom were Grecians as well, who they hadn't seen before. It says in verse 5, but there they were, seven men, actually, of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom too. But Stephen, as it turns out, was full of more than that because according to verse 8, he was full of grace and power to, and wow, it says, it doesn't say wow, I say wow, it says, here he is performing great wonders and signs among the people. The way I would picture that, this guy we haven't seen performing great wonders and signs among the people, it's like a quarterback who's been playing second string, we've never seen him play, first time he shows up, he lights the place up with signs and wonders. Oh my, who is this guy? Where did he come from? It's all really good. But with that stuff coming off the bench and all of a sudden you light it up, it creates a problem because now, just like what happened to Peter and John when they started moving in signs and wonders, you're on the radar screen of some people, other people, not just the apostles, some other people who hadn't seen you before, who didn't care about you before, but who weren't too excited about this new kid on the block who's throwing touchdowns. He had some goofy analogy. Signs and wonders. He's scoring big, lighting it up. Not too excited about this new kid on the block. And so it is in verse 9. It says this, that these men who were called, who were from what was called the synagogue of the freedmen, whatever that is, These guys, they get in Stephen's face. So as they rose up to argue with him, which is fascinating, and creates some interesting dynamics because they actually didn't know what they were getting into here. This guy is, you know, the second string analogy is kind of already worn out, I think. They didn't know what they were getting into when they decided to rise up and argue with Stephen because Stephen was a Greek. It means nothing to me or you until I studied this a bit. He was a Hellenistic Jew, which means a number of things. It means he was ignored by the native Hebrews, but it also means this, that unlike Peter and John, who were uneducated, in fact, that was one of the fundamental things we needed to know about Peter and John and the other apostles, too, that they were speaking these words of wisdom, and in fact, a council. Remember that one? It's Peter and John, but before the council in Acts 4, verse 13, the council marveled, who are these guys? Because they noted that they were uneducated, untrained. They were considered, Peter and John and the other apostles as well, by some to be hayseeds from Galilee, their kind of lower class. But Stephen is of Grecian descent, which made him a different breed, quite frankly, than the other apostles. A man of letters, actually, is what Stephen was of education and culture, particularly Greek culture, which might help explain at least part of why when in verse 9 it says that some men from the synagogue of the freedmen rose up to argue with him. They were unable to cope, it says in verse 10, with the wisdom that he had because Stephen was a force. But there was one thing that these men from the synagogue of the freedmen actually had in common. with Stephen because much like Stephen and the Hellenistic widows who didn't fit in with the native Hebrews in Jerusalem, neither did they. They were, that is, these people from the synagogue of the freedmen, they were outsiders as well. Where were they from? Text says this. They were from Cyrene, Alexandria, Slesia, and Asia. And they were called the freedmen because this whole group was a group of former slaves who'd been set free. They didn't quite fit in, but they'd found kind of a power base in the Hellenistic area of Jerusalem in the synagogue that was theirs. Interestingly, this synagogue, kind of get a picture of it, full of former slaves who didn't fit in with the native Hebrews in Jerusalem, but were still intensely Jewish, which is why they had their own synagogue would have been in the Hellenistic part of Jerusalem where Stephen actually happened to live himself. So what's actually going on here, I find this fascinating, is that this guy named Stephen is moving in on their territory. Indeed, according to Ben Witherington, whose commentary I was using, at least one of them for this story, says this. He's It's kind of a matter of record that that's what was going on here. I'm quoting him here. He says this. The followers of Jesus in Acts chapter 7, the followers of Jesus from among the Hellenists who were now being led by Stephen were having great success in the Greek-speaking neighborhoods where the synagogue of the freedmen had previously been the only game in town. And when you're the only game in town, when a new game comes in, you kind of resent them. So that is why they get in Stephen's face, rise up and argue with him in verse 9, but unable to cope. Whoa, we're in over our head here with the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking. They did what you do. When you're losing a fight, you fight dirty. And so they did, like a desperate politician who really needs to win, they started a smear campaign, verse 11. So they secretly induced some people to spread lies. They knew they were lies, saying, we've heard this Stephen guy who's getting all this attention now speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God. And they did that spreading of lies enough to get the attention of the council because they stirred up the people, it says in verse 12, and they stirred up the elders and the scribes who were on the council. So the council then did what the council did also to Peter and John back in Acts chapter 5. They came upon Stephen, it says in verse 12, and dragged him away and brought him before the council and then standing before the council. Picture him there just like Stephen and John in Acts 5.33, the same council who so wanted to kill Peter and John. They now have Stephen in their crosshairs. They paid a guy, that is, the synagogue of the freedmen guys, paid a guy in verse 13. It says they put forward a false witness saying this, that this man, Stephen, incessantly speaks against this holy place. And this holy place was the temple. And incessantly speaks against the law as well. So there's actually four accusations kind of spinning around Stephen. That he speaks against Moses and God. He blasphemes Moses and God, verse 11. And he speaks against this holy place, the temple and the law in verse 13. And so it is in chapter 7, verse 1. The high priest looks at Stephen and asks a very simple question. A very direct question. A very short question. The question is this. Are these things so yes or no? It's a yes or no question. Expecting a yes or no answer. And I've got, I lost my notes. Here it is. Out of order. It's a yes or no question calling for a yes or no answer. It's calling for a short answer, actually. And the short answer to, have you been blaspheming God, Moses, the temple, and the law, the short answer is no. The true answer is no, because he hadn't blasphemed God, Moses, the temple, or the law. So Stephen, just say no. Because the only safe answer right now, Stephen, is no. But Stephen couldn't do that. opting instead to take a stand, as it were, but actually opting instead to make his defense. And he does it by launching into what Mary referred to as this sermon that ultimately does become the longest sermon in all of the book of Acts. It was his defense. And the reason it's long is this, because what he does in his defense, as the basis of his defense, is to tell the council a story, a bedtime story. No, it's not that. Actually, it's a story that they knew. So it's a familiar story he's going to tell, and it's a story that they love and reverence and think they know better than anybody else knows the story because he's going to tell them the story of God, which makes it their story too, beginning as this story does with Abraham. Look at it in verse 2 of Acts 7. Here's Stephen beginning his defense, saying this, the glory of God appeared, the God of glory, rather, appeared to him. God revealed himself, is Stephen saying to them. He revealed himself to our father Abraham. You remember when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and he said to Abraham, you know the part of the story where he said, depart, Abraham, and go from your country and your relatives and come into the land that I will show you. It was the promised land he was speaking of. It was their land. And this movement of Abraham into this land was the beginning of their identity, the identity of those in the council who were looking now at Stephen. It was the beginning of their very existence as a people. And it all began, says Stephen, when the God of all glory appeared. Because that's what he does. The God of all glory appeared. And then from Abraham, Stephen spoke to these guys, the story that they knew had to maybe be wondering, why is he telling us this story? We know this story because he spoke from Abraham. He went then to Isaac and Jacob and Joseph from verses 8 to 19. And then beginning in verse 20, all the way to verse 44, he begins to speak to them of Moses, that they're accusing him of blaspheming, which makes it interesting that the first thing Stephen says about Moses is in verse 20 when he describes Moses. Look at it on the screen. And Moses was lovely in the sight of God, a man of power, Stephen says in both word and And indeed, verse 22, whom God sent, you guys, God sent Moses to be both ruler and deliverer, performing wonders and signs among the people. And he did that in the land of Egypt, as you know, and the Red Sea, as you know, and then in the wilderness, as you know, for 40 years. This is the Moses, says, verse 37, received the living oracles. They weren't just written words. He received their living oracles and passed them on to you. And the living oracles are the law. That Stephen is being accused of blaspheming. And Stephen is saying here what Moses gave us, Moses, who is lovely in the sight of the Lord, was not just a written word. He gave us the living oracles. Doesn't sound like he's against. To me, anyway, the law. Or Moses. And then he speaks of Joshua, does Stephen, in verse 45. And then he speaks to them of David, who they know him too, in verse 46. And then he speaks of Solomon in this as well. And he's saying all of these things as his defense. Because he's fighting for his life. As you begin to hear the story, as you get into the story, as I got down into the story, and it began to unfold. And as you get into the way Stephen actually tells the story, you begin to get this feeling that he's not just fighting for his life here. He's fighting for theirs in ways they do not know. Because the real story that Stephen is telling here is he's telling them this story that they know so well and venerates so much these stories of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Joseph, and Moses, and David, and Solomon, actually has a sub-story. Because there's another story going on in the story. Because at one level, all we ever do is celebrate Abraham. And that is what you're supposed to do. When you think of Abraham, you celebrate Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, and Joshua too. And what we celebrate is this. that they're our fathers, and we're their children, and aren't we blessed? Yes. So don't you dare say anything, you know, bad about Abraham, Isaac, but there's another part of the story. At another level of the story, there's another story, and it's also a part of the story that they knew quite well. Actually, they did, but they didn't like to talk about this part of the story because this part of the story is about how over and over and over again in their history with God, the story within the story was this, and the pattern was always the same, starting with this. God would, in fact, send a prophet, provide for his people a patriarch, like in Abraham, to whom the God of glory appeared, or provide for his people a deliverer like Moses, a redeemer of sorts who was sent by God to rule and redeem, to call them out and up and into a good and spacious land. And every time we think of that, we celebrate Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, too, because they're our fathers and we're their children and aren't we blessed? But here's the other part of the story. Stephen is telling and spinning. Here's the pattern that's always the same because when God would send a prophet or the patriarch or the deliverer, our fathers, says Stephen, over and over again would reject the prophet that right now we celebrate. They didn't all celebrate. Our fathers would reject the prophet, would not recognize the prophet as a prophet. Sometimes they would kill the prophet. Indeed, in verse 52, Stephen in his word to them telling the story that they're so familiar with and love to celebrate Stephen says in verse 52 indeed when I talk about our fathers killing the prophets the fact is this which one of the prophets did our fathers not persecute and kill but he started all this talk did Stephen in verse 9 so come back I'm moving you around here in the story when he kind of sneaks this thing in, that it was the patriarchs. He says in verse 9, and the patriarchs, if you keep it in context there, the patriarchs were actually the sons of Jacob. Jacob, who was the son of Isaac. Jacob had 12 sons, and they were being called the patriarchs who became jealous of Joseph. Now, I've got to catch up with the story here. The patriarchs, they would all connect with the council because they're Jewish, and they knew the story, and you know the story too, but the sons of Jacob, Joseph was one of the sons of Jacob, and he had these dreams, and he told his brothers, you're going to bow down to me, and they didn't like that, remember that? And they became jealous of Joseph. Stephen's telling them in the council list part of the story, and when they became jealous of Joseph, they sold him into slavery. So they rejected him, tried to kill him, that is Joseph, verse 9, but God was with him. That is, God was with Joseph and rescued him from all his afflictions. You know the story, Potiphar's wife, the prison, everything else, and granted him then favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. So when a famine came to our father's house, our fathers could find no food. And when Jacob heard that the grain was in Egypt, he sent our fathers there, the patriarchs, the other brothers. He sent our fathers there. Isn't it weird? He's telling them the story they know. There's a point to this. He sent our fathers there, the brothers of Joseph. And when they got to Egypt, there they stood before, whoa, hi, Joseph, who they had rejected. He was now their only hope. He was now their savior. He was now their deliverer, redeemer, the one you rejected. And if I'm in a council, I'm thinking, why are you telling me this? I know these stories. Why are you putting them together like this? And then he spoke of Moses. Did Stephen, you know Moses, the man of power, both in word and deed, verse 22, whom God sent to be both ruler and deliverer. fact that we love to celebrate, because Moses is our deliverer and Savior and Redeemer who gave to us a living oracle, which means that he's our father and we're his children and aren't we blessed. But there's another part of the story, says Stephen, another level of the story where there's a different story, because our fathers, says Stephen, in verse 39, In fact, with all this happy talk about Moses, our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him. In fact, they repudiated him. Do you remember this part of this story? And rejected him. And in their hearts, they turned back to Egypt, this place of slavery and death, saying to Aaron, Make for us gods who will go before us. In other words, make for us gods who will do what we want. For this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what even happened to him. And it was at that time that he made a calf and brought the sacrifice to the idol, to this false god, and were rejoicing. They were rejoicing in the work of their hands. Look what we've done. Aren't we something special? Look at me. I can save myself. But God, next verse, turned away and delivered them up. Whoa. As if to say, okay, okay, okay. If that's what you want Then you can have it And get a belly full A lot of times when we think of God's judgment We think of you do something bad I'm going to hit you with a lightning bolt There's a kind of judgment Where God just goes You know I can see you really are going that way And I keep calling you You know if you want to go Then okay go that way It's much like in Romans chapter 1 verse 22 I'm sure Paul had this Old Testament story maybe even in mind when he speaks of people who are professing to be wise, and in their professing to be wise, they've actually become fools. They have no idea how foolish they sound because they've exchanged the glory of God for an image, for something false, some false source of life. Therefore, God, after kind of come back, says, I think that's what you want. God gives them over. Go ahead. Gives them over to the lusts of their heart as if to say, if that's what you want, you can have it. Get a belly full. But even then, what his design is this, when you get a belly full of that slop and get really, really sick, come home. Come home. So he delivered them up, says Stephen, to this counsel of a story they had heard before many times. But here's the part of the story you need to know. God didn't give up. Which brings us to another part of the story, another level of the story where there's another story. And the pattern is always the same. Three themes in this story, three movements. Number one, God sends a prophet or a patriarch or a deliverer of sorts. And the reason he does is to call out a people like he did with Abraham. I am sending you to call out a people to establish a people who will belong to me, says God. I am sending a prophet, a patriarch, a deliverer of sorts to deliver you, to heal you, forgive you, restore, reconcile, and redeem you. Sometimes I will send them to remind you of who you are and whose you are. Sometimes I'll send them to warn you and confront you. but even when I've sent a prophet to confront you, even then it was always to call you back home. It was to woo you and to win you, but over and over again, in one way or another, this is the second part of the story. God would send a prophet, second part of the story, they would reject a prophet. Over and over again, they did it. They didn't recognize the prophet as a prophet. they overlooked them, just like last week. They overlooked the Hellenistic Jews. They can't see this man or woman who actually is speaking the words, the oracles of God, so they sold Joseph into slavery. Slavery. The reason they sold Joseph into slavery is because they couldn't see him as anything but a punk kid. They didn't see the prophets, which means that ultimately, if the prophet doesn't go away they kill the prophet so it leads to the third theme in Stephen's story because after they reject the prophet to patriarch to deliver of sorts God sends another prophet and then they reject him and God sends another prophet and then they reject him and God sends another prophet and over and over and over it goes it began with Abraham to whom the God of glory appeared saying go saying call, saying possess the land and create a nation because you will be a father of nations which means I want you to create some things begin some things, call out some things and then there was Isaac and Jacob and Joseph but our fathers the patriarchs sold Joseph into slavery they rejected him, didn't recognize him, couldn't see him and then there was Moses who you accused me of blaspheming says Stephen but Moses was lovely in the sight of God a man of power and words and deeds but our fathers disowned him verse 35 this man who led them out and we celebrate today Moses with wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and Red Sea and the wilderness because our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him. They repudiated him, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt, because I'd rather be a slave in Egypt than follow him. And then they come to Joshua, and David, or Stephen comes in his talk to Joshua and David and Solomon, who started the whole temple thing, that Stephen, through the council, is saying, you say I am blaspheming, speaking against the temple. So he brings up at the end of this talk, I don't know if it's on screen or not, but he talks about David Solomon, and Joshua, because this whole temple thing started with a tabernacle. In verse 44, a tabernacle which was a dwelling place of God that we enjoyed in the wilderness. And when the time came to go to the promised land, Joseph, it says in verse 44, I believe, brought it, this tabernacle, into the land that God had called them to, and it stayed there. It says in verse 46, until the time of David, who found favor in God's sight. So I'm not speaking against David. Don't get me going on that. And asked God that he might be able to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. And God said, yeah, that'd be good. And when Solomon, who actually built it, built it, in verse 47, the temple was a good thing. It was a God thing. It was a holy thing. But even when it was a good thing, God thing, holy thing, it wasn't everything. It was a limited thing, says Stephen in verse 48. because, said Stephen, to this council about the temple, he's going to get in trouble here. It's good he's quoting scripture because even when the temple was a good and holy thing, the truth is this, the most high God, the God of glory, does not dwell in houses made with human hands. And then he quotes the prophet Isaiah, who to the council he would be able to say, who we quote all the time because Isaiah made that abundantly clear when Isaiah, in Isaiah 666, one said this, and Stephen is now speaking as if he were, it's in the first person, as if he were God, that God says this, heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool of my feet, so what kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord. This is the Old Testament. Or what place is there that you could build for my repose? What kind of, you know, man cave are you going to get for me, for me to get some rest? Because heaven is my throne, so you think it's the temple? Really? Says God. So there's Stephen, Speaking against, it sounds like the holy place, but he's quoting Isaiah, and what Isaiah says is not making the temple a bad thing, but it is a limited thing. It's a confining thing. It's not big enough for the God we know and serve because the Most High God does not dwell, is not limited to houses or temples made with human hands, and that's what he's saying to this council. But here's the deal, you missed that too, says Stephen, Because in Stephen's day, the temple system, as he's standing before this council, the temple system, like most every religious system, even today, has become so corrupt, had become so corrupt, the temple did with money changers and political maneuvering, that it actually had become the least likely place on the planet to actually have an encounter with a living God. And then Stephen goes for the jugular. And I thought this was supposed to be his defense. It sounds like he's on the, I don't know, attack. When he says in verse 51, look at it on the screen. I'm talking about you, you men of who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ear, stiff-necked, hard-heart, Not hearing, indeed, in ways you don't even know. He says in verse 31, you're always resisting. You don't have any idea how much you are resisting the God you say you serve. Whoa. I mean, I just think about how we do that. Anyway, get back to Stephen. Indeed, you're doing just what your fathers did. He says, your fathers who, when God would send a prophet or a patriarch or a deliverer, a redeemer of sorts. They would reject him, not recognize him, sometimes even kill them. So God, here's the story. You know the story. In his desperate attempt to woo and to call and to create and proclaim and reclaim and to redeem, restore, deliver, forgive, make, no God in his deep desire to do that would send another prophet and you would reject him and God would send another one and you reject him and God would send another and another and another until one day he sent his son, this Jesus, you know, the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with signs and wonders. Acts 2.22, he was greater than Moses. And I love Moses, says Stephen, but just like your fathers, you missed him too. You didn't recognize him. You didn't see him. You looked over him. You never loved him. You never desired to follow him, to serve or obey him. Indeed, you killed him. And when they heard that, verse 54, they gave him a hug. They were cut to the quick. I think it's the fourth time we've heard that. the book of Acts in response to a sermon. First time Peter was preaching, they were cut to the quick and said, what should we do? Peter said, repent. 3,000 were saved in one day. This time they were cut to the quick. Different response. They began gnashing their teeth at him because they hated him. But Stephen, being full of the Spirit, it says in verse 55, gazed intently into heaven and was able to see, was able to see, hold the story together. I think he was able to see what Abraham saw and Moses too and the prophets, the patriarchs, the deliverers too because he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God and so it is, he says in verse 56, and this is my paraphrase of verse 56, I've got some really good news for you, and this good news is for you, counsel. Right here, you want to kill me. I've got good news for you, because I see the heavens. What does the text say? And they are what? Open. They're open, which is really good news, because what it means, among other things, is this, that it's not too late even for you. Because God is doing it again. And by the way, God is doing it again, I think, in real time. I think this is dawning on Stephen as it's happening to him. It's happening again. God's doing it again, having sent over and over and over again the prophets and patriarchs, deliverers and redeemers, starting with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, to he finally sent his son Jesus. but you missed him, didn't recognize him, didn't see him, looked over him. You never loved him. You never desired to follow him, serve, or obey him. So God sent me. Stephen, he sent me. Who am I? He sent me. And he sent me to tell you, counsel, what all the prophets, patriarchs, deliverers, and redeemers have been trying to tell you in one way or another since the beginning, and it's this. They've been trying to tell you that the heavens are open. Indeed, I see, says Stephen, what I know you can't see right now because I see the heavens opened up and they're opened for you even now after all of this. They're still open because God is still wooing and still calling and still creating and recreating and reclaiming and restoring and redeeming and forgiving and desiring to reconcile all things to himself. So can you see it? Do you believe it? That the heavens are open? And they're open for you. Forget about the council. They're open for you because it's never too late. But then in verse 57 through verse 59, the council just continues the pattern. And it's always the same because they end up doing what their fathers did. They reject the prophet. This time the prophet is Stephen. They don't recognize him as a prophet. He's an idiot. They didn't see the prophet, so they kill the prophet. We'll deal with this next week. delivering him or driving him out of the city. They stone him. Interesting in this whole thing when Stephen's declaring the heavens are open and there's hope. There's a guy named Saul who's watching this, gives hearty approval to Stephen's death. He becomes Paul one day. The heavens are open even for you, Paul, and I know you hate me. Oh, my God. And that is Stephen's story. Let me close with a question. What's yours? What's your story? Where are you in this story? All week long, I found myself drawn to verse 51, and it might be a verse you want to stay away from me. I'm feeling warmth in verse 51, but as I sat in it, I became aware that far more than I'm able to see and maybe admit I am, and quite frankly, I think we are, In ways we don't know any more than the council knew.
