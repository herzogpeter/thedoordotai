Today, in what last week I referred to as a waiting room, I want to talk about what we've been singing about, what in that song we just prayed, and that song was just that, a prayer. I want to talk about our breathing, spiritual breathing, and its connection to the Holy Spirit and power, which is kind of in the bigger arena, what we've been talking about these weeks, and what, in one respect, we're waiting for. I'd like to pray as we move into this. My prayer, Father, is what we just sang. Breathe on us your breath. Breathe on this word your breath. Lord, this is the third service for me. In my body, I feel out of breath. Give me your breath. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. You know, when it comes to physical breathing, most of us do it without thinking. Not always, though. Sometimes we need to learn to breathe. Because sometimes we forget to breathe. What? What do you mean? When do you forget to breathe? Who forgets to breathe? A few years ago, I was joining a health club, a club that I've been a member of for several years now, which is why I look so very healthy. You know, when I first joined it, though, they give you this orientation, and a trainer was showing me how to use the weight machines in particular and how to use them correctly. And several times as I did these reps, this trainer said something to me that under other circumstances, I would have found kind of offensive. Like, what do you mean? I don't know how to do that. He kept saying, breathe. You keep forgetting to breathe. And he wanted me to breathe when I pushed up and breathe in whatever. And I kept holding my breath like that. And he would say, and it happened at every station. Every station I went in, he had to remind me, breathe. You keep forgetting to breathe, which reminds me of a joke. Isn't that good? Anyway, it's a potentially offensive joke, particularly if you're a woman whose hair is a certain color. There's a groan, you know, then that's not going to stop me. It's terribly unfair. It's generally not true. I just need to tell you that some of the brightest women I know are blonde, including my wife. she's a brilliant woman but it's funny nonetheless so here we go there's this guy there's this guy walking on the beach so a guy walks into a bar no not that one there's a guy i'm i'm losing it i did better in the other services he's walking on the beach with his girlfriend this girl whose hair is a certain color and she's listening to a tape these headphones constantly, will not take them off. This is very frustrating to her boyfriend, because like most guys, what he really craves, what he really cares about and desires is to have a long and meaningful conversation. It's what he really wants. Please take them off. After several unsuccessful attempts to get her to remove the headphones, he finally grabs them off her head and throws them as far as he can down the beach. A couple minutes later, she keels over and dies. That's the joke. Now, that's not the end of the joke. After the paramedics come to take her body away, he walks over to the walkman. He's feeling all sad. He realizes the tape is still playing. He puts the headphones on, and this is what he hears. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. You know, I started something with this thing last night, this morning. Did somebody boo? Brenda, I walk in, Brenda, in the prayer time before we started praying, is telling blonde jokes. She's as blonde as they come anyway, so I don't feel as bad now. This breathing thing actually is a little more serious. You just need to learn how to breathe. I recall vividly when my wife had our four children, was pregnant with our four children. They were not all at once. They were kind of separated. but in those days we went to birthing classes and I know they're different now but the the thing that they used in those days was this thing called Lamaze classes and we would go and we'd see first of all these films I don't know why they show them because it just scared all the women to death women having babies but what they did was they taught us this method of breathing us they taught her this method of breathing I was the coach and unbelievably helpful was I telling her to breathe Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out. They called them cleansing breaths. When I shared this analogy of needing to learn how to breathe, and she did. It was like a foreign thing for her to breathe this way. When I shared this analogy with the message team, it was noted that maybe this waiting room we're in as a church is, in fact, a birthing room. And maybe we would do well to kind of see it that way, that maybe in ways that we can sense but can't completely see that even as a church we're pregnant with something these days. And if that's true, then this word about learning how to breathe and maybe learning how to breathe a different way is very important for us to deal with. See, the fact is that most of the time we don't think much about our breathing or what it does, but it is generally true that what's inside of you and me would kill you and me if it were allowed to stay because you and I produce some pretty toxic stuff. So there's this real important thing that all of us do. Most of the time without thinking at all, we breathe out the toxic stuff that would kill us if it stayed. We breathe in the stuff that gives us life, and we do it all day long. Most of the time without thinking. We even do it when we sleep. Breathe in, breathe out. All of which raises a question, I think a pretty important question. What on earth does any of this breathing stuff have to do with the Holy Spirit and power? Well, the connection to power is this, that in biblical language, both in the Hebrew and the Greek, most particularly in the Old Testament, the same word is used for spirit as is used for breath. The Hebrew word is ruach. So whenever it says the Spirit of the Lord, and that's a very common phrase in the Old Testament, the Spirit of the Lord came upon, the Spirit of the Lord did this. It is the breath of the Lord, the breath of God, the ruach of God. In Genesis 2, verse 7, the writer describes the very first time that a human being breathed this way. The Lord God formed man in his own image. From the dust of the ground he formed him, and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. The imagery there, the symbolism of that event is very significant and needs to be noticed. For God could just as easily in creation have snapped his fingers and brought us to life like a hypnotist knocking us or bringing us out of our stupor. He could have spoken a word. He could have barked a command. Instead, he did this mouth-to-mouth thing. Why? Here's why. because God's desire was to do more than fill the human body with oxygen. The text does not say that man became animated tissue, like a dog or a cat or a bird. It says that man became a living soul. Men and women became living souls, became spiritual beings with spiritual, eternal capacities for life. So it is that when men and women were made alive, they were made alive by and they were filled with the breath of God, the life, the vitality, the ruach of God. One writer put it this way. When the Old Testament refers to the spirit of the Lord, life is intended. That's what the image is that you need to get because vitality and aliveness is the essence of the spirit. 104 29, speaking of all living things, says this, when you take away their breath, they die and return to dust. But when you send your spirit, when you send the ruach of God, the breath of God, they come again to life and renew the face of the earth. And that's exactly what was being prophesied or pictured in the Ezekiel passage that Matt read in the middle of worship. It's the same in the New Testament. Romans 8, verse 2, the Holy Spirit is called the spirit of life. 1 Corinthians, the spirit gives life. It's even crept into our language unawares. When we see an animal, a magnificent animal, like a horse, for instance, with a fierce sense of life, we say of that animal, that thing is spirited. It's high-spirited, full of energy and power. In fact, you better be careful around this thing. It's so full of life, it's actually a little dangerous. people are like that spirited people children in particular are like that full of wide-eyed energy and enthusiasm they are full of life, they are full of breath my kids are older I have occasion from time to time to be around little ones, I really do love it Sid Haynes who's on staff here at Open Door a few weeks ago had to stop by my house on the way home from work to drop some things off that I had left there She had her two little kids with her, about this big. They came in my door, and they took a tour. They didn't stop moving the whole time they were in my house. They were over there. They were under, under. They kept talking, asking questions, making comments. They were full of life. They were full of breath. So when they left, I was out of breath. And I just remembered why God, you know, gives people children when they still have, you know, youth and breath. and while sometimes in human beings because of sin this hunger for life gets disordered because we pursue this life in ways and in places that are foolish and twisted and empty and hurtful make no mistake the aliveness itself even your desire for for life and breath is a work of and a gift from the Holy Spirit of God. Indeed, wherever the Spirit of God is present and active, there will be a deep, energetic, mysterious, even kind of dangerous sense of life. Sometimes we talk about churches that are alive. I hope that by that you mean more than a slick program, snappy music, and a pastor who tells good jokes. In fact, sometimes when we have no spirit life, we try to manufacture this kind of false life, even in the church, with this slick thing that doesn't have any life, the breath. But where the spirit is, wherever the spirit is, if it's active in your marriage, if it's active in your life, there will be life. Life will come. There will be life. That is why Romans 8, 2 calls the Holy Spirit the Spirit of life. It's also why in John 7, 38, Jesus says, Whoever puts confidence in me for life, quits looking other places for life and puts confidence in me for life, out of him, out of her, will flow streams of living water. And by this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Out of them will flow streams of living water. I've heard that verse all my life. It struck me odd this time. Living water. I get the picture real clear that when water comes to places that are dry and dead like a desert, life springs, life comes. But this water itself, which is the Spirit, is life. It's living water. The point is this. The Spirit is just teeming with life. Bottom line. That from the beginning, we human beings were created by our creator, God, to live a wonderful kind of life, to live a life that is continually, a continual, interactive, intimate relationship with God, initiated by the very breath of God. And for a while, that is exactly what happened. As Adam and Eve walked with God in the cool of the day, And in the fellowship and the interactive relationship they had with God in the garden, they didn't hardly think about it. I mean, it was just as natural as breathing. But then sin came. And we forgot how to breathe. And with sin came death, spiritual death. And we've been gasping for air ever since. what was once so totally natural is now labored and foreign marked by starts and stops and gasping for air we need coaches who like the guy who was talking to me on the exercise machine had to say breathe you forgot to breathe we need prophets we need pastors we need friends who say breathe you forgot. For some, this lack of breathing, this struggle with breathing spiritually in the life of God is marked by death. But the good news is this, that the breath of God is still available, not just for creating, but for recreating. And that was the image that Matt was portraying when he read that passage in Ezekiel during the worship time. Because the Holy Spirit of God just never gave up, for continually throughout history, God has been looking for people who might just be receptive to, maybe even desperate for, the breath of God, which brings me to something I think is very important to talk about while we're in the waiting room as it relates to the power and activity of the Holy Spirit, which is kind of, again, what we're waiting for. Here's what I want to kind of give you here by way of teaching. I want you to kind of get this perspective in your mind that the power and activity of the Holy Spirit did not just begin at Pentecost in Acts chapter 2. The reason I'm kind of giving that to you is that I think some of us have that impression. You might not be conscious of it, but I've kind of had that impression. If I was ever interested in doing a study on the Holy Spirit, its power and activity, where would you begin? Where would I I'd go to Acts chapter 2. In fact, that is where I went first. I want to broaden your perspective a little bit. For the fact is this, that all through history, long before Acts 2, all through the Old Testament, the Spirit of God, the Rock Yahweh, the breath of God was exceedingly active and very apparent. Indeed, if there is a difference, and there is a difference, between the working of the Holy Spirit from the Old Testament to the New, It is not so much in kind of activity that God did. In other words, it's not so much like in the New Testament, the Holy Spirit of God began to act differently than he did in the Old Testament. He did it. You will see the same manifestations of power in the New Testament as in the Old, the Old as in the New. The difference is more in what I would call scope. Let me explain it this way. In the Old Testament, the Spirit of the Lord, the breath of God, would often come upon a particular individual, often a key individual, and breathe life into them, empowering them to accomplish tasks beyond their normal capacity to perform, enhancing things like their insights, enhancing their wisdom, their strength, and their courage, so that they could become popular. That's not why he enhanced their power. He enhanced their power, their insights, wisdom, strength, and courage, so that they could perform great works to serve the redemptive purposes of God in the world. but in the Old Testament these empowerments were limited as I said a moment ago to certain individuals these things weren't kind of just available to the community of faith key people had them in unusual kinds of measures the first person that comes to my mind as an example of this and I'm sure it's because we've spent so much time in Exodus and now these days in Joshua is Moses I think if you think at all about Moses and the role he played among the people of God, one of the first things that comes out at you and me is that he was really different than everybody else. He had a different relationship with God than other normal people had. The Bible even says that God spoke with Moses, Moses spoke with God face to face. Not everybody did that. Moses moved with incredible gifting, supernatural empowerment that were not available to normal people. Now, his faithfulness as a leader provided for the people some wonderful things, but it also created in the people some things that eventually they needed to get over if they were going to enter into the fullness of what God had for them in the promised land. For it created in the people a kind of dependence on God. That's a good thing. Their dependence on God, however, came through Moses. Do you understand that? in fact if they were going to hear from God they didn't even expect to hear from God from God they began to expect to hear from God through Moses in fact the only way they could hear from God was through Moses in fact the only one they could hear from was Moses and anybody ever if anybody else tried to speak if Aaron came yeah yeah blah blah blah blah blah when's Moses going to get here. Moses was kind of the man. In fact, if a period of time went where they weren't hearing from God, they would blame Moses. What's the matter with you? Which had a wonderful effect on Moses. In fact, if you want to hear the effect of Moses, read Numbers 11 where he's with God one day and he says, God, if you're making me responsible to feed all these people all by myself. And if I have found favor in your side, if I've been faithful to you and you really do love me, then kill me now. Here's the deal. They had, the Old Testament people, the people under the Moses model of ministry, if you will, had a pillar of fire. And that was wonderful. And it kind of gave them a general direction. But I think you're getting the picture here. Moses was kind of the man. Now, what I want you, I'm going to come back to that in a minute. I just want to kind of seal this off for you for your thinking that is an old testament model for ministry it's an old testament model for ministry that many evangelical churches still hold where there's the man and and and the ministers who went to seminary and they do the ministry and that's why we pay them so just know it's an old testament and any level at which we're functioning that way it's an old testament model for ministry so i'm just leaving that now and i'm going to go on give you some more examples of the Holy Spirit at work in the Old Testament. Very exciting, I think. Very expansive, actually. See, I expected my understanding of the Spirit to expand in Acts chapter 2. Your understanding of the Spirit and how He functions will expand if you understand the Old Testament. Example number one, David. On the occasion of his death, 2 Samuel 23 verse 2 says this, that the breath of God was upon David, putting His Word, God's Word, upon his tongue. I want you think about this, that what a guy of David's stature in the community of faith says when he dies might be an important thing. To say the wrong thing when you die is not something you can take back, come back and apologize for later. To say the wrong thing on an occasion like this could devastate the community of faith for years to come. David has the possibility at the moment of his death to speak to his people life or death. He has the possibility to speak to them blessing or cursing. Facing death, he could easily be filled with anxiety. You know, you'd give him that, wouldn't you? He could easily be filled with fear, disappointment, or even bitterness, or he could be filled with life, even at his death. So when he was about to die, David took a deep breath. And he breathed out all of the fear that most all of us would have at a time of our death. He breathed out his anxiety. He breathed out his disappointment. And he breathed in the life of God. And he breathed in his hope in God. And with that breath came wisdom and guidance. So when he died, he said just the right thing. And he spoke words of life. And you can read them in 2 Samuel 23. Today, we would call that ability to breathe in the life of God and breathe out and then speak something that is absolutely right. We would call that an anointing. Sometimes our impression of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament and New Testament is that in the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit came and went. Remember that? And in the New Testament, the Holy Spirit is in you and he never leaves. Well, that is true. That is true. The Holy Spirit in the New Testament, that was something post Acts 2, Pentecost. the Holy Spirit comes in and remains. He is in you. But I want you to expand your thinking on this thing of anointing. The Spirit of God comes upon people still, just the way He did then. Some of you have experienced that. I would guess at one time or another, you've experienced, all of you have experienced that. Maybe you haven't identified that. Let me give you another example of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament, King Saul. King Saul was the predecessor of David. When he first came to power as a very young boy, young man, he struggled tremendously with a sense of inferiority, much like Moses. Remember when God said, Moses, I want to use you, and he said, who am I? And God had to kind of wrestle with him to even get him to accept the responsibility. In 1 Samuel chapter 10, Saul says this, you don't understand, you want to make me king, I am from the least significant family, and the least significant tribe of Israel. When it came to anoint him as king, they began to look for him, and Samuel needed to get a vision from God to figure out that this goofy kid was hiding in the baggage. Go get him, he's in the baggage. They brought Saul to Samuel. Samuel was a pretty scary looking guy. Samuel looks at this young man, prays over him for anointing, and this is what he said. Young man, you need to know something. You need to breathe something in. You need to believe this, and if you don't, we can't go further. But here's the word of the Lord. The breath of God is coming upon you mightily so that you will hear from God and you will speak for God. Indeed, you will become a different kind of person than you are right now. 1 Samuel 10, 6. And that scared little kid took a deep breath. And he breathed in the promise of God. And he breathed in the energy of God and the confidence in God. And he breathed out his fear, his anxiety, and his inferiority. and he did it that one time, and he never had to do it again. No, that's not how it works, is it? It was an amazing event when Samuel anointed him, and he took a deep breath, and all of his fear in that moment left, and then 20 minutes later, what happens to you? What happens to you? The fear comes back, and the inferiority comes. And you know what Saul had to do in order to be king? He had to learn how to what? Breathe. Breathe in the promise of God. Breathe in the grace of God and the amazing love of God and confidence in God and breathe out his fear that visited him every day. The toxic stuff that's inside of you and me, he had to learn to breathe. And he did learn to breathe and he became, at least for a while, an extraordinary leader for the people of God. But you note that I said at least for a little while. See, he was an extraordinary leader for the people of God till he forgot how to breathe. And this man with incredible potential who was used by God in amazing ways for a while became full of himself and full of pride. And he began to believe, you see, that it was his kingdom and his power and his glory. Remember when the disciples came to Jesus and they said, Jesus, teach us how to pray. And they taught him to pray the Lord's Prayer. And among the things they were taught to pray was this, thy kingdom come. At the end of that prayer, For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. And we almost always hear that, at least I do. It's kind of a doxology of praise. And we hear a song, thine is the kingdom and the power. What that also is, just hear that. That is a declaration of submission as well. When I pray every day, it's part of learning how to breathe. When I pray every day, God, just help me remember. And I do declare again to you, this is your kingdom. And every day, every moment I forget that, I'm going to be doomed. It's your kingdom. It's your power and it's your glory, not my glory, not my power, not my kingdom. And I got to remember that every day. In fact, in 1 Samuel 15, that same prophet who looked at that young boy and saw the spirit come on him and says, you just got to let this, you got to breathe in the breath of God on you right now, and was trying to encourage him and saw him rise. In 1 Samuel 15 says to the same guy, you know something, Saul, when you were little in your own eyes, when I saw you with your knees shaking and you were scared to death to take on this mantle, but you were dependent on God, when you were little in your own eyes, God was mighty upon you, but now you're full of yourself and the anointing is gone. So when a scrawny little shepherd boy named David came along with an anointing of his own, Saul wasn't able to bless him. Wouldn't that have been a cool thing? Can you just picture kind of the older person who's been walking in the fullness of their ministry and their life in Christ, and then they see this young man or this young woman come up, and they got an anointing too, and maybe it's even greater than theirs. Saul couldn't bless that. He couldn't enjoy it. He couldn't encourage it. Instead, he was threatened by it. He tried to snuff it. He was full of jealousy and fear that if this David guy rose to prominence, if this little shepherd kid rose to prominence, he would lose his kingdom, his power, his glory. Guess what? He did. The tragedy is this. Saul didn't have to lose his place. He didn't have to lose his anointing. Look at it this way. Saul had an anointing, and with it, he killed his thousands. Now, that's kind of a weird analogy. I'm taking something out of what people said about David and Saul when they were doing their thing. Saul has killed his thousands. David has killed his ten thousands. But just let it speak in a metaphor for an effect. He had an incredible effect. David had an anointing too. And with it, he killed his ten thousands. It was a greater anointing. Picture how incredible it would have been for the people of God to watch. Picture how incredible it would have been for Saul and David, even in their relationship. And what could have gotten burst out of this to see and hear Saul, the old guy, speak to David, the young guy, and David has the greater anointing. Things like this. David, you know, do you hear what people say in the market? I do. I'm sure you do. They're kind of pitting us even against each other that I've, you know, done this and you've done this bigger thing. Can I just tell you something, David? I am so proud of you I am so delighted in you and I bless you he couldn't do that you know why? he forgot how to breathe by the way this is more for me than just a little cool story in the text this is a big part of our vision beloved in this waiting room period of time as we anticipate what God is going to do among us it's a part of the vision we've articulated a lot behind the scenes, some from the pulpit. A few weeks ago, Keith, with no small amount of passion, spoke of the necessity we have to call out the next generation and pass the ministry of the kingdom of God onto them. And as we do that and truly do that, what's going to become apparent is there are going to be young men and women who have a greater anointing than we do, who will have a greater effect than we do. And you know how you avoid this Saul problem? Just keep praying this. It's your kingdom. It's your power. It's your glory. Because as soon as it becomes mine or as soon as it becomes yours, anybody with a greater anointing is going to be a threat and the work of God is over. See, the funny thing about these skinny-armed sheepers, the skinny-armed sheep, this little skinny-scrawny David guy who's got the greater anointing, In a metaphor, to me, it's like someone you don't expect is going to move in a power that's greater than yours. And you just go, what the hell? Who do you think you are? I think you are an anointed one. Another example. Exodus 31. I love this one. This is another example of the working of the Spirit. It tells the story of a guy named Bezalel who was in charge of the building of the temple. What that means is he's a construction guy. He had calluses on his hands and cement he couldn't get out of his jeans. He was doing work, and this is the key, that we don't often associate with needing and anointing. A lot of us, wrongly, and we need to bust this down, wrongly kind of separate in our minds that which is secular and that which is sacred. And I think all of you kind of would understand, and we do need to do this, that before the services, we have people coming around our worship team and we pray what on them? Anointing. Breathe on them breath of God. And we have people come around me or whoever else is speaking that day. Breathe on them breath of God. And there's a need for an anointing. And everybody here would go, that's good, that's really important. You really got to have that. And boy, that one was anointed or that one wasn't better, whatever. Do you realize that there isn't anything we do that doesn't require an anointing? I want you to read this with me. Exodus 31 verse 2. See, I have called by name, this is God speaking, Bezalel, the son of Uriah, the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah. And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God, the breath of God, the ruach of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship. I have anointed him by my Spirit, by my very breath, to make artistic designs for work in gold and in silver and in bronze, and the cutting of stones for settings, and in the carving of wood that he may work in all kinds of craftsmanship. Take that text, think about it. Now let me ask you a question, what do you do? What do you do that you don't, in fact, you don't put at all in the category of something that might be affected by the breath of God? What do you do? You carpenter, housewife, truck driver, business owner, administrator, your teacher, real estate agent, garbage collector, your coach, artist, musician, have you ever considered that there's an anointing for every single one of those things, just like there is for this thing that I'm doing? The kind of anointing that would cause you to wake up every morning and say something like this, God, be in my hammer and in my nailing. It's hard for me, Father, to sometimes see what this does, where this goes. I don't know, but this is what I do. So let me do this in a way that somehow glorifies you. And I'm going to invite you into what looks to me mundane. Experiment. Be in my hands and in my making. Dear Jesus, be in my senses, Spirit of God. Be in my senses and in my creating. Be at my desk and in my writing and my working. Be in my plans and in my deciding. Be in my mind and in my thinking. Be in my heart and in my loving, breathe on me, breath of God. In things I think don't need the breath of God. Invite him into that. It's called breathing. One more example, again involving Moses. Numbers 11. A kind of revival was going on in Numbers 11. The breath of God had fallen on some people beyond Moses. It wasn't just Moses anymore. And they began to hear from God, and they began to speak for God, and the people started listening. Oh, no, it's not just Moses. It didn't last very long, except for two guys continued to hear from God and speak for God prophetically, named Eldad and Medad. Well, Joshua, the number two guy with Moses, at least now got a little threatened by this, loyal to and protective of Moses' status as the man. We've got to make sure he's still the man because even though he gets tired and wants to die sometimes, it still kind of feels good to be the man. And he comes to Moses and he says, Restrain them. Do you know what's going on? People are listening to other people just than you. So shut them up. And Moses' response is wonderful. Hear it as being in stark contrast to King Saul's when the skinny-armed sheepherders started coming with his anointing. For Moses says this in Numbers 11, 29. Joshua, are you jealous for my sake? I would that all God's people were prophets and that he would pour out his Spirit on all flesh. Well, Moses had no way of knowing that this was not only his dream, this was God's dream. Later, the prophet Joel would get a little more revelation than Moses ever got on this and able to articulate it with these words. People of God, get your hopes up. Because a day is coming, says the Lord, out, hello, are we there? I will pour out my, you still heard me, I would have just had to yell at her. I will pour out my spirit on all flesh, not just on people like Moses, David, and Bezalel, a select few. For your sons and your daughters will prophesy, old men will dream dreams, young men will see visions, even on male and female servants, on women and children and teachers, housewives, coaches, carpenters, businessmen, bricklayers, facility managers, business administrators, garbage collectors, accountants, real estate agents, computer geeks, soundboard technicians, car salesmen, artists, musicians, athletes, even a few pastors here and there. And I will pour forth my spirit on them and I will teach them how to breathe in the life of God and breathe out the stuff that kills. In Acts chapter 2, it happened. The wind of God blew. What was that wind? Take a wild guess. It was his what? Breath. and the fire of God fell appearing as cloves of fire according to Acts 2 verse 3 and here's the key on who? Moses the pastor, no no Paul, Peter, no the cloves of fire fell on each one of them connect the dots in the Old Testament when Moses was the man the people were led by a pillar of fire one pillar in Acts chapter 2 that fire separates and lands on everyone why? because to do the work of the kingdom of God that God had called his people to do what he's saying in this fire landing on everyone among other things is this I need just everybody and the word of the Lord to open door in this waiting room is exactly that word see the Moses model for ministry is just not going to bring us where we're going over the years I've had people say things to me and often it's a complimentary thing and it's just kind of even reflecting on our journey it's just reflecting on our journey Dave you're kind of like our Moses when we went through Exodus I found myself identifying in some ways in ways that I didn't always like with the Moses kind of thing. And am I willing to wear certain kinds of mantles? And those are personal struggles for me. But if you've been around along and you know kind of our language and where we think we are right now, one of the analogies that bother me about that whole thing is Moses didn't go to, did you know Moses didn't cross the Jordan? Moses didn't go into the promised land. And you're all laughing and I'm glad, it's fine. But I have, I don't take things. I wonder about things like that. And I've even never been in there. This is a huge time of transition for our church. What's going on? Hello, hello. Am I back? I'm going in and out. Oh, I'm fine. Breathe. Yeah, it's good. I wish this would breathe. We'll just do this. Okay. the point is this that the Moses model doesn't cross the Jordan I'm coming with you but the Moses model is not going there was a different kind of leadership and I need to be a different kind of leader and we need to be a different kind of people. In the promised land, Joshua was a leader. They still needed a leadership. They still needed anointed leadership. But guess who took the land? Joshua? The people. The people took the land. Wrap it up. In John chapter 20, Jesus said to his friends in the upper room, As the Father has sent me, now I send you the same way. But before you go, I want you to work on your breathing. so he breathed on them and said receive ye the holy spirit and all of those guys little scared disciples took a deep breath think about it this way carbon dioxide is not the only toxic substance you and i produce for inside you and me is anger and pride bitterness and anxiety lust and fear and if we do not learn how to breathe that toxic stuff out and breathe in the life of God every day, all day, not just at revival services. You know, revival services are great, but what they do is revive. I mean, and every once in a while, if you've quit breathing, you need a revival. And not just on Sunday, church. I mean, I would hope that sometimes when you come to church, you get revived. It's like, but it's like, see, do you understand a revival service is like CPR? It's like, It's like, clear, it's like that. You know what? You can't live on that. That's not how you're supposed to live. We need to be a people who learn to live, who learn to breathe it in and breathe it out all the time. Do you know I'm talking about prayer, by the way? Do you know that this is prayer? Yeah, you do, don't you? It's not titled, The Sermon on Prayer. This is a sermon on prayer. Practicing the presence of God every single moment. Let me close in a practical way by giving you some breathing exercises. You might feel a little contrived. Matt, I want you to come up. Get ready. Matt, where is he? There he is. It's a wig he's got on. Just want you to know that. I decided it was pick on the skinny-armed sheep herder day. Here's the breathing exercises. Just real simple. In fact, it may be important that you start simple. Tomorrow morning when you wake up and you become conscious that God has given you another day to breathe, before you get out of bed and your feet touch the floor, breathe in the love of God for you. Bring yourself conscious to the life of God in you. If you get up early in the morning, I do that. Try sometimes sitting in a seat with the lights off all by yourself, not a sound, and just be quiet with God. as Dallas Willard says it might not feel normal to you for a while you'll have to do this long enough to stop twitching but in the quiet place breathe in the life of God and breathe out the anxiety of your day I think music helps me the song that Matt's about to sing that he sang at the offertory is a perfect breathe on me breath of God that's a prayer can you see yourself just beginning your day with something like that. Maybe some of you don't get up early. I really am an early morning person. There's two kinds of people in the world, people who love to get up early and people who hate people who love to get up early in the morning. So don't get up early. You know, some of you don't have time. You don't. You have little kids. You don't have a... You don't take a quiet moment. What is that? You take a shower. Do it there. You don't take a shower? I'm out of suggestions here. Do you drive to work? Turn off the radio. Turn off the radio. And breathe in the life of God. And breathe out the toxic stuff so that maybe later in the day, as you continue to breathe and you begin to be anxious about a meeting, you can take a deep breath. You get confused about a decision or cut off in traffic or stuck in the grocery line at the store that I talked about last week with a cashier who has ruthlessly eliminated hurry from their life. Take a deep breath. And when you run into that difficult person, breathe on them. They're much more responsive than the other services. I'm serious about that. Breathe out. Breathe out the instinct that we all have to avoid them and fear them and demean them or even try to hurt them. And breathe in the love of God for frail, fallen, unlovely people like yourself. Is what I'm telling you feel a little too simple, contrived, artificial? Maybe. Can I tell you the goal of all this? That we get so good at breathing in and breathing out that pretty soon we don't even have to think about it anymore. we don't need the coach saying breathe living in the life of God has just become as natural see as breathing I'm giving you some exercise I want to close by doing one just quick won't take long close your eyes by your head enter into the song make it your prayer Amen.
