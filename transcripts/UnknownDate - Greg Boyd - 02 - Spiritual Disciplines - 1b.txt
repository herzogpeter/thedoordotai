As you have time, just once, for a nice reading, pick up some of these other authors throughout church history, you know, St. Augustine's Confessions, and just read a little bit at a time, you know, just as devotional stuff. Thomas Akempis, his book, The Imitation of Christ. Another good one I didn't put down here is Brother Lawrence, and I don't even know when he lived. But Brother Lawrence, he wrote a book called Practicing the Presence of God, and it's basically about how to worship God doing dishes. Really good stuff. There's a really good tradition there. Yes? Yeah. In fact, we'll be using a little bit of his stuff when we talk about centering prayers because he's really big on that. Are you familiar with his stuff? He held a seminar here in the Twin Cities a couple months ago. what was it okay yeah uh with uh pennington one problem that he's had uh for better for worse is that among evangelicals they're really suspicious of him because he's he's really good friends with the guy who's the head of eck and and and they do a lot of the same things now i don't think that necessarily discredits him you got to take his stuff on its own value. Not everything that goes on in X is bad. They do some stuff about centering that's pretty good. Do you have any other questions or comments? Do you understand what the course is about, what we're going at? What's X? I'm your curious five-year-old. No, no, no, that's great. I don't assume that everyone knows that. What's that stand for? Well, no, no, he's not with Econcar. Est. I meant to say Est. Yeah, they're Est. E-S-T. And they've changed their name now to E-T. Phone home. I don't know what they changed their name. I know a person who's getting involved in it. They made it much more commercialized or whatever. But anyways, it's a technique. It's kind of a new ageist technique to discover your inner potentiality and all this other kind of stuff. Kind of new ageist. Anything associated with New Age, if I'm an evangelical, kind of discredits things. And I think that's a pretty appropriate paranoia. Better to err on the side of paranoia. But if you're rooted, you can kind of then begin to look at what a value is there in these people. Okay, other questions or comments? Oh, really? Brother, son, sister, moon? No, no, that's St. Francis of Assisi. St. Francis of Assisi. He was the guy who, he was the Dr. Doolittle of church history. The legends about him was that he could talk to animals and stuff. St. Francis of Assisi, he didn't write that much on spirituality, but it's good stuff. In fact, a lot of New Agers are using him because he really emphasizes the spirituality of the earth and all this kind of stuff. They didn't get their hands on. But he wrote a famous poem called Brother, Son, Sister, Moon. I think it was called that. At least the line is in it. Who cares? Okay, let's talk about the spiritual disciplines. Yeah, that's great. Can you see these? What I want to do here is provide a foundation for this stuff in 40 minutes. And see where we go. Turn with me if you would. If you have your Bibles, you don't have to. You can just trust me. But turn to 1 Corinthians 9, 24 through 27. I'm going to be reading a couple of texts here. 1 Corinthians 9, 24 through 27. This doesn't come through very clear at all, does it? Will you be in charge of telling me when this is off? Because I don't. I wish it could be a little bigger. then people can't write well well yeah how come it gets dark when I walk away from it oh maybe the darkness is in my eye how come I can't see it when I look away from it I'm on the screen. From my perspective, it gets real bright right here. Okay, 1 Corinthians 9, 24 to 27. Check this out. Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. I intentionally want this to sound discordant to you. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore, I do not run like a man running aimlessly. I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize. Let me bring out a couple of things here. He uses a training analogy. You'll be in charge of Canada, okay? Thank you. I can't think of more than three things at once. He uses a training analogy that our Christian life, our spiritual life, is to be carried out in a way that is analogous to the way people train for races. There's that intentionality we talked about earlier. You have a project. When you're training for a race, you're intentional about it. You say, I want to run this race. I want to win this race, perhaps. And to do that, I've got to do these things to prepare myself for it. I've got to train. so you're very intentional and you're intentional about every day i've got to get up and run five miles today i gotta get up on 15 miles today i gotta do interval training today i can't eat that because i'm in training and i can't do that because i'm in training you're very intentional and your intentionality carries over into every every aspect of your life you're doing that to win a temporal crown well paul says how much more important is it for us who are running a race to win an eternal crown that we become intentional about our lives, that we're in training. Because as a matter of fact, we're in a race, to use an analogy. We're in something that requires a great deal of training. So he says, I don't beat the air. I'm not doing it for no reason. I'm not just doing it to do it. I'm doing it in order to make my body my slave, because when my body's my slave, then I can run the race the way I want to run the race, right? There's an intentionality that covers this whole thing. A lot of times, see, and you don't do well on the race unless you're intentional about the training for it. There's a book that was written some time ago, and I can't remember the author or the title of it, and that's okay because otherwise I'd be slamming the author and the title of the book. But throughout the book, the person asked the question, what would Jesus do in this situation? What would Jesus do in this situation? You're in this crisis, what would Jesus do? And you always want to be asking the question, what would Jesus do in this situation? That's not a bad question to ask. But the problem is that you're sort of isolating what it means to be a Christian. You're isolating your Christianity into your moment-by-moment crucial decisions. The problem with that is that you can only do what Jesus would do if you were living like Jesus lived. That's part of what Willard gets at in his book. A lot of times we want to have the spiritual empowerment that the apostles had and the spiritual empowerment that Jesus Christ had. We want to be anointed and we want to live godly lives and we want to be free from this or this or this. But see, you don't have those benefits until you have the training that goes into it. You don't win the race unless you train for it. And there's things you do that are prerequisites to getting there. That's what Paul's getting at. If you want to be a great ball player on the field, you've got to do more than wish you were a great ball player. Kirby Puckett's great on the field only because he practices an awful lot off the field. That's what discipline is about in our life. If you want to be able to catch that ball when it's hit to us, we've got to be about training for it when we're not on the field. He says, I beat my body to make it my slave. Look into this. I know this doesn't sound very happy, but it's happy. If you're a masochist, I know. It presupposes that your body doesn't want to do what you're supposed to do. You wouldn't need to beat it if it just willingly went along with you. There's a struggle here. There's some pain involved here. And Paul is assuming that that's a normal part of what the Christian life is all about. A normal part of what the Christian life is all about. Your body rebels. It's part of the fallen world we're in. We're going to talk a little bit more about that shortly. But struggling is a normal part. Declaring war on certain desires and certain habits and certain thought patterns, that is a normal part of Christianity. One of the things that happened in the last several centuries to Christianity, both among Catholics and Protestants, is that we got the idea that this stuff was for the specialist. The holy people do this sort of thing. And the lay people just kind of were saved by the hair of our chinny-chin-chin kind of thing, We just kind of get by. But this is supposed to be normal. This is normal. It's normal to be doing this. It's not some kind of weird asceticism to be struggling with sin in your life. This is normal. What's abnormal is not to be struggling with it. Because that means you're either so spiritually wonderful that you don't have a struggle, or it means you're so decadent that you're not aware that there is a struggle. It's normal to be involved in a struggle. And then he uses this tough phrase, so that I may not be disqualified from the prize. and I don't know how much into this I want to get because we could go we could be about solving a theological problem here and I don't want to spend a lot of time solving a theological problem the problem is how do you score that with grace I thought we were saved by grace now Paul is saying that we're running a race to win the prize oh I got to run faster I'm not going to get a crown and that's all what it sounds like if I don't beat my body I'm not going to be saved I don't believe for a lot of reasons that paul is talking about salvation here i i the purpose of the passage isn't to teach a doctrine of salvation the purpose of the passage is to teach us something about the atmosphere of the christian life the prize that we're striving for is a relationship with jesus christ a deepening relationship with jesus christ now we all have by virtue of our faith by virtue of the fact that we accept jesus christ as our lord and savior we all have uh a relationship with jesus christ we're perfected before god once and for all but there is still a prize out there that we can strive for and the prize is to draw closer to him to experience more of what we know to be true to be further transformed by him to make our confession of his lordship more reality in our life to experience more of the peace and the power and the joy of god in our life that's a prize that's out there and it's something that we only get when we go through certain spiritual disciplines this is part i think what paul's getting at in in first corinthians chapter 3 verse 10 through 15 when he talks about uh the various things that christians acquire in their life or what they do with their salvation and he says that there are some that that build works of hay and some of straw and some of wood and some of stubble and some of stone and everything's going to be tried by fire and only that which is really solid is going to you know persevere some people will have all their stuff burned up but they're still going to be saved but by like barely escaping the fire are you familiar with that passage it's first corinthians 3 10 through 15 he's talking there he's got a it's called the the judgment of works and and what that's about and again i don't want to get into the whole thing here but what that's about is not salvation because that's done simply by believing in jesus christ but it's about what you do with your salvation or it's really more about this every christian is is rendered right with god but not every christian has the same degree of the same ability to receive from god what god wants them to have you alter your receptivity god's attitude towards you doesn't change but your ability to reflect god changes as you grow okay so you become a better receptor or it's sort of like this i hear one analogy that was sometimes once used that that god fills everyone's cup all right so so your cup is full and so you have total joy but your ability to have joy differs from from person to person some people have a four foot cup some people have a four inch cup it's all full and so internally they're they have joy but your ability to radiate god's goodness and love and peace and joy changes as you grow as you're able to receive it not everyone is capacitated at the present time to receive from God the same amount. What discipline does, what spiritual discipline does, is it doesn't change God's attitude towards us, but it changes our ability to experience his attitude towards us in our life. We're transformed, as Paul says, 2 Corinthians 3.18, from one glory unto another. And so our lives take on, we express more of God in our life. That's what this is all about. And That's a prize that I hunger for. I hope that you hunger for it too. If you have the mentality, oh, as long as I just get out of hell, it's all I care about, and I just want to live as carnal as I possibly can, but still get by. If that's your attitude, then spiritual discipline won't mean anything to you. You won't want to have anything of it. And this passage won't make any sense to you because it presupposes there's a hunger there. But if that's your attitude, I'm worried about you because I don't know how you could experience the salvation of Jesus Christ and have that attitude. But that's between you and God. Okay. Another passage, Romans 8. Just to kind of give a flavor here. Romans 8, 13. I'll start with verse 12. Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation, but it is not to the sinful nature to live according to it. everyone following here okay romans 8 13 for if you live according to the sinful nature you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body you will live because those who are led by the spirit of god are the sons of god the the point i wanted to bring out here is simply the truth that Paul says that to be led by the spirit of God one other things that means to be led by the spirit of God is to put to death the misdeeds of the body to declare war on sin in your life to declare war on it to beat your body if needs be, that's part of what it means to be led by the spirit, that's not legalism that's part of what it means to be led the spirit the way Paul phrases this here he says this we have an obligation but it's not to the sin that reigns over our body it's to the spirit of god that's fighting against that to put to death the misdeeds of the body so there's an obligation that comes from the inside and as long as it comes from the inside it's not legalism it comes from the spirit of god inside you that you desire to be free from these things that entangle you from the things that keep you from seeing the beauty of god and keep you from enjoying the joy of god you desire to be free from that. And therefore, you embark on spiritual disciplines to bring that about. That's what spiritual discipline is all about. It's a means to an end. We want to walk in the spirit, want to live in the spirit, we want to run the race effectively. Discipline is the only way that it's going to come about. Okay, let me say a couple more. Are there any questions about that before I move on. Okay, a couple more things about this. Scripture constantly presupposes spiritual discipline as a part of the believer's life. The Bible says, for example, and I had earlier today, I went through, I looked at all the different passages that talk about being set apart, and I was going to go through those, but I thought, man, you already know that, and so I don't want to be able to point. But the Bible constantly talks about God's people as being set apart. If you read the context of those passages, you see that they're set apart. They're set apart distinct from the world. There is a difference. There is to be a difference between Christians and non-Christians, between those who bear light and those who are involved in darkness. There is to be a difference. They're to be set apart, set aside. That's what the word sanctified means. They're set apart by who they love. That's the first and the primary thing. You love someone that the world does not love. And that sets you apart. Your reason for existing is different than other people's. The purpose for your life is different from other people's. Your ambitions, your motivations are different. But because of that, we're therefore set apart also by what we do. 2 Corinthians, in fact, can I get a couple of other people to read these? I don't want to keep looking at the passages. Who's got a Bible? Could you look at a passage? Anyone? Voluntary? Okay, would you read 2 Corinthians 6.17 and Matthew 12.50? That'll do it. All right. We're in part set aside by what we do. See, the reason I prayed for protection at the beginning of this class because I know that this kind of talk has been used to beat some of us up. It was by me. I mean, it was used to beat me up. And what I want to do here is, as I said in a sermon earlier this summer, make this user-friendly. This is good stuff. It maybe sounds like bad stuff to some because you got wasted by it. What I want to do is to present this, but in such a way that we don't get wasted by it. Okay, being set apart, being sanctified. 2 Corinthians 6.17. Okay, Paul is here quoting Leviticus, and he's really tying into a whole strand of the Old Testament tradition that carries on into the New. And that is the call to come out from among them. Be distinct, be separate. there is to be a noticeable difference among christians okay now that's not a source of life for us like look how different we are group i was a part of they went out of their way to try to look different i mean i to this day i went to the mall america last week i can spot them i can spot every person who belonged to the the group that i was a part of because they all wear their hair a certain way they all wear their dresses a certain way and the women really stand out um and they they you know they don't have any makeup they also look and they purposely dress like that because they think that they're witnessing to christ what they do is they look much older than they really are and but but but they get pride from being noticed for being weird they are there's a lady in our neighborhood who rides and she's she's one of them too um she rides her bike and she wears uh you know her dress and long sleeves and her hair up in a bun while she's riding this bike and she looks really silly uh but i'm sure she's thinking what a witness i am for jesus because they think i'm silly but that's a pride thing you see they're you're getting off on being different and these are the people who kind of flaunt it you know i don't i don't smoke it and they really got to make everyone notice that they don't do whatever everyone else does that's a pride thing it's wrong the motivation's bad it'd be better for you just to collapse on that and burn out but you don't do it as a source of life but you do it because of who the source of life is given that christ is your source of life it is to have it's ordinary to have it's normal to have repercussions in your life such that as a matter of fact your behavior is not synonymous with the behavior of the world there's a different your heart drives you to a different lifestyle a different way of living that's what discipline is all about so come up from among the be separate matthew 12 50 only point i want to note here is that jesus says those who those who do the will of my father in heaven that's my brother my sister and at that point he was saying it's not Mary and it's not James those guys but whoever does the will of my father in heaven now if you were to ask Jesus well is it the behavior that makes you the child the the child of God or is it the love that you have in your heart he was of course it's the love that you have in your heart but if you have the love in your heart you're going to do the will of my father who's in heaven and the behavior is what shows forth where your heart is the orientation brings forth a manifestation but the manifestation is what manifests what the orientation is okay so that's why he says whoever does the will of my father in heaven the point i want to note here is that what you do with your physical body what you do with your physical body in public and in private is is important to the kingdom is important to the gospel it's not superfluous stuff it's not irrelevant the early christians as i mentioned this summer were called disciples they're called disciples the word literally means disciplined ones they were they were ones who were disciplined to be discipled means literally to be disciplined it's an ordinary thing it's part of the christian walk to be disciplined they're also called christians which means christ-like they looked like christ that's how they were set apart you know in fact some of them could even uh there's one phrase in acts i think it's chapter five where they said they perceive that these people had been with jesus you could tell these people spend time with jesus there's an there's a there's an air about them a way about them a demeanor about them we could tell that they spent time with jesus they were disciplined and being disciplined they became christ-like thirdly you find throughout scripture too numerous to mention but it constantly you constantly have spiritual blessings being connected with obedience or being connected with with discipline here's a passage i read just the other week and it kind of stuck in my mind i could read it if someone can find it before i do get there psalms 15 i'm gonna win but hurry okay i got in there too bad just listen to this lord who may dwell in your sanctuary and who may live in your holy hill okay who's going to dwell in your presence he whose walk is blameless and he who does what is righteous who speaks the truth from his tongue and has no slander on... Who speaks the truth from his heart. I love that. And has no slander on his tongue. No gossip here. Who does his neighbor no wrong and casts no slur on his fellow man. Who despises a vile man. Hating sin is part of righteousness. But honors those who fear the Lord. Who keeps his oath even when it hurts. That just strikes me. Who keeps his oath. Make a promise, keep it, even if it hurts. Who lends his money without usury and does not accept a bribe against the innocent, he who does these things will never be shaken. A single-minded man is stable in all of those ways. Okay, who dwells in the presence of God? The author there, and this is a motif, a theme that you find throughout Scripture, connects spiritual blessing, dwelling with God, abiding in God, receiving the blessing of God with obedience. If we want to sense God's presence in a very real way, and you want to be, and to sense his love, and to feel that intimacy and that closeness, it's not going to happen just by wanting it, if everything else in your life is totally incongruous with that. That's a prize, that's something you want to long for. As we, you know, it's good that we don't get it, we don't just get it cheaply, because we grow, we mature as persons we're empowered as persons as we do things to draw close to god our love for him strengthens as we do things to draw close to god and that's not about salvation that's about blessing but to dwell richly in the presence of god where you just sense his presence you're aware that he's there you go to pray and his presence is there and you feel spiritual vigor and when temptation comes there's a spiritual power that kicks in and there's a spiritual power when you confront evil there's a spiritual warfare kind of dynamism that kicks in these are all things that come when a life is yielded, when a life is yielded, when you really are a soldier in training. But when we settle for fire insurance and are back on the beach sipping a martini, we never experienced any of that. And because when you think carnal, this is how you define pleasure, you think this is the best thing there is. As a matter of fact, if you would just enter into the discipline, enter into the life, begin to not only just make Jesus, you know, confess him as the Savior, but the Lord that you follow by example, when you move into that reality, there's a whole richness of blessing and joy and peace that begins to just overcome you. And a lot of the things that tear you this way or that way, and a lot of the things that are destroying you, you can be freed of if you'll just break through to this new level that this this this new lifestyle which is being intentional about your life and being disciplined about it finally discipline church tradition just say a word about that this hasn't gone all this this scriptural stuff has not gone unnoticed by the people throughout church history that have loved god spiritual disciplines has been normal throughout church history. In fact, the one I listed in the annotated bibliography, one book there about the lives of the saints. It's good sometimes to read the lives of the saints or Fox's Book of Martyrs. Read the autobiographies of some of these people just to set before you examples because there's not very many living ones, but examples of people who are sold out to God, who really were tired of mediocrity, who were just tired of living the ordinary, earthly, physical, biological existence and wanted to see how close was it possible for a human being to get to God. And some of their lives are just incredible. Just incredible. It was not at all odd for a person to spend days in prayer in church history. In fact, the monastic movement, whatever else you might think about that, and there's a lot wrong with it. Philosophically, I disagree with it in some ways. But in some ways, I agree with it. But that was all about people who just wanted to dedicate their entire lives to the thing that mattered most to them. And what mattered most was prayer. And you think, well, maybe that's selfish. And that seems kind of selfish. Maybe it is. But when they meant prayer, they didn't just mean prayer for themselves. They meant prayer for the world. And they really believed that what you do in prayer affects more than what you do with your physical life. And I think they were right about that. And so it made sense to them not to have everybody do that, but to have some people who simply dedicated their lives to prayer. They were described as fortresses that did spiritual warfare for the church because they took it so seriously. There's something good about that, something valuable about that. They were part of that. Martin Luther, who was the founder of Lutheranism, he at one point in his life, towards the end of his life, wrote to a bishop, and he was complaining. He was saying, my life is so overcome now with the practicality of running this new church. He hated business stuff and administration and all that kind of stuff. But he said, my life is so overcome with practicality that I can scarcely find time two hours a day to pray. He was complaining. It was like a confession of sin. I can't find time, two hours a day to pray. Now, what does that tell you about what he was like when he was good? Think about it. They took prayer so seriously. Being disciplined about this kind of stuff was normal. I just yesterday met a person that I've respected for a long time, and I'd heard that this woman spends five hours a day in prayer. And she's been doing that for years, and just with incredible testimonies about power that it does. We've lost that. We have lost that. I've lost that. In our culture, you see, we're so materialistically orientated. We really believe, and this has to be confronted, and the spiritual disciplines help us to confront this, that what is important is what is physical. what we do. We're very empirical. And that's why we sometimes sense that when we pray, we're wasting our time. We don't really believe that we're fighting demons when we're praying against them. We think that with our head, but not in our gut. And that's why where your heart is, what you really believe in your gut will determine where you put your time and where you put your money. So one thing we need to ask ourselves as a spiritual barometer is where do we put our time where we put our money. And if it's a bad indicator of maybe where our spirituality is, we need to begin to become intentional about changing it. What can we do to begin to change these things? I think we all do want to change them. Okay, move on. How does this all connect with salvation by grace? I've already touched on this a little bit. Let me just say another word about it. All this stuff about running and all this hubbub. We're saved by grace. I'm going to assume that we here know what that means. In some places, in a lot of churches, I wouldn't even teach a course like this. Or I'd spend five years teaching a course on this first. I'd read Needham's book, and then maybe a couple years later read Willard's book. Because a lot of places, you don't have this kind of foundational understanding, and we've got to have this foundational understanding. And I'm going to kind of presuppose that we have that here. What is to be saved by grace? That you are okay. Your well-being, your okayness before God is completely 100% a matter of what Jesus Christ has done for you and nothing else. And nothing you're going to do is going to add to that or improve on that or win kudos with God, get strokes with God, get points with angels, get points with God's people. None of that matters. So whatever the motivation for doing anything is, it can't be to get points because there's no points. All points have been gotten by Jesus Christ. That's what salvation by grace means. But now there's a misconception that comes with this, and this is what I want to confront. I'm assuming you know what salvation by grace means. But the misconception is that grace, because we're saved by grace, that means that discipline is not necessary or discipline is not important. It's not necessary or it's not important. And it can take several different forms. One form is called antinomianism. The wind bloweth where it listeth. That's my notes. I don't know what it is about the King James Version, but it sticks in your head more than any other versions when you memorize it. I still have to say a quote in King James. I don't know what it is. People prophesy in King James. I don't know why. This is the Lord. It's true. Why is that? Maybe God really does speak King James. We're going to get to heaven and God's going to go, beholdeth, though, through the recometh. Oh, no, I've got an eternity to deal with this stuff. The inspired version. It is not meat for me to give. Okay, antinomianism. Anti is the word for against. Nomos is the word for law. Antinomianism means lawlessness. And antinomianism is used to describe any group of people, or any movement, or any individual, who somehow believes that behavior is utterly irrelevant to walking with God. I met a guy some years ago who got to know a little bit, and he was living with two women, and was really strung out on cocaine, and his life was, by most standards, what's a nice word? Lecherous, debauchery, he was a slime! I got to talk to him a little bit about the Lord. I saw a witness to him, and he goes, Oh, I'm a Christian, praise God, I'm a Christian, and yeah, good to have a brother in Christ. And I was like, what's going on here? Maybe the guy's sincereness is very uninformed, but I don't think so. You probe a little bit, and what you find out was the guy when he was like four years old and the Southern Baptist Church went forward and gave his heart to the Lord. That's what you do when you're four years old in the Southern Baptist Church. You give your heart to the Lord. And then there's this teaching on eternal security. And that was taken to mean something that John Calvin never intended to mean. That was taken to mean that no matter what you do, you have the assurance of salvation. You can have the full assurance of salvation. And your life is totally inconsequential. Some people teach that what is true about you is positionally true in terms of your being right with god okay so god god sees you god sees you as being righteous god sees you as being holy and spotless and blameless because you are positioned in christ it's where you're at even though in reality you're a you're a sinner and your life uh doesn't manifest any of the fruit of the spirit and and there's no hunger and thirst after righteousness in there there's not even any concern about things that that you're doing that crucified jesus christ and and you're flaunting it okay even though that's true you still the full assurance because it's positionally true of you that you're in jesus christ and god wears jesus filters and now sees you that way because at the age of four you did what your mom told you to do and there's no one in church history that would ever agree with that except there's some modern versions of it now and there was some in the early church too another version of it is another much more mild uh misconception is that that when you're saved, it's not just positionally true, it's a real thing, but healthy growth comes naturally, okay? It's all going to come naturally. You just kind of have to sit back and let it happen to you. So you get saved, relax in God's presence, and everything else will take care of itself. And when the time is right, that's when you'll get out of this sin, or maybe you begin to pray a little more, you begin to read your Bible. And naturally is defined by when you feel like it. That's what naturally means. so it will happen naturally which means you all of a sudden want to you'll have a craving for it and and you won't be able to do otherwise it will feel right you'll want to do it and it won't be any kind of a burden okay those are two misconceptions and here's why i think they are misconceptions the first one is is a drastic misconception because god's declaration creates reality what i mean by that is this when god declares you to be righteous he's not just pretending he's not just saying let's pretend like greg is righteous or i tell you what you know in some ways this positional truth thing makes god out to be sort of um ignorant it's like god doesn't know and he's wearing to see through jesus spectacles he's wearing blinders because he doesn't know what's really going on like the god god doesn't know that you're sleeping with these two women and you're snorting cocaine and you're defiling them all the other kinds of god doesn't see that what is it i i know more than god knows because i see it well when god when god declares you to be righteous he's not pretending it's not a fabrication it's not just a positional truth it creates reality it is a real thing when god said in the beginning let there be light there was light when he said let there be earth there was the earth and and so on god when god speaks reality occurs that's what I mean by God's word creates reality God's declaration when he declares something to be it is that's why he's God so when God says Greg Boyd is righteous he's not just saying I'm gonna pretend like Greg Boyd is righteous he's saying Greg Boyd is righteous that's what's really true about me now you're all wondering well then why don't we see it don't you and There's a reason for that. Because you're all blind. I really am holy. No, if there's a lie, the lie is in the fact that I don't live the reality. But the reality is there. God's word creates reality. And therefore, here's the punchline. The gift of salvation necessarily has repercussions. Okay? It has repercussions. I don't mean at all instantaneous perfection or even steady growth towards perfection, but it has repercussions. What is real is defined as real precisely because it confronts other realities. If I introduce to you a person up here who doesn't have any impact on your eyes or impact on your ears or impact on space or impact on sense or impact on anything, I just introduce to you a non-existing person. because there's no reality there to be real means there's going to be impact in your life and so also when god declares you to be righteous that's going to have impact now there's a reason why it doesn't have instantaneous impact and we're going to get to that probably next week but it does have impact so the idea of just going on unchanged in all the carnality in all the sin and all the apathy that you've always had without at least some conviction about it some growth in a certain way really is incongruous with with with the gospel's declaration that in fact you're made righteous when paul says these things under inspiration he he means it oh we're gonna get to it now we'll end with this so why don't our attitudes and desires and behaviors immediately line up why don't our attitudes and desires if i'm really righteous and i'm really holy and i'm really perfectly compatible with god and i am that right now the bible says so why is it that i yet feel very alienated from God sometimes. I don't feel like praying. I still have carnal thoughts, carnal ambitions, carnal behavior. Why is it that the reality doesn't immediately shine forth? Flesh, exactly. Und das Flesch. And, well, there, you got the answer. Let's move on. No, we're going to have to quit now. But let me just say this and we'll pick up here next week. When God said, let there be light, there was instantaneous light, because there was nothing to combat the light. When God said, let the dry ground appear, the dry ground appear, because there was nothing to fight against him. But when God says, let Greg be righteous, at that time, there was 17 years of old Greg Boyd that combated it. And there's 18 years since, I've been saved 18 years. I've been saved longer than I was unsaved. I just realized that. over half my life I can't believe that why haven't I made more progress this is really sad but there's also this constant influence of the world what the Bible calls flesh and fights against it that's why the reality there's a conflict here there's a warfare here there's a battle that goes on we'll talk more about it next week but the disciplines come in. The disciplines come in because it's necessary as a way of taking the true reality of our salvation and conquering the old reality of our carnal self, the flesh. Discipline is necessary. It doesn't come automatically. It does have implications. It has repercussions. God never lets you at peace with this old self, okay? And so there's a constant motivation to go against it, but only discipline is what makes that transference from what God calls you to be to what you, in fact, are in your own experience. For next week, I said I'd give you an assignment. I'll tell you what, I don't want to have a call to fasting without some kind of background towards it. If you practice fasting on occasion on your own, and you want to fast next Wednesday, do it. But otherwise, let's wait, and we're going to take that on as the first thing. So I was going to say, hey, let's all fast next week with some provisions. Like if you're a diabetic, don't. And if you're a doctor, don't. And if you're anorexic, don't. So there are some spiritual disciplines which are not good. I had this in this class where I was talking about fasting. And there's a woman in the class who was anorexic. And she loved that discipline. For her, discipline was eating. So that's why you have to kind of condition it. But let's wait till next week.
