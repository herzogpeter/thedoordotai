Let's pray. Lord God, we just acknowledge that you are here today, Father, Son, Holy Spirit. You no longer dwell in a man-made house. It was never your intention. You dwell in your people and you dwell in all those, even today, who would open up your heart and say, Lord Jesus, come. Come and move into my life. Come and move into my being. And we invite you now, Jesus, to speak, to heal, to come into the desert, the prison, or the party, and to just be there and share your presence and love with us and do your work. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. All right. Somebody's not having a good time right now. We, as our family, would take vacations and trips, and we have tried to do the same thing with our kids. And we had a trip that I thought was going to be one of the best trips we could ever take up in the Purple Mountain Majesty. You know, I told the kids that's where this song comes from, kids. We're going up to the Colorado mountains. We were going to Colorado for a wedding. But we were going to go see this wonderful. Now, the kids somehow did not have the same excitement that Sherry and I had. The sign of that is they take the Walkman. Just remember that. When they take the Walkman, you know, they're going to be in another world. So anyways, we're going up, and we allow the Walkmans. You know, that's fine. And we're up in the mountains, and it's beautiful. Pretty soon we start hearing the music. And this is a few years ago from Kyle's Walkman. And it's not music that we've approved. And Sherry asked to see Kyle's Walkman collection of CDs, and there were a few CDs in there that we didn't approve of. Well, this ensued some other than Purple Mountain Majesty kind of stuff in our car. And at this point in time, Kyle's defending these CDs. They're his friend's CDs. You can't take these CDs. They're not his CDs, so it's okay that he has them, see, because they're friends. And, yeah, he'll give them back. And, you know, well, whose friends are they? I'm not going to tell you. You've been there, parents, right? you know. Then Kara, who was there, has given me permission to tell the story as well. Kara was there and she began to do her thing, which was, Kyle, you know, if you were a Christian, you would not have those CDs. Now, Kara wants me to let you know that that was several years ago. All right, several years ago. And then I, of course, join in the game and I go, now Kara, that's a little too heavy. And you see this little circle is starting to, you have this happen sometimes, and outside is purple mountain majesty. And inside is a valley of despair. And we are driving out of the mountains like this. Sometimes outside, it can be really good. But inside, not so good. You see, the point, the little story, is that it's not what's outside, it's not what's happening outside that matters. It's what's inside that matters. And the psalmist knew that. and today what's happening in your life outside affects you it certainly does and we would pray that if we have it in our power to change that we would that's what God asks us to do bring everything to him but when those circumstances don't change and I would guess right now that a few of us could raise our hands and we're there right now something's got to change in here something's got to change in here and that's the beauty of the Christian life we have the trinity inside and he can do a wonderful work inside us and begin to make our life a spiritual adventure. Now this psalmist, if you get into his pain, he is, again, not at the temple courts where he'd like to be and he's only there a few times a year. He is not even journeying there. He's at home, wherever that may be, kind of off task, not in the lineup, and yet he's gotten this wonderful peace and presence. What are the blessings? He gives us all kinds of blessings. This psalm uses the words blessed are more than any other psalm in the Bible. Three times it says blessed are. But there are more blessings, more unexpected blessings in verses 5 through 7. And I want to give you three unexpected blessings. Three surprises. What's a blessing? You know, the counter blessing. What is that? The Christian word for what? Well, a little later he says, no good. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's good things that God brings into your life. The psalmist says, no good thing will God withhold from them who trust in him. Blessings are God's good things. So what are some surprising good things that happen? If you set your heart on this journey, and if you begin to get off, you know what Jesus once said, you know, there's one road. And there's lots of roads to destruction. But there's one road, and this is that one road. This is this way of being in God and living in God where there are unexpected blessings. Well, let me give you the first one. The first one's in verse 6. It says, as they pass through the valley of Baka, or Beka, they make it a place of springs, and the autumn rains cover it with pools. Now, to get the picture of what's going on here, they're passing through a desert place, a dry place. The word Bika can mean various things, but it perhaps is a tree, a special kind of tree, a valley where this tree would be that lives in arid places. Well, even the context gives you that it's not with water, right? It's dry. Others have thought that perhaps it also means the dryness, the pain that comes from a painful experience, being separated from something, whether it's peace or comfort or joy or a person. In this case, the psalmist being separated from the place he'd love to be. Whatever it may be, that it's some kind of place of tears. And many believe that this psalmist is the same one who wrote Psalms 42 and 43. And if you'd write that down sometime, look at those psalms. We're going to look at it perhaps a little later if we have time. But Psalm 42 and 43 are the direct opposite of this psalm. This psalm is praise songs, the ultimate of praise and being in God's presence. Oh, if I could just be one of the birds. You know, that's a light heart. Psalm 42 is, Oh, Lord, where are you? Why have you forsaken me? All my friends look at me and say, Where is your God? You were all so happy in God. You're depressed. You're down. What's the matter with you? And the psalm was three or four times there. that has this refrain. He says, Oh, why so downcast my soul within me? Why so hopeless? Hope in God. He's talking to himself. He's at this place where he can't even look to God, so he's talking to himself. Let's get out of this. Hope in God. I will yet praise him. And the words there are interesting because it really says, I will yet see his smile. Isn't that great? From what we talked about last week? I will yet see his smile. Beautiful psalm. If you are in pain right now, it's a psalm to go to. You know, beka happens. I'd like to do a little bumper sticker. Pain happens. Now, as we're going on this trip, and I just got through saying this is going to be a great adventure, you might say, oh, this sounds like one of the trips I've been on. You ever been on one of those trips? You head out towards, you're going to go west, okay? You go west on 94, and you've got your RV or whatever it is you've rented, or your car's all souped up. You've got all the stuff ready to go. The kids are ready to go. You're having fun. You're singing songs. And you get to Fargo, and you have a breakdown. Virgo. That's what this feels like to me. Blessed are those who set their hearts on pilgrimage, and they go through the valley of Bika. What's this? Well, if you've been a Christian for long, you'll know that living the Christian life is not all roses and sweetness, is it? The Christian life is about facing the pain in life, the fallen things in life. It's about facing this fallen world and not escaping from it and not medicating yourself out of it, not white-knuckling through it alone, but it is going with God who sent his son, Jesus Christ, to die on a cross to face the pain and the fallenness of this world so that we could face our own pain of our own sin and the sin of others. And Bika happens, but God has been there for you and me. And as Christians, we know that we can face pain. Now, some use Christianity to escape pain. They spiritualize things. And really, that's a kind of a form of escapism and Christian medication. We know that the way through pain is through it, right? It's the only way. Through it. Dave's preached on that. That's kind of a theme song around here. The only way through your pain is through it. That's it. You can't go around it. Now, God does not wish pain on us. Our God is a God who did not set up this world so that it would be fallen. He set it up perfect and good. But we chose, and the angels chose, to ignore him, to walk away. And so we have fallenness, and we have pain in our world. Now, this verse here promises something to us. There's an unexpected blessing as you go through whatever pain you're in. And the psalmist knows pain. 42, he says this. So you know he knows pain. He says, my tears have been my food all day long. Have you or are you in so much pain, or have you ever been in so much pain that you've cried so much that the tears drip down into your mouth? You ever been in that much pain? I've been in that much pain. That's usually the pain of some kind of rejection by people, isn't it? That's usually what it is. Or it may even be sensing rejection from God and not being able to get to Him. A deep pain. Well, here's the blessing. Blessed are those as they go through the Valley of Bika, they make it a place of springs. The autumn rains also cover it with pools. these people have learned to take that pain to God and if you read Psalm 42 and 43 you'll see this person is not going it alone not white knuckling it this person is not medicating somehow to escape the pain this person is taking that pain to God now it doesn't mean that he doesn't fall and white knuckle it sometimes and medicate and have to do but he is taking it to God even taking his failures at taking the pain to God to God he argues with God that's the way to get through pain is to bring it to the cross bring it to Jesus ask him to take it he may not even give you a why I think one of the ways that we try and white knuckle through pain is why Lord, why Lord and there are plenty of people who want like Job's friends who want to give us all kinds of reasons and you know God doesn't promise to give you any other reason for your pain you know what he promises? what? his presence his presence how did they make it a place of springs? How does this desert become, literally, the verse here says this desert becomes a garden. Springs come up in this desert place, in this valley. And then God waters it. He sends rains that are out of our control and he waters it. This is a person who's living in God even in the place of pain. I was really afraid last week as we talked about living in Jesus that some would say, you know, I have failed so much or others have failed me so much, I can't even think about living in God like you're saying. well when you begin to take any of that to god all your your pain to him and he gives you himself that's the first surprise you get your point of pain in your life becomes his place of presence he opens you up through that pain he uses that pain to fill you with his presence and he gives you a capacity as you do that more and more in your life to be more and more in him. Unfortunate that pain is here, but dear God, how gracious you are to give us yourself and heal us, to come with your love and your smile. No matter what we've done or others have done to us, as we offer that pain to him, he comes with his presence and his love. My wife has grown up with horses and she had a horse one time that got out of the barn. And as it got out of the barn, It had a deep gash in its chest. They called the vet. They thought it was over with. This horse was going to bleed to death, and they'd have to put it down. But the vet said, no, the horse is fine. What you're going to have to do for two weeks is going to be very painful for the horse, but you're going to have to take clothes and water that wound every day. And the first few days, it was tough. But then pretty soon, the horse got used to it, and the horse got handled about half an hour a day. And you know what? That horse, which was kind of an unruly young horse, became one of the gentlest, kindest, handled horses you've ever seen because of a pain, a point of pain that a presence of care was applied. God can take your points of pain if you give them to Him. Maybe a past pain. It's very hard to give to Him. Very hard to bring into the light of His love. Pain from your own failure or pain from someone having failed you. And it's painful to bring your pain to Him. but he puts his hand on you and he makes it a place of springs and he opens you up for his presence and his blessing the second surprise is in verse 6 as well it says that they go from strength to strength they go through the valley of Bika the valley of pain, tears, whatever pain it may be and as they open their lives up to God and give him that pain like in Psalm 42 and 43 and just pour it out he gives them his presence and they go from strength to strength. Now, what overseas trip have you ever been on if you've taken a flight overseas or a long trip from like Seattle to Florida or even from the Midwest to Florida? When you get off the plane, you go, wow, that's great. I just feel great. I usually feel tired, don't you? On that first day of that journey, you were at Fargo, you broke down, you got the car into the repairs and you got to the hotel and you're exhausted. What kind of journey is this? What an unexpected and wonderful, surprising, good thing, blessing. On this trip in the heart, you get younger and stronger. What a surprise. As you get older in the Lord, yeah, you're going to get some wrinkles. Yeah, your bones are going to start. Paul says we begin to deteriorate. But inside, when you're in this living in God thing, and you're not holding anything back from Him, all your pain, all your pleasure, everything, you just give it up to Him. When you live in Him and He lives in you, you're going to get younger and stronger. Remember that verse in Isaiah? Isaiah chapter 40, verses 28 through 31. Those who wait on the Lord, what do they do? They don't grow weary and tired. They renew their strength as the eagle. Their youth is renewed. Now what does that mean? It means that you get the capacity as you open yourself up to God to be more and more of an open person. And when life comes at you and hits you in the face, and other people do, you have so lived in God's presence and lived in His love that you're no longer taking it quite as personally. And you're able to forgive. And you're able to release love back. Even when you are what? Remember Stephen? Stoned. And you begin to live the life of God. But God pours into you His life, the life of His Son. And you have the eternal youth of the life of heaven that cannot be killed and springs eternally young from you. What did Jesus say? Except you become as a what? A child, a little child. You know what he's saying? In the Christian kingdom, even though you're getting old in your body, in your age, as a believer, you're getting younger and younger and more open and more free with God, just like a little child. You know, children can say the greatest things. My daughter on the way home last night, I didn't think Saturday went so well, and I was kind of beating myself up for some of my points that I didn't say them as well as I thought. And she said, Dad, I was sitting with people, and they were enjoying that message, and God was speaking to them, and Satan's just teasing you right now. Boy, you need kids to tell you the truth, don't you? They're open. They're young. And God makes your spirit younger and younger. Princess Diana in our culture is being seen as kind of an icon of all the beautiful and wonderful things. She's royalty. She was blessed with all kinds of things, and she was beautiful. And people have just showered her with flowers and attention, even at her grave. You know who Princess Diana sat at the feet of? Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Ever seen Mother Teresa of Calcutta? She is not a beauty queen. She was not a beauty queen. She's very wrinkled. She's had a hard life. A labor of love in the streets of Calcutta. And you know who Mother Teresa gave her life to? The refuse of the city of Calcutta. Why did she do that? These were people who were cast away, throwaways. In India, if you have AIDS, it's the death sentence on your life. No one wants to be near you. They will throw you in the street. If your old families will throw you away, people, kids get thrown away. And they're there in the streets, and it just rips at your heart. But Mother Teresa said, I'm going to be with these people. And she takes each one into a home, and she is there. And though they cannot do anything for them to physically make them better than just give them some comfort as much as they can, they're with that person. Do you want to know why? Because in each person she sees a soul made by God, a spark of the life. of heaven. And when you're young in God, you can see through stuff. You know, when you live a life of sin, even if you're young, you're going to look really old. But if you live a life being in God, you're going to look really young. You're going to look really young and people are going to be attracted to that youth. The third surprise and blessing or good thing that we see here is that not only does your point of pain become his presence point in your life, place of presence, and then you get younger and stronger in him, but you also become who God made you to be. You become who God made you to be. Look at the verse. It says you go from strength to strength, glory to glory, it says in the New Testament. Paul says we are renewed day by day. But here's this last part of the verse. They go from strength to strength till each appears before God in Zion. What an interesting way that he has to talk about coming to the temple. He's really talking here about meeting his maker, not just going to the temple. He's talking about the end of his life, that final point of pain. When we lose our sight and our sense and our smell and face the living God. And for him, this has become a place of tremendous expectation. Because having looked into the eyes of his God for so long and seeing the love of God and becoming the loving person, the person that lives in God's presence and can love others. You see in Psalm 42 and 43, he asks for vindication because there have been those who have wrongfully accused him and perhaps that's why he could not serve in the temple. In this verse, he prays for those very people in the later verses. He prays for the anointed one, the Messiah, the King. He prays for the blessings upon even those who have persecuted him. He's another Stephen. He's Jesus on the cross blessing those who have persecuted him. How did he get to this place? By looking into the eyes of the God of love. Did he become a lover? And if you will do that, I don't care what prison you're in. If you're in the prison of some kind of persecution and insult, and you right now feel that it's impossible to live, as Jesus said, to bless those who persecute you, To love those who are your enemies. If you begin on a daily basis to look into his eyes and love him and have him love you back, you'll become a lover. If you want to know what people are becoming, look at the pictures that they hang in their office, in their bedroom. Look at what they look at. Praise God that we have laws now that keep us from having to look at the junk that somebody would set up in their office or in their place. But in their homes, they can do whatever they want. Look at what they read. Look what they look at. Look at the TV. What you look at is what you're becoming. What you give yourself to is what you're becoming. And this psalmist, this Levite, had so given himself in being in God and in his presence and daily, moment by moment, looked to God and his love that he became a lover himself. And he would then appear someday before God. And it says in Revelation that God's going to give to you a name that only you and he know. What a picture of intimacy is that. Nobody else, I don't think in eternity he's ever going to know that. That's a name, only you. God has a name, a special name for you. I had special songs that I sang to my kids when they were little. Now they don't want me singing those songs. Every once in a while if I want to tease them, I'll sing this, you know, I love you, I love you, Kyle. But every once in a while they ask me, Dad, remember that song? It's just between us, that love place. And God has that for you. And when you die, even though death is a fearful thing, you can pray to have a glorious and wonderful entry into the kingdom of God because Jesus says you're his, and he opens his arm and welcomes you in. And the scriptures say live a life. You read it in the New Testament over and over again. Live your life in such a way that you will not be ashamed when you face him. That's written to believers. live your life present to him it's not about making sure you've confessed up and you're living right it's not about that it's living in a way where you just know if he said you know you had that it's covered by the blood just amen i agree with that and you just live in love with him and that's how you die and you go and be his presence fully accepted fully accepted now i think there are going to be some of us who haven't lived in this kind of life he's going to wipe away a few tears so we can see his heart. That's what he'll do when he glorifies us. But why not live in his presence now and feel that love now? I want to give to you some resistance points of why we don't in just the last five minutes. Why don't we do this? Why don't we go to prayer? I have to tell you, when I'm through preaching this, I go home and I go, oh, Lord, why is it so hard for me to do what I just told them about? Let me give you some roadblocks on this journey, okay? To really help the church begin to see how to really be in God and be the gospel. Not just know it in your head or know a bunch of rules that you're supposed to obey, but really to just be the love of God and how to be in God. And Dallas' book, The Divine Conspiracy, is available in our bookstore as well as Spirit of the Disciplines. He's got a book on hearing God's voice as well that's just really excellent. He will be here. And he is a huge person in the kingdom right now, very humble guy. He's in South Africa, has just been speaking to all the vineyard churches there and then speaking in the Methodist churches. And he's taking no speaking engagements, but last year he said he'd come here. And so he's going to be with us that weekend. So I'm really excited about that. Well, if you were here last weekend, I did speak about being in God, living in God, and how when you do that, you become a lover like him. And that was just fun to just be with you. I just prayed I could enjoy it. And I hadn't preached for eight years, you know. And that's a long time cooking a sermon, you know. It better be okay, you know. But I told that story about going to Disneyland. You remember that? I just, you know, sometimes you wonder if preacher's story is really true. This is a really true story, and I've got pictures to prove it. And, Scott, if you could put one up there. There I am right in front of Disneyland in California. That's me with the arrow pointing. There's my mother. We're all styling there, 60s. If you can see the black socks and the kind of tube shirts, you know, same shirts on everybody. Now, you notice in this picture, I'm the only one with a fudgesicle, and you notice the relative sizes of everybody. I won't explain that any further. Well, this Sunday, I want to talk about an adventure that's not about Disneyland. I want to talk now about if you were to live more and more the way we talked about last weekend, your life will become, if it isn't already, a great adventure. And the text that I want to go to is an Old Testament psalm. I love the Old Testament. You know, Dave and I sometimes, he's more of a New Testament guy. He does stuff in the Old Testament. I'm more of an Old Testament guy. I always tell them the New Testament is just the Old Testament really good. You know, that's all it is. But the Old Testament is Psalm 84. And we're going to look at a psalm of Korah, one of the sons of Korah. This is a temple musician or a temple Levite worker who has written this. All we know is he's the son of Korah. And he's written this incredible psalm about being in God's presence. This is an incredible psalm that we could unpack in a million different ways about how to be in God's presence. This guy wants to so live in God's presence that he's jealous of a bird, he says. Even the birds have a nest in your temple. He's jealous of this bird who has its young in a nest up in the temple courts. And he says, oh, if I could just live in your presence like that. He talks about his God being a son. And I can just see this person waking up in the morning. Maybe some of you do this. Just, oh, dear God, shine on me today. And that's this guy. And if he knew what we talked about last weekend from John 14, 21 and 23, that Jesus, having died on the cross, rose again, now has taken the Shekinah glory and taken it from the Holy of Holies in a temple, a man-made temple that God landed on, and now has landed in our hearts, the Trinity, he would be so jealous. Well, he is. Now he's with God, so he's got that. But he would be so jealous to live like that here in this life. Well, we want to look at just a few verses, verses 5 through 7, that are a, it's kind of like a little parable here. An analogy of his life as he lives it before God. And he makes an analogy to what the Jews would do at feast time. That is, they would make a spiritual pilgrimage from wherever they were in Israel to the temple. And as a Levite, he would be on rotation of service. It would be like on a worship team. And he would only be there for a couple weeks out of the year where he'd be able to serve in the temple. The rest of the time, he'd be at home. And we believe he's the writer of Psalm 42 and 43, and there he's not in a good place. In fact, he says there, Lord, where are you? It feels like you've forgotten me, and it appears that somebody's falsely accused him of something. So as a temple worker, he couldn't go to the temple. He says, I used to lead the procession. I used to be the leader, and now I can't even go. And men are mocking me. And if you are in that spot where things aren't going well for you, this is a wonderful two Psalms, 42 and 43, to just be in your pain and be with God and offer that pain up so you don't live in that pain. Offer it up to him and just be with God and shout at God. Some think that Jesus, when he said, why have you forsaken me, that's Psalm 22 and Psalm 42, 43, that he's quoting from the cross. Well, in this Psalm, he's just busting out with praise. And his life has become a great adventure for him as he describes it in verses 5 through 7. Now, sometimes we think that spiritual ventures are more like Pastor Steve Hansen and the group that goes down to Haiti and gets to give a $50,000 check to Pastor Deal. That is a lot of fun. Or, if you're in high school, like I was, you know, going to camp or going to some place where I can get my batteries charged, and that's, you know, if I could just live on that mountaintop. Well, this person talks about going through his everyday life, in fact, being in a very tough place, because it looks like things haven't changed much for him because he talks about, oh, if I could be in your temple. He says, blessed are those, verse 4, who dwell in your house. He's not there right now. Verse 5, blessed are those who strengthen you, who have set their hearts on pilgrimage. He's not even taking right now a trip to the temple. He's at home. Blessed are those, blessed is the man who trusts in you. So he's in a place where he's not at that temple, he's not serving God, but in his heart, he has found God's presence and his very life every day It's become an adventure with God. Wow. Let's look at those verses, and we'll pray. Verse 5, Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on pilgrimage. As they pass through the valley of Bika, they make it a place of springs. The autumn rains also cover it with pools. And they go from strength to strength till each appears before God in Zion. Lord Jesus, we thank you that you're here, that you reside in the hearts and lives of your people. This is your temple, these people. And as they go out, these are the places of heaven on earth, as they move out and as you live in our lives and as you live through us daily. And as we gather together to worship you and praise you and to hear your word, we invite you now to come and to take that life that is in us and move it out into our hands, our feet, our tongues, our mouths, our eyes, our faces, that those who see us this week might know Jesus. We want to see you though now, Jesus. We ask this in your name. Amen. Well, some of the journeys that I've been on, I've told you about this Disneyland one. I have some other lessons. I'm going to tell you one that I've passed by my family as a, you know, it was okay to tell because it's one of those. And we were on a trip to a wedding in Colorado here a few years ago. And as a part of being out in Colorado Springs, we were going to go up into the mountains. And Dave's talked about his love of the mountains. I love the mountains too. We were going to go up there right near the Continental Divide where the song Purple Mountain Majesty comes from. We were going to be up there. Now my first clue that the kids weren't as excited about this is that they were taking their walkmans with them, the discmans or whatever. That's a good sign, parents, that there's maybe a disconnect and it wasn't going to be quite as good for them as for us. But they said, yeah, yeah, we'll go do that. Sounds great. And they saw enough rocks after about two hours, you know, and then family dynamics began to set in. Sherry picked up listening to, the headphones were kind of loud on Kyle's head and she just picked up some music that wasn't on our approved list and asked Kyle to see the disc package and sure enough, there were some discs in there. They were not his, they were friends, you know. So there was a little ensuing battle there and Kara then joined in the fray and she said, you know, Kyle, Well, having those CDs, I don't think a Christian would have that kind of music. And, well, you could hear a pin drop now. Of course, it's getting really hot in the car. And then I join in and defend council. Oh, wait a second, that's a little bit much care. And then Sherry's, you ever had one of these? You kind of start going around, you know. And pretty soon, everybody's kind of torqued at each other, and purple mountains are kind of gone, and you're just driving along like this, getting out of the mountains to go home. You ever had one of those? See it doesn't matter what's happening on the outside So much as what's happening on the inside And that's true of our lives And what the psalmist is saying here in verses 5 through 7 is that even though he couldn't be where he wanted to be Inside his heart he could be And he was with God And I want to take you on this little trip with him, right? And we're going to find some blessings Now, this is the psalm with the most blessed R's in the whole Old Testament. Blessed are those who dwell. Blessed are those who strengthen as you. Blessed, verse 12, is the man who trusts in you. There are other blessings here. What's blessing? Now, this is an overused word, blessing. Well, we get a clue of what a blessing is in verse 11 because he says, For the Lord is a sun and a shield. The Lord bestows favor, grace, and honor, glory. No good thing does he withhold. What are blessings? Really good things. All of God's really good things, really enjoyable, good, anything good is a blessing that comes from him. And I want to show you three unexpected blessings that God's shown me as I've meditated on this verse in my own life and this person's experience and Spirit spoke to me. And they're unexpected. You just don't expect these things as you go on the journey. They're surprises. What's the first one? Well, the first one we see in verse 6. It says, for those who have set their hearts on pilgrims. Literally the word there in verse 5, just for a second, is to cut a path through your heart. Cut a path. Today you come with all kinds of stuff. I don't know what kind of desert you come from or what kind of situation, maybe a party. Life's a party for you. Well, it's easier either in a desert or in a party to get away from God. And he's cut a path through whatever's happening in his life inside his heart for God and is looking to God. And the first thing he encounters, as they pass through the valley of Bika, oh man, what's that? He set his heart on pilgrimage. The first thing he comes through is the Valley of Bika. Well, the Valley of Bika is the Valley of Pain. Valley of Pain. The word Bika, you can get it even from the English context. They make it a place of spring. It sounds like it's a dry place. Well, it is. It's a dry place. In fact, some people think that Bika is a word for a tree, a particular tree that would dwell in a part of Israel where it was very dry and parched. You ever been in a dry place in your life? It might be right now. Sometimes just the common ordinary days. You know, nothing's really happening. It's kind of the flow of the days. The pages go by. It can be a dry place. You know, you haven't had any great new insight from God, no great new experience. It just kind of flows through. Or you can be in a dry place because of pain. Some people think this is about pain. In Psalm 42 and 43, this psalmist is in tremendous pain. In fact, he describes it in one of the verses there in Psalm 42. Tears have been my food day and night. tears have been my food day and night have you ever been in such pain in your life and maybe you are now that the tears have continued to roll day and night and you've actually drank your own tears they've been your food that's the pain that the psalmist has been in and he says that as you go through in his life journey as he's been with God he's been to that place and he said there's something he's learned that those who are setting their hearts on God have learned to make springs out of tears. That God rains down even through the tears and there's something He does as you submit your pain to Him where He begins to fill your life and take your pain and fill your life with His presence. It can happen. It can happen. Now, Christians who are just starting out in the Lord and have had wonderful deliverance and just wonderful meeting with Him are full of joy, don't realize that as you go on the journey, that very quickly you're going to run to Bika. Bika happens. Pain happens. And it doesn't all go away when you meet Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. In fact, the Christian life is all about going what? Through life's pain. Not around it. Not white-knuckling it, through it alone, apart from God, or really going away from God is often going away from community, from others in our pain. So it's going through life with God and with others, facing our pain and going through it. Now, pain doesn't come from God. He does not cause pain. He created this world to be painless, and someday he's going to wipe every tear, and there will be no more pain, and that will be heaven. But we can enjoy now, even as we give to him the pain of our life, whether it's a great past hurt that still causes tears, where there still is healing that's needed. We can continue to offer that up, or a present pain, or just the dull pain of wondering. There's got to be more, God. He can come and move into that place and fill you with his presence and make life an adventure. Sherry, my wife, has grown up with horses. And she had one horse, a young horse, that in its energy ran through the barn one day and ripped open its chest and down to the muscle. And if you know anything about horses, boy, when you get a gash like that, you really worry about it. You know, you just wondered whether that horse needed to be put down. And the vet came out. He said, oh, no problem. He said, what you need to do is hold that horse every day, and for about 20 minutes you've got to wash that wound. Ouch. This was down into the muscle. And that horse is going to not like that at first. We'll give it some painkills at first, but then some ointment. But then you're going to have to do the hard work of washing that until it heals. And she did that for 20 minutes a day for two weeks. that horse was the friendliest most handleable horse you've ever seen. You see, its point of pain became a place for the hand of a loved one to touch. You may never know why it is that something happens in your life that brings pain. We're in a fallen world. That's the best reason sometimes I can give you. We're in a fallen world. And God may never give you a reason why. Job never got a reason why all that stuff happened. You know what he got? God. He got God himself. God poured himself onto Job in that pain. And Job complained and complained. His friends gave him all kinds of reasons. You know, you weren't good enough. You didn't do this. You didn't do your devotions. You didn't go to church. You didn't, you know, on and on until God silenced them. And he said, Job, I'm here. And Job said, I repent in dust and ashes. It's enough. And he showed him his creation. And he opened Job's eyes up as he offered his pain to God, and God filled him up with his presence. So that's the first surprise. The points of pain in your life when you live like this, and you learn to, you know, you go through this journey, you go through Valley of Bika many times, right? And you keep learning to give that to him, and he'll continue to fill you with his presence. Second surprise, good thing, blessing. The second one is found in verse 6. It says, They make it a place of springs, and God covers it with pools. There's the image of God's mercy raining down, His presence raining down into that pain and washing it away. As we go to the cross, and the blood of Jesus, and the Spirit of Jesus washes away our pain as we take it to Him. It says there that they go from strength to strength in verse 7. They go from strength to strength. Now what trip have you ever been on if you've traveled across the country or if you've gone from here to Fargo to the west, that you didn't get through driving and you just wanted to lay on the bed and go, I am bushed. What kind of journey is this? They just keep getting more energy and more energy. And the image here is of getting stronger and stronger and younger and younger. More youthful, more renewed in your energy. As I looked at this, I began to think, and as I looked at some of the commentators, a verse came to my mind. One that many of you know perhaps. Isaiah chapter 40, 28 through 31. Those who wait on the Lord will not grow weary or tired. He's their God that doesn't grow weary or tired. He's eternal youthfulness. It says if you wait on the Lord, you will renew your strength. Your youth will be renewed as the youth of an eagle. Think of an eagle and how it soars. as that power to ride through the winds, the wonderful wingspan. God will give that to you. What is this about? Well, as you learn more and more to trust in Him and to give Him your good times, your bad times, and you live in Him, the life of heaven begins to just get all full in you, and you begin to become a lover, a forgiver, a calm person, a peaceful person. Pretty soon when bad things come your way, you don't become some kind of a monk, you know, just mmm, om, and you have to kind of chase it away by saying it's really not there. No, it's really there, but I can go through this. I've been here before. I've been through the Valley of Bika, and I know now that as I offer to Him, He opens up me and gives me a capacity more and more for His grace, His peace, His love, and His power. Do you know that in your life? I know you do. I know those of you who have walked with Him, you've known that. Do you know that that capacity is there much more than we'd ever ask, imagine, or think? That's what Paul says in Ephesians. He says, I pray that you, the family of man, from whom we derive the whole idea of fatherhood, I pray that the father of the family of man might give to you a faith, and eyes to your heart that Christ might dwell in you by faith. That's John 14, 21 and 23. And that as he dwells in you, you might know the fullness of his love, the width and the height and the breadth and the depth, so that you might be filled with the fullness of God. And then he says, and now that that might happen in the church, beyond what you would ever imagine or ask. That's younger and younger, stronger and stronger. In some other texts, Paul puts it this way. Day by day, 2 Corinthians 4, we die. Our bodies deteriorate, but inside we're being renewed. day by day. In another place, he says we go from glory to glory. Some think that when Paul says we go from glory to glory, he's quoting Psalm 84, verse 7. They go from strength to strength. You see, when you live a life of sin, even if you're young, you start to look really old. Isn't that true? It's true. When you live a life of sin, you know what's happening? You're taking the pain that Jesus took on the cross and wants to take from you the pain of your own sin and the pain of sin of others on you. And you're holding it in. You're white-knuckling it. You're medicating it or trying to escape it. And all that does is what? Delay the pain and make it worse until finally you just go, I'm getting old. This is getting old. Sin is getting old. Going it alone is getting old. Renew me, Lord. Lord, take my pain. Bring the life of your spirit. You know, our world has made an icon of Princess Diana because she has it all. Or she looked like she had it all. Her life tragically ended because she had it all. People chasing her through tunnels. What a tragedy. But she had looks. She had royalty. She had anything money could buy. She had the adoration of people across the world, and yet it wasn't enough. You know who she adored? Some of you know. Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Not your beauty queen. Mother Teresa of Calcutta has this old haggard face when she was here. She's in heaven now. Now she's got that youthful face. She had this old haggard face, but the life of God was so powerful in her that people were drawn to her because she was so open to God, so childlike in her faith. And you know what she did? Something nobody else would do. Her mission, God gave her, was to take the cast-off refuse of society in Calcutta. And if you have AIDS in India, you're gone. Your family just, you know, it's much worse here in the United States or any place. If you have a sickness, if you're old, you're done. Your life's over, and they'll dump you in the street. And she would take these people, and their ministry there still goes on, is to take these dying people, bring them into the house, and I think we even have an AIDS house in Haiti, right? Where they take babies and others who are the dying, the sick, and just bring the ministry of holding. Do you know why Mother Teresa does that? Because she has the life of God in her, and she sees each human being as a divine spark from the eternal life of God. And that's the kind of life that he wants to have flowing from you and me. It's not about our circumstances. It's about what's happening in here and what we're giving to him and having him receive in us. You can get younger and stronger in this journey. And then the third surprise, good thing, is in verse 7 as well. They go from strength to strength. So you imagine on this journey, you go through the Valley of Bika, and you may go through it a few times, but you continue. Instead of getting blown away by that, instead God's renewing you, And he is opening you up in love. If someone's done something to you, you're beginning to learn to love instead of spit back. You're beginning to forgive. You're beginning to be a person who's not only been wounded, but now you're a wounded healer. And it says here that there's a culmination to this journey where you appear before God in Zion. I love that. The word literally there in the Hebrew means that a person finally shows up. When you're in face-to-face presence with God, some contemplatives have called this the beatific vision. And it's the idea that when we finally see God, who he is, he will then, in looking in him, we'll see who we are in our complete loved and being loved state. We will fully be made complete in him. Now we see through a glass darkly, then face-to-face, and then we'll be who he has made us to be. And what is that? Who has he made you to be? he has made you to be a follower of the way a christian one who loves as jesus does one who is more and more maturing in him and and when jesus said be perfect as the father in heaven is perfect the companion text explains that in luke where it says be ye merciful even as your father in heaven is merciful this isn't about some perfection where you can say dear god my anger is under control uh my anxiety is under control my fear is under control some kind of list you know some moral list This is about being a person who in the midst of that stuff, you're growing, you have that stuff, you give it up to God. Yes, you're going to become more peaceful. Yes, you're going to become more calm. That's going to get tested. You're going to go all through life and see the junk come up as you get closer to God. And guess what? The junk, you keep on feeling worse, but you keep feeling better. You find out as you go through life how deep sin is. And even though you grow and you drop off sins, you begin to see the sins of the Spirit that are really there, the pride. That's a big one. Pride. And the really biggest one is just going it alone without Him. That's what got us in trouble in the first place. And as you grow in Him, though, you begin to experience hanging on to Him more and more. And He's going to make you merciful, and He's going to make you dependent on Him. He's going to open you up to God so that like a little child, remember how you first trusted Him when you first came to Him? Or as a child, how you just trusted Him? It's that openness. It's that free fall into his grace and his love that he wants you to live more and more in. And someday when you die, to close your eyes and know that precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints because he's receiving you to himself. And you go, goodbye, I'm going home. I'm going to appear before God. There's a statue in a museum that's beautiful over in France. and it's the statue of God the Father, and he's holding Adam. And Adam has not yet woken. It's just his flesh and blood. His eyes are closed. And he's looking in the eyes of Adam. And the picture is of when Adam has breathed the life of God through the nostrils in Genesis there, that the first thing Adam will see is who? His father's eyes. And he'll know who he is, and he'll know he's loved. We now, in Jesus Christ, die and go to heaven, and we look into the eyes of our Savior, and it says in Revelation that we are going to be so close to him, so intimate with him, he's going to make us who we were always meant to be, and we're given a new name. It's in Revelation 2. Check it out. I can't remember which church Dave preached on it back in Revelation. But it says he gives each person a name known only to that person. That's how close God wants to get with you. That's how intimate he wants to be with you. Are you looking at him? Are you looking at him? You can tell a lot about a person in terms of what they watch, what they spend their time with, what they put their attention to. You know, go to somebody's office, and if they're going to try and be successful, I bet you sometimes there's a dollar in there, right? Their first dollar, you know? It's not bad to have that up there. There's maybe pictures of family. There's maybe a pet. I don't know how many times I've been to the offices of our, and there's a pet, you know, a picture of a pet. You look at things that you love. And that love and knowing something is related in a way. We don't know things by our head. We don't know things that way. We know things, you truly come to know things in the way the Bible talks about, knowing God by loving, that is paying attention to, giving yourself wholly to. You come to know God by continually offering yourself up to him daily, weekly, at worship services, at worship in the morning, at worship through the day. Offer up to Him your failures. Disagree with Him, I blew it, and claim the blood over that. He forgives and cleanses. Invite the Spirit in. Ask Him that He put to death those acts, and that the Holy Spirit would make you an instrument of righteousness, the very limbs of your body, your hands, your mouth, your tongue. And He'll do it more and more. Someday we're going to Him, and we will be perfected as we look into those eyes of Jesus. and we'll be the perfect Keith or the perfect you, but with a new name even, a new name. Well, why wouldn't you want to be on this journey, huh? You know, there's times when I, in my life, just the rain is coming, the autumn rains, the rain is just coming down, and all I've got to do is just play in the rain of God's presence and love, and it's really easy. There's other times when Bika happens to me. because of some of my stuff. As you get closer to God, your stuff's going to come up, and that's good because he wants to purify you. That's what it's all about. He's going to prune you. He's going to teach you to live in him, and he wants good fruit to come, and he's got to get the other stuff out. But as you live in him, I find myself, even when things are just kind of going okay, that there's just this resistance to really free fall into his grace. Do you ever feel that? Just the resistance? And sometimes I think it's just the static of my fallenness. And it is, all right? It's the static of the separation that we're here. We live in this flesh not yet perfected. And God's okay with that. I mean, he gives us every breath every day, all right? He rains grace on us. But I find that there are some resistances that God has opened my eyes to. And they have to do with these unexpected blessings, all right? Because I kind of sometimes want to resist those. The first is that when pain comes into my life, I resist going to God with that pain because I'm really afraid that that pain is going to hurt me so bad that I won't recover. And I have a hard time. I have a fear of change. Pain is all about change. You lose somebody, you've got to grieve it out. If you're disappointed because life is this, you've got to grieve it. You've got to accept it, right? It's change. And God in that change by His Spirit is going to transform you. He's going to make you new. John Orpik has said that it is in the times of pain in our lives when we grow the most. He took a poll and he asked people, when did you grow the most in your Christian life? You know what the number one answer was? A time of pain. It wasn't some great Bible study. It wasn't some great camp experience. It wasn't necessarily some great trip. It was a time of pain when they learned to take that point of pain, open up to God, and he just increased their capacity to be with him. All right? Didn't anybody know why? as children we get younger and younger in the Lord as children as small physical children we were taught to not put our hand on fire right sometimes our parents would put our hand on the burn stove as children of God God wants to teach us in Isaiah it says when you walk through when the fire happens and believe God is not behind the fallenness of the fire that's here on this earth but he takes that fire and through his love he can bring your his presence around you and as you walk through that pain with him, like Daniel and his friends in that furnace, Jesus will appear with you and you will walk through the fire, it says in Isaiah, and will not burn you. The waters will come, but you will not be drowned. And he will take that thing that was meant for evil and make good in you. And he'll put his Shekinah in you even more and he will drive home his love so that you become a garden of his fruit. But still, I don't like change. Second thing I don't like, and this has to do with growing stronger and younger. Growing stronger and younger, being more and more open to God, being like a child means that you are not so much in control. And I like to be in control. I like to know what's going on. I like to know why that bad thing happened. I like to know what's happening. I like to be able to be in control. And as you trust God more and more, it's more letting go. It's more free-falling. I love to pray my day. And there's days when I know I'm going to be with somebody and I say, Dear God, it's going to be hard. And I just ask right now that you'd bathe that time in your spirit. You know, when I get to that place and then I try and pray right before that time, it's amazing what a difference that makes. And when I forget to do that, he's still with me, all right? It's no magic formula. But practicing the presence is quite a powerful thing. Just listen to Paul and the writers of Scripture. They advocate it all the time. Pray in the Spirit at all times. Pray for everyone all the time. Pray for kings. Pray for everyone. You make it as weird as I do, and you go by and you see somebody, and you go, dear God bless you, that person looks like they're in some trouble. And God prompts you to pray or prompts you to pray for a loved one. This happens. And you'll find out later they were in trouble and you didn't know it. The second thing, the sphere of control. My daughter is now, she's giving me permission for all these stories. She is, this one she wants me to tell you. She's learning how to drive. She's just got her permit. And some of you will appreciate it. I wish I had one of those little kiddie wheels on my side with even a brake pedal down on the bottom because it's so hard for me to let her drive my nice truck. But she's doing good, and if she survives all my nervousness and all my interruptions in the car and learns to drive, she'll be lucky if I don't get us in an accident. Well, you know, when God is really in control of our lives and you give up that thing where you have to get in the way and you mess it up, when you go with the flow and you learn to listen to his voice and live in him, you still have a wheel. He wants you on the wheel. And he wants you to ask for things, and he wants you to move and work, and he's gracious and he's merciful. When you turn the wheel this way and it's in his will, you're going to feel the wheel go stronger than you turned it. Wow. Ever had that? When you turn against his will, if you're really sensitive to him, and he's graceful, if you keep turning hard and you bump yourself, he's going to pick you back up. That's the peck, Becca, just go back. I messed the car up. It's okay. But you're going to feel that resistance. You're going to begin to learn what it says in Isaiah. Isaiah says, in quietness and rest. Repentance and rest is your strength. In quietness and trust is your salvation. But you would have none of it. He says, I long to be gracious to you, compassionate to you. I long, the minute you pray to me and ask me to come, I will come. And then you will cast away your idols. This is Isaiah 30. It was up on the screen. Verses 15 or so. You will cast away your idols, and you will hear a voice behind you saying, go this way, no, go that way. No, go this way, go that way. Love, don't speak that word right now. That's not good. You know that's not right. Hold your tongue. Receive that rebuke. Come and meet with me this morning. Oh, this morning you didn't have time. That's okay. I'll talk to you later. It's a relationship. And you just live in it. My third point of resistance is that I resist intimacy. I resist intimacy. and I resist intimacy. That is, I want, I long to be close to God, to appear before Him, to look into His eyes, but I know that I am not so formed in His love that I am able to come. And my resistance is, Lord, are you really going to be okay with me like the way I am today? Are you really going to be okay with me? I had a really good day yesterday and I kind of shined the apple. Hey, I'm really walking in you. And I found I was proud. And I started to get independent of you. Are you okay with that? You know, his smile is so big on you. This psalmist knew that smile. You know, the prayer back in 42 where he said, Oh, Lord God, will you come to me? I'm so downcast. He talks to his soul. He says, Oh, my soul, why so downcast within me? Put your hope in God. He's so down that he can't even talk to God, so he's talking to himself. And he's saying, Put your hope in God. I will yet see his smile. That's what it literally says in Psalm 42. Sometimes things get so tough, we can't see his smile. God knows that, but he still smiles. And my resistance is sometimes I just don't think he's still smiling, and I want to go to him. And I don't want to expose myself to him. When you open yourself up to God, you're going to get his presence, and his presence is like a fire, and you're going to find he's going to touch on things. And, you know, the stuff you felt really guilty about, he's going to say, you know, I didn't care so much about that. I cared about this. And when you begin to be in his presence, you're going to notice other people and go, yeah, I could have told you that a long time ago. And God's going to begin to work in your life. But that intimacy of exposure to the fire of his love where he purifies us, when we run into that love, when we free fall into that love, what a wonderful thing he can do in us. And as we also commune with him but get into community. Because you see, it is when we're running from God, fearing intimacy, That's also fearing being in community with others. Because his most often place of reaching us is through other people. And when we're not in community, we're not underneath the kind of love that we could be and power of love that we could be. So I want to just encourage you today. What's this brought up for you today? What's your fear? Lose your job? Is your fear today of something you've done that God just would not forgive? Or is your fear that you just can't get over this bitterness? What's this thing? What comes up for you? As you wake up in the day, what is present for you? Instead of trying to work your way to God's presence, just bring it to Him and ask Him to show up right there. Ask Him to show up now. Now, so what's the next step on this journey? Okay, now I'm going to switch scenes and then we're going to be done, all right? You would never believe it, but I like to ski. And you don't want to be on the bottom of the hill when I'm coming down because there's a lot of weight going down there. but I love to ski. And the best image I have for living prayerfully in God is going on a black diamond hill that I can handle. Now, my kids love to take me up to these black diamonds that I'd never, you know, and it took me one time, and it was this sheer cliff. Oh, man. You know, I kind of, get out of the way, you know. And I came down over that thing. And skiing is all about controlless control. If you over control, you're going to go down. You've got to learn to go with the, because you're not really doing much, but moving the force of the downhill mountain. And prayers like that. You just bring yourself to the force of God's love, and you just start skiing on your edges. All right? And you go through your day like that. If you're a surfer, and you don't surf in Minnesota, I've met some of them in California last service. This is hanging 10 over the edge of the board. If you're a skydiver, this is just jumping out and free-falling. All right? If you're a bungee jumper. And what you need to do is just, you know, I'd even say go buy the Orper book, but don't read the Orper book. Ask God to read your heart. And go to Him and ask Him to fill you with His love. Free fall today. Let's bow for a word of prayer. As we close, let's stand. And the altar team is going to come forward. And if you want to pray today, they will bring you into God's presence, help you as you come into community and in communion. And he'll meet you. Let's pray. Dear Jesus, we thank you for your wonderful, wonderful word and how it frees us up. I pray now today on your people freedom. Freedom to free fall into your love. Even out of a boring time, Lord, bring the joy of the simple things, of being present for others in just simple joy. Lord, bring the joy to those who are in some kind of prison now. You do your best work in prisons, Lord. Help them to turn that pain to you. And Lord, if there's those in a party, we just pray that you just continue to keep them rejoicing in you and that others might see you. And Lord, more and more you would gather into your kingdom those who will appear before you in your perfect love. We ask this in Jesus' name. Amen.
