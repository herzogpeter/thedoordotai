As we return this morning to our study in the Ten Commandments, what we've been referring to as the Ten Great Words for Life. Keep this in mind. These commandments were delivered to already redeemed people, not as a means by which they could be saved. That was never the purpose of the Ten Commandments, but rather as a guide to show these already redeemed people how they could live and flourish in the freedom that God had already given to them. The ten great words are these, my paraphrase. Put God first and accept no substitute. Revere God's name, observe his day. Honor your parents. Don't kill intentionally. Limit sex to marriage. Don't steal. Don't lie. Don't enviously desire what doesn't belong to you. Today, we're going to focus our attention on the third commandment, revere the name of God. The text renders it this way, verse 7. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. I'd like to pray as we begin. Father, I pray in Jesus' name that as we consider today your name, and what it means to reduce it, that we would in this place not do that. And by your spirit, through this teaching, your name would be magnified. And by magnify, I do not mean like a microscope that would attempt to make something small look big, but more like a telescope that would empower us to somehow bring close to us something that is infinitely unable for us to comprehend. Magnify your name through this word in Jesus' name. Amen. We will be helped in understanding this commandment when we understand some of the meanings of the words involved in this. In Hebrew, the word vain, for instance, speaks to worthlessness, nothingness, uselessness. So this commandment could be rendered this way. Don't bring my name to a place where it no longer has any use or worth, meaning or value. This word vanity is the same word Solomon used in Ecclesiastes when he determined all is vanity. All these things I've been pursuing to find life are empty. They are void of meaning. They are void of life. Vanity is the word he used. This word has the opposite meaning, interestingly, of the word honor, which is found in verse 12 of Exodus 20. Honor your father and mother. Honor, whatever else it means, refers to something that has weight, influence, and substance. Therefore, the commandment could be rendered, don't reduce my name to something light. Don't reduce my name to bumper sticker cliche, to triviality. Do not reduce my name to a slogan for your cause, to a swear word for your frustration. Why? Well, beyond the obvious fact that this is God we're talking about, and he is worthy of more than respect, he is worthy of reverence, there is something I want us to see on a very practical level that's of even more serious concern to us, and in fact puts us in some peril. For the name of God reduced to something light, meaningless, and vain undermines the possibility of faith, and it destroys hope. I want you to think about how that could be. How could that be? How is that? Well, it's as simple as this on a human level. If every time I heard your name, it came to me in the context of derision, sarcasm, ridicule, and condescension. Oh, yeah, he's kind of a good guy, but he's not too bright. The very opposite could be true of you. You could have substance. You could be brilliant. I could benefit greatly by relationship with you and drawing from you advice. But the word on you that I've always heard has been sarcastic. Not even any proof, just, oh, he's an idiot. That kind of attitude, I promise you that I would not be likely if I believed the impression I was getting about you when your name was mentioned, I would not be likely to consider seriously your opinion, influence, or benefit when it came to any serious issue of my life, my family, my career, or my future. Why? Because you're a joke. I mean, you may be a nice person, but you're a lightweight, you're a cliche. You may be nice, but you are irrelevant to any real issue of life, and when I've got problems, I need to talk to somebody, I need to go to somebody who's got some substance, who might actually have some help and hope. You have no credibility, no authority. Why on earth would I care about your opinion if the word on you is lightweight, irrelevant? Why on earth would I listen to your call, consider your benefit? The fact is I wouldn't. Here again, in that context, the commandment. Don't reduce my name to uselessness. Do not reduce my name to a slogan for your cause or a swear word for your frustration. Why? Because at its ultimate level, where it affects human beings, it undermines faith. By eliminating the possibility that in that name that has now been reduced, there might just be life, hope, help, healing, strength, wisdom, power, and redemption. Life, help, and hope found in God, in Jesus? Just even saying it that way. Jesus? That name's a joke. That name's a swear word. That name is irrelevant. I am going to have to look somewhere else. And people do in droves. By the way, I really do believe that behind all of this reducing of the name of God to triviality, that has been happening since the foundation of the world, that it is indeed a demonically empowered spirit of blasphemy at work. That might sound extreme to some of you. I believe that it is a very real spiritual force at work in the world, at work in the church, whose job it is to demean the name of God, to diminish our view of God, and thereby eliminate the possibility of faith in God, hope in God. So that now, as Dallas Willard observes in his book, The Divine Conspiracy, and I quote, very few people today find Jesus interesting as a person or of vital relevance to the course of their actual lives. He is not generally regarded as a real-life personality who deals with real-life issues, but rather is concerned with some feathery realm other than the one with which we must deal and deal with now. Frankly, he is not taken to be a person of much ability. End quote. Why? Because the name of God has been reduced. It has been taken in a vain way that has rendered the name of God among us as useless, as worthless, as having lost its meaning. What I'd like to do this morning is examine briefly ways that I believe we, without knowing very often, reduce the name of God, bring it to worthlessness. I thought of three. I'm sure there are more. The first I thought of was this, that we bring the name of God to uselessness with mindless overuse. Let me clarify something about that. Overuse is not the problem. The people of God cannot call on the name of the Lord too many times. The thing I am confronting here, key word, is mindless overuse that reduces the name of God, even among us, to cliche or triviality. And I promise you, if the name of God is reduced to cliche among us, unbelievers who hear our language hear it even more connected with meaningless cliche than you do. Just for a few moments, I want to speak to a specific group, as it were. If you're new in the faith, this probably doesn't apply to you. You haven't been around church long enough to pick up the language. If you're not in the faith, then I doubt very seriously that you reduce the name of God this way. you may reduce the name of God in other ways, but probably not this. This applies more to those of us who've been in the church for many years, maybe even grown up in the church. The fact is this. Among us, there is a kind of Christian subculture God talk. Do you know what I'm talking about? If you've been in the church, you know exactly what I'm talking about. And it can become a kind of babble. No one understands it but us. Indeed, outside the context of the church, it makes no sense. To the ears of unbelievers, ultimately, it reduces the name of God, again, to cliche, to nothing really more than a pattern of speech. I mean, we don't even know why it is. We talk the way we do. It's just this flow of speech. Let me give you kind of an extreme example. I don't know if anybody would actually say this, but I'm pushing the extreme to make a point. It would sound something like this. Well, how you doing, Brother Dave? Bless God, hallelujah, praise the Lord. And I did push it, but I talked to a few people who came up to me after the service, and I said, you said that was an extreme. I know people who put bless God on the end of every sentence they say, bless God. They don't even know what they're saying anymore. I'm not picking on bless God. I'm picking on cliche. I'm picking on mindless usage of Christian cliche that we don't even know what it means anymore. people think you're weird you think you're spiritual but with the mindlessness of it the name of God is brought to meaninglessness even by those of us who honestly love that name this is not an intentional thing it's something we slip into with what I think is a Christian subculture it's brought to nothing it's reduced to cliche every time I close my prayers I say in Jesus name amen sometimes when I close my prayer I am engaged with what that means what that means is that everything I've asked for and everything I've brought to the Father I have brought in the name of Jesus and because of that I have confidence that he will hear it is an incredibly potent thing to say amen simply means let it be I agree with you God but an awful lot of times and Jesus, I'm not, you know, and I'm not confronting everybody who's going to get all self-conscious about how they pray now, they're not saying Jesus' name but basically it's kind of become for me sometimes just the way, I might as well say 10-4, rubber deck, we're done, you know I have no idea what I'm saying it's just a way to sign off think, you know what, this is a little work This isn't going to hurt you any. To think about some of the language that mindlessly we get into turns the name of God to cliche wouldn't ever mean we adore the Lord. But it reduces the name of God to cliche. Don't do that. Ecclesiastes 5.1 says, Guard your mouth as you go to the house of God. Draw near and listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools. Think about what's flowing out of your mouth. See, we just think it's swearing. We'll get to the profanity thing. We're going to get to the profanity thing. But we can offer the sacrifice of fools without profane words, with mindless words. Mindless words is the sacrifice of fools. For they do not even know that they are doing evil. Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth, therefore let your words be few. one way to reduce the name of god is with mindless overuse another is when we use the name of god for personal manipulation this one does damage it's when i attach god's name to my opinion and use his name to get you to do what i want now i will tell you it's god who's telling me to tell you this but it really has nothing to do with god it's something i want you to do and i just attach God's name to make you do it. It's called spiritual manipulation and it reduces the holy name of God to your agenda. It's evil. Making it much harder, quite frankly, for people to go toward this name of God in faith and hope and trust unguarded. You know why? Because if you have been manipulated by someone who used God's name to get you to do something they wanted, if that's ever happened to you, you're going to be guarded around the name of God. So you're going to go to church and you're going to hear somebody talking about God, and you're going to have your guard up the whole time. And you're even going to have a hard time letting the real voice of God in. You know why? Because you've been manipulated. Why did that happen? Because the name of God was reduced to your agenda. That is taking the name of the Lord in vain. It's taking it to your agenda. Now, one of the most obvious ways that we do this is when prophetic gifts are abused. Let me make something clear as I go into this. We at Open Door believe that God speaks prophetically to and through people today. We believe that the prophetic gifts are for today. We believe that God gives words of knowledge for the building of the body. But in the hands of immature, unstable, controlling people, this same dynamic can be very dangerous and extremely hurtful. The truth is this. Some of the most confusing, hurtful words that have ever come to me from anyone else, and I can pretty much promise you, the same is true of you. The most confusing, hurtful words, words from God that ever came to you, came from people. And this was interesting. This is kind of just kind of something I've noticed over years. came from people who were often otherwise very timid and shy, but who discovered somewhere along the line that, you know what, if I attach the name of God to my opinion, which I normally would never give because they're timid and shy, but if I attach God's name, I'll get a herring. And so they dump their load. They drop their bomb. And what their bomb is has to do with something that they have decided is your secret sin or how they think you should be handling this or that or what you should be doing when, in fact, the secret sin that they think they're exposing because they've got a word is really generated not by God but simply by the fact that they don't like you very much. And you're put in this extremely awkward, painful situation that if you disagree with them, it's not them you're disagreeing with. Who are you disagreeing with? You're disagreeing with God. Now you've got a lot of work to do. And if you disregard what they say, you're not disobeying them. You're disobeying what? God. And all the while, they're protecting. Well, it wasn't me. It wasn't my idea. It was God gave me a word for you. Here's the word. I'll give you a word. Don't you dare use the name of God to manipulate people to do your agenda. Don't you dare do that. Be very, very careful about what you say God said. In Ezekiel chapter 22, verse 28, God was speaking through the prophet Ezekiel to the prophets of Israel with a scathing rebuke. And what they were doing, among other things, was this. They see false visions and divine lies, saying, Thus saith the Lord when God has not spoken. Be very careful, because what that's called is taking the Lord's name in vain. It's taking it into your personal agenda. And it reduces the name of God to nothing. It reduces the name of God to fear for some people. And for that kind of manipulation and, quite frankly, abuse, some people have a hard time ever getting to God because whenever they hear the name of God, they're getting ready to get manipulated. I'm running away. Sometimes pastors do it to get people to give a certain amount of money, to get people to serve in a certain area of ministry, to get people to go to some kind of meeting that maybe they're afraid enough people won't show up at. And so they kind of put on this spiritual pressure. God kind of told me that you're supposed to give this. I don't know why, whenever I put on this southern voice. And I'm sure there's something about that. I've got to get into therapy about that. anyway and the problem is is that if you don't give the amount of money that he just told you god told him you're supposed to give and if you don't serve in the area he said god told him you're supposed to serve in and if you don't go to the meeting yada yada yada you're not just blowing off the pastor which by the way is kind of hard to do i mean if i collared you and said you know You could say no to me, but I think it'd be kind of hard. That's why we just let God tell you. But I tell you what, if I had God's name to that, and you blow it off, now you're blowing off God. So you can't even stay home. You can't even stay home without feeling like, God, you're an absolute disobedience. Let me tell you what's really wrong with that and how it fleshes out in people's lives. Because, see, it really destroys the work of the Spirit. See, we think we're getting people to do all this stuff and things are growing, but the truth is, before you know it, you're doing all sorts of things, supposedly for God, that you don't really want to do. And God, quite frankly, never even told you to do it. And the worst part of it all is this, that listening to the legitimate promptings of the Spirit of God is something that's totally lost on you. You know why? Because you've never done anything that was in response to the Spirit's voice. You've always been manipulated by somebody else who used God's name to get you to do what they wanted you to do. Thou shalt not take God's name to do your agenda. It's taking the Lord's name in vain. Some people use God's name to gain trust. And by the trust secured, then defraud. It's called, again, manipulation. Sounds like this. I swear to God, as God is my witness, you can trust me. And by that, borrowing God's name, swear to God to affirm to you that I'm telling you the truth, you put down your guard. And quite frankly, the person who's using God's name to get you to put your guard down is somebody you ought to have your guard up around. don't you dare use my name says the lord to mask your lie so you can defraud people that is what it means to take the lord's name in vain back matthew 5 34 jesus says don't make vows at all don't do this i swear don't don't don't get all big and blustery to try to convince us that what you say is true. Just let your yes be yes and let your no be no talk straight. Third thing we do to reduce the name of God is when we use it for profanity. Sadly, this may be the example with which we are most acquainted. The name of God is reduced to a curse. We hear it at the movies. It's often on TV. We hear it at work, school, and everyday conversation. I promise you that after the sermon, in fact, as I was preparing the sermon all week long, because I was thinking about this, I heard it everywhere I went, more than I normally do, which tells me I'm numb to it myself. But I promise you, if you go to a movie this afternoon, whatever movie you go to, you're going to hear this all week long. It's going to be more than normal. And that's good. so common is this that i am quite convinced and this might help you with people who are using this language that those who do use it often in fact most of the time do not mean any direct disrespect to god they're consciously thinking of a way that they can blaspheme the name of god and drag it in the mud it's just become for them a figure of speech just sometimes like our god talk becomes for us nothing more than a figure of speech. Their profanity around the name is just that as well. I am not saying that that all of a sudden doesn't matter. But they're not thinking about what they're saying. The Lord's name is profaned sometimes to show surprise, disgust, or pain. You hit your finger with a hammer. And it's God damn it. You get frustrated and it's, Jesus Christ. Does that kind of just make you cringe when I talk like that? It ought to. Jack Hayford tells a story of a time he brought his car into a mechanic and he waited for his car and he was in a place where he could hear the guy working on his car, just probably a gas station in the work area was over there. And the guy used that curse, cursing God's name, several times as he was working on his car. And he didn't know what to do. And, you know, you don't want to confront everybody who says that. And you don't want to understand. And yet he saw that he had come to know this guy a little bit and develop a relationship in some measure of respect between the two. And Jack just kind of meekly said, you know, I really had a hard time when you were saying, God damn, my car. I'd really like, God, not to damn my car. I'd like it to run for a long time. oh I'm really sorry I didn't mean to offend and Jack Hayford said it's really not about offending me I'm kind of worried about you I'm kind of worried about you just this loose use of that holy name I think you need relationship with somebody to talk like that I'm not giving you freedom to everybody you run into at the Burger King and away I'm from church you know spare us all from that. It is interesting, however, that we live in a culture that in recent years has become obsessed with language that is politically correct. It started as a good thing. We can't live as a civilized society that tolerates ethnic slurs. We have, right now, in our culture, strong social convention against sexism and racism, and that's good. We have strong negative reactions to any kind of demeaning language toward people with disabilities, and that is good. But like many good things, it sometimes gets a little crazy, and the whole politically correct language has gotten pretty crazy. We have a little politically correct police telling us what we can say and what we can't say, so that now we have inter-office memos, even at open door, informing us that Mark Johnson is not really bald, he's follically challenged. and he feels so much better just the lack of respect is anyway what's sadly ironic however in all of that is this that you can blaspheme the name of god you can reduce his name to a curse and no one bats an eye our social conventions don't go there and there's something maybe inside you that goes, I think this is right this is right, we shouldn't do it but I think you're making a big thing out of nothing but hear this you see, I believe over time over time, you hear it and you hear it and you use it the effect of that demeaning in our culture, maybe not in your heart but in our culture of reducing the name of God is to undermine faith, confidence and hope in that very name. For the name of God has become, in our culture, a cliche. It becomes a joke, a swear word, a way to express frustration or surprise. He may exist, but he's irrelevant. No credibility, no authority, no real competence. Why on earth should I care about what Jesus thinks? Why would I care about his opinion? Why would I listen to his call? Why would I consider his benefits to me? I won't. Dallas Willard, again, in his book, Divine Conspiracy addresses all of this with these words. It is not possible to trust Jesus or anyone else in matters where we do not believe him to be competent. We will not pray for his help or rely on his collaboration in dealing with realities of life if we suspect he is not capable. Not capable. Let's talk about capable, says Willard. Goes on with his quote. at the literally mundane level. Jesus Christ, I want to talk about competence, he knew how to transform the molecular structure of water and make it wine. Sounds competent to me. That same knowledge allowed him to take a few pieces of bread and a few little fish, feed thousands of people. He knew how to transform the tissues of the human body from sickness to health and from death to life. He knew how to suspend gravity, interrupt weather patterns, and eliminate unfruitful trees without a saw or axe. Today we think of people as smart who can make lights, light bulbs, who can make computer chips and rockets out of stuff. He made the stuff. Jesus. Jesus is not just nice. He is brilliant. And he is now supervising the entire course of world history while simultaneously preparing the rest of the universe for our future role in it. Think about this. In spite of what I do believe has been, from the beginning of the foundation of the earth, a demonically empowered effort to reduce the name of God to nothingness, God, through Christ, amazingly, still stands, in the words of Albert Einstein, as the luminous Nazarene. Along with two thieves, he was ignominiously executed by the authorities 2,000 years ago. And yet today, from countless paintings, statues, and buildings, from literature and history, from personality and institution, from profanity, popular song, and entertainment media, from confession and controversy, from legend and ritual, Jesus still stands quietly at the very center of our contemporary world. Why? Why has he mattered so much? Why does he matter now? Why does Jesus continue to appear on the front covers of leading magazines 2,000 years after he died? Why is it that multitudes, even today, even in this room, credit him with their very life and trust in him with their entire future? Why? Well, let's let the words of one of the greatest preachers I have ever heard, S.M. Lockridge, tell us why his name still stands. Because Jesus, Lockridge says, is unparalleled and unprecedented. He is the centerpiece of civilization. He is the superlative of all excellence. He is the sum of human greatness. He is the source of divine grace. He is the wellspring of wisdom. He is the doorway of deliverance and a pathway of peace. He is the roadway of righteousness. He is the highway of holiness. He is the gateway to glory. He is the all-sufficient king. He is the king of the Jews. He is the king of Israel. He is the king of righteousness, and he is the king of the ages. He is the king of heaven, and he is the king of glory. He is the king of kings, and he is the lord of lords. There is no gauge to measure his limitless love. There is no barrier to block his blessings outpoured. He is enduringly strong. He is entirely supreme. He is eternally steadfast. He is immorally faithful. He is imperially powerful, and he is impartially merciful. I wish I could miraculously describe him to you, but he is indescribable. He is incomprehensible. He is invincible. He is irresistible. You can't outlive him, but you can't live without him. The Pharisees couldn't stand him, but they found they couldn't stop him. Pilate couldn't fault him, and Herod couldn't kill him. Death couldn't conquer him, and hell could not hold him. He's not done. He's the Alpha and the Omega. He's the first and the last. He's the God of the future and the God of the past, and we rise to speak his name, Jesus, again and again and again, for he is the source of life, and that is why you shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. Thou shalt not reduce it to uselessness, to triviality, to a slogan for your cause, to a swear word for your frustration. Why? Because it undermines faith. It destroys hope. Why? Because it eliminates the possibility in the minds of millions of people that just maybe in that name that you have reduced, there is life and power and truth and hope. Thou shalt not. I think I've made it clear that when the name is reduced, faith is undermined. But do you know that the opposite is true as well? when the name is revered, taken not in vain, but taken in faith, simple faith, maybe even weak faith, but taken in faith, that that name is a name that releases faith, that releases healing, that releases life. Don't take the Lord's name in vain. Okay, so let's not. Right now. Instead, right now, let's take that matchless name, invoke it, call upon it in faith. Let's take it in hope, in reverence, and love, and let's take it for whatever it is you need right now. What is it that you need right now? Take that name for your healing. Take that name for your hope. Take that name for your salvation and your deliverance, for power and courage to face the weak you have ahead. Take it for life. Take it for wisdom. and what I believe we need to do is take that name right now for healing, hope, saving, deliverance, power, courage, life, and wisdom. I'm going to ask the worship team, Mark, to come. I'm going to ask the altar team to take their place in front even as we begin to sing. As we invoke the name of God, the name of Christ, which is above every name, Believe that as we invoke that name, call on that name, take literally that name in faith. He will among us be who he is. Healing, saving, delivering, empowerment. Stand as we call upon the name of the Lord. When the name of God is reduced, faith is undermined. Keep in mind, the opposite is true as well. For if I be lifted up, I will draw people to me. And when they come, I will give them grace, and I will give them healing, and I will give them hope, and I will impart to them life. So as you go through the rest of your day and into this week, invoke the name of God. Call on the name of the Lord. And take that name in faith. And take it in love. And take it in reverence. And take it for what you need. God bless you as you leave. In Jesus' name. And all God's people say, amen.
