Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Well, today is the fourth Sunday of Advent, and we've lit the candles of hope. And love. And peace. And so today we light the fourth candle. The candle of stress. No. In the face of stress we light the fourth candle. The candle of joy. And yes. Joy is kind of defiant. In this season sometime, no matter what your circumstance may be, when we light the candle of joy, we're talking about something bigger than circumstances. And it occurs to me that joy maybe is a lot like breathing. Because maybe you can't possess joy. Maybe you just take in as much as you can. But then you've got to give it out. you breathe it in and you breathe it all out and that results in joy to the world amen let's do this reading together loving God we open ourselves to you trusting that this is how you made us you created us for joy filled hearts and lives. Show us the creative power of hope. Magnify your love within us. Teach us the peace that comes from justice. And fill us with a kind of joy that cannot be contained but must be shared. Prepare our hearts to be transformed by you that we may walk in the light of Christ. Amen. I have a word to bring just real briefly kind of invite you into something with us just before we go to the offering it's been a weird couple of weeks relative to weather actually no big mystery to you a couple of weeks in November and then last week we pretty much got snowed out Saturday night we had to call the services off and we had them on Sunday and there were about 15 of you and that was great we had a wonderful time but at the end of the day what that does is it kind of, not kind of, but it really has kind of put us in this, whoa, we weren't expecting this in terms of kind of a financial hit around that kind of thing. And Sandy Lubrant was, we were talking about this and she kind of likened it to you're kind of going home from work on a Friday night and in your mind you're kind of reflecting on the week, but you're also kind of planning ahead and you're thinking of what are you going to do that night and maybe what are you going to do on Saturday. And then on the way home you hit a patch of ice and all of a sudden and you're in a ditch, and all of a sudden your plans change. You're not going to be watching TV that night. You're going to be calling a tow truck and an insurance company and all that kind of stuff. And what's weird is that these weather things that hit a church like ours is like us hitting a patch of ice. And I wouldn't quite say we're in a ditch, but it's like unexpected. And all of a sudden, some of the things we were kind of expecting and anticipating, it's looking a little different now. Every year, this time of year, we talk about year-end giving, And we kind of gear things up and really needing to catch up a lot of times at the end of the year. And we always do. And this year is a little different because of that weather thing. Just to kind of put some perspective on it, the month of December, we needed $690,000. That's right. And that's an enormous amount of money. But that's kind of consistent with years in the past, and it's consistent with the year-end push. But this year, partly because of the weather, we're at around $120,000. So we're going, whoa, what does this mean? What's this going to look like? And so inviting you in, this is all we know how to do is tell you and invite you into it. And one of the things that occurred to me is I was just sitting over here thinking about how to tell you this. And what dawns on me is to enter into something like this. These kinds of things don't get dealt with by kind of reaching in your pocket, saying, what do I got? For this to happen, it's like, Dave, do you know what you're asking him for? You're asking for sacrifice. This is like, this is going to be intentional. This will be sacrificial. This will, for this to happen, people would have to go, okay, we're not going to do that. We're going to do this. We're not going to go there. We're going to go there. And you know what I think? I think that's asking a lot. And so I want you to ask God about this kind of stuff and where we go with this. And I had another, one other thought about this. A couple weeks ago, I was sitting up here with Steve, and we were talking about our 30th year here, my 30th year here, along with Bonnie. And one of the questions was, how do you do 30 years? And here's one way you do 30 years, just like this. It's in ours. It's in ours. It all belongs to God. So Holy Spirit, come. So Holy Spirit, come. Into all of our hopes and fears, some of them small, some of them big, some of them about our whole community, some of them about our own individual lives, and we invite you into all of it with faith and trust in you because you are all about joy, joy to the world. Bless this offering. Those who give, we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Come, thou long expected Jesus, born to set thy people free. From our fears and sins release us, let us find our rest in thee. Israel strength and consolation Hope of all the earth thou art Dear desire of every nation Joy of every longing heart Born by people to deliver Born a child and yet a king Born to reign in us forever, now thy gracious kingdom bring. By Thy own eternal spirit, rule in all our hearts alone. By thy all-sufficient merit, raise us to thy glorious throne. It was the first Christmas ever. And as most of you know, one of the first Christmas messages that first Christmas morned begins with these words. In Luke chapter 2 verse 10. Don't be afraid. I love that. In the middle of all our hopes and all our fears. Don't be afraid, said the angel. For I bring you good news of great joy, which shall be for all people. Which shall be for all people. Joy. So it is on this, the fourth week of Advent, we're going to talk about joy and about how when the good news of great joy is really understood and entered into an experience, embraced, and then lived out, it can have a reproductive effect. that kind of multiplies itself as it ripples out and eventually touches more than just a few. For this good news of great joy is actually designed by God to somehow, someway be for all people. It raises this question, how does this good news of great joy get to and have some kind of effect on all people? Actually, it happens lots of ways. While there are a number of places we could go this morning and stories that I could tell, to illustrate the reality of this kingdom dynamic. The one I've chosen, actually, is a parable that came to my mind a couple weeks ago when Steve, in dealing with the Advent theme of love, told what he referred to as a love story. It was a love story that was kind of revealed to us in a parable that Jesus told in Matthew 20. And I just thought that if Steve can take a parable that on the surface doesn't seem to fit the Advent theme at all and make it fit, then so can I, so here we go. Because this is a contest, actually, anyway. Actually, the parable that Steve told a couple weeks ago out of Matthew 20 was a parable designed to do what a lot of parables that Jesus told were designed to do, that is, among other things, to try and reveal to people the face of God and to do it to people who had developed, for whatever reason, a distorted view of God, thereby answering this question that a lot of people ask, even though they don't ask it out loud, The question that sometimes just stirs in the soul of people is what kind of God is God? And as it turns out, he's the kind of God, at least according to the parable in Matthew 20, who doesn't stay distant and detached. He's way up in heaven someplace because he's the kind of God who gets up off the couch. Remember, that was Steve's phrase and was kind of the centerpiece of that whole talk because in the parable, it was the landowner who got up off the couch and acted. Even though he didn't have to, and even though historically most landowners in Jesus' day would not have gotten up off the couch, this one did. Because as Steve made clear, this particular parable was a love story. Whose job it was to reveal to us what love looks like and what love does. Because love, particularly the kind that is revealed to us in God through Christ, gets up off the couch. It acts. And it sees what other people don't see. that's what love looks like. That's what love does. That's what God does, particularly sees people that other people don't see, thereby giving dignity where others see none. And all I could think of a couple of weeks ago, not only as Steve spoke, but as we as a community were given opportunities ourselves to kind of, even on that weekend, you remember this, to kind of tangibly get up off our proverbial couches that Sunday afternoon, that Sunday morning. And all of us acts through the global marketplace. Remember that thing that was set up out there? The response from you was amazing. Over the last several weeks, Project Homeless Connect, many, many people involved. I was told the day they did that, it was the coldest day of the year, and we did it anyway, and I'm really glad. Hands-on serving environments. We had the posting of needs out there in the gathering place. There was this tree, and all of these needs were posted, anything we could think of. And one of the things that kind of stunned us was the level of need in our own body, and every single one of those needs were taken and met from mattresses that kids needed to sleep on to cars that people needed to drive and things were happening and it was incredible and all I could think of when I heard Steve Sermon and heard these stories a couple weeks ago was that not only does getting up off the couch like that reveal love you know what else it does it produces joy the product listen that's These two talks, these two themes of Advent are incredibly connected because authentic love, the kind that is revealed to us in God through Christ, the kind that gets up off the couch and acts, produces joy all over the place, inexpressible and full of glory. So don't be afraid. Don't be afraid for I bring you good news of great joy, good news, the euangelion, that is the gospel of great joy because when this good news of great joy is really understood and entered into experience and embraced and begun to be lived out, it has a reproductive effect. It has a ripple effect that ripples out beyond just a few because this good news of great joy is designed by God to somehow, some way, be for and affect all people. It's joy to the world. and the people and the parable i've chosen that i think speaks to this in maybe an unexpected way much like steve's did a couple weeks ago was found in luke chapter 10 very familiar parable to all of us we're going to take a little different angle on it today than maybe you've heard before but the parable begins with a religious leader an expert in the law approaching jesus and he asks Jesus this question in Luke 10 verse 25, a very theological question. He asks him basically this, teacher tell us, how do I inherit, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? And Jesus in his classic rabbinic style answers his question with another question by saying this, well what does the law say? How does it read to you? And the expert in the law says, well here's what I know from the law. The law says love the Lord your God with all your heart, your soul, with all your strength, with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself, to which Jesus says, good answer, A plus, do that and live. But then in true rabbinic style again, the expert in the law asks another question, who is my neighbor? Now, on one hand, that question might seem like an innocuous question. It might seem like a logical question. As the course of this conversation goes, that would logically maybe be the next question. But the fact is this, this who is my neighbor question is a loaded question. Because among the rabbis in Jesus' day, there was this running debate about this issue. And the background on this debate is found in Leviticus. Because in Leviticus is the first place, Leviticus is the first place you find this reference to loving your neighbor. The text says this, Leviticus 19 verse 17 says this, do not hate your brother in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor, frankly, so you will not share his guilt, but do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord. And I am the Lord means, and I'm not kidding. That's what that basically means. So everybody's looked at that and they kind of heard the I'm not kidding part. And so they took it very seriously and said, among other things, well, obviously my brother is my neighbor because my brothers in the text in Leviticus and our people or people like us are our neighbor because they're in the text but after that there actually was kind of a debate and people would go back and forth there were questions like what about a convert I mean our people the Jews the people who believe the right thing we know that they are our brother so but what about converts what about people who weren't our people and now they're kind of our people and there would be debates about that people would go back and forth. Some of the rabbis would say, yes, of course converts to this new faith are our neighbors, because now there are brothers, and brothers are in the text. Others, rabbis, a little more hard line, would say, no, I can't be that inclusive. But while that debate raged around this who is my neighbor thing, there was no debate among the rabbis about who wasn't the neighbor. Because while there was a debate among some, most of the rabbis, the vast majority of rabbis knew that there were some people who weren't our neighbor because a Gentile wasn't, under any circumstances, my neighbor. A pagan wasn't, and a heretic wasn't, under any. No debate about that. One rabbi actually quite bluntly said it this way, if Gentiles be in any danger of death, we are not bound to deliver them. Such a one is not our neighbor. So the question this guy's asking, That kind of puts a little different spin on this. It's a lot more loaded than it looks on the front end, and it's clearly designed to at least kind of on one level just kind of find out where Jesus is at, but also it's designed to maybe get him in trouble because where Jesus lands on this who is my neighbor question, this debate will reveal to some of the people listening to him whether he's one of us or whether he's not, whether he's in or whether he's not, whether he's okay or whether he's not. And to answer the question in true rabbinic style, Again, Jesus tells a story. A story that, depending on how he tells it, could get him in a whole lot of trouble. Indeed, it's going to get him in some trouble with some people because he's going to spin this thing in a way that most people wouldn't expect. But to understand the spin he's really putting on it, even before I tell you the story, let me explain some things kind of behind the scenes structurally about this story that will help you kind of see the thing that Jesus really is spinning here. Because in Jesus' day, these kinds of stories that he was about to tell were circulated widely. And all of them had a kind of structural dynamic, which was actually known at the time as the rule of three. These stories were all the same, at least this kind of story. There were these rule of three stories. And the rule of three was this, that there were always three main characters in the story, and it always kind of went the same way. So the first character would come into one of these rule of three stories and he would do something. It wouldn't matter what he or she would do. The behavior might be different. The rule would be that the first character would come and do something. The second character then in this rule of three rhythm would come and do the same thing. And the fact that he would do or she would do the same thing would be setting a pattern. But the pattern is a setup for the third character who comes along and does something different. So somebody comes and says something or does something, somebody else comes and does the same thing, and you're kind of wading into that. The third person, and it's almost like if you know these rule of three things, you're kind of waiting, what's going to be the joke here? What's going to be the weird thing here? They do a different thing, and the different thing they do is the point. And if it's a joke, the different thing they do is the punchline. Fact is, you're probably thinking of this already, we have rule of three jokes that people tell. See, this has been around for a very long time, you know, where a blonde and a brunette and a redhead walk into a bar. You know, that's the rule of three. When the redhead said something and then the brunette says something and they say the same thing and then the blonde comes along and she says something stupid. Sorry. I said I wasn't going to do that today, but I did. But you know the drill. When you hear the rule of things, it was weird. I got a call yesterday. This is true from a friend of mine. His name is Jeff. He's called me from California. And he's one of these guys. I don't know if you have people in your life like this. They don't even say hi. I just pick up the phone and he goes hey Dave I got a joke and he starts telling me the joke and he goes there's these three women and I'm sitting about hearing about the rule of three and he goes honestly he goes there's these three women and they went to high school and now they're going to have a reunion they're all 50 years old and they come to the reunion they haven't seen each other for a long time and the one woman is all dressed to the nine she's all dressed up and had her hair done the second woman is all dressed up got her hair done and the third woman is in blue jeans and a t-shirt and I'm going this is a rule of three and the whole joke he told me was very bad and I can't No, it's very funny. Anyway. No, I hated it. Anyways, it was all about the spin. It was all about the spin. It was all about the rule of three, and I'm going, this has been around a very, very long time. So here's the story. And it's a very familiar story. But what I want you to do with this very familiar story is listen this time for the rule of three. Luke 10, verse 30. Let's read it off the screen. Jesus replied and said to the man, I'm going to tell you a story. Here's the story. A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers. And they stripped him and beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. And by chance, a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. That's the first character. Likewise, Levi, here's the second character. When he came by to the place and saw him, he passed on by the other side. Now, before I read you the story, just kind of dial into this. Everybody listening to this story is able to picture it quite well, because all of them know that there is this 17-mile stretch of land, or road, if you will, that goes from Jerusalem to Jericho, and they know that it's notoriously dangerous in a very narrow valley with hills surrounding it filled with nooks and crannies where thieves could and did hide and then ambush travelers. In fact, this story would be kind of like something that was on the 10 o'clock news. Pretty much every night, it was a bad neighborhood. Everybody knew it, and you're asking for trouble if you go there. Well, this guy does go there, and he does get in trouble. He gets ambushed, robbed, stripped, beaten, left for dead. Now, when the first priest comes by, when the priest comes by, he's the first character in this rule of three. He's probably riding a donkey. We don't know that for sure, but Kenneth Bailey, who wrote the book through a peasant eye, Steve and I both used that book extensively when we were a couple years ago doing this series on the parables, talks about the fact that in all probability, this priest was or might have been riding a donkey, unlike other people who would have been walking. The priest, because he worked for the temple, was a wealthy man and might have been riding a donkey. And seeing the man in distress, he passes on by the other side doing nothing. It raises a question, why would he do nothing? Why didn't he stop to help? Because you wonder about that. And then the obvious answer without going very deep because he's a cruddy character. That's why. Because these rule of three things, we know what's coming, and this first guy and the second guy are a cruddy guy, and the third guy is going to be the hero in these kinds of stories. But the truth is, there were actually a number of reasons why this priest might not stop and help this guy. One, maybe obvious, is that it's a very dangerous road. And kind of going along, he sees this guy beat up, and if I stop to help this guy, what happened to him might happen to me. That's one possibility. Another, more likely, is because he's a priest, And being a priest didn't automatically make him a cruddy guy. There were some other things going on in his mind, possibly, that might have made him keep going on. See, the priest serves in the temple. And he handles the tithes, and he leads the worship, and he offers sacrifices, and he's on his way to do that duty. And to do that duty, he had to be, in those days, he had to be what was called ceremonially clean. And there were a number of things that could make you ceremonially unclean. And if you were unclean, then you couldn't do your job. And so he's kind of being responsible here, maybe. Indeed, rule number one in the written law in those days was this. You could not contact a corpse. And it would make you, if you did, ceremonially unclean. And then he couldn't do his job. And there was a lot of people depending on him to be the priest and lead the worship. Rule number one in oral law was you couldn't contact a Gentile because that would make you ceremonially unclean. And now you can't do your job. So here he is, going down the road. He sees this body in the road that Jesus describes as half dead. It's an interesting reference, half dead. What is half dead? It reminds me of a scene. Maybe you're thinking about yourself in Princess Bride. Remember this? Now, you weren't thinking of that, were you? You were thinking weird stuff. Where the hero Wesley is thought to be dead. Remember that? And so they bring him to Miracle Max, who's played by Billy Crystal. And Billy Crystal says this, oh, no, he's not dead. He's just mostly dead like that. He did it better than me. he's just half dead here's the deal though the rabbis that that that term half dead was actually a technical term describing in their minds the last phase of life just before death so technically this priest could touch this guy but how do you know if he's alive or dead for sure and if he does die while you're trying to help him now you're ceremonially unclean and how do you know if he's a Jew or Gentile. If I touch a Gentile, I'm ceremonial and clean, can't do my job. Or even a Roman. How do you know if he's a Jew, a Gentile, a Roman? Because in those days, one of the ways you knew, and we've talked about this before, because you could often spot the rank of a person by the clothes that they wore. So you could sometimes tell if they were a Jew or a Gentile or a Roman by the clothes that they wore. And by the way, I don't know if you're getting it, but this makes this story kind of genius because all of these things are woven into the story and they mean things because this guy was stripped and naked, so there's no way to tell just by looking at him. This is profound, I think, if he's a Jew or a Gentile, bigger than that. There's no way to tell just by looking at him, is he a good guy or a bad guy? Is he an insider or an outsider? Is he one of us or one of them? Here's what he is. He's just another human being who really needs some help. That's all he is. I mean, it's incredible. The intentionality of Jesus' story here, you can't tell. So who are you going to care about? How do you know? What if they don't deserve it? I mean, what if this guy is a credit character himself? You can't tell. He's a good guy. You don't know if he goes to church. You don't know if he loves God. You don't know if he's a Republican, a Democrat. You don't know anything. He's just a human being in need, so what are you going to do? okay another pattern don't give me another i haven't even told you a story yet i got to give you another pattern again kenneth bailey points this one out again in that book through peasant eyes it's this that each one of these characters in these rule of three stories would do three things so you have a rule of three story which has three characters and each character would do three things because each one of them would number one come you'll see that word over and over in the text number two they would do and then they would go so they would come and they would do and they would go. So you heard it in the text already. Character number one, the priest in this rule of three comes and he does what? Nothing. And then he goes. Second character, the Levite in verse 32, we already read it, comes and he does what? Same thing. Nothing. And then he goes to, so now you have a pattern, but it's really a setup for the third character who's going to come along and do a different thing. And the different thing will be the point. It'll be the punchline. It'll be the surprise. Now, one more thing you need to know before I tell you the story, though I know you know the story, you know the punchline, about stories like this in Jesus' day. Because there were a lot of stories in Jesus' day. This is fascinating for me to discover this. And they were called priest and Levite stories. Priest and Levite jokes, where the priest and the Levite would be the butt of the joke, where they would be the object of sarcastic derision, kind of like, well, blonde, you know, dumb blonde jokes. They're very unfortunate and terrible. And lawyer jokes, you know, those kinds of things. There would be priests and Levite jokes, and they were kind of common because many of the priests in Jesus' day were not highly regarded. They were seen as collaborators with Rome. They worked with the temple that was run by Rome, and they were getting rich off of the oppressive tax system of Rome that was on the temple tax. And these taxes that were making these priests and Levites fabulously wealthy were making almost everyone else in the culture desperately poor. So a priest and a Levite go into a bar. You know, you can just hear the story. A priest and a Levite were walking down the road, and if you hear that priest and Levite story begin, in your mind you kind of go, I heard this one. Here's another one of those priest and Levite stories. You don't know exactly what the spin's going to be, but you know how it will go. So they come, and they do nothing, and then they go, and it's always the same. But another thing that was almost always the same in these priest and Levite stories and priest and Levite jokes was who the hero of the story would be. Because it was almost always, this third character in these kinds of stories were almost always an ordinary person, an ordinary guy, Joe Sixpack, you know, just Joe the plumber kind of person. An ordinary Israelite would be the hero of the story. And they were known, this kind of person. We've talked about this before. We did a lot of this when we were doing the Way of the Rabbis series. They were called the Amharats. Remember that? The Amharats. And literally that word means the people of the land. And the people of the land are just regular people. Everyday folk who were often looked down upon by people in power like the priests and the Levites. And the result of that is these priests and Levite stories. People loved these stories. Because the priests and the Levites were kind of being made fun of, and it just kind of felt good to jab them a little bit. And they, the ordinary folks, were always the heroes of the story. And it's precisely this kind of story that they were hearing and expecting. Ah, we've heard this one before. Don't know how it's going to end. But we know who the hero is, and it's going to be good. So Jesus, when he spins it, is dropping a bomb. When he introduces this third character, not as Joe the plumber, but as a Samaritan. And again, I don't know how to create in you what they must have felt, but there would be like this fud. This isn't a good one. That's funny. Because the most first century Jews, Samaritans, were not only despised as lower class half-breeds, among Gentiles they were the lowest. So just get this, even the Amharats would look down on these people. Not only that, they were their mortal enemies. Indeed, fresh in the memory of most Jews in Jesus' day, when the story was being told was the fact that it was the Samaritans who had defiled the temple by taking the rotting bones of human bodies and throwing them into the temple courts. I mean, seriously, if you had all that stuff running through your mind, just be, don't be the expert in the law who's there kind of examining Jesus. Be somebody listening to the story who's with Jesus, who's for Jesus, who's wanting him to kind of put this expert in the law in his place. Be one of the disciples. As you're listening to this priest and Levite story unfold, instinctively you know how these stories work, so you know where it's going and you're thinking to yourself, this is a great story. I love this story. The audience is going to love it. Jesus is going to score points here. It works every time. So when he introduces the third character as a Samaritan, And again, Jesus, don't you know how to tell a joke? This is not how the story goes. See, we know this story as the story of the Good Samaritan. In fact, even in our kind of cultural lexicon, we talk about Good Samaritans. A Good Samaritan is someone who helps someone on the side of the road. We hear it on the news. There was a Good Samaritan today, and they got beat up because they, whatever, you know. But it wasn't part of their lexicon. Nobody in Israel told stories about a good Samaritan, but Jesus knew exactly what he was doing, and it was very intentional, because now, whatever else he accomplished, now he has their attention. In fact, he has everybody's attention, including those who would see themselves as followers of him. So now that I have your attention, listen carefully to the story again. Because when the priest came, he did three things. Remember, come, do, go. So he came and he did nothing. And then he went. The Levite does the same, thus setting a pattern, which is really a setup for the punchline for the point because the Samaritan came too. He's the third character and what did he do? Well, actually, he did several things. And the fact that he did several things is even in contrast to the priest and the Levite who did nothing. So the Samaritan not only does something, he does several things because first he felt compassion. Look at this on the screen, Luke 10, 32. The first thing he did was feel compassion. And then he came to him and he bandaged up his wounds. That's another thing. Then he poured oil and wine on them. And then he put him on his own beast. And then he brought him to an inn. And then he took care of him. And on the next day, he then took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, take care of him. And whatever more you spend, I will return and I will repay. Go back to the oil and wine thing. Remember, he poured the oil, and he poured the wine on the bandages. You know, that's just kind of part of the story, no big deal. This is fascinating to me because oil and wine, this is all intentional. Jesus is a master storyteller. And the oil and wine were implements of worship in the temple. So this priest who went away and went off to the other side, but then went off to do his priestly duty, which was a very good thing, when he got to the temple, you know what he did, among other things? He poured the oil, and he poured the wine in the temple. and that's a very good thing to do and the oil and the wine would speak to among other things but isn't it weird because the priests of the temple though they pour the oil and the wine and maybe there's some healing that came out of that they didn't really know how to use oil and how to use wine for healing because healing happens when someone goes healing happens when someone does what the Samaritan did. And so the Samaritan came and then he does seven things. I counted. And that's, again, Jesus, that's on purpose. That number is on purpose. Seven things. He felt compassion. He bandaged the wound. He poured the oil and wine. He put him on a beast. He brought him to the inn. He paid the bill. And any more, I will pay that to, let me say it this way. The Samaritan came and then what did he do? Here's what he did. He gave. And he gave. And he gave. And he gave. And he gave. And he gave. And he gave. For God so loved the world that he... Quick, in your mind, remember right now, one of the points of many of these parables, What were the underlying woven in point of almost all of these parables, among other things, was to reveal the face of God. What kind of God is God? He's kind of like this Samaritan. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever would put confidence in his son would come to life. And coming to life would ripple out to others, and that would be joy to the world, because he gave, and he gave, and he gave, and he gave. For though he was rich, yet for our sakes, he became poor that we, through Jesus' poverty, might be made rich. For I came, said Jesus, not to be served, but to serve and to, here we go again, give my life, a ransom for many. So he gave, and he gave, and he gave, and he gave, and he gave, and this is our God, And that is good news of great joy to all people. But it gets better. Because at the very end of this parable, Jesus says to the expert in the law one more thing. Luke 10, 37. Read it. And Jesus said to him, Now you go and what? Do. Go and do. Remember? Come, do, go. Quick question, quick question. Go and do. What if he did? What if this expert in the law heard this and then he did? He began to do. What if he began to give? To have mercy? What if they did? They, by being the people who were listening, because a crowd had gathered around Jesus to hear this story and zing this expert in the law. But what if they quit worrying about zinging the expert in the law? And what if they began to do? What if we did it? Well, actually, I know exactly what that would be if we did it and he did it and those who heard it did it. See, that would be good news. That would be a euangelion of great joy for more than just a few. For when people begin to not only cheer for what Jesus has done and what he has given, but they begin to do the same and give the same, that becomes joy for more than just a few. That becomes joy to the world. So here's the word of the Lord. Go and do. And do, and do, and do, and give, and give, and give, and get up off the couch. Because all of that is joy to the world. You guys, the stories are pouring in. The last two message scenes, we've been kind of marveling with emails coming and stories being told and being gathered in a variety of ways from our church of people. You, who are going and doing. From the global marketplace thing we did, to the project homeless thing that we did, to serving people meals, to serving Maple Grove, to serving Minneapolis, to the needs that we posted. I talked about it earlier, even in this talk. Some of those needs, incredibly serious. All of them met a couple weeks ago, Kim. Remember Kim? She sat up on the stool, and she told her story of how she'd been abandoned by her parents and moved into some incredibly painful things. And she experienced healing, and then she didn't just get healed herself. She began to... I'm spitting a lot. Wow. Sorry. I ruined the whole talk you know what she did she began to go and do herself she began to go and do and out of her doing there emerged this ministry it's in Minneapolis that ministers to young girls just like her and I'm here to tell you that's joy to the world that's joy to the world so here's the word this Christmas morn don't be afraid for I bring you good news euangelion it's the gospel which of great joy which shall be for all people as you go and do and do and do what Jesus did and did and did as we give and give and give the way Jesus gave and gave and gave and that is joy to the world. We're going to sing a couple songs and while we do that, we're going to do something that might feel a little risky. As Dave said, the stories have been coming in over the last several weeks and the stories are incredible. They're humbling. They're challenging. And a couple of things that come out in the story. One is that we have an incredibly generous community of people. That you all, when you hear need, you immediately move towards it to meet that need with each other. It is humbling and it is encouraging and it's the kingdom of God. And the other thing that has come out is that within this community, there's enormous need. There is material poverty in this community that frankly is surprising. And we kind of believe it doesn't have to be. and those two things are coming out in these stories everywhere the generosity to give and the incredible need we have right in this room in our community so here's what we're going to do during this last couple songs if you're somebody that this Christmas you have a little extra cash you have cash on you right now and you've got all the gifts you've got the food, you're ready to go and you just happen to have a little extra, I want to invite you to go to the back and there's baskets in the back. Just throw the cash in the basket. If you don't have cash today, this week I'd encourage you, get some cash, give it to somebody who has need. Just to say, this isn't mine. Then also while we sing, And this is going to take a ton of courage. But if you're a person today that's finding you don't have the money for Christmas. You can't get the kids gifts and we know this exists. You're struggling to figure out how we're going to get enough food. We've heard folks who the kids don't have mattresses and the kids don't have clothes. If you're sitting in that place today and you're a part of us, then we want you to go back. and take money out of that basket. Take as much as you need. It's yours. I would take a lot of courage, but if you're one of those people today, here's what you need to hear from us. This is what the community of God does. This is what the community of Jesus does. We all come here today with all sorts of things that we can give, and we all come with all sorts of things we need. And we're just going to take one little step today to say that in this simple way, a little extra cash for those who have to give and for those who need to receive. So I encourage you to go as we sing and put money back there. If you have it, if you need some, go and take. Take. It's yours. Let's stand and sing together. Joy to the world The Lord is come Let us receive the King Let every heart prepare me to rule And let nature sing And let nature sing And let nature sing Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns Let all the songs employ While fields and floods, but fields and plains Repeat the sounding joy Repeat the sounding joy Repeat, repeat the sounding joy Joy Speak up all the time Overflowing well No tongue can tell Joy Speak up on joy Rises in my soul Never lets me go He rules the world With truth and grace And makes the nations prove The glories of His righteousness One verse of His love And one verse of His love I wish you all It is now Joy Speak of all joy Oh, we're going well No tongue can tell Joy Spirit of joy Rises in my soul Never lets me go Joy Spirit of joy All I'm going well No talk can tell Joy, speak the one joy Rises in my soul Never lets me go Oh, oh, oh. And I keep thinking, all God's people said amen. I think all God's people said, ha! That was great. Okay, a couple of things. Christmas Eve, back here, Friday, time is 4 and 7. I got it right this time. I got it wrong in all the other services. I wouldn't trust me. I would check if I were you. Christmas Eve, 4 and 7. The other thing is, somebody asked me between services, I didn't even think of this, are we having church the next week? Yes. but not Saturday night. Saturday night is Christmas day. We have a Saturday night service normally, not next week, but both services on Sunday are going to be just like always. A couple more things. One of the concerns we had with this giving and taking thing was that people who really need it wouldn't take. That it's awkward and hard and this combination of kind of pride and shame kind of stuck together. And just one more time say, I mean, if you haven't done that and you really have needs, if you need a meal, if you need, how am I going to get my car fixed? I mean, there's money there. And you would honor us. You would honor us by taking it and taking what you need. The picture I had in the last service was, you know, if you're an open door, you're used to the fact that fairly normal is that we have ministry times after and people come forward for prayer. Sometimes it's a large group. Sometimes it's just a few. And not all of you come and you just kind of see what's going on. And as you're watching those kinds of things, There's something you know. You're like, I don't know their situation. You're sitting there. I do this. I don't know the situation. What's really going on there? But just from a distance, you're watching that, and you go, I just know that's a God thing. God's meeting him someplace. So I just want you to know that as you go and take what you need, that the way we're going to look at that is as you do that, we think it's a God thing. We just think it's a God thing. So do it. One other thing, just as the songs were going on, a guy came over to me and told me that there's some military people in our service today, and I don't even know where you are. I think there's a couple over here. If you're on leave or where you're from, Iraq or Afghanistan, I just want to say this one thing to you. I'm glad you're here. And come back. Here's... But here's what I actually wanted to say. That, I want to say that. But I also wanted to say, come back next year. Get back here next year. We want you safe and do that. Here's a benediction. Here's a benediction. Don't be afraid. Do not be afraid. For I have good news of great joy. And the design of God is this good news of great joy is to be for all people. How does that happen? It's when people like you and people like me begin to do what God did. Because what God did was give. And give. And give. And give. And give. And give. And give. And as we do, that is joy to the world. Merry Christmas, everybody. Go in peace. We'll see you next time. Oh joy, speak of all joy I'm a lonely friend No tongue can tell Joy, speak of all joy Rises in my soul Never lets me go you
