You know, a time of renewal like this is an extraordinary time of grace. You rearrange your lives, your calendar, your meetings, your social life, your meals, to come here to be present to the Lord. And in return, he gives gifts pressed down, shaken up, and running over. If there's a dark side to an experience like this, what I've discovered is it's impatience. I hear the gospel. I measure myself from where I am with the words that are being spoken. I start to compare myself with other people. I am very impatient with my lack of spiritual growth. And that impatience grows into a sense of discouragement, which eventually flowers into a long winter of discontent. And somehow, I want to cross the finish line without having to run the race. And it leads to a very subtle kind of despair where life takes on a routine, humdrum, monotonous, ordinary kind of quality. And I secretly admit only to myself that life in Christ Jesus is too sublime, that radical discipleship is just too demanding. I'd like to bring to your attention the wisdom in an old Latin proverb, festina lente. Festina lente, which means make haste slowly. Make haste slowly. Like the story of Izzy Schwartz. Izzy Schwartz's wife died. Izzy was in a terrible gloom. Terrible, terrible grief. He couldn't get out of the gloom. And after six months, he wouldn't get out of his apartment. finally he's found Abbie and knocks on the door and Israel Schwartz has come in Abbie says you've got to get out of the gloom you're going to die in the grief you've got to find a new reason to live what you do is get out of this building go buy yourself a new suit get a new car and begin to live again you'll find somebody else leave me alone Abbie says I've got no reason to live the grief is too heavy a week later Israel Schwartz says hmm hmm, maybe every year's right. Maybe I could find somebody else. He goes out, he gets himself a toupee, gets the clothes face under his eyes removed, gets himself a new shiny sharkskin suit, a pair of alligator shoes, and he buys a new pink Jaguar. Izzy Schwartz looks in the mirror, likes what he sees, opens the door, across the street, the maiden riding his Jaguar, when a bus comes down, hits Izzy Schwartz and kills him on the spot. Izzy Schwartz is very upset. He says, Yahweh, how could you do that? How could you do that? My life is grief, gloom, misery, pain, suffering, loss. And now you get me killed. Yahweh says, Yahweh says, Yahweh says, Yahweh says, Yahweh says, easy easy Schwartz who is he I did not was you even God doesn't know us in these overnight conversions festina lente make haste slowly Several years ago, a group of five computer salesmen from Milwaukee went to a regional sales convention in Chicago. They were all married men and they all assured their wives they'd be home in ample time for dinner. The meeting in Chicago ran late and the five guys raced out of the building, headed down toward the train terminal, and they saw their train slowly starting to chug along the tracks. So they went tearing through the terminal. Inadvertently, one of them kicked over a table on which rested a basket of apples. There was a 10-year-old boy there selling apples to pay for his books and clothes for school. With a sigh of relief, the five guys clamored aboard the train, but one of them felt a twinge of compunction for the kid, whose apples stand a bit overturned. So he said to the other four, when you get to Milwaukee, call my wife, tell I'll be on the next train, I'll be about an hour and a half late. He walked back into the train station, and later he said, I'm really glad I did, because the 10-year-old boy was blind. Well, the apples were scattered all over the floor. His computer salesman reached down, picked them up. He noticed that several were bruised. So he reached in his pocket, and he said to the blind boy, here's $20 for the apples we damaged. I hope I didn't spoil your day. God bless you. He started to walk away, and the blind boy called after him and asked, Are you Jesus? who is this Jesus who is such a magnetic field for so many people and a stumbling block for many others who is this obscure Nazarene Carpenter in whose name reforms, renewals, crusades have been launched whose name has filled libraries with brilliant scholarship my own books out there among them in whose name our very calendar is numbered, B.C., the days before Christ walked the earth, A.D. Anno Domino, the days since Jesus rose to the Father. Who is Jesus Christ? Tonight in this closing talk, I would like to share the Jesus of my own journey, the Christ that over the last 39 years, by the grace of God, I have encountered on the grounds of my own self. And I turn your attention to one of those eight or ten passages in the Gospels that's had a profound impact on my personal life and led to a more intimate and heartfelt understanding of Jesus as saving Lord. We're in chapter 12 of Matthew, beginning with verse 17. This is actually a prophecy coming from the Abba of Jesus concerning his only begotten son, and it comes to us through the mouth of the prophet Isaiah. Imagine the Abba of Jesus looking at Jesus as he says these words. Here is my servant. whom I have chosen, my beloved, the favorite of my soul. I will endow him with my spirit and he will proclaim the true faith to the nations. He will not brawl or shout, nor will his voice be heard in the streets. The bruised reed he will not crush and the smoldering wick he will not quench until he has led the truth to victory. In his name, the nations will put their hope. An old Hasidic rabbi, Levi Yicek of Berdachev in the Ukraine, claimed that he learned the meaning of love from a drunken peasant. One morning, the rabbi was out in the Polish countryside to visit a friend of his who owned a tavern. When the rabbi walked in, he saw two men seated at a table, both gloriously in their cups, drunk as skunks, stoned out of their minds, arms wrapped around each other, each girl was reassuring the other one how much he loved them. Suddenly, Ivan said to Peter, Peter, tell me what hurts me. And bleary-eyed, Peter said, How do I know what hurts you? Ivan's answer was swift, "If you don't know what hurts me, how can you say you love me?" What made Jesus of Nazareth the greatest lover in human history is that he really knew what hurt people. A few years ago, a close friend of mine, an Episcopal priest in Columbus, Ohio, walked into his office at the church on a Monday morning and wrote it without any forewarning, wrote a hasty letter of resignation to the vestry, went back to his house, sat down at the kitchen table, wrote a letter to his wife and his three children. All the kids were under the age of 10, and he was abandoning them. He fled to a logging camp in New England, took a job in Vermont as a logger, and one Saturday afternoon in January, it was about 12 degrees below zero, the priest was sitting in this portable aluminum trailer they'd rented. The only source of heat was a tiny portable aluminum heater. Well, the heater suddenly quit and died. Within minutes, the temperature in the trailer was below zero. In a fit of frustration and rage, the priest picked up the heater, flung it through the window, broke the window and shouted, Christ, I hate you! Damn you, God! Get out of my life! I'm finished with this Christian crap! It's all over! He sank to his knees, defeated and weeping. And in the bright darkness of faith, he heard a voice from within say, It's okay, Kevin. I understand. I'm here. I'm with you. And I'm for you. Then he heard Jesus weeping within him. Christ felt what he was feeling. It was an overwhelming experience of intimacy. That same afternoon, Kevin Martin packed his bags, returned to Columbus to be reconciled with the San Andreas Church, and went on to pastor the most dynamic, alive, spirit-filled Episcopal church in America, St. Luke's in Seattle, Washington. That Jesus really knows what hurts the human heart. That he's really fine-tuned to our hopes, our fears, our anger, our loneliness, our frustrations, and our desolation. As well as our joys and our consolations. Shows up all through his public ministry on earth. With the sinful woman in danger of stoning. the adulterous woman, with the sinful woman in the home of Simon the Pharisee, who washes his feet with her tears, dries them with her hair, with the thrice-denying Peter on Easter night, with the women weeping along the road to Calvary, with the 23-year-old John laying his head in the breast of Jesus. It shows up in all those passages in the four Gospels that describe Jesus as, quote, having compassion. The Greek verb splachnitsomai is used 12 times in the four Gospels and is usually translated into English as he was moved with compassion. However, because of the poverty of our English vocabulary, we really don't capture the profound physical and emotional flavor of this Greek verb for compassion. So depending upon the translation of the Bible you use, it may say he was moved with pity or he felt sorry for them or his heart went out to them. But again, they miss the deep etymological meaning of this Greek verb, slaknitomai, which is derived from the noun splankna, meaning bowels, entrails, intestines, the deepest parts of a person from which the strongest emotions like love and hatred arise. We must never forget that when we speak of the compassion of Jesus, we are speaking of the compassion of the infinite, omnipotent, transcendent, almighty God. The compassion of Jesus is the compassion of the man defined by the Council of Nicaea as being co-equal and consubstantial to the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God. And Jesus says to you and to me, don't ever be so foolish as to measure my compassion for you in terms of your compassion for one another. Don't ever be so silly as to compare your thin, pallid, wavering, capricious, fickle, moody, dependent on smooth circumstances, human compassion with mine, for I am God as well as man. What I'm getting at is this. When you read in the Gospels that Jesus was moved with compassion, it is saying that his gut was wrenched, his heart torn open, the most vulnerable part of his being laid bare. Spagnizomai in Greek is related to the Hebrew word for compassion, rakamim, which refers to the womb of Yahweh. Compassion is such a deep, central, and powerful emotion in Jesus of Nazareth that it can only be described as a movement within the womb of God himself where all the divine tenderness and gentleness lie hidden, where God is mother, father, brother, sister, son, and daughter, where all feelings, emotions, and passions are one in divine love. When Jesus was moved with compassion, when he wept within the brokenness of my priest friend Kevin Martin, the gospel is saying, the ground of all being shook, the source of all life trembled, the heart of all love burst open, and the unfathomable depths of the relentless tenderness. That's my free translation. Spaknitzam I was laid bare. The numerous physical healings performed by Jesus and recorded in the gospels are only a hint, and no more than a hint, of the anguish in the heart of God's Son for our wounded humanity. If there is one thing of towering importance that I have learned in the 39 years since I was ambushed by Jesus back in February of 1956, it's this. If you call Jesus goodness, he'll be good to you. If you call him love, he'll be loving to you. But if you call him compassion, he will know that you know. As the 15th century mystic Meister Eckhart said, the best name for the Nazarene carpenter is son of compassion. When we speak of Jesus as Emmanuel, as God with us, We are simply saying that the greatest lover in the history of the world really knows what hurts us. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that Jesus does not understand about the pain that hangs like a darkening cloud over the valley of human history. In his own flesh, he feels every separation and loss, every heart broken, every wound of the spirit that refuses to close, all the riven experience of men, women, and children across the bands of time. If there is anyone sitting here tonight crying out for a hand that will touch them, an arm that will embrace them, lips that will kiss them, who's longed for somebody who's not afraid of your cynicism, your skepticism, your, Christ, I hate you, get out of my life. I'm filled with this Christian crap. There comes a sacred man right now who says to you it's okay. I understand. I'm here. I'm with you. I'm for you. And your pain reverberates in the depth of my own soul. My friends, this is not pious poetry. This is the very meaning of Easter. Easter did not remove Jesus from us. It simply made it possible for him to touch not only Niamh, but New Orleans, not only Mary Magdalene, but me. Your Christian life and mine don't make any sense unless in the depth of our souls we believe that Jesus not only knows what hurts us, but knowing, seeks us out, whatever our poverty, whatever our pain. His plea to his people is his promise to us. Come to me. Not to church, not to a Bible study, not to a seminar, but come to me. And don't wait until you get your head on straight, you're confirmed in grace, free of lust, pride, arrogance. And don't wait until you're feeling kind and gracious and benevolent toward yourself. but come now angry, frustrated, wounded, lonely, tilting toward despair and I'll meet you right where you live and I'll love you the way you are, not the way you're supposed to be. My brothers and sisters, this is not something that I read in a book or heard in a sermon. This is the Jesus of my own journey. This is the only Christ I know, the son of compassion. Tonight, a man came up to me at the book table and said, would you sign this? I said, what's your name? He said, Jim the Drunk, recovering alcoholic like myself. I mean, this morning in the motel, this is as vivid as if it happened last night, weaving down to Oakland Park Boulevard in Lauderdale. a busy, busy thoroughfare right in the heart of the business district. Six lanes of traffic on each side with an island in the center. And I've been in a 12-day drunk wearing the same rancid clothes, unbearable body odor, unshaven, filthy, lice, and sleeping on the beach until the cops caught me and then going to the bridges out in the weeds and in a blackout most of the time. 10 o'clock in the morning weaving down Oakland Park Boulevard with my precious bottle of cheap Taka vodka in my back pocket always patented to make sure it's there coming up behind me is a young couple in love they're holding hands and they spotted me the moment they did they moved quickly to the outside of the sidewalk quick in their pace never looked up and I came out of my blackout long enough to realize that was the loneliest moment in my life I have ever known. As Mother Teresa of Calcutta with her vast personal experience of human misery said, the greatest agony in the world is the feeling of not being wanted, of not being accepted. And the Jesus of my journey, the Christ I've met in the grounds of my own self. Love me as much that morning in a state of disgrace as he does tonight in a state of grace, for his compassion is never, never, ever based on our performance. It knows no shadow of alteration or change. Jesus is the fulfillment of the Isaiahan prophecy, the bruised reed of your life. He will not crush, and the smoldering wick he will not quench until he has led the truth to victory. in his name we all put our hope my doorbell ran one summer during a fierce rainstorm in New Orleans one summer morning I go and I open the door, it's a woman about 35 years old and she asks, are you Brennan Manning? I said, yes ma'am she said, well obviously we've never met, I was wondering if you might if it was possible if you please could, she started to cry I said could I please what she said would you please come to my house and pray with my daddy he's dying of cancer I've asked the pastor of my own church three times to go and pray with him he promises that he will but then he gets so caught up in his own sermon preparation his own administrative agenda he forgets I know my daddy doesn't have long to live would you please come and pray with him he said he'll be there in ten minutes go to the man's house walk back into his bedroom and he's lying on his bed with his head propped up in two pillows and there's an empty chair beside his bed. I said, hi, I guess you were expecting me. He said, no, sir, who are you? I explained, I said it was an honest mistake. I saw the empty chair, I thought you were expecting company. He said, oh yeah, the chair, you mind closing the door? I closed the bedroom door, what's going on here? He says to me, Brennan, I've never told anybody this in my life, even my daughter. But all my life, I have never known how to pray. Go to church on Sunday, my pastor talks in prayer, goes right over my head. Finally, one day I got the courage to say to him, Pastor, I get zero, zilch out of your sermons on prayer. He reaches in his desk drawer, takes out this book, and says, Here, read this. It's by Hans Urs von Balthasar, Swiss theologian, best book on contemporary prayer in the 20th century. So, Brené, take it home, and the first three pages, I have to look up 11 words in the dictionary. next thing i give it back to my pastor saying thank you under my breath for nothing and that day i abandoned any attempted prayer till one day four years ago my best friend said to me joe prayer is just a simple matter of having a conversation with jesus here's what you do sit down in a chair place an empty chair in front of you in faith see jesus on the chair and he's there because he promised I'll be with you every day until the end of time. Then just speak to him and listen, as you would, in a dialogue, a conversation with your best friend. This old man says to me, Brennan, I've been doing that two hours every day now, the last four years, and I just love to do it. I'm careful. He said, in fact, I'm very cautious. I do not want my daughter to see me talk to an empty chair. You know, she's a funny farm for daddy. But he said, you've got a background on this, Brennan. Do you think it's prayer? I said, Joe, that is so real. That is so unsophisticated. That is so honest. That just delights the heart of Jesus. He said, thanks. I kind of knew that. I anointed him with oil. I pray with him. Go back to my house, and two nights later, his daughter returns and tell me her daddy died that afternoon. I asked that he seemed to die in peace. she said yes I left the house about 2 o'clock this afternoon to go to the store and just as I left my daddy called me over told me one of his corny jokes and kissed me on the cheek but when I got back just before 3 I found him dead but she said Brennan's strange beyond strange this is weird at the moment my daddy died he leaned over and put his head on an empty chair beside his bed do you know that Jesus not about him do you know him you know it's honestly heartbreaking for me as I travel the country back and forth a couple of weeks ago I'm in Montreat, North Carolina next Wednesday I'm going to be in San Francisco I go to Seattle, I go to Key West, Florida all the places in between and I meet so many Christians young, middle-aged old they tell me they're born again They're baptized in the Holy Spirit. They're deep into the Word. They've got a real relationship with Jesus. But they've never once laid their head on the empty chair. Somehow that's too intimate. That's too threatening. But that's the meaning of the central mystery of our faith, the incarnation. God draws aside the curtain of eternity, steps into human history in the man, Jesus. The incarnation is the mystery of the compassionate closeness of God in Jesus of Nazareth. He draws near to us and speaks in words of incredible familiarity. My little children, I will not leave you orphans. I'm going to come back, and I'm going to take you with me, that where I am, you also may be. Fred Peterson, when was the last time anybody ever addressed you as my little child? Tim Titus, Dave Johnson, when was the last time anybody ever called you my little child? This is Jesus speaking to grown men. My little children, I'm not going to leave you orphans. I was giving a retreat up in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, a weekend retreat to a group called the Soaring Singles. It had 95 people in their 20s. To qualify for the retreat, you had to be in your 20s, you had to be single. Well, I got the invitation. I thought, well, what a lightweight weekend this is going to be. They're just going up there to play Kissy Face and Huggy Bear. And they just want me to say Jesus every half hour to give it some legitimacy. Well, Saturday night in the great room, it was 55 degrees below zero outside with the wind chill factor. I was driven to my knees by the hunger for God among those young people. And that night I happened to be developing at some length this passage, these words of Jesus, my little children, I will not leave you orphans. The moment I said the words, a 26-year-old Vietnamese kid let out a shriek, I mean a piercing scream, and he bolted out the door. I was stunned. The young people were shocked. They said, Brennan, what do we do? I said, if he's not back in 10 seconds, drag him in. He'll freeze to death out there. He came walking back in on his own, came up, sat down on a bench at my side, and he asked, Brennan, may I say a few words? I said, please. He stood up and he said to the group, none of you know me. It was 14 years ago in Cambodia. My father learned that the Khmer Rouge were on the way. My father got me out of bed at midnight. We slipped through the jungle, got out to the ocean. My father strapped me to an open raft and pushed me out into the sea. Miraculously, I was picked up by some Korean fisherman. Later made my way here to the States. Two years ago, I got my MBA from Harvard. I live in a little apartment in Chicago by myself. In 14 years, I've had no word from my mother, my father, my two sisters. I don't know if they're dead or alive. I've lived in your country like an orphan. I saw your ad in the paper for a retreat for single people. So I came here hoping I would make a friend. I am not a Christian. have heard of your Jesus, heard he was a wise man, even a prophet. But Brennan Manning, when you spoke his word, my little children, I will not leave you orphans. Your Jesus was in my face, and that word was a cutting knife. It was like rolling thunder. It was an earthquake in the world of my spirit. I know him. Yes, I know him. I share this for one reason. What I'm about here is not to pass down lofty ideas, inspiring thoughts. The gospel is not merely information. It is transformation, the transforming power of the risen Christ. The day you surrender without reservation in faith to the compassion of Jesus Christ, I promise you, your life will never be the same. You will never again be shadowed by self-hatred. self-condemnation, shame, guilt, anxiety. To Jesus who says, my little children, I will not leave you orphans, is not just some great teacher or some model for us to imitate. His words resonate with the deepest affection, and he offers himself to you and me as companion for the journey, as a friend who is never rude, quick to forgive, always patient with our brokenness, a love that keeps no score of our wrongdoing, This is an awesome, awesome dimension of discipleship, and the New Testament lays great emphasis on it. What deity in any great world religion, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism, would ever dare to say what Jesus said? Make your home in me as I make mine in you. If anyone of you love me, you'll be true to my word. My Abba will love you. We'll come to you. We'll come to you and make our home within you. I tell you solemnly, I'll be with you every day of your life until the end of time. As the Father has loved me, that's the very way that I love you. Behold, I stand at the door, I knock. If you open the door, I'll come in, sit down beside you, and have supper with you. If you know anything about the Orthodox Jewish tradition, when an Orthodox Jew, which Jesus was, says, I want to have supper with you, he is saying, I want to enter into friendship with you. In 1995, an Orthodox Jew still defines a friend, quote, as someone who breaks bread with you. Today, an Orthodox Jew will have a cup of coffee with you, a donut, probably not a hot donut unless it's kosher. But if he says, I want to have supper with you, he is saying, come to my mikdash mayat, my miniature sanctuary, my dining room table, and there we will celebrate the most sacred and the most beautiful experience of all life affords, friendship. This is Jesus, Lord, Messiah, Christ, God himself saying, I'm knocking. Open the door of your heart and I'll come in and sit down, not across the table, but right by your side. And we'll break the bread of friendship. I don't call you servants. A servant doesn't know what his master is doing. I call you my friend. St. Augustine's commentary in that one sentence was, A friend is someone who knows everything about you and still totally accepts you. Not in spite of all your faults, that wouldn't be total acceptance. but with them all. Isn't this the dream we all share? Someday, somewhere, I'm going to meet that person who really understands me and the words I speak and even understands the words I leave unspoken. Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of that dream, and that is why for me, Paul Tillich's definition of faith is most meaningful of all. Tillich defines faith as the courage to accept acceptance. Faith is the courage to accept that Jesus, knowing my whole life story, every skeleton in my closet, my shallow faith now, my empty heart, my desiccated feelings, my resentments, my frustrations, my loneliness, my rage, accepts me as I am. Tillich says, you can pray the Nicene Creed, the Apostles' Creed, I believe in God the Father Almighty, Jesus Christ, and I understand our Lord until you're blue in the face. Tillich says, until you accept that you are accepted. You're not a believer. That's faith. That's the meaning of the death and resurrection of Jesus. I am accepted by Jesus as I am. With all the warts and flaws. And not as I should be. I read a newsletter four times a year to people around the country. And in a recent newsletter I wrote, friend is somebody who stands with you in the bad weather of life. That is a definition that is pregnant with meaning for me. A friend is someone who stands with you in the bad weather of life. Back in the fall of 1981 when I had dropped out of the ministry entirely, gone off to the monastery for six months to pray for discernment, Was God calling me to marry Rosalind, or was it just a figment of my own imagination? Was I deceiving myself? Was it really from God, or was it just from Brennan? And after a 30-day sign of retreat, meeting with a spiritual director regularly, and just seeking God's will for my life, I came to a great inner peace that God was calling me to turn to the road, that I was to walk the rest of my days hand in hand with Rosalind. so I had 200 invitations at that point in the fall of 81 to speak to Catholic churches around the United States there were 40 a year, each one for five nights like a revival, a Paris renewal I contacted all the 200 pastors and told them my intention to marry and that if they chose to cancel I would understand if they chose to confirm the invitation I would be delighted to come all 200 canceled so on our wedding arrived we were both broken and employed and had no money to afford a church wedding so we went up to Greenville, Mississippi to marry in the home of two friends Bonnie and Dom Verona I knew that I was going to catch some flack from the flock the marriage of a celibate Catholic priest all those years just didn't endear me to a lot of people when I announced my marriage, but I never really anticipated how bad it was going to be when my two closest friends in the priesthood with whom I walked every day for 26 years, one called me Judas, and the other told me my word was no longer trustworthy. And I gathered my family around the dining room table one night. When I announced my marriage, my mother screamed. in rage. She said, if you go through with that, I will commit suicide. Nobody from my family came to my wedding. A mother, a father, a brother, a sister. Began to get hate mail addressed to Brennan and Jezebel Manning. Phone calls at 3, 4 o'clock in the morning. Let me talk to that whore, that slut you call your wife. My Roslyn. They're calling My Roslyn a whore. Catholics call My Roslyn a whore. Well, a lot of pain then. There's been a lot of healing since. My mother, God bless her, called two and a half years later. Asked my forgiveness. Asked Dr. Roslyn. Roslyn didn't want to talk to her. She was so afraid of her. She got on the phone and my mother said, would you ever forgive me for what I've done? I began to call every week, exchange recipes. My mother didn't want me to come home without Rosalyn anymore. Because she's a lot more fun than I am. Over in Mobile, Alabama, my best male friend, Paul Sheldon, we've been friends for 23 years. Met when I was working on the shrimp boats in New Orleans. He's a banker in Mobile. We meet to this day once a month on the beach in Biloxi, Mississippi, halfway between where he lives and where I live. We go for a three-hour walk and then have luncheon. Celebrate the isness of the shall be. Yeah, celebrate the isness of the shall be. Paul is married with four children, and he's what they call an ordained deacon in the Catholic Church, meaning he's ordained to do everything a priest does except celebrate the Eucharist and hear confessions. Paul, without a doubt, is the most gifted preacher I've ever heard in my life. Invite all over the South to speak. And his bishop called him in and said, Sheldon, I understand you're a close friend of Brennan Manning. And Paul said, oh, yes, I am. And the bishop said, if you stand with him in his decision to marry, you'll be stripped of your diaconate. You'll never preach the gospel in the Catholic Church again. And you're no longer welcome to our communion table. Paul Sheldon loves the ministry more than I do. The tears just washed down his face. He was brokenhearted, he said, Bishop, I stand with Brennan. He was the best man at our wedding. To me, he was the human face of Jesus Christ. The Jesus who stood with me in the bad weather of life when I was a broken down, drunk in the gutter. When my friends and family deserted me, Paul Sheldon was there at great personal cost. You are never, ever more like Jesus than when you are choked with compassion for the brokenness of others. Never more like Jesus than when you are choked with compassion for the brokenness of others. A 27-year-old woman in San Jose, California walked up to me and she said, Brennan, I just want you to know what you wrote on the top of page 75 of your book, A Stranger to Self-Hatred Changed My Life. And I said, well, young lady, along with my mother, I don't read my books. Do you remember what it was? She said, yes, I memorized it. You wrote, our problem with the compassion of Jesus is either we don't know it, or we know it, but we don't believe it, or we believe it, but we don't accept it, or we accept it, but we're not in touch with it, or we're in touch with it, but we don't surrender to it. She said, Brennan, I read that one paragraph 10, 20, 40, 50 times until at some unremembered moment, God gave me the grace to surrender myself without reservation to the compassion of his son. And I just want you to know that these last two and a half years of my life have been indescribably different. She reached out and kissed me on the cheek and she said, I'm free. I'm free. Would you once again gently close your eyes and join me in prayer? As you center down deep within yourself and become aware of Jesus dwelling there, I'd like to share something I learned from an old evangelical pastor here in northern Minnesota in his house when I was having dinner the doorbell rang it was a 28 year old man from his church and the man said pastor I've been coming to your church now about six months we've got a lot of members you probably don't know who I am but I've heard you speak three times now on the compassion of Christ I believe every word you say, but it's still all stuck in my head as nice thoughts. I've never experienced it. I don't suppose there's any way you could help me. The pastor said, come into my study, invite me to tag along. The pastor led a short prayer. Then he said to the 28-year-old, listen carefully to what I'm about to say. Jesus, the risen Lord, is present in this room right now as the three of us gather in his name. Do you believe this? Do you believe it? About a minute went by and the 28-year-old said yes. Yes, Pastor, I do believe that. All right, now, said the pastor, listen very, very carefully to what I'm going to say because it is the core of the gospel. It is the essence of the good news. It is the heartbeat of discipleship. Jesus, the risen Christ, in our midst, right here, right now, loves you and accepts you just as you are. You do not have to change to get his love. You do not have to give up your sin. You do not have to have a conversion experience. Obviously, Jesus wants you to change. Yes, he wants you to give up your sin, be converted and live, and experience the freedom of the children of God. But you do not have to do that to get his love and acceptance. You have that already before you decide to change and whether you decide to change or not. do you believe this do not say anything to humor me if you don't believe it come back in a month we'll talk again a full five minutes passed and finally the 28 year old said yes yes pastor i do believe that all right said the pastor right now say something to jesus either say it aloud or say in a silence beyond words. Spontaneously, the man began to pray aloud. He reached out, he grasped the pastor's wrist, and he said, yes, yes, now I know. I know that I know. I sense his presence. He is here. I invite each of you to enter into this same liberating experience. In the awareness of Jesus dwelling within you, reflect on the truth that he loves you and accepts you just as you are. Loves you whether you believe it or not. Loves you whether you're on the mountaintop or in the valley of desolation. Now see Jesus looking at you. An eye contact here is important. This does not require any great gift for visualization or imagination. But in faith, see Jesus looking at you. How is he looking at you? The way he looked at the sinful woman in the eyes in the home of Simon the Pharisee. For the first time, this woman laid eyes on her eyes on Jesus. She was so awed, so overcome by the compassion that streamed from this sacred man. The throwing caution of the winds, caring nothing about what people thought. She walked down the center of the room, knelt at his feet, began to wash them with her tears, dry them with her hair. And Jesus said tenderly, many sins are forgiven you because your love is great. Is that the way Jesus is looking at you? Is he looking at you the way he looked at the adulterous woman in danger of stoning? She looked into his eyes and she saw heaven in his eyes. Has nobody condemned you? No. Then I don't either. Go and don't do this anymore. is he looking at you the way that the apostle john in the upper room on holy thursday when in this incredible gesture of intimacy this 23 year old young man lays his head on the breast of jesus obviously he wasn't afraid of jesus and jesus turns and the gospel says he looked at, it doesn't say John, but at the disciple that he loved. Is that the way Jesus is looking at you? Or is it the way he looked at Peter in the upper room on Easter night? Peter's cowering in the corner because three times he denied everyone knowing the one man who loved him most. Peter had become a sniveling coward in that courtyard of Caiaphas, crying, I don't know the man, I don't know him. And Jesus walks through the door of the upper room, comes over to Peter, looks deep into his eyes, and says, Shalom, my friend. Apparently no memory at that moment of his betrayal. And then in the subtlest act of affirmation possible, Jesus names Peter the leader of the apostolic band. is Jesus looking at you the way he looked at Peter no doubt he's looking at you as he's never looked at any human being because we are each a unique singular and irreplaceable personality a unique manifestation of the truth goodness and beauty of God but however Jesus looks at you His eyes are filled with immense compassion For the bruised reed he will not crush And the smoldering wick he will not quench Now if this next word causes a movement A stirring in your heart Then accept it Not simply as a word of encouragement from Brennan Manning But as a prophetic word from the Lord Jesus Christ My friend were you so naive as to think that your relationship with me would be an unbroken upward spiral toward holiness? Don't you know that I'm too realistic for that? I witnessed a Peter who claimed he didn't know me, a James who wanted power and returned for service to the kingdom, a Philip who did not know he was supposed to see the Father in me, and scores of disciples who were convinced that I was finished on Calvary. The gospel has many examples of men and women who started out well and then faltered along the way. But on each night I appeared to Peter. James is not remembered for his ambition, but for the sacrifice of his life for the kingdom. Philip did see the thought in me when I pointed the way. And the disciples who despaired had enough courage to recognize me and the stranger at their side when I broke bread with them in the gathering darkness at the end of the road to Emmaus. The point, my friend, is this. I expected more failure from you than you expected from yourself. Do you hear my word? I expected more failure from you than you expected from yourself. This moment, take your eyes off yourself, fix them on me, and let me be who I am, Savior. As the Holy Spirit moves you, respond to the compassionate call of Jesus. If you're comfortable, pray aloud. Or communicate in a silence beyond words. Or just lay your head on the empty chair. Thank you.
