Music Some time ago we discerned that there was a word that was building in Vicki Degner pastor here in the context of formation in our church and our staff. And today is her day to preach. And the text is Romans 12, verses 1 and 2. Hear the word of the Lord. I appeal to you, therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. Same text, this time, however, from the message says this. So here's what I want you to do. God helping you take your everyday ordinary life, your sleeping, eating, going to work, walking around life, and place it before God as an offering, Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don't become so well-adjusted to the culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention on God. You'll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you and quickly respond to it. Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity, God brings the best out of you, develops well-formed maturity in you. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Vicki, I'm praying for you too. Okay. Quit laughing. Did you snort first? There you go. I got one. It's all I needed. We're ready to go. Holy Spirit, I know you've put some things in her that matter to us as a community, and I pray in your name that you would release all of it from her. And for her, in this, there would be great joy. In Jesus' name, amen. Go get them. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Glad everybody's here today, particularly those of you that are visiting. For those of you that are visiting, this isn't my typical place to be, so that's all the hoof-a-la around here. So anyway, I am pretty full of it today in the best possible sense, and I'm hoping you all don't have big plans until later this afternoon. Just kidding. Well, as I've been thinking about this day, I've been excited about it. And approaching today, my prayer for all of us has been that God would speak to each one of us in new ways about how to live our everyday ordinary lives. We're talking normal here. In more awareness of His loving presence, in more openness to His resurrection and transforming power that enlivens us. And I'd like to propose a few practical ways to start doing that before we close today. And then as we close, I'd like to extend an exciting invitation to our whole community. So don't leave early. Stick around for that, okay? I've been sitting with the scripture text personally in Romans 12, 1 to 2, on and off for a little over two years, actually. It's a scripture that has come to mean a lot to me. These verses have been personally convicting to me, invitational, and empowering as I pursue my own struggle to become fully alive in God. And the other thing that I want you to know, that these verses have become a prayer for me, for our community. And as a spiritual development pastor here at Church of the Open Door, my heart has been stirred by God. That God would deepen this community's experience of God so that we would be more and more able to live out of that experiential knowing and encounter of God in the world. And then all kinds of craziness can ripple out for the kingdom of God. And that is a prayer that not only me, but the leadership here has been holding. So let's dig into the text for today. As the scripture begins, it's helpful to look at the context of Paul's remarks in these first two verses of Romans chapter 12. Up until this time in chapter 1 through 11, Paul has been laying out a deeply theological argument. And if any of you have studied Romans, it goes deep, doesn't it? He's been preaching that we are saved by faith, by the grace of God, not by anything within us, but by the straight-up grace of God. He's preaching that now, because of what Jesus has done, we are literally, we're dead to the sin in our life. And again, just as literally, we have the opportunity to live alive to God. And this whole divine plan of salvation that he is unfolding in Romans 1 through 11 kind of culminates for me anyway in Romans 8, where Paul talks about this gift that we are offered of living a changed life, initiated, empowered, and sustained by the indwelling Spirit of God within us. And then Paul reminds the body of believers in Rome and us today that that invitation is open to all of us if we will respond to it. And then, at the end of chapter 11, in Romans 11, 33-36, Paul's tone changes. And in these three verses, he breaks out into a song of sorts. In my Bible, it's titled doxology even. But Paul becomes overwhelmed with something at this point. And he says this, you can read along on the slide. How very rich is the wisdom and the knowledge of God. How God judges is more than we will ever understand. And the way that he deals with people is more than we will know. Who can know the great mind of the Lord? Who can give him advice? And has anyone ever done anything so good and so important that God has to pay him back? All things come from God, Paul says. All things are directed by God, and all things are for God's good. May God be given the glory forever. Amen. it's a song and it's a prayer and I want to point it out today because I want us to connect with the place that Paul launches into in this next verse Romans 12 1 Paul is overwhelmed with this story of the grace and the mercy of God the more he preaches in this letter to the Roman Christians and he can't help himself he can't help himself His love for Jesus and his passion for the power of the good news actually reminds me of what we've also seen in the apostles as we've been sitting in Acts together under Dave and Steve's teaching. The deep belief that the apostles have in the gospel lived out through Jesus' life and death and resurrection compels them literally. This deep belief is so compelling to them that they have to give all of their energies to inviting others into the life of freedom that they have now witnessed and tasted for themselves. I find that very convicting, actually, personally. That energy, that awareness that they have of the mercy and the love of God, that passionate energy and awareness they demonstrate is convicting to me, and I want to be like that. I want to live that way in the world I want to be in touch with my heartfelt gratitude for God and allow it to motivate my life in ridiculous ways for the kingdom of God and I invite you all into that invitation today this brings us now to Romans 12 1-2 in response to what Paul has been previously writing in this letter to the Roman Christians, he now beseeches and strongly urges the people to live a life that is pleasing to God. And he says this, Romans 12, 1, I appeal to you, therefore, brothers and sisters in Christ, by the mercies of God, or in view of the mercy of God, to present your bodies now as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God. With Romans 11, 33 to 36 as a backdrop now, Paul is clearly stating that if and when we realize and become aware of the reality of the overwhelming mercy and the love of God extended to us, that that awareness alone is enough by the Spirit of God to elicit a response out of us that results in worship and praise to God by offering our lives. so I'd like to just stop here for a minute and ask God to help us connect with this awareness this place of encounter that Paul is writing to us from in Romans 12 1-2 kind of bring it down to our level think of a time in your life when someone has extended unsolicited kindness to you and remember how you felt, what response took place within you. And if you can't think of something now, bring that question into your week this week. An example came to my mind, and for me it was from a couple Christmases ago. It was the day before Christmas, and my husband Jerry was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath. and at that time my daughter and my then two-year-old granddaughter were living with us I was babysitting we were expecting 20 family members over the next day for Christmas dinner it was snowing outside and all I can think about is I have got to get to the hospital to be with Jerry I'm kind of worked up I'm pretty anxious overwhelmed I'm feeling trapped and alone and then besides that how in the world am I going to get to preparing a Christmas dinner well a few friends the short story is a few friends decided to come over and watch my granddaughter so I could get to the hospital and while I was gone not only did they watch my two-year-old granddaughter for me, but they did my laundry. They snow-blowed the driveway, and I don't know how they figured this out, but they started chopping stuff for my Christmas dinner. I remember coming home with Jerry, seeing them sitting around my kitchen table so peacefully like they hadn't broken a sweat. And, you know, they'd been sitting and telling stories and jokes all afternoon. And like it was no big deal. And I remember standing in my kitchen. And granted, I was kind of tired. You know, I had been worried about my husband. But I was standing in my kitchen, and I became so overwhelmed with gratefulness. So overwhelmed with gratefulness for their loving service to our family in the middle of that crisis. And it was unsolicited. that might be similar to the place in which Paul is speaking to us from here today he's speaking from an experience and an awareness of knowing what it's like to be overwhelmed by unsolicited grace mercy and love and in my own words it might be something like this people in light of the extravagant outpouring of God's grace to us by sending Jesus to make a way for us to be alive, live now a life that pours back thanks to God for this extraordinary gift made available to us. Well, Paul goes on to say, and then present your bodies as living sacrifices. And it's important to note here that that word bodies doesn't just mean this. You know, it's not just this. But it's a very Old Testament use of the word and it means our heart, our mind, our soul, and our might. It means all of us. It means our lives. And when you sit with this word present, and in some translation the word used is offer, this is what you find out that it means. It means to take something and cause it to stand near. so take your life and cause it to stand near God. Take your life and place it nearby God. Take your life and wait in the presence of God and be present to God with your life. And this is really obvious, but it is worth stating just to make a point. The opposite of this word present means to be absent from, to be away from, to be away from God with our life. So Paul is strongly urging, beseeching out of this place of encounter and experience with God that we take our life and we come and stand near God with all of it. Our very existence, not parts and pieces, the very manner in which we live our life, don't think you have to clean it up first, the whole thing, our whole biography, and take it now and stand near God. Paul goes on, holy and pleasing to God, for this, my friends, is your spiritual worship. So worship is now our life. And life is worship. Isn't it great to come on Sunday morning and spend time together for an hour, a little more than an hour, singing together and sitting under the word of God? But that's such a minute part of our week, isn't it? What would it be like for us to press into a life of worship in which we are offering our whole life now to God because we are overcome with gratefulness for what God has done for us. I love the way that Eugene Peterson says this in the message because it brings it down to our level. Our worship to God is offering our everyday ordinary lives, our sleeping, eating, and going to work, walking around, father-mothering lives. and this is an invitation. But to me, it is also a confrontation as often invitations might be. In a book called The Dangerous Act of Worship by Mark Labberton, it's not the one Steve's been talking about, it's a different one. This book is called The Dangerous Act of Worship. Mark says this, this sort of worship, this offering up our lives as spiritual worship to God out of responsive gratefulness for what he has done for it is dangerous because it is meant to produce lives fully attentive to reality as God sees it. And that, frankly, is more than most of us want to deal with. So therein lies the problem and the confrontation. because honestly most of my worship is about me. I am more caught up with my own agendas, my own wishes, my needs, my plans, my addictions, my anxieties, certainly my performance then I am aware of offering up my life to God. The call here, the invitation here that Paul is extending to us is to offer it all. All the bits and pieces, all the parts and pieces. All its emotions, temptations, desires, hurts, joys for God to come and live fully with me in it. So worship now is being defined by Paul as encountering God and responding with my life, all of it, my existence. And that delights God. And it is good for us. So how do you feel about this? How do you feel about offering up your whole life to God? Do you ever even think about it? I challenge you to think about what parts and pieces you do offer. Because we all think there's parts of our life that are safe to offer. God, you can have this. I'll show you this. And then what parts and pieces do you hold back like God doesn't know? Those places we're ashamed of. things we're unaware of and do you ever take the time to stop and think the shape and the form that the love and the mercy of God has taken in your own life let alone give your chance of self to react to it to feel it to let it have its work in your heart these are some hard questions well friends on a good day I can feel just like Paul and I can be overwhelmed with the goodness and the mercy and the grace and the healing that God has done in my life. And on those days, my heart is filled with thanks. And I beg God to take my life and let it be consecrated to him. I'll even sing the song. But then there's those other days Where I say, seriously, God? You have got to be kidding. I thought we did this already. We're going through this circumstance again, this tragedy again, this challenge. I can't, God. Jesus, I love you, but would you just sit right there in the chair and let me try to figure out a few things on my own. but God is even graceful to me in those places and this actually just overwhelms me even more because here's the truth God honors our resistance and God waits for our readiness and that kind of mercy is overwhelming to me so then at the end of the day good days are bad, I'm starting to realize that they're all framed under the mercy of God. So many days, maybe most days, our most spiritual worship to God is just stopping. As simple as this, folks, just stopping and lifting our attention to God. Fix your attention upon God, Eugene Peterson and says. Insane. Okay, God, here I am. Here it is, all of it. It's all I got. It's nothing fancy. It's not complicated. But I'm here. All of it. All of it. I'm here. And I invite you in. I want to be in you and you and me in all of this. In verse 2, Paul goes on to say, Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may discern what the will of God is and go do it. And in the message, Peterson says it like this. Don't become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention upon God and you will then be changed from the inside out, transformed, Readily recognize what he wants from you. That's the will of God. And then quickly respond to it. Go do it. Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity. God will then begin to bring the best out of you and develops well-formed maturity in you. So here, another example. Offering our lives to God delights God, and it results in goodness and blessing in our own lives. So what is our culture? That's probably pretty obvious to all of us. I mean, we could all name a few things off here. Entitlement, we all think we deserve to get what we want. Violence, disordered sexuality all around us. A drivenness in this country towards productivity, success, image. Mastering things, being the best, being number one. And something that is particularly grieving to me is this is a culture of self-actualization or self-help versus a culture of spiritual transformation. So cultural conformity is a subtle bondage that affects every single one of us, and we often go through our everyday lives without even thinking about it. And at the very least, it leaves us all very anxious people, doesn't it? In her e-reflections from June 2013, Ruth Haley Barton says this. A recent survey of 20,000 Christians around the world revealed that Christians worldwide identify busyness and constant overload as a major distraction from God. The survey describes a vicious cycle that is prompted by cultural conformity. And it may be the case, she goes on to say, and she lists five things, that number one, Christians are assimilating a culture of busyness, hurry, and overload, which leads to, number two, God becoming more marginalized in the Christian's life, which leads to, number three, tragically, a deteriorating relationship with God, which leads to Christians becoming even more vulnerable then to adopting secular assumptions about how to live their lives. Which leads to, lastly, number five, more conformity to a culture of busyness, overload, and hurry, and drivenness. And then the cycle begins again, she says. That makes me sad, and it makes me anxious. Our tendency to imitate our culture is directly related to our unawareness of the real story that we're living in. Go back to Romans 11, 33, 36. Paul breaks out and says, all things are in him, all things are directed by him, and all things are for his good. That's the story we're living in. That's the real story. And we forget that. We're planning our own. And the other tendency to imitate our culture is directly related to our unwillingness to stop. Our unwillingness to stop producing, consuming, moving, buying, planning, accomplishing. These things aren't bad in and of themselves, friends. But when they're the first thing that we worship, they pull us right away from God, Which is the exact opposite of what Paul is talking about in verse 1. When he invites us to take our lives and come stand nearby God. This is a place that I have a lot of passion about. Because it is in this place that we are in dire need. Of committing intentionally as Christians to some spiritual disciplines, practices or rhythms. You pick your favorite word. that will assist us in offering up our lives to God and keep us from being mindlessly distracted by the culture around us. And lastly, to protect our deep, deep desire to live a life of dependence on God. The transformation that Paul is talking about is a change of condition. And he's urging the church to allow God to change the very condition of themselves. I've grown to love the definition of spiritual transformation that Ruth Haley Barton has in her book called Sacred Rhythms. And you can see it up on the slide. Spiritual transformation is the process of becoming more like Christ. Number one, for the glory of God, right? It's our spiritual worship. Number two, for the abundance of our own life. It's good for us. And number three, for the sake of others in the world. Because once it's in us, it ripples out. Well, this becoming new, changing, transforming, and growing can get really complicated, and I think we're a church here that is pretty aware of that. In our mission statement, we refer to that struggle to invite others to pursue the struggle of becoming fully alive in God. We know it's a struggle. But here's what I think. If human spiritual transformation was easy and we could do it, who needs the cross? The resurrection. the gifts of the Spirit the ability by the Spirit to live in the kind of life that we could never initiate for ourselves and the real danger is that our spiritual worship of offering our lives to God doesn't change us and it doesn't influence the world around us towards God lastly Paul states in these verses that the spirit of God is changing and renewing my manner of thinking so that there's a big so that I can discern what the will of God is and go do it we're not set aside our lives aren't set aside and made holy just for our own sake and pursuit but now as a result of the way God's changing and growing us and transforming us we find ourselves in partnership with God seeing what he wants done in the world and using us to do it we are involved with God and God's mission well we can't transform ourselves to be more like Christ we cannot do it but we can partner with God to create conditions in which spiritual transformation can take place in our lives and that is our spiritual worship to God how do we do that? by engaging in some sort of rhythm in our life folks in which we are experiencing some quiet where we're pulling away from the noise of people and activity this drivenness of the culture everywhere around us. A rhythm of sitting with Scripture when we can and rather than feeling like we have to master it and pound something out of it we sit with it and we let it address us. We let Scripture have its work on us. These sorts of practices actually provide space for God to reset our lives. And we need a lot of resetting. And God knows it. Thanks be to God. Resetting our lives from conformity to culture, resetting our lives from our own well-planned agendas to the story that God has actually always been writing with our lives in the story that he longs to complete to write so that the world would know more of him around us. We need our lives reset. And it's important to say that God doesn't need our spiritual practices. I'm not talking about legalisms. That would make us all sick, right? More anxiety. We're not talking about legalisms. We are talking about an elicited response of worship that comes out of our belly because we know the love and the mercy of God. It's we that need spiritual practices to remind ourselves of whose we are, of who we are, and what it is we are to do and be in the world. That's for us. God then takes the simple offering of ourselves and does with it what we cannot do. He transforms us. He heals us. He fills us with love and joy for the world around us, even those that are difficult to love. And I'm not talking about something that is just more for us to do. It's important to say that because sometimes we can feel like when we hear people talk like this, oh, Vicki, really? Spiritual practices? Come on. It isn't just more to do. These practices and rhythms, these ways of resting and being with God, these ways of stopping and allowing God to reset our lives actually open up more space in us to be available to God in the crazy things that God would want to do for us and in us that ripple out into the world. and all of a sudden we can live our lives. We all have drama in our lives, right? We all have those things that keep cropping up and we're like, seriously, God? But we find ourselves to be able to respond to that with less and less anxiety as God opens up in us more space to know him. And that's how we become fully alive. That's how we do it. It's all connected. So here's some practical ideas, okay? I wanted to give you a few practical ideas to practice this as you might sit with this text this week. Some of you might want to do this. Take five minutes every day this week, maybe two or three days this week, and read Romans 12, 1 to 2 in the message. And let that language and the Spirit of God have its work on you. And ask God this question. God where are you at work in my everyday ordinary life what story are you writing in this crazy mixed up beautiful mess of my life and see what happens see if you gain more awareness over the week of how God is at work or some of you might want to do this I dare you take five minutes sometime during the day when you know it's critical and sit in quiet with God. Close the door to your office. Take your chair and turn it around from your computer. Go sit in a room of your house and close the door. Five minutes. Set the timer if you have to. Then you don't have to worry so much. And just rest with God. How crazy is that? Let your Bible sit right there. Let your journal sit right there. Empty your hands of whatever is in them. In fact, maybe you even want to open your hands as an indication of the posture before God that you're giving that five minutes and see what you experience, particularly as you do it over time. Take five minutes every morning this week, another option, at the beginning of your day. This is something that I've started to do because I'm kind of a freak about details. And take, literally take your calendar, take your post-it note, take your list of tasks for the day, a copy of your Outlook calendar, whatever it is. Take five minutes at the beginning of your day with your calendar or your list and look over the day's commitments and your well-planned agenda. And then just let it sit there. And stop. and turn your attention to God and say, God, okay, here's this. Well planned. I know what I have to do. But God, would you come into this and be with me in this as I go throughout the day to these different meetings, these different conversations, these challenging things, these exciting things. and see what happens over time. Do you experience your days any different? Is your awareness of God's presence with you any different? And then lastly, this is the exciting invitation I spoke about earlier, so it's time to wake up your neighbor now if they've kind of nodded off, okay? Another great next step for all of us to take as a community would be to come to an exciting event that we have planned for this fall where we can engage together as a community learning in more practical, ordinary, concrete ways how to offer our lives as spiritual worship to God. Ruth Haley Barton, renowned pastor, author, spiritual director and founder of the Transforming Center in Chicago is coming back to Church of the Open Door to facilitate a two-day retreat in which we will be learning and experiencing ways for us to open our lives to God, creating conditions for God to transform us and change us to be his presence in the world. And we'll be doing that together, spending time, the theme of the retreat is Sacred Rhythms, Arranging Your Life for Spiritual Formations, the name of her book. So the two-day retreat will be based around that. And to use Paul's language, I strongly urge you, I beseech you, Church of the Open Door, as many people as possible, to come and attend this event. Because here's the question that we've been holding in prayer. What kinds of crazy things could God do in the world for the kingdom of God if a whole community our size would intentionally give two days of their life to sit under teaching and enter into more intentional ways of opening our lives to God and deepening our experience of God? wow that is really exciting so I want you to all think about it it's in the bulletin today you can look at the details there and you can sign up at thedoor.org and for those of you that attend the two day retreat Next Steps staff Al Shuck, Julia Shermers and myself are putting together a six week experience to follow that up for those that attended the retreat and want to go deeper in October and November. So you can watch for more information on that. You will definitely walk away from this retreat inspired. I've sat under her teaching now for a little over two years. You will be changed. You will be equipped. And you will be inspired in offering your own life as spiritual worship to God. So in summary, folks, I will let you go home to your plans for the rest of the day. Offering our lives to God. A spiritual worship to God. Out of a heart of deep gratitude and awareness of what he has done and is doing and will continue to do in our lives. Is our call, our invitation, and our confrontation. And the ways in which we are being transformed is we bring our whole lives near to God. I love that picture. Picture yourself bringing the whole biography of your life and bringing it near to God, standing nearby God. It brings delight and glory to God, most importantly. It brings abundance and blessing of God to our own lives that cannot help but ripple out for good of God to the world around us.
