Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Lord, as I reflect for the third time on the word that I'm about to bring, what rises in me is gratitude to you that you have been the God of our journey as a church for years and years. I pray that by your Spirit's power and speaking right now that you would be our shepherd. Shepherd your flock as you call us to deeper and deeper things in Jesus' name. Amen. Today we are going to put a parenthesis around the study that we have been involved in these weeks dealing with the issue of power to deal with something that in 21 years of ministry here at Open Door, I have never spoken to directly, at least not in the context of a sermon. It's kind of a family talk this morning, and while visitors are certainly welcome and might even find this interesting, there's a real possibility that you won't. Actually, I think you will if you're a visitor, because we're going to speak of some things that will reveal to you who we are and what we care about. But the talk today actually is really directed to those who consider Open Door their home or are seriously considering making Open Door their home. To those of you who are involved in ministry here or want to be, it's a talk that I probably wouldn't give, to tell you the truth, if it wasn't for the fact that I was so convinced that it really is something that needs to be made clear, particularly in this season of our church's life, that we have been identifying for some time as a time of preparation for where it is we're going as a church, both physically, embodied in our physical move to Maple Grove, but spiritually as well. What I want to talk about this morning is simply this, what it means to be a member at Church of the Open Door, to be a partner in ministry here at Open Door. To be even more specific, I want to talk this morning about the process of membership at Open Door and why an understanding of this process is so central to the accomplishing of the vision for ministry that God has planted in our hearts and is now birthing in our midst. You see, while this talk is, in fact, about membership, it's really about the implementation of a vision, particularly at a time when we expect in just a few months with our move to Maple Grove, a significant, what some people are anticipating to be an overwhelming influx of new people, people who do not know who we are, who do not know what we're about, who do not know what we value or who we love. And it is entirely, and while it is entirely okay that these new people coming to us don't know those things about us when they come, number one, we need to know those things about us. And number two, we need to provide a vehicle whereby the people who are about to enter into fellowship with us can quickly and effectively get to know these things, who we are, what we value what we're about and who we love. It is therefore not only my judgment but the judgment of the elder board and the senior staff that it is critical and strategic to talk this weekend about this issue now before we get there then. It's all about preparation. Preparation has been kind of a big word around here for actually the last year, born of the end of our study in 1 John, in the first three chapters of the book of Joshua. In Joshua, the people about to cross the Jordan River, on the Jordan River, not quite gone. The word of the Lord to them was one we took for us. Before you go, number one, prepare yourselves, and number two, consecrate yourselves. This talk this morning is all about preparation for where we're going. Now, I would have to say that for me, personally, the seeds for what I'm talking about this morning really were planted about five years ago when I got a picture of what some might call a vision or maybe a word relative to what the second half of my ministry life was to be about. It's a story I've told before, so many of you have heard it. I was in a season of my life where I was kind of just recognizing that I was probably, by virtue of my age and how long I've been here, probably reaching about the halfway point of my ministry life. And I began to seek God for just some direction in terms of what the second half of my ministry was supposed to look like, not wanting to assume that it was supposed to be exactly the same. The picture I got was this, that in the first half of my ministry life, I was kind of like the leader of a parade who blew the trumpet of amazing grace as loudly and clearly as I knew how to do to an ever-growing crowd of people. It's very exciting, lots of energy. The picture was that of a parade. There are some things about a parade that are interesting. Don't want to go deeply into it. But one of the things that occurs to me about a parade is I don't know who's there. It's just nice to have you. And the more, the merrier. And the other recent thing I don't know about a parade is I don't know why you're here. I have no idea why. Some of you are because you're really committed to parades. Others, because you heard the noise and people came. And while in this picture I got, there was no rebuke as if I was supposed to have been doing something other than leading a parade for the first half of my ministry life. It was also very clear as I tried to kind of unpack what I felt like God was saying to me was that the second half of my ministry life was to be different in at least this way. That instead of leading a parade of an ever-growing crowd, I was to stop, turn around, and call out the life of God in people. Even more specific than that, to literally be part of calling out a people who bear the mark of God, who find their life in God, who have passion about their character being formed in the power of God. I shared this picture I got with people I trust, like my wife, and we would talk about it, and senior staff and elders, and among the things that happened around that word was that the word that I was getting was very much confirmed. In fact, in other ways, there were other staff, people, and elders who were feeling very much the same thing. In fact, there was a kind of fatigue, I think a holy fatigue, a boredom, if you will, with just the big noise of a parade. But as this picture came clear, there was also this little piece added. As you stop, turn around, call out the life of God in people, it's no longer a parade. You may be doing this to a significantly smaller crowd. Now, something felt very noble to me about the first half of this picture. Stop, turn around, call out the life of God. The smaller crowd, I don't know. I don't like that as much. I think I was made for a big room. The picture was that. It was a smaller crowd, at least for a while. And even back then, this was a couple years ago, it was about getting ready for something else behind the scenes. There were words, I think, that were coming through people's study of the word of God. There was this weird thing going on in the staff. and I don't think I've ever said this publicly before, about God about to do among us, this was a few years ago, a Gideon thing. And there's many things that happen to Gideon, so what are you talking about? And it's that part in Gideon's story where he had been called to do a great work, and it was a great battle. And I don't know about you, but if I'm going into a big battle, and it's a great work, I want as many people as possible. I want a really large army. Let's blow the horn and get a parade going here. More and more people. I don't care if you're really committed, just come. And I'm sure that was the spirit of Gideon. He was a warrior and he knew what it took. But God kept throwing him curveballs and the curveball was this. No less, no less. I want even less people. God gave him a significantly smaller group to start with in order to do the great work. This was a weird word. Guess what? That's happened here. Not because anybody got mad that I know of and left. Now, in our history, we've had people get mad and leave. But in the last few years, that has not been the case. In fact, in one very physical, kind of forced-on-us way, if you just pay attention to what's going on here in the last couple years, when we got forced out of Robbinsdale, we had to go where on Saturday night? Crystal. And we had to come here on Sunday. Now, if you come to the Crystal building on Saturday night, one of the first things you're going to feel is that place is packed. It's standing room only. They have to go downstairs. There's so many people here. It's about a third as many people as we were normally getting on Saturday night. But the place is packed. That was God's grace to me. That was God's grace. I know, Dave, you like the big crowd. So it's going to pack out, but you're going to have about a third. And you won't notice because you're not all there all the time. As long as the room is full, I'm happy. Same thing's going on here. It wasn't anybody was getting married. There's standing room only here a lot in this Europe round. We have significantly fewer seats. available here than we ever had at Robbinsdale. So what does that mean? You know what? Honestly, I'm not sure. You know what it means? God's up to something. God's up to something. And I'm not sure what. I don't even always know how. In fact, most of the time, I get weird pictures, and I have no idea how. Now, it was during this season that God began to stir in us these things. It's no longer a parade. We need to call the life of God out of people. About five years ago, that you began to hear some language, not just from me, but from us. Kind of a shift, not terribly subtle. It was a significant shift. We began to talk more and more about things like transformation and spiritual formation. Till Christ be formed in you became the mantra for our ministry and the focus of our vision. We changed the letterhead on our stationery at church. It's no big deal, but our stationery, our letterhead kind of key verse was that it's good for the heart to be strengthened by grace. Please hear me. It is still very good for the heart to be strengthened by grace. But now on our letterhead, it reads this, till Christ be formed in you. That's the preoccupation, the obsession of our ministry. Everything flows from there. That's the goal. We found ourselves in those years beginning to be drawn to the voices of some people. I want to sit on that just for a second. You know, there's a lot of voices, even in the context of the Christian community. And they're all speaking truth, and they call you in this direction and that direction and have this emphasis and that emphasis. Well, the voices we were finding ourselves drawn to, primarily because of what God was calling out of us, were the voices of people like Leanne Payne and Dallas Willard, pioneers in this movement of the Spirit of God in the church. And that is what it is right now, a movement of the Spirit of God in the church, of authentic transformation and how it actually happens. Like, scratch your head and wonder how it actually happens. You know why it's a good thing to wonder about? Because all too often, it doesn't seem to happen. Have you noticed that? Christians who, in the actual living of their real lives, I'm not talking about what they put on for Sunday morning show, but in the actual living of their real lives, in arenas of their lives that kind of matter, like love and joy and peace and patience, in arenas of their life that kind of matter, like relationships and how they treat people and family stability and marriages and financial integrity and issues like character, don't seem to be much different at all than many unbelievers. many people who call themselves christians may have indeed redeemed hearts but they do not have formed in god hearts what do you what do you mean by that well we've spoken of it before let me just sit on that for a second when you talk about spiritual formation and if it sounds like an intimidating word just just understand this all of you have been formed in something you have all been spiritually formed. You may not have been spiritually formed in the character of Christ, but if you came out of a family that had certain dynamics, be they healthy, be they not, you were formed in that. You've been formed by your relationships, you've been formed by the world you live in, we've been formed by our reaction to, responses to our healthy upbringing, our dysfunctional upbringing, those things form us, and then we receive Christ. And guess what? You become a brand new creature. You come alive to God. You were dead, and now you're alive. And some people report amazing things when they get saved. Now, I'll just grab one. Somebody who is an alcoholic and struggled with it their whole life, they get saved, and bang, I lost all my appeal or all my desire for alcohol right now. And it's wonderful. It was wonderful. It's kind of like, that's their Jericho experience. I don't want to get too lost here, but they cross the Jordan River. They came into the kingdom life and Jericho and the walls came down. Boom, it was gone. Some of you could, you know, could give that kind of testimony. Do you know, in the story, I'm not going to go into this deeply right now, but in the story of the people of God crossing the Jordan River, the first city they come to is Jericho and they walk around. They don't do a thing. They blow their hands. The walls fall down. Bang. They got free from, did I blow something up just now? Did I? That's cool. See if I can do it again. Anyway. You know, they get free from their proverbial alcoholism. The walls came down. Do you know that in the book of Joshua, every single city after that, they had to take by force. They had to take by force. With divine empowerment. And they took every single city. But it took effort on their part. Cooperating with God for the taking of the... That is an incredible paradigm of spiritual formation. With many people in churches who have redeemed hearts, they have not had formed in God's heart, in God's hearts. Now, part of why I think this issue of transformation has taken root and has become so central over these last few years to the ministry focus here at Open Door, indeed it's become for me and the people I work with here at Open Door a passion, is because the seeds of this transformational focus were planted in the soil of our own disillusionment around what the ministry of Open Door itself was actually producing in the lives of people, particularly what we were discerning to be the lives of the people in what I called a few moments ago the crowd, the parade of people who were coming for whatever reason we didn't even know. Dallas Willard in his book Divine Conspiracy makes it clear that this is not just an open door problem but in many ways it is an American church problem quoting a recent Gallup poll he says this 94% of Americans believe in God 74% claim to have made a commitment to Jesus Christ and about 34% of all Americans confess to a new birth experience These figures, says Willard Are shocking when thoughtfully compared to statistics on that same group For unethical behavior, crime, mental disorder Family breakups, addictions, financial misleadings and the like Could such a combination of profession of faith and failure in life Really be the life and life abundantly That Jesus said he came to give Or have we somehow developed an understanding of commitment to Jesus that does not break through to his living, transforming presence in our lives? Without question, Willard concludes, it is the latter that has occurred and with heart-rending consequences. Christianity Today recently editorialized about a rumor to the effect that a leader at a certain evangelical institution had resigned because of moral failure. The rumor was confirmed, but the magazine decided not to report it with this explanation. The cases like this had become so numerous that they needed to limit such coverage to only top-level leaders. That was interesting. So this guy wasn't big enough to make the cut. So many scandals, so many moral failures in ministry that they had to start being selective, only telling people about the nationally known people. I mean, we'll run out of room if we tell you about everybody. Mike Iaconelli, in the Wittenberg Door, December 1992 issue, tells of how from his conversion as a 10-year-old boy had always believed, and I quote, that if you were a Christian, people would see a marked difference in your life. And that the longer and closer you walked with God, the sweeter and more visible that difference would be. Now at 50 years of age, having seen so many mentors stumble and fall, some never to recover their faith, so many casualties, so many losses, I just don't believe that anymore, he said. I still believe that Jesus changes you, but my definition of change has changed. It's a positional change, a status before God change, a theological, technical change, A change that is often only visible to God. End quote. In other words, this conversion thing might be real in some spiritual, ethereal, you're saved from hell sort of way, but it will never be made visible in any arena of your life that matters. In like, oh, I don't know, how you treat people, or how you love people, or how you work through the issues of your marriage or with your children, or how you handle your money. question is he right about that is that what salvation does is that what Jesus death and resurrection was really intended to accomplish just to kind of give us fire insurance to make sure we don't go to hell thank you God for that but not to touch any other arena of our real life how we really live how we really love is that who we are is that what the church is I hope not because if that really is all there is then I really need to find something else to do with the energy of my life and what are you doing here how pitiful that is how weak that would be. How useless, how inconsequential, how ignorable. Why don't more people go to church? Do you know how easy the impotent church is to ignore? I can ignore it all day long. It has no impact unless something is real somewhere that people can see. And I'm not talking about just being odd, rigid, sour I'll stop there Jesus said to his disciples and he didn't say it with a lot of hype he didn't get them all lathered up with emotion he just looked at them one day right in the eye and he said you are the light of the world a city full of lights set on a hill cannot be hit go ahead and try you get a city full of lights sit on a hill and it's full of light, it won't be hit and people will be drawn to that. They'll just get this strange impression there might be hope there. There might be healing there. There might be shelter there. I'm going to go there. But sometimes, not always, and there are great, wonderful pockets of the real deal, but sometimes you look at the church and you go, what light is that? That we're supposed to be? Speaking of light, did I tell you that a couple months ago, in the context of prayer, I got a picture. If you're visiting and you're wondering, why are they laughing? That wasn't funny. It's because this picture I'm talking about, I've been talking about about every Sunday. In the context of prayer, just before a Sunday service, I was praying, Our Father out in heaven, hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come. I prayed that phrase. I got a picture of our building in Maple Grove, and it was full of light. As best I could tell at the time, that light was a symbol of the power of the kingdom. Thy kingdom come. The active supernatural manifestation of the spirit among us. And while I see that now, there was a sense that there is something going to happen there that is bigger than what you've seen and what you've known. Power to heal and deliver and save. signs and wonders kind of power, but also in light of what I'm speaking of this morning, transforming power, real, honest to God, power to change people from the inside out. And the metaphor around that internal transformation of God from the inside out is the picture of light. For God to fill us with light. In fact, as I unpack this a little bit more, it's like the source of light in that building. isn't just this emanation of this odd thing, like somebody came in and turned on the lights. The light is people, you and me. But it's not just any old ordinary person. It's people like you and me, in whom the life and the light of God is dwelling, from whom the light and the life of God is flowing. Shared this picture with Scott this last week, and he says, what, you have a picture of of God tabernacling among his people. Remember in the Old Testament, God brought his presence in a physical manifested, light-filled way to the tabernacle and people would come there. How does God tabernacle his presence now? Where? In you. Christ in you. Christ in me. The hope of glory. The life and light in here emanating from here. Let that picture of what God's going to do there be in your mind. But I also want to add this, That this authentic, irrepressible light of God, emanating from the people of God, is not an automatic thing. It is not without effort. I made this distinction several times in the last several weeks. Grace is not opposed to effort. It's opposed to earning. You can't earn this, but it is not opposed to effort. And this light shining through you and me is not just automatic. Indeed, Paul says it this way in Philippians 2, verse 12. If you want this light to shine, here's what you need to do, church. Work out your salvation with fear and trembling. Let me clarify what he means by telling you first what he doesn't mean by that. Number one, he does not mean work for your salvation, for it's by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. What it means, however, is this. Work out into your living where people can see it. Work out into your relationships, into your loving, into your handling of your possessions, your career, into your living where people can see it, the life of God that you have received by faith, and do that with fear and trembling. In other words, be a little bit afraid of not working out into your living where people can see it, the life of God you have. Why? Verse 15 of Philippians 2, he answers that. Here's why. Because in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, where evil men and imposters grow from bad to worse, you appear as lights. There's that light thing again. Let me paraphrase that a different way. Because in the crooked and perverse generation, where evil men and imposters are growing from bad to worse, people who are getting out here into their living, the life of God they have, are that crooked and perverse generations only hope to ever see the light. With fear and trembling, do this. It's a confusing concept, actually. Fear is almost always in the word of God spoken of as a bad thing that we need to pray against. We need victory over. Jesus said, fear not. Later on in the book of Philippians, Paul himself said, I've not given you a spirit of fears. Don't be afraid. There is a kind of fear, in fact, that does. You know about this kind of. It shuts you down. It makes you want to run. It causes you to shrink back and not move forward. That is a kind of fear we need to consistently pray against. And when I get that kind of fear, I want you to pray for me. When you get that kind of fear, I want to be praying for you. But there is another kind of fear. It's a kind of fear that Paul is speaking of in Philippians 2. That far from shutting you down wakes you up. And this is a kind of fear that most of you have been involved in as well. It's a kind of fear, that's the best word I can think of for it, that you experience when you realize that you are now in a situation where the outcome matters, where the stakes are high, and because the outcome matters and the stakes are high, this situation is going to take all of my energy. It's going to take the best shot I have. There is an adrenaline rush that causes you not to run away, but to run straight forward. In the athletic arena, I kind of can resonate with this most. I mean, some of you have played athletics. You've felt this and often even seen this in your opponent. There's times when you feel afraid on the court and it turns your knees to mush. I mean, because you're intimidated. Sometimes you see it in your opponent and you know you're going to have a very good day because they're afraid. There's another kind of fear that surges through you when you realize this is the biggest game of your life. It keeps you up all night long, but it doesn't cause you to shrink back. It causes you to move forward. Your eyes are open. Your ears are open, your nostrils are flared, and you go nuts. Here's what the Apostle Paul is saying. Work out into your living where people can see it, the life of God you have with that kind of energy. Why? Because in a crooked and perverse generation where evil men and imposters are growing from bad to worse, people who are authentically living out here where people can see the real life of God are that crooked and perverse generation's only possible hope. all of which raises a question that you're probably asking if you're paying attention to this talk the question is this what on earth does any of this have to do with membership you started on membership now you're talking nothing I just wanted to talk about this stuff actually it doesn't have anything to do with membership. If membership means to you what it's meant to me for years and years and still does with regard to many things that I'm a member of. I mean, I thought about that this week. Things that I'm a member of and what membership means to me, not so much the church, just others. And see, I'm a member of a car club, for instance. You know, that's a big surprise to some of you. You know, I love cars and that's a big deal. But what membership in this car club to me means this, is this. It's kind of an arrangement. I send them my monthly dues or yearly dues. They send me a membership card. Thank you. I got a card. I send them my yearly dues. They send me a newsletter and a monthly magazine. In fact, the only reason I joined this club was because I liked the magazine. It's really cool. It's got a lot of pictures. I do pictures well. Check it out. Anyway, I've never been to a meeting. I'm not going to go to a meeting. I've never met anybody in the club. I don't want to know anybody in the club. Very antisocial. But you know what I am? I'm a member. And I'll be ticked to you if you tell me I'm not, because I got my card. I'm also a member of the health club, which I'm sure you can tell. Does he work out? Anyway. Ah. Yes, I do. Here's what the Health Club membership means. We have an arrangement. I send in my monthly dues. They provide the services. They let me use their machines. I am a consumer. I'm a member. I have my card to show it. Here's the analogy or the connection. For many people, church membership is not much more than that. And the truth is, for many churches, church membership is not much more than that. It kind of works like this. What we get from you is your attendance and your money. It's called nickels and noses. I mean, there are people who actually talk about this. Pastors, nickels and noses, that's what it's about. And what you get from us is the show. You come, you give, we'll put on the show. You get the program, you get the services, you get the teaching, you get the place to volunteer and maybe make some friends. That is a membership based on what we will call contract. not covenant. It's a membership that appeals to consumers not disciples, not partners in ministry. Now, if membership at Church of the Open Door were based on contract our membership process would take two weeks. You'd meet the staff, you'd clarify some doctrine, we'd tell you about what we're for and what we're against, and we'd tell you about all the services we provide and we'd really hope that we provide the services that you want and if you get the membership card, then you get to complain about the services. You know how that is, because you're a member. And you get your card, and you'd have a right to vote. You're a member. Now that approach to church membership has resulted in many churches that actually boast very large membership lists. How many of you know of churches that have like, well, how many members in this church? 10,000 people. I go, wow, how many in a weekend? 500. With fewer than that involved in a meaningful way, and even fewer than that being impacted by the ministry of that church in a meaningful way. Here's the deal about that. We have never had that at Open Door. In fact, part of it, I'm sure, in the early days especially, was out of such a revulsion for that kind of membership, we so de-emphasized membership that we never ever had more members than attendees. It was always kind of the opposite. But we've also never had what we have now. rather involved process of membership. Presently 16 weeks. It's moving just now to 15 weeks, which is such a relief. You know? Whew! Only 15. I'm not going to go into now, right now, what we do in those 15 weeks, but raise the question, why is it so involved? Just assume it's involved. Why? Because rooted in and born out of a passionate desire to experience together authentic transformation in the context of a community of faith that we call a church, we are not offering to you a contract. We are inviting you into a covenant. We are not looking for clients. We are not interested at all in nickels and noses. We are looking for partners in what I believe is and is going to be a great work. by great work I do not mean big though I believe and I think many of you can tell with what is going on and where we're going that we are probably going to get very big by great I do not mean big I mean great in that it is going to call out the life of God in people in people in ways that maybe they never dreamt are going to be reformed in their hearts in places that they've lost hope that they could ever be different are going to be able to be different. It is a work that is going to generate, I believe, much light. Does that excite you? Indeed, I think it would be accurate to refer to membership at Open Door as not membership at all, but as a covenantal partnership. And a covenantal partnership is about agreeing together to do all that we can together to create an environment, to provide resources, us to you and you to us to teach us disciplines that will show us how in practical ways that I can do in my real life learning on a daily basis to receive and let in the life and the amazing love and the amazing grace of God and then to daily walk in it grow in it, become convinced of it and be, here's the word, formed by it we've all been formed by something Have you been formed by the love of God? Have you been formed by the amazing grace of God? And have you invited that love and that grace and that truth into your sexuality and into your money and into your school and into your career and into your real life? It's a covenantal relationship that says we will bring our lives together before God in a community of faith where disciples are being made till Christ be formed in us. Have we obtained it? Have we arrived? Are we fully formed? This is why God made me your pastor. No. So you know. Paul said it this way, no, I have not obtained it. What I'm sharing with you today is my dream, says Paul. Haven't obtained it. We haven't become perfect, fully formed. But this one thing I do, I press on toward the upward call of God in Christ. And we're going to fall down and we're going to stumble and we're going to flop on the floor like a fish. And we're going to pick each other up and say, you know what we're about? We're about being reformed. You still in the game? You still in it? Let's go. Here's some grace. Here's some truth. And that's what membership at Open Door is about. A couple questions occur to me around this, though. Dave, are you saying that going through a membership process at Open Door will produce transformation? Well, obviously, I just said that it doesn't. Actually, one of the things, we've been doing this for a couple years now, this process of membership, and 400-some people have gone through it. And people have reported that going through the process itself had some transformational impact on them. And part of the reason for that is that our membership process is not just an information dump. It's a process by which, in the context of community, we invite you into new ways of knowing and being with God. But the answer to the question is going through the process, something that's going to produce transformation, the answer to the question is no. The process doesn't transform you. A membership process is simply a tool. We call it an on-ramp. It's the method we have devised, I think, by the moving of the Spirit and the skill of some very gifted people in our church at leadership levels for putting this together to help put us and those who are about to join us, and that is a critical piece in this whole talk, about those who are about to join us in significant numbers to put us all on the same page, moving in the same direction, on the same journey, sharing the same values. Another question, Dave, are you saying that if we don't participate in this membership process that we're obviously not on the journey toward transformation or won't be transformed? No, I'm not saying that, and I want to say that very clearly. In fact, I know for certain that there are hundreds and thousands, millions of people who've never heard of Open Door or our vaunted membership process who have been and are being wonderfully formed in the character of Christ. I'm not saying that, you know, in fact, if some of you don't do it, you're going, oh, you must not care about for me. No, I'm not saying that. Here's what I'm saying. I am saying this, that our membership process is a critically important on-ramp to not just understand but to enter in to what we at Open Door really are about, to who we really are. And if you're here, I want to invite you to be more than here. I want to invite you to be about what we're about and to do it on purpose, not just kind of because you come on the weekend and kind of think it's going to rub off on you some way, To sign on for the journey as we strive together for the faith of the gospel. What I am saying is this. That we're really not interested in nickels and noses. I have no energy to make sure you're here. And make sure you're giving. I have no interest in offering you a contract. None at all. What I am interested in is inviting you into a covenant. That I will make and you will make. We're not looking for clients. We're looking for partners. in a work that is great that I will believe will generate much light. Important side note here. To those who are already our partners in ministry and have been for years, you know, when this process was first unveiled a couple years ago, in our exuberant conviction that this really was central to our vision and central to the pulling off of our vision and we really needed to do it, we communicated something to our present members that we really regret. It was this. We said to our present members was that if you don't go through this 15-week on-ramp process, you're not a member anymore. The result of that was this. We ended up offending our best friends. Some of our most committed, involved people who for years had already been on this journey, who for years, 15, 20, 30 years, had already been praying for and paving the way for the journey that we were now so excited about had finally come, you know, that kind of thing. And now we were telling him, you don't do this thing, you're not in. See, without realizing it, and by the way, all the mistakes I've ever made, I've made without realizing it. I mean, I've never looked at something and said, well, that's a mistake. Let's do that. I don't do that. I always think, well, that was a good idea, and I found out later, it wasn't. Without realizing it, we had inadvertently invalidated what was for some of you years of commitment and partnership, putting you in a position of needing to prove an allegiance and a partnership to open door and to the work of God in this place that you already had and had had for years. So here's the deal. People who were members before this process began are members. And we don't need to threaten you with, you won't be a member if you don't go through the process. We're not going to do it. And you know what else we don't need to do? We don't need to welcome you. New members, it would feel so weird to you. Some of you have been here 15, 20 years. Members here, involved, partnering in ministry. Welcome now. No. What we need to do to you is thank you for years of partnership. At times when it wasn't real easy to be here at Open Door, and you gave, and you prayed, and you stayed, and you served. With all that settled, let me also ever say this to those who've been our partners over years and haven't gone through this membership process thing and don't have to. I encourage you to. I want to invite you to. Check this out. You know, we didn't have this process that we have now when you came in, and you're going to love it. You will love it. Let me close with this. Dallas Willard, in his book Divine Conspiracy, again, indicates that for years the American church has spent enormous amounts of time and energy intentionally evangelizing. That's kind of been the focus. That's what we're about. And teaching people how to evangelize, believing that discipleship, or what I'm calling today, formation, would just happen. The failure of that approach is, in my mind, beyond dispute. His suggestion is to spend our time and energy intentionally developing true followers of Jesus, who, now in my words, are learning together how to get into their living where people can see it, the life and light of God they have. And as that happens, says Willard, evangelism is what will happen. How do you know that? I mean, that seems kind of naive. Here's how I know that. According to the text, Philippians chapter 2, because people who are getting out here, the life of God they have in here, where people can't see it, people like that appear as lights. They just do. And in a crooked and perverse generation where evil men and imposters are growing from bad to worse, people who are getting out here where people can see the life of God they have are that crooked and perverse generation's only hope. Because this crooked and perverse generation has seen more than they can handle of phony, baloney, Christianity garbage. if I told you about this picture I got in prayer of a building in Maple Grove full of light you know why it's full of light because it's full of people who are full of God and when you see that you will say this the kingdom has come God is calling us to a great work one that is going to generate much light let's pray as we close as I close I just have pressing back into me this sense of gratitude that you have been the God of our journey. I certainly have seen and sensed that in the time I have been here. The journey at times has been winding. The journey at times has been slow. The journey at times has been hard. The journey at times has been thrilling. But you have been the God of our journey and we hear you calling us now. I pray in Jesus' name that your people in this place, as we have been in the past, will respond in faith to the light that you are providing, to the calls that you are extending. I pray these things in Jesus' name. All God's people said, amen. Amen.
