For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Hey everybody. As we dive in today, I want to let you know that we're doing something a little different. today, and that is we're, I'm going to give a talk on baptism. Something that we do a couple times a year around here, and yet we never seem to talk about it much, so I want to talk on baptism, but I'm going to do it in such a way that I think is going to be a little bit of the roundabout way. So hang with me, okay? And before I dive into that, though, one of the things that I noticed sitting down here is there's no female voices that you're going to hear from at least up here today, and that's troubling. and so what I'd like to invite one female to do, if you would, is just where you're at, just stand up and pray for the message. Would you do that? Just where you're at, just stand up. Great. Great. Yes. Father God, we come to you. We come to you. I want to come to you to our first day. I also want to pray for the service. The name that you would give us your presence. And Lord, we ask that you are protecting each body of these people. And I would just want to thank you. Amen. Amen. Thank you. All right, now we're ready. Now we can dive in. Now we're good. I want to ask you a question. And the question is this. Have you ever been at a moment in your life where there was something really destructive and bad that you were involved in? something that was killing you. But you chose to leave it. You chose to walk away from it. And then a little bit into your journey away from this destructive thing and toward a thing that hopefully was more freeing, you stopped. Because this journey toward freedom was a lot harder than you thought it would be. And as you sit there and stop, maybe you glance back toward the thing that was destructive. and maybe it starts looking a little more attractive again to you. Have you ever been there? Maybe you left an old boyfriend recently. Maybe you're in high school and this old boyfriend treated you poorly and your friends are telling you that and you knew that and so you left him, you broke up with him. But now it's a week later and the phone calls aren't coming anymore, the texts aren't coming and the loneliness you feel the emptiness around that feels even worse than how he treated you. So maybe you're thinking, you know, maybe he wasn't that bad after all. Maybe I should go back. Have you ever been there? Or maybe you're in a family or church system, for that matter, that's really unhealthy. Lots of abuse happening. And so maybe you made the decision to break the silence and speak into what was happening. But now a little ways into that journey, the rejection you're feeling and how they're pointing at you and saying you're the problem is starting to feel a whole lot worse than even the abuse that was happening. And so maybe you're thinking on your way to freedom, maybe you're thinking, maybe I should just shut up and go back to the way it was and keep the peace. You ever been there? Or maybe you decided that the pornography you were looking at is killing your marriage. And so a couple friends said, man, you gotta stop that. And you said, yes, I have to stop that. And so you stopped, but a couple weeks into it, you had a really, really hard week at work and you're fighting with your spouse. And so you're thinking, Man, this unmedicated me is not nearly as happy as the medicated me. So maybe one more hit to get me through the week would be better than this thing I'm feeling over here. Have you ever been there? Well, I think most of us have been there in one situation or another. And the question when we're there is why does the slavery, that we would all point out as slavery, why does that start to look better than freedom? Why is it that we so seemingly often will turn back to slavery and turn our backs on freedom? Well, we're going to get some help from the children of Israel in an iconic story. portrayed in a wonderful movie many years ago by Charlton Heston. Turn to Exodus chapter 13, verse 20. And I think we're going to get some help from the children of Israel. And just setting up the story, they've just been released from Pharaoh from after 400 years of slavery in Egypt. Pharaoh finally says, after, remember all the plagues, and Pharaoh says, please, for the love of God, leave my presence because you guys are killing me. And so they leave. And picking up the story, Moses is leading them, picking up the story in Exodus 13, verse 20, we read this. After leaving, sucketh, which, you know, in the Hebrew, what that means, no. I suppose we should pronounce it sukkoth or something like that. They, that is the children of Israel, camped at Etham. That's south of, they were moving south on the edge of the desert. And by day the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way. And by night in a pillar of fire to give them light. So they could travel by day or night. Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people. God was what? Present. And leading them. Into the what? Wilderness. Fascinating. Because we always want God to lead us into, you know, right into the promised land, right? Do not pass go, do not collect 200. Anyway, that's a monopoly reference that was not needed. Starting now, verse 14, or sorry, chapter 14, verse 1. Then the Lord said to Moses, sort of an interesting thing. He says in verse 2, Now, one of the things you need to know about the Hebrew scriptures is language is really important. When the writers throw certain names in there and certain words in there, they should act as huge flashing lights. And so a couple words that we need to examine. The first phrase is turn back. because they're traveling, being led by the Lord, and they've gone south and they've hit the Red Sea and they've turned north again to go around it. But this word turn back is the Hebrew word shuv. It's where we get the word teshuva, which is repeated over and over again all throughout the Hebrew Scriptures. It means to return or to repent. Return to what will bring you freedom because you've wandered away. And so this word shuv is amazing. And it's when Jesus enters the scene, you know, several thousand years later, some of his first words are teshuva, repent and believe. That the way of slavery really isn't the best way. The way of freedom is the way toward life. That's what he says. when you're at this moment dial back into your own moment where you've walked away from slavery toward freedom but you stopped because slavery is starting to look a lot better than the freedom you're experiencing when you're at that moment I want to call that moment your sacred moment of choosing what will you choose? Deuteronomy 30 it says therefore choose therefore a choice is set before you life and death. And in the sacred moment of choosing, it really is your choice. What will I choose? Well, Israel is at a sacred moment of choosing. And in this moment where the Lord tells them to turn back, and this is where language is so interesting. He says, And what that word means is the mouth of freedom. Very interesting. The Lord is saying to the children of Israel, million of them or whatever it is, I want you to turn around and camp at this place that I'm going to call the mouth of freedom. And then we read that it's between Migdal and the impassable Red Sea. Migdal is sort of an elevated watchtower that the armies from Egypt could come and stand on and look over the whole land and see where people were at. And so they are in between the armies of Egypt that could look down on them, vulnerable and exposed as sitting ducks, and the impassable Red Sea. And the Lord is saying, this is where I want you to what? Set up camp. At the mouth of freedom. Even worse, as it says, it's directly opposite Baal Zephon, which is the false god of Canaan, the false god of the north. And directions in the Hebrew mean certain things, and north means hidden. So you're directly opposed, directly opposite from the false god of hiddenness, the false god of deceit. So you need to know when you're at that moment where you've left the old boyfriend, you've left pornography, you've left deceit, and you've started to walk toward freedom, but then you stop and you say, is it worth it? You're standing at the mouth of freedom. And why it feels so terrifying is what are you in between? Your enemies and the impassable Red Sea. She'll never change. I'll never get over it. I'll never be able to do it. I can't go there. And you're directly opposed by the false god of deceit that would have you know and believe that slavery is better than freedom. And that is why you feel so terrified at the mouth of freedom. And some of you are at that spot right now. Now let's read about what the children of Israel feel at this moment. In between verse 3 where we left off and verse 10 where we're going to pick up, Pharaoh and the Egyptian army decides, wait a minute, we've lost our entire slave labor force. and so our economy is going to tank because the bricks they were making, someone else is going to have to make them. We're going to have to pay them to make it. So they pursue the children of Israel to what? Enslave them again, right? Okay. Well, verse 10. This is amazing. As Pharaoh approached, Exodus 14, as Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up. Remember, they were in between Migdal and the sea, so they looked up to Migdal, this watchtower, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them, and they were terrified, and they cried out to the Lord. They said to Moses, was it because there was no graves in Egypt that you brought us out to the desert to die? I love that. Now, a little side note. They were afraid that the Egyptian army was going to kill them. What was the Egyptian army going to do? Enslave them. One of the ways that you know that you're standing at the mouth of freedom is that you feel like you're going to die. But you're not going to die. This thing just wants to enslave you again. And in a way, that's worse. What the false god of deceit would have you believe is that that enslavement is better than the freedom that you're walking toward. So let's pick up the story here. Halfway through verse 11. What have you done, Moses, to us by bringing us out to Egypt? Didn't we say to you in Egypt, leave us alone? I'm pretty sure they didn't say that, actually. Pretty sure they said, get us out of here, right? Let us serve the Egyptians, as if that's some noble thing. It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than die in the desert. The word Egypt means narrow place, the place where you cannot worship God. Wouldn't it be better, they're saying, for us to serve the place where we can't worship God than move to the place where we can see and hear God again? Fascinating. And if you're feeling that, that sense of exposure, you're a sitting duck, you're about to die because you're at the mouth of freedom, wanting to move back into slavery, you need to hear something in order to not go back into slavery. You need to hear something from God because when you're sitting there like a sitting duck, exposed and vulnerable in this mouth of freedom, if God doesn't move, you will become enslaved again. So in verse 13 of Exodus 14, this is the word of the Lord to the children of Israel and to you. If you're in the mouth of freedom right now, Moses answered the people, do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance that the Lord will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today, you will never see again. Verse 14, the Lord will fight for you. You need only be still. The Lord will fight for you at the mouth of freedom. You need only be still. Now that is exactly the opposite from what we feel right then, isn't it? You're exposed. You're in between the enemy and the impassable sea. You're directly being opposed by the false God of deceit who is telling you, go back to slavery. All you want to do is run. And the Lord says, you need right now to camp at the mouth of freedom. And some of you are there right now. And the word that the Lord says to you is, I will fight for you and you need to be still. So let's see what the Lord does. Verse 21, Exodus 14. See, what happens is this. God makes a way to cross over where there seemed to be no way. And this is where language matters again. And remember I said that directions in Hebrew have specific meanings. North meant hidden. It says that the Lord brought a strong east wind. And we associate east with where Eden was, which was in the east. And so east means beginning. So when you're standing at the mouth of freedom, what the Lord does is bring with him a new beginning. It's amazing. Even this phrase in Exodus 14, 21, where it says the waters were divided. Where else in the Hebrew scriptures do you hear that language? The waters were divided. In Genesis 1, the creation. God is saying to the children of Israel, I am freeing you from your slavery and I am bringing you into a new beginning so that you can be my people, my demonstration to the world that when they are terrified and standing at the mouth of freedom, surrounded by their enemies in the impassable sea, directly opposed by the false God of deceit, I want you to be a people that stands firm with them and says there is a way through. That's the call on God's people and that's what God is calling his people to become. now after they pass through the waters come back together and the Egyptian army perishes in the sea but what else dies in the sea? their identity as slaves dies in that Red Sea that day now it doesn't mean they're never going to have one temptation to go back but their identity as slaves is put to rest and they get a new identity as God's people given a new beginning to start a new community in the promised land where it would be a demonstration of God's ways on the earth calling people to stand with others in their mouth of freedom saying there is a way to go through. Now you may say that's a sweet story makes a good movie. It does make a good movie. But we're not really connected to it, you know. I mean, those people weren't even Christians. Well, our story goes back quite a ways. It goes back all the way to this story, in fact, and further. And there's a thread that connects our two stories together in a way that's pretty amazing. in 1 Corinthians 10. I want to read you four verses that tells you what the threat is. So if you have your Bibles, turn there. 1 Corinthians 10, verse 1. Paul writing here, I don't want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea and they all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. Remember when Moses strikes the rock with his staff, and what comes out? Water comes out. Living water. Jesus comes out of the rock. You ever heard anywhere else in the scriptures when we read about living water? Anywhere? Well, Jesus found himself at his own sacred moment of choosing in a different garden, not the Garden of Eden. But it was at the mouth of freedom himself when he was at the Garden of Gethsemane. And on one side, he was looking at the sin and death that was enslaving people that he loved. And on the other side, he was seeing the future. His community, a new community of people that would be the redeemed, that would call other people that there would be a way to cross over. And he was directly opposed from the false god of deceit, Satan thinking that he was going to win, thinking that he was taking Jesus down, thinking that this was his final victory. But Jesus chose wisely. He did not choose for us to be enslaved forever. He chose to march to the cross and die to death we couldn't die so that we could live a life that he could bring us. In Colossians, it's a little letter that maybe you've heard about. Chapter 2, verse 13. We read this. When you were dead in your sins, dead in the identity as slaves, And in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all of our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us. He has taken it away, nailing it to the cross, and having disarmed the powers and authorities, the false God of deceit, he made a public spectacle of him and them, triumphing over them by the cross. The cross was the mouth of freedom that enabled us to cross over and become a new people, become crossover people, become people that when we stand at the mouth of freedom, surrounded by our enemies in the impassable Red Sea, our shout, our declaration is, we will not die. We have a way through because we are crossover people. we don't have to go back to slavery. There's a new way and a new life. And some of you, some of you, this year made that crossover. You left a life of slavery and moved toward freedom and moved past the mouth of freedom where you were terrified and you kept going toward life. And Jesus brought you through the Red Sea. And if that is you, if some, in some way this year, That was you. What I want you to do, and we almost never do this kind of thing around here, but if you would, I want to invite you to stand up so that we can just give a witness to your new life. So if that was you this last year, just stand up where you're at. Now, yeah, just keep standing if that's you. you are crossover people. You are a part of the community of the redeemed. And you've been given a new beginning. Amen? Okay, you guys can have a seat. Thank you. we're crossover people and some of you right now june 6 2010 are standing at the mouth of freedom and you're scared to death because the enemies are on one side and the impassable red sea is on the other side there's no way to cross over. You're being lied to by the false god of deceit at every turn. You're there right now. And slavery looks a lot better than freedom. And so what I want to do for you, if that's you, is just pray for you. I would never ask you to stand up, because that's, you're feeling way too vulnerable anyway. But I do want to pray for you. So if that's you, just in your own spirit, say, Lord, I receive this. I want to put your hands out in front of you, or whatever, but I just want to pray for you. And And those of you who maybe aren't in that place, you can pray as well. You pray as well. Jesus, you are the spiritual drink that nourishes us. You are the one that enabled us to cross over. You're the one that accompanied us through the waters, away from death and into life. And so by the power of your Holy Spirit, which raised Jesus from the dead, I pray that you would give these dear ones strength to wait for your deliverance. And I pray that you would be strong and fight for them. And that they would see their deliverance today. That they would teshuva. That they would repent and return to you. Right now. and leave their life of slavery and walk into freedom. Come, Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. Baptism. Get it? Well, we do two sacraments at Open Door. One, communion, which we'll do in a few minutes, and the other one is baptism, which you don't hear a whole lot about. And that's one of the reasons why we're talking about that is because you don't hear a whole lot about that. Baptism is the declaration from the community of Jesus that someone has gone from death to life, that someone has turned their back on slavery and walked to freedom. And it's not just a, you know, it's not membership dues or a place where you say, I believe. It's a place where you say, I am a part of a community of people, the church of Jesus, that is called to be a demonstration to the world, that is called to stand at the mouth of freedom for the terrified ones who don't know what to do, to stand at that mouth of freedom with others and say there is a way through. Amen? That's the call of the church of Jesus. And so that's what we do when we gather for baptism. So I want to invite those of you who have never been baptized before and who have crossed over from death to life, from slavery to freedom, to be a part of our baptism service this August 15th. How you do that is just right at the end of the service, you'd walk out in the gathering place. There's a baptism kiosk. You'll see it right away. Just, if you're interested in that, just sign your name and you'll get an email explaining how it works and what to do and what's involved in it. So I really want to encourage you, if that's you, be a part of this declaration with us. And for the rest of you, maybe you've been baptized or maybe you're not even interested in that. I want to encourage you to join us on August 15th. It's Sunday afternoon, right after the 11 o'clock service. We're going to French Park, and it's going to be a huge party. Give witness to the life that God is doing in this church. It's August 15th. You'll find out more about it. Because Jesus is bringing a strong east wind into the world. A new beginning. And we are part of it. And in these moments, we recognize it and celebrate it. Now as we come to the table, this other sacrament, one of the reasons we come to the table is because we are always moving from slavery to freedom, are we not? We are always and frequently standing at the place where slavery looks better, but freedom calls. And so we come to the table every single month to remind us that what is real and what is life is the body and the blood ingested in us because the living water needs to be in us so that we would be reminded that the way of Jesus is the way of freedom. And the name of the God who makes us cross over people is Jesus. Amen? Amen.
