Thank you, choir. Let's pray as we go to the Word this morning. Father, my desire this morning is that by the preaching of the Word and the working of your Spirit, for some of us this would be the planting of a seed, and that for others it would be the fanning of a flame. So plant the seed and fan the flame, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Most of you, I'm sure, are aware, if you've been with us these last several months, that the word we've been dealing with and responding to, born originally of 1 John 5, and then it kind of pressed into Joshua chapters 1 through 3, is that as we anticipate where it is we're going as a church, both physically, as it's kind of embodied in our move to Maple Grove, but also spiritually as it relates to the kind of people God's calling us to be and the things he's calling us to do in a spiritual sense, that we need to be using this time of transition, of waiting for the move to, number one, prepare ourselves, and number two, consecrate ourselves in three vitally important arenas of life, money, sex, and power. And for several times I've told you why those three things are the things we've landed on, and I'm not going to go into that today. Having dealt extensively, as you know, with the issue of money and then sex as well. We began two weeks ago to deal with this issue of power. Establishing in that introductory talk a couple of things I'd like to remind you of as a way of setting the table for what we're doing this morning. Number one, that power in and of itself is not an evil thing. Admittedly, when disordered, we all know what power can do and what it does historically, globally, personally. We have seen it. We have experienced it. For disordered power crushes, destroys, damages, wounds badly people. In our grasping demand for ascendancy and total control, wars are fought, lives are shattered, marriages are dissolved, churches are split, relationships are destroyed, leading us often to believe that all manifestations of power are inherently evil and are therefore to be summarily avoided, mistrusted, dismantled, and relinquished. But nothing could be further from the truth. For there is a kind of power at work in the world that does not tear down, it builds up. There's a kind of power at work in the world that doesn't crush, it lifts. That doesn't wound, it heals. That doesn't destroy, it creates. and it's the kind of power that the world desperately needs. It's the kind of power that the community we are moving to as a church desperately needs and would positively respond to. We've referred to this kind of power as rightly ordered power. I would call it kingdom power. Bottom line is this. While disordered power is frighteningly destructive, rightly ordered power speaks to and reveals some of the most noble instincts known to man for rightly ordered power uses power to build and create to serve and protect to restore and heal so on that Sunday coming up not too many Sundays from now that we consecrate our power to God like we consecrated our sexuality and then our money when we come to God as a congregation in this room, consecrating our personal power to God, I'm sure that part of that consecration will be a recognition that we need to repent, first of all, of all the ways we have used our personal power to control people and crush people, to use and manipulate people to our own ends. And then we'll ask God on that day to forgive us, but then we will ask God to fill us with the kind of kingdom power that serves and builds and protects and heals. And on the day that we make that consecration, that's the day that we will be ready to move to Maple Grove. Now there's going to be a day when our building is ready, and that's the day we're ready to move. I'm here to tell you, the day we're ready to move is the day we are a consecrated people. Second thing I want to remind you of around this power issue is that we have made a distinction between what I call positional power and personal power. Positional power is, as you recall, that which I have by virtue of my position. Office, title, credential, or decree. Decree is the basis of positional power. Positional power is a legitimate kind of power, but it is external and temporary in nature. I use the illustration of a police officer who by virtue of his or her positional power can make you stop your car. I have no idea what kind of person that police officer may be. It doesn't matter what kind of person they are. They turn on their lights. I pull over my car. It's called positional power. Personal power is a different thing. Having more to do with the kind of person you actually are than the office you hold. Jesus, best example of this, we noted last time, had very little positional power. No titles, degrees, or office in his earthly ministry. But when he spoke, people marveled. For he spoke as one having authority. Matthew 7, verse 29. Not like the scribes and the Pharisees who incidentally had positional power, but no personal power. The basis of Jesus' authority was not just that he was God. I'm sure that had something to do with it. The basis of his authority and the thing that people picked up was that his life, his personal integrity matched his words and the people discerned that to be authority. All of which raises the question of the day that we will probably be pursuing for a couple of weeks. The question is this. Is it possible for ordinary people like you and like me to gain access to, to live in the reality of rightly ordered personal power? To literally walk in the same kind of power, authentic authority that Jesus had? In other words, is there a path to power? Is there a route I can follow that will get me to this place of a desirable kind of power that will be manifested in my relationships, in my family, in my church, in our community, in the world? Well, the answer to that question is yes, there is a path. But I need to warn you about this path to authentic kingdom, rightly ordered power. It's an odd path. It's an unfamiliar path for many of us, myself included, and is a path that is full of paradox and seeming contradiction. For the truth is this, if you are in fact on this path to rightly ordered kingdom power, you will probably find yourself walking into things and experiencing things that feel like and seem to be the very antithesis of power. Indeed, one of the ways, ironically, that you can know that you're on the right path to authentic power is if it feels like you're on the wrong path. You're not making any sense. Here's why. Because the path to authentic kingdom, rightly ordered power, doesn't always look or feel very powerful when you're on the path. Let me explain that by examining, not only today, but over the next couple of weeks, several scriptures that illustrate and explain this path to power that I'm trying to describe. Today we will examine two scriptures and weeks to come others. The first is one we actually got a glimpse of a couple of weeks ago in the first talk. I ended the sermon just by reading this, Matthew chapter 20. We're going to look at it in a bit more detail from a different angle. Open your Bibles to it if you have them. I think it's also going to appear on the screen, beginning in verse 20, Matthew 20. Let me set it up. Jesus, in this chapter, has been speaking to his disciples about the kingdom of God and how through his death and resurrection its power would be demonstrated. Speaking of power, the mother of the sons of Zebedee's ears perked up, and she came to Jesus in verse 20. with her sons, who happened to be James and John, bowed down to him, making a request of him. And he said to her, what do you want? And she said to him, as long as you're talking about power in the kingdom of God, command that in your kingdom of power, these two sons of mine, these little two priests, these little boys, may sit. One on your right hand of power and one on your left hand of power. I'm adding the power there to the text because that's clearly what she's talking about. But Jesus answered and said to her, I'm quite sure very gently, you do not know what you're asking for. Are you able to drink the cup that I'm about to drink? And they said to him, they now being James and John, we are able, which by the way was probably a demonstration of disordered power. Why do you think they thought they were able? because of their strength, because of their commitments. We're able. And he said, my cup you will drink, but I know one thing about you right now. You are not ready to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and that one day you will drink as well of suffering and loss and obedience in the middle of it. But this business of who's on my right and left is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my father. He is speaking there kind of cryptically, almost hauntingly of a cup, and you're able to bear it. You will one day drink it. You can't drink it now. I think wonderfully, gently, in verse 25, he kind of brings it down to a level. They're ready to receive right now and speaks in very concrete terms these words. You guys want to talk about power? Let's talk about power. You know how the rulers of the Gentiles exercise their power. These big guys, how they lord it over the people that they're over and their great men, as you define greatness, use their greatness to throw their weight around to get what they want, to exercise authority over the people that they're over. It's not to be so among you. If you want to talk about power, here's how it works in the kingdom. This is the path you're going to walk. Whoever wishes to become great among you, really powerful, sit at the right and the left. Here's the path. You should become the servant. Whoever wishes to be first among you, you shall be your slave. And then speaking of himself, he says, Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many. The path to power he is saying here to people who are desiring power, James and John and the rest of the disciples, is an odd path. It's an unfamiliar path. And I even think when Jesus said this to them, he knew that they didn't get it. I don't think they got it. They might have, like we do in Sunday school, nodded their heads, well, it's really nice you serve, yeah, it's really good. I don't think they got it. The path to power is the way of the cross where we lay down our rights, lay down demands to be served, and none of that, laying down rights, demands to be, none of that looks like power to me. Does it to you? It's not the familiar path. This is Palm Sunday. And because it's Palm Sunday, this is my Palm Sunday sermon. If for no other reason that this is Palm Sunday and I have a sermon, It's my Palm Sunday sermon. Truth is, however, this, I think, is a wonderful word for Palm Sunday. Picture it in your mind. Jesus is entering the city on that wonderful day to the shouts of Hosanna. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. And they were waving their palm branches. And it was a great celebration. And everyone was excited for their king was coming. They did not understand the kingdom that he was bringing. And they were quite sure he was coming with a kind of power as a king. that was going to uproot the physical kingdoms of the world, and they would finally get rid of the Romans. Hosanna, blessed are you, the man of power. And he came riding in on a what? On a colt. Not even a full-grown horse or a donkey. A little baby won at that. I would not have done that. Bad PR move, I think. I'd have come in on a Harley. I'd have come in on a big Harley. A really, wouldn't you? I'd have had a limo. If I'm the king, that's what the president, I mean, that would have even been a symbol of my what? Power. Okay, forget the limo and the Harley. A chariot. Give me a chariot or something. A big horse. He comes in on a colt. He did it on purpose. The colt didn't look powerful. I wonder even if in the crowd and all the shouting and the excitement and all the enthusiasm, I wonder if anybody looked at him and said, huh? Because he was sending a message. He was giving them a very strong hint of something they still didn't get. The path to his power was going to be a different path. The cult didn't look powerful. A few days later, he was nailed to a cross, and that didn't look like power either. In fact, it looked weaker than the cult. A few hours after that, he was lying lifeless in a tomb. and I'm telling you this, that looked even weaker than the cross. It didn't look like power. But please let this in. That was the path he took. And the path he took led to real power because three days later he rose from the dead. It's the path of power. It's just a weird path. I don't get this path. I mean the whole point of being powerful, as I understand power and my even desire to have it, is that when you are powerful, the perk of it is you get people to serve you. You get to call the shots. You get to throw your weight around. You get to be in control. You get to be the boss. That's why we want power, because we want to be in control. We like to throw our weight around. We like people to say how high when we say jump. We like to be in control and be the boss. Anthony Campolo, in his book, The Power Delusion, spoke of a time in his book when he was doing a family life seminar dealing with marriages and things like that in the church someplace when a man stood up in the question answer time near the end of the seminar and said this Mr. Campolo you still haven't answered the most important question relative to marriage who's supposed to be the head of the house in other words who gets to be the boss who gets to be served who gets to decide well Campolo responded in his inimitable style with all the subtlety of a freight train when he said to that man, to ask that question at all reveals that you don't get it at all. I have a feeling the place fell pretty silent at that moment. He went on to say this, if you understood Jesus, you wouldn't even ask that question. In fact, that question is the same question that Mary, the mother of James and John, asked Jesus, and then he read Matthew 20, the text that we're dealing with right now. Verse 25, it's the Gentiles who play the power games. It's the Gentiles who ask the questions, who's the master, who's the head, who gets to be the boss, who gets to lord it over. It's the Gentiles who exercise authority. So I'm going to say it again, and it's not to be so among you. whoever wishes to become great you want to become great your big question is who gets to be the head who gets to be the master here's my answer you don't hear my answer you don't like my answer here's my answer you want to establish headship forget about the home anywhere in your life master be the boss here's how it comes in the kingdom become the servant of all that's the path to power in fact says Jesus that's the path if you pay real close attention you'll notice this real subtle thing that's the path I followed says the Lord I came not to be served but to serve and to give my life away and that's how he got his power now I don't know where the conversation that this guy with Kampalo in this conference went after that I'm not sure Campolo hadn't handled it the most gentle way he could have there and I don't know how he responded he might have been humiliated you know sat down and shut up he might have been convicted he might have become indignant I might have become indignant saying you know possibly to myself what do you mean I don't get it and I know what I thought of Ephesians 5 and I don't know if he did but you can just kind of imagine doesn't Ephesians 5 say wives be subject to your husbands as unto the Lord, for the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. So that means I get to be the head. I get to be the boss. And that's why I asked you the question, who gets to be the head, because I was hoping you'd tell my wife that, because she won't let me. Okay, I'll tell her that. I'll tell her that. But before I tell her that, let's talk about a very important question that isn't needing to be answered simply by men, but by men and women, by children and adults, by anybody who names the name of Jesus. Let's ask a very important question. How did Christ, who is the head of the church, you all agree he's the head of the church, how did Christ, who is the head of the church, come into his headship in the church? How did he establish his authority? What was his path to power, to headship, to being the master? Well, I want to tell you about the path. It was an odd path. The path he took was an unfamiliar path. And the path he took didn't look like power. The path to power for Jesus and for his disciples is the way of the cross. The path to power was when he laid down his rights and his demand to be served and he served and he gave his life. So who gets to be the boss? Who gets to be the master? The one who serves like that. So husbands, Ephesians 5.25 Love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up there. You want to be the head. That's the path. By the way, while we're in Ephesians 5, let me just explain something that I don't have opportunity to explain often. The key to Ephesians 5, and Ephesians 5 is that big, you know, especially guys tend to go to their wives, be so miss with your husbands. The key to Ephesians 5, the whole chapter, is verse 21 where Paul says, men and women children and parents everyone who names the name of Christ here's the word for all of you be subject one to another in the fear of Christ in other words out of your deference to Christ and submission to him as the true head use all of the strength and capacity you have as a man as a woman as a child as a whatever to get underneath the people who are around you to lift them Be subject one to another. Be serving one another in the fear of Christ. That's the main message he's giving. First he talks to women. Women, do that with your husbands. Then he speaks to husbands. Husbands, do that with your wives. Like Christ did it with the church, lay down your life for her. Then in chapter 6 he talks to children. Says the same thing. Then he talks to parents. Says the same thing. Then he talks to masters. Then he talks to slaves. it's how we relate in the kingdom of god serving one another and when that kind of mutual subjection to one another not being served but serving is going on in a relationship who's the boss is a moot point i was talking about this with bonnie uh yesterday the day before it doesn't matter when last couple days um about this very thing we've been married 28 years and we do not have the perfect marriage. Evidence of that would be that I'm in it. That's all you need to know. There you go. So I'm not trying, I'm not saying this you know, to stir up that kind of idea. It's not true. But I can, in 28 years of marriage, we've never had a big I can't even imagine saying to my wife, well, it's because I'm the boss. I mean, the way I would say that is if I was like trying to just irritate her. Which I would maybe do. It's a moot point. in the kingdom of God the question is not how can I be master the question is how can I serve it's not the question we often ask and it's a very unfamiliar path but it's the path to power a couple of months ago I was in Atlanta with Bonnie and among the things I had to do there was preach and I was in a wonderful church wonderful people I really enjoyed my time there. But at the end of all the services, I wasn't quite ready for this. They kind of give me, you know, no limits. You know, if it's a communion service, I have to preach shorter. But this was a communion service. They said, no, just preach. So they just kind of tacked the communion on the end, and they passed us things, and it went very, very quickly. But when the pastor asked the stewards to come forward to serve us the meal, as it were, I noticed something odd. At least it was odd to me. Maybe no one else. What I noticed was this. It was only men who were serving. and my first day on that was no big deal I mean I'm a visitor so it doesn't matter why they're doing that maybe it's a special Sunday and it's just men's Sunday we're going to show how men can serve and I thought it was just kind of sad and limiting and I was really glad we don't do it that way I'm glad that we have men and women and sometimes children serving and it's a symbol of this is a servant who had symbol but then I discovered through some discussion and just kind of listening to what was going on that this wasn't just you know men's Sunday this was a rule there was a rule that not only men would serve but women couldn't serve. Only men could serve. Curious, I asked about that because I'm curious and stupid as well. I asked someone I thought was safe. It was the friend who actually had been instrumental in us coming to this church and we were just talking about the fact that I just noticed it. It didn't even tick me off particularly that men were serving but I just noticed it. In the course of her explaining it and reacting to it, she said the most amazing thing in what I think might have been an unguarded moment. She said, you know, it's really odd about only men being allowed to serve this meal. And the picture is that of a meal. You know, they're serving the bread and they're serving the wine. It's kind of dinner time and they're serving. What's weird is that in this particular culture, not only in Atlanta, but in this church culture, most men wouldn't be caught dead serving a meal any other place. and by the way that's not a condemnation of those particular men who were serving that day because that might not have been true she was talking kind of a bigger picture thing of the church culture and the culture of that city even secularly wouldn't be caught dead serving a meal anywhere else but they'll serve it here and the women who serve at home all the time like really serve aren't allowed to serve it here and immediately the symbolism of their serving changed for me from being a symbol of servanthood to being a symbol of superiority because the reason I'm serving this bread and this cup is because I can't it says that they're even saying that without saying that I can and you can't I have the power and you don't primarily because I'm a man and you're not it's kind of the ultimate positional power once again I want to underscore the fact that the men who were specifically on that Sunday serving communion might have had tremendous personal power. They might have been the ultimate expressions of servanthood in their home and in community. But the picture of that is incredible. And what troubles me about it most is how familiar that kind of power is to me. That path of power is a familiar path. And sometimes we don't even question those kinds of paths because they're so familiar, they feel like the right path. I'm telling you that if you're on the right path, it's going to feel like the wrong path. Please note, this is not about men serving communion and women not being able to. That's an example. For the familiar path to power is bigger than that example. The familiar path to power says things that you and I say all the time and live out in ways we're not even aware of. The familiar path to power says you get power by being the biggest, by being the fastest, by being the smartest. In some contexts, you get power by being the prettiest, by being the sexiest. Some contexts, people get power by being the neediest. How many of you know that? How many of you know that there's somebody in your family system or work system who gets enormous amounts of power? The whole church or the whole family revolves around this person's neediness. It's all about power and control and getting what they are. Because I'm just so, they play the victim. Get all sorts of power. The familiar path to power is the path that says you get power by grabbing it for yourself. By being always in control. By finding ways to look like a servant without really being a servant. Anybody here know how to look like a servant without being one? I do. Jesus in Matthew 23, a section of scripture that I can't possibly imagine leaving this series on power without doing some examination of where Jesus is confronting the scribes and the Pharisees who were the quintessential example of people who had positional power but were using their positional power to crush people he said of them among other things this they love to do their deeds to be noticed by men in other words they love to and they have figured out how to look like a servant without being a servant they love the place of honor at banquets and respectful greetings in the marketplace where people loudly say hello rabbi but what they do with that power is this They tie heavy weights on the backs of men and women and do nothing to use their power to lift that weight off of them to liberate people, to heal people, to serve people. They use their power to crush people and to prove to the people that they're the ones with the power. Right in the middle of this conversation, Jesus says again, almost what this is, is kind of a mantra for him, that he says, I think when he says it, he says it softly, knowing that some will get it and most will not. Matthew 23, verse 11, But the greatest among you, as long as we're talking about power, shall be your servant. It's an entirely different path to power. Keep this in mind, the scribes and the Pharisees were probably the most powerful people that anybody had ever known. They were the definition of power. but I am calling you to a different path. It's an unfamiliar path. So odd is this path that if you're truly beginning to walk it it's going to feel like the wrong path because it won't feel powerful and it won't look powerful as you define power. Second scripture I want to examine this morning is Philippians chapter 2 verse 6 where it says of Jesus this that although he existed in the form of God, open your Bibles to Philippians chapter 2. I'll erase you. There it is. I won. I feel very powerful. Although he existed in the form of God, verse 6, chapter 2, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but did a most amazing thing, did God. He emptied himself, taking the form of a bondservant and being made in the likeness of men. And being found in the appearance of a man, he humbled himself further by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on the cross. Therefore, verse 9, and this is what you need to catch. Precisely because he walked that path of emptying himself, becoming a servant, he got power. It was the path to power. Look at what it says. God gave him power. God highly exalted him, bestowed on him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow. Why? Because he's got power. Those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of the Father. Two things about that text I want you to notice. Number one, it's a very strange path to power. When he emptied himself, when God became a man, and wound up in a manger, in a stable, it didn't look like power. Does that look like power to you? When he was nailed to a cross, it didn't look like power. Very strange path to power. Second thing I want you to notice about that passage, however, is this. That path to power worked. Meaning, it yielded real power. Not just because God highly exalted him and gave him a name above every name. That's one manifestation, obviously, and proof that that path works. But at a much more personal level, that path to power works on me. And I'm guessing on many, most, I hope, all of you. I'm going to explain that this way. You see, beloved, and many of you could give this same testimony as I'm about to give. What captured my heart, what conquered me, was not that he was God and could crush me like a bug, so I better repent and avoid hell. The face of God painted for many of us as we were growing up in church. I didn't hear that message in church. Go to camp and I could hear it there. There were places I could always find a message that would basically, over and over, in a way that frightened me, designed, quite frankly, to scare the hell out of me, so I would go to heaven, remind me of what a little slimy worm I was, and God, in his infinite glory and power, was going to crush me like a bug unless I raised my hand and accepted Jesus. Guess what I did? I raised my hand. Twelve times. I'd have done anything. I mean, I'd have jumped around on my one foot barking like a dog if I thought that would help me escape hell. But that face of God did not capture my heart. It got my compliance. See, what captured my heart was when it dawned on me that though he was God and could crush me like a bug, he didn't. And he had no desire to. Instead he did the most amazing thing. He emptied himself and took on the form of a slave. Instead he came not to be served, which is what I expect of God, but to serve and to give his life a ransom for me. Guess what? He got me with that. And you know what? He got me for life. I'm his. He captured my heart when he emptied himself and took the most unfamiliar path, and it meant power. You know what? He's got power in my life right now. You know what God says to me? It matters more than what you think of me. It matters more than what you say to me. He's got a lot of power. You know why? Because he emptied himself. He conquered my heart with power in yours too, but it was a power that didn't look like power. He took a different path. I love how Brennan Manning says this in his book, The Signature of Jesus. The cross of Christ, he says, reminds us that we are not going to be helped or healed by God's raw power, but by God's laying aside his power for love. Raw power can force change. Only love can move us to change. On December 13, 1969, Manning says, all of that broke in on me as a gift of amazing grace. When during a long and lonely hour of prayer, I heard in faith Jesus Christ say to me, Brennan Manning, for love of you, I left my father's side and emptied myself. Brennan, I came to you who ran from me, fled from me, who did not want to hear my name. Brennan Manning, for love of you, I was covered with spit, punched, beaten, and affixed to the cross. Brennan's response was this. I can just hear him saying this. Jesus, are you crazy? Are you out of your mind to have loved me so much? You got me with this one, said Brennan. Since that day, he went on to say, whether I am in a state of grace or disgrace, elation or depression, That experience with God quietly lives on in me. I looked at that crucifix the day this happened for a long time. Figuratively, I saw the blood streaming from every pore of his body and heard the cry of his wounds saying this, Brennan Manning, this isn't a joke. It isn't a laughing matter to me that I have loved you so much. Ultimately, says Manning, It wasn't his power that captured my heart. It was his love that had the power to capture my heart. To which I say, me too. But then there comes a curveball. Curveballs are designed to trick us and make us miss. That's where the analogy breaks down. This is a curveball you can hit if you want to. Here's the curveball. is through this text, Philippians chapter 2, verse 5. I hear Jesus say to me personally and to us open door this word. David Johnson, Church of the Open Door, I know you love me. And I'm really glad you worship me. I love to listen to you sing. But what I really want, David, an open door, is this. I want you to join me. What? What? See, the part of that text I have not read is the beginning of that text. Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 says, Have this attitude in you, which was also in Christ, who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself. It's a very strange path. I walk that path. And then he looks and says, I want to invite you to walk the path too. This is the path to power. Want to be the master? Want to be a big shot when we go to Maple Grove? Then join me on this path. And while others use their power, maybe even other churches, and maybe even open door you would like to use your power while others use their power influence and size to lord it over to get their way to exercise authority to force the issue to press their own personal even maybe political religious agenda it is not to be so among us here at open door says the Lord I think this is a word for us for I am placing you in Maple Grove open door as a people who serve I am placing you there for a very specific purpose, to be a people who use all of their strength. And you will have considerable strength, Open Door. I am calling you there to use your strength to build and lift and heal that community, to empty yourself, to pour it out for them. Because believe it or not, that's the path to power, Because that's what captures the human heart. It's a strange path, I admit. An unfamiliar path, I know. But it's the kingdom path. It's a real power. The kind that transforms people. I don't know if you know it, but we are what's called a mega church. You know what? I kind of like the sound of that. Every once in a while I'll get something even in the mail. It says, Dear Pastor Dave, I was a pastor of a mega church. And I go, yeah, that's who I am. Pastor of a mega church. And you know why we're called a mega church? You know why we're called a mega church? Because we're big. Mega is big. I'm reading a book right now by Lyle Schaller. It's a very good book. It's called The Very Large Church. It's a good book. Turns out we're not a very large church. We're a megachurch. Late last fall was a nice warm day. Bonnie and I drove out to the building to look at it, and it was at the place where it was starting to take shape, and you could see all the outside structure was up, and there were some neighbors there riding bikes, and our windows were down. We overheard them saying this. This place is huge. Got me thinking about huge. Got me thinking about big and what big does. Think about what does big do normally? What does big do? Big, among other things, takes up space. That's not a bad thing. There's some big people. Some of you are sitting next to somebody who's really big. Doesn't make them a bad person. Just take up space. That's okay. What else does big do? Big takes over. I like that. I like taking over. Wouldn't you like to take over? You know, maybe we're a mega church. We'll be able to, I don't know, take over. Because that's what big does. Big has presence. Big has influence. Big calls the shots. Big dictates policy. Big lords it over. Exercises authority. You know what? You know what? Not only are we a mega church, we're going to be a mega church. We're going to be bigger than we are. Do you kind of know that? When we go there, our church is going to get bigger? maybe more than some of us can imagine. And we'll have so many people, they'll have to do what we say. Because we can just vote them off the board that we don't like and we can kind of run this show, don't you? I get getting excited about moving to Maple Grove. We've never been in that position before, meeting in Robbinsdale. Nobody even knew we were there but us. honestly don't you know how hidden we were do you know how hidden we were no more I'm serious right we won't be hidden anymore we will have presence we will have a big presence what are we going to do with that we're going to take over let that percolate over there let me say this Some weeks ago, when we were talking about giving, in the context of our series on rightly ordered money, we learned that this issue of giving was not a peripheral issue in the Christian life, but absolutely central to the gospel that we preach. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor. In other words, he gave. He was the original giver. So that we, through his giving, might be made rich. and our instinctive response to having received the riches of His grace that He gave to us by His becoming poor, by His giving, is that we become givers. It is not a peripheral issue. It is not something you come into when you get mature. Giving is central to the gospel that we preach, so central that if you don't get it, you may not get the gospel. Beloved, the exact same thing is true for rightly ordered power. and the path that we as a church and as individuals must take to procure real power. For central to the gospel that we preach is this inviolable truth that he, our Redeemer, the one we say we worship, came not himself to be served, but to serve, to literally give his life away. And while everybody else on the planet is jockeying for position, trying to be seen, wondering who will be the greatest and the biggest and the slickest and the best. And while everyone else is using their strength to lord it over and get their way and press their agenda, it is not to be so among you. For we, I am speaking specifically to our church, we must walk a different path to power. It's an unfamiliar path. It is a path that at times will feel to us like the wrong path because we'll feel and look weak. For the path to power is the way of the cross. Through death to life. Jesus on a colt didn't look powerful. On a cross looked less powerful. in the grave, couldn't be less powerful. He took a different path. The path to power, open door, is the way of the servant, is the way of relinquishment of rights, not demanding rights. He emptied himself, he poured it all out, and then he said, don't just worship me. join me on this path a couple of weeks ago I told you that I got a picture in prayer the picture in prayer came the day of our consecration service around our money I was praying about our service and in the course of praying I prayed the Lord's prayer Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come and you remember what I said I couldn't get past thy kingdom come and I kept praying that and I began to weep God bring your kingdom and I was thinking first of all of the service of consecration God bring your kingdom and your power to that service I don't know what's going to happen today just bring your kingdom but it went beyond that in my mind to who we are as a people and where we're going as a church and in the context of that weeping and that stuff going on I got a picture in my mind that I can still see in my mind of our building in Maple Grove as I told you a couple weeks ago the building was full of light and light in scripture speaks of many things and I'm sure the light is a symbol of everything that light is a symbol of but in the context of that prayer that morning what came to me was a picture to me that the kingdom is going to come to that church, the kingdom is going to flow through that church the power of God will be evident to us there but then the question, how will that power be wielded? what are we going to do with that power? how will it be manifested? how will it be seen? well my passion is this that it won't be seen by coming to Open Door and announcing to everyone in the community that we're the power church good news we've arrived we're going to fix you and we're going to correct you and we're going to confront you it's not going to be by going there and trying to wow them impress them and entertain them though who we are and how we live might wow them I don't know might impress them might entertain them might correct them might even confront them It's not the agenda. I believe with all my heart that God is calling us to be people who are going there and saying to that community, here's really what we want you to know, that we are among you as those who serve. Here's what we want you to know, Maple Grove, Minneapolis, whoever else comes under the purview of whatever our influence is going to be. We came not, we didn't come to take up space here. to be served. We came here to serve. That's the path we want to follow. That's the value we want to bring. Let me close with this word. Consecrated power is the greatest power on earth. For consecrated power has the power to capture and conquer and win the human heart. So church of the open door, prepare yourselves. Prepare yourselves. Let's pray. My prayer, dear Father, is this. That this word for some of us would be the planting of a seed. And that that seed would grow. And that for others of us this word would be the fanning of a flame. And that the fire of servanthood would spread beyond our wildest dreams. For the saving of many alive. I pray this in Jesus' precious name. and all God's people said Amen Amen.
