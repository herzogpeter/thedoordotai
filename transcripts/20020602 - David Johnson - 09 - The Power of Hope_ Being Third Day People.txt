Father, my request is this, that by the power of your spirit, this morning you would use the word to open wide our hearts to meeting with you as we come around the table this morning as your people. I pray it in your name. Amen. Last week in our continued dealings with the issue of power, and in particular the path to power, we examined together the crossing of the Jordan River by the people of God as described for us in the book of Joshua. And the lesson we learned from it was this, that God's power is available to people who are willing to take the first step and follow him into the deep waters of a risky obedience. Because if you remember the story, it wasn't until the priest stepped into the water first that the waters began to part, making that first step a pretty scary step. And recognizing the fear factor in this, God spoke to Joshua these words, be strong and courageous. He said it three times. Chapter 1, verse 6, verse 7, and verse 9. Don't be afraid. Why? Because you'll never have to plunge into the deep waters of a risky obedience alone. For I will never leave you. I will never forsake you. Chapter 1, verse 5. For I will make a way. Indeed, every place you put your feet, I will give it to you. But you're going to have to trust me. And you're going to have to take the first step. Now, with that kind of in mind, that story in mind, to prepare ourselves for the table this morning, I want to look at a wonderful way that God underscores all of that stuff we dealt with last week in a little phrase that we could easily miss right in the middle of the story of Joshua. In fact, it's found in the 11th verse of the first chapter. To set some context, I would just read verse 10, previous to verse 11. It goes like this. Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying this. Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people saying, bear provisions for yourselves. For within three days you are to cross this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess. Now the easily missed phrase that carries more significance than is immediately apparent is the reference in the middle of verse 11 to three days. You might notice it says, for in three days you will cross. My first reaction to that is probably what yours is, big deal. So what? Who cares? Fact is this, that all through the word of God, this third day thing actually is a big deal. Almost always a third day reference has to do with the movement of God for the deliverance of his people in some way, accompanied by a short period of time that you need to wait for this deliverance. Now sometimes this period of time is a literal three days, sometimes it's symbolic, but the symbol is caught in this analogy or this reference to three days. Wait three days, and God will show up, and God will do what he's going to do. Now, while you're waiting for your third day experience where the power of God is released, it might often look like nothing good is happening. Indeed, while you're waiting for the proverbial third day to happen, it might actually look like Satan's winning. But on the third day, God shows up, and God makes a way. It's on the third day he parts the water. It's on the third day he defeats the enemy because the third day is God's day. He'll give you some examples of that, some biblical perspective on this third day thing and kind of give you a feel for where this thing comes from. One example is found in Genesis chapter 40. Joseph said to the cupbearer, while both the cupbearer and Joseph were still in prison, in three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your job. And so for three days the cupbearer had to wait. and he wasn't sure if it was going to happen. Don't know if he was full of faith or not, but sure enough, on the third day, he was delivered. God showed up. God made it happen. In Exodus chapter 3, verse 18, Moses said to Pharaoh, let us go into the wilderness for three days. In Exodus 19, verse 13, we find out why three days. Because on the third day, the Lord will come down. And in the morning of the third day, after they consecrated themselves and made themselves ready for the third day, In chapter 19, verse 16, it says, It came to pass, For the Lord did indeed come down and appeared to the people in a cloud, shook the mountain, and spoke to them words of truth. I'm sure you've heard the story of a young woman named Esther who felt that she was in way over her head, and the reason she felt that way was because she was in way over her head, having been placed by God in a position to bring deliverance to his people if she could only find the opportunity and then find the courage to speak a risky word of truth to a very frightening king in preparation for that confrontation and hope that God would open an opportunity. She fasted and prayed for how long? Do you remember? Three days. And it was on the third day that she went into the presence of the king and spoke a word that if it was not received could cost her her life. But God showed up and made a way for her, and the people of God were delivered. As soon as I mentioned this third day thing, and you're kind of getting the flow, you might have even thought of the story of Jonah, familiar to us all, swallowed by a great fish, and he's in the belly of that fish how many days? Thank you very much, three days. Praying the whole time. I don't know if it says that in the text. I don't think it does, but I actually know what he was praying, and this isn't in the text, but God gave me a word about this. He prayed two things. number one he said over and over for three days he prayed Lord let me out Lord let me out second thing he prayed was this Lord let me out the same way I came in please oh please oh that's what I'm thinking again it's just this thing I have a word about this not in the text don't go look it up it won't be in there now being in the belly of a fish is kind of it's like you know how I like to stop every once in a while and say imagine what it had to feel like I can't imagine what it had to feel like to be in the belly of a whale, but I can, I think, assume this, that more than once he thought he was going to die. That more than once he thought it was hopeless, there was going to be no deliverance, but something happened on what day? The third day. See, God showed up on the third day, and God made a way where he didn't think there was a way. The third day was God's day. Hosea 6, verse 2, it says this. I love this one. that after two days he will revive us but on the third day he will restore us so that we can live in his presence I want you to get the picture here I think you're getting the flow the third day is the day that God shows up in a big way I think all of you know that all of these references in the Old Testament are setting up and pointing to the day that Paul spoke of most definitively this is the culmination of all things relative to third day awareness in our life around this truth in 1 Corinthians 15 3 where Paul says this that I delivered unto you that which is of most importance that which I also received that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried two things he died and he was buried now from everything that could be seen at the time that he was dying and that he was buried those two days. The day he died, the day he was buried. Those were really bad days. In fact, the day he died was Friday. That looked like a very dark day, but there was still hope. Maybe God, while he's on the cross, will flex his God muscles and come down and establish his kingdom. But then he was buried. That was Saturday. That was a worse day than Friday, because as dark as Friday was, Saturday looked final. But on the third day, God showed up and raised him up again. Because the third day, get the picture, just get the flow. The third day is the day that belongs to God. That's God's day. That's the day God shows up. And if I didn't know better, as I kind of get the flow of biblical history around this third day story, if I didn't know better, I'd think that God was showing off. As if he was purposely setting the stage to kind of show up at the last minute or when people thought it was too late. Remember Lazarus? You missed it, Jesus. If you had come just a little bit sooner, he was still alive, and we believe you had power to heal. And Jesus says, I got power for what you need, and he raised him from the dead. Begin to get this idea. I don't know if this is accurate, that he sets the stage that way. I don't know. But I'll tell you this. I do get from this third day dynamic that he thoroughly enjoys playing the role of redeemer. That he thoroughly enjoys playing the role of deliverer and healer and restorer and savior just in time. Just in the nick of time. See beloved, this third day in biblical history is a big day. Because the third day is the day that prisoners get set free and people get restored. The third day is the day that mountains shake and rivers part that young harem girls named Esther face down kings and stubborn old prophets named Jonah get dropped off in seaside ports by very large fish. And the third day is the day that stones get rolled away and a crucified carpenter comes back to life so that from that very day until this day, his followers, the followers of Jesus, who used to observe only the Sabbath, Now also observe what the Apostle John in his revelation refers to as the Lord's Day. The reason it was called the Lord's Day is because that was the day God showed up and reversed what looked final and reversed what looked dark. I want you to know something. The Lord's Day is not only God's day, it's our day. Because we, because we are in Christ, we are third day people now. It's a whole new phrase for us to enjoy. as it relates to our identity. I want you to say that to yourself. I'm a third day person and I never even knew it. Never even thought of it that way. Third day identity really is a definition of who we are and why we hope. It's not as though we don't have pain. It's not as though we don't experience Friday kinds of darkness and Saturday kinds of despair in terms of finality. But neither one of those dark or final things has the power to define who we are. Why? Because we're third day people. That's why when one of my dearest friends breathed his last, Dave Busby, it felt dark to me. In fact, it felt final to me. And there was nothing that was going to make my grief go poof away. But here's the deal about both Dave and me and you. We're third day people. So what it did to that whole awful hard thing was put it in an entirely different context. See, the third day is the day God shows up. And you never know what God might do on the third day. He might just turn evil into good. No, he might, he will. That's what he does when he shows up. You never know what God might do on the third day. He might just take what looks like darkness and turn it into radiant light. What looks like death and turn it into life everlasting. And by the way, when that kind of stuff happens, don't wonder what you're experiencing. When you see evil get turned to good, darkness be replaced by light, death be translated into life. Don't wonder what you're watching. Don't wonder what you're experiencing. You need to know it's God's day. It's Lord's day. When I was a kid growing up in church My understanding of the Lord's day Was limited to the fact That it was physically Sunday My understanding of it was that Because the Lord's day is Sunday You know that And It's because it's the third day And I don't know if you knew that But you know Every once in a while I get asked this question How come we have church on Sunday You know the Jews have it on the Sabbath And we have it on Sunday Well it's because of what I'm talking about today Sunday's the third day but the experience of that day for me as a kid growing up in church was that the third day, Sunday, the Lord's Day is what we always call the Lord's Day day was kind of a boring day for me don't get me wrong, it was not a bad day I didn't hate Sunday, I wasn't abused by the Lord's Day but as a kid, 12 year old boy, I need to tell you that it wasn't my kind of day I mean Saturday, getting ready for Sunday, I had to take a bath, I hated that I wouldn't have picked that it was more the kind of day where you do things you're supposed to do because they're good for you like listening to my father preach everybody told my dad was a good preacher I would have never known it I'd have rather been out having some adventure catching frogs it's about going to Sunday school the fact is I think a lot of people still experience Sunday that way not here other places the point is though that's not the Lord's day that's not how the Lord's day feels if that's how the Lord's day feels you haven't experienced the Lord's day because the Lord's day is the day God shows up and you're going to experience that in a pretty radical way I don't care how old you are I don't care what day it actually is when God shows up the way you know is because he made a way The Lord's day is God's day, and God's day is a very good day. It's almost like saying God had a really good day that day. A couple weeks ago, a guy by the name of Sean Green, who plays baseball for the Los Angeles Dodgers, made headlines all over the country because he did something that no one else has ever done. He hit four home runs in one game. Incredible thing. When asked by reporters, how'd you do that? Now, they were amazed that he hit four home runs in one game, but also he had been in a season-long slump, hadn't been hit at all, and all of a sudden to explode like that was really an incredible thing. So how did you do that? His reply, kind of with a knowing grin, was this. Well, I don't know. I guess it was just my day. So it was. Sean Green's day. And you know what? He was right. I can news for you. You hit the ball out of the park four times in one game, it's your day. Are you getting the picture? See the Lord's Day Isn't just the day we tip our hat to God And go to church The Lord's Day is the day he hits it out of the park The Lord's Day Is the day he parts the water The Lord's Day is the day he makes a way When you didn't think there was a way The Lord's Day is the day he raises People From the dead The Lord's Day is the day He gives sight to blind eyes That couldn't see his truth and hearing to deaf ears who couldn't hear his truth. The Lord's day is the day he heals the broken hearts. The Lord's day is the day when if the Lord himself were asked by reporters, say, Lord, I'll use your imagination here. So how'd you do it, Lord? How'd you heal that disease? How'd you restore that marriage that was beyond help? How'd you transform that life that was such a mess? How'd you rekindle that hope? where hope had died, how'd you forgive that sin? How'd you redeem that life? How'd you part those waters, walk out of that grave, ascend to the Father, send your spirit alive into men and women? Ask those questions, you might say with a knowing grin, well, I don't know, I guess it was my day. You see, beloved, that's the Lord's day. Because the Lord's day is the day that God shows up. and God shows up the third day and yes Friday was dark and many of you may be in a Friday right now as Jesus hung on the cross Saturday was worse because it looked so final but the third day is God's day and that was such a good day that it actually made Friday look like a good day what do we call it? we call it Good Friday do you know this third damn thing I'm talking about today is so powerful for us third day people that it actually has the power to take our dark Fridays and after we see what God was really up to, after we see the third day experience, we actually go back and call that terrible thing a good thing. We call it Good Friday. And that is ultimately, beloved, why all things really do work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose. Because no matter how dark it is, or how final it feels, and it might, again, be for some of you in this room right now, very dark, and there may be things in your life that feel very final, here's a word to you, from the word of God, we are third day people. That is who we are. And third day, and the third day, is God's day. Indeed it is that day, that this table we are about to go to reminds us of and points us to. Because it was on the third day that these symbols of death, and that's what they are, it's really kind of odd, isn't it? We celebrate, we take in our hands and we get all misty-eyed about symbols of death. The bread, take the bread, which is his body broken for you. And then we go to the cup and we say this cup symbolizes the blood. This is his blood shed for you. But here's the deal. It's the third day that takes these symbols of death and translates them into symbols of life and hope and healing. So here's the word this morning. From this table, from this third day reality, get your hopes up, church. Because no matter how dark your Friday feels right now, no matter how final your Saturday seems right now, we are third day people, and the third day is a really good day. So come to the table this morning and taste and see that God is good. But before we do, come to the table. I want to take a moment to do what we did last month, actually. In preparation for coming to the table, I want to invoke the name of God, invite the presence of God, And in the invocation of his name and the invitation of his spirit, we can expect the power of the same. Such that this very day, as we meet with God in this place at his table, could be for some of you a third day experience. Turning the darkness of your Friday, and when it feels like the finality of your Saturday, into the hope and healing and unspeakable joy of God's day. Because God's day is a very good day. So come Holy Spirit. Let's invoke the name of God as we go to the table. We do in Jesus' name now invoke your name, invite your presence. all of us in this room desire that my heart especially would extend to those among us Father and you know who they are for whom this is a Friday darkness or a Saturday finality and that's what they're facing in Jesus name I pray you come with mighty power and make a way reveal your grace bring your healing be who you are do what you do in ways that might astonish us beyond what we could ask or think make this day your day I pray these things in Jesus name Amen Amen.
