Verse 53, Matthew 13. As we come to Matthew 13, 53, we are moving into a new section of Scripture. That is made evident with the first phrase. It came about when Jesus had finished these parables. We have just finished a number of weeks dealing with the parables of the kingdom. The parables of the kingdom, as you know, if you've been with us these last several weeks, are designed by Jesus to accomplish two things. Number one, he used parables which were simply pictures of everyday life. The kingdom's like a field. The kingdom's like a seed. The kingdom's like a sower. The kingdom's like a mustard seed. The kingdom's like leaven. It's like a dragnet. It's like a treasure. He used all those little pictures that we could all understand, and then he laid them alongside spiritual realities that are very hard to understand, but because we had a physical picture, he extended the physical to the spiritual, and then all of a sudden we got insight into this spiritual thing that we wouldn't know any other way. In fact, one of the things, if you were here this week, if I tell you the kingdom is like a dragnet and it speaks of eternal judgment, I have a feeling you can recall all of the theology behind it. That was the design of it. He designed it, number one, to reveal the mysteries of the kingdom, but secondly, and this was a real emphasis all through our teaching, was that he was using it to equip and train, prepare and motivate his disciples, and now us, for ministry in the kingdom. It was as if he was saying this, and we are saying this to the Church of the Open Door. Church of the Open Door, disciples, there's some things you need to know about ministry in the kingdom. And if you don't know them, you're going to get disillusioned, discouraged, and knocked off. You need to know, first of all, that the kingdom's like a sower who goes through the field. And the seed he's got is the word of the kingdom. And you need to know that that word of the kingdom is good seed. It has life. It has power. It has the power to redeem, to heal, to deliver. It's incredible. But as you sow the seed and as you spread the word, you're going to notice something discouraging. Not everywhere you throw the seed is life born. And sometimes you're going to have the impression that you're not throwing the seed right. Or maybe there's something wrong with the seed. What you need to know is that there are different kinds of soil. And sometimes that soil is going to fall on a hard heart. And the word of the kingdom, the best, most clear, powerfully demonstrated word of the kingdom that ever came, won't be able to penetrate the hardness of some people's hearts. Sometimes you're going to see the seed fall and life is going to happen for a while, but what you didn't see was underneath that veneer of receptivity was a bedrock of resistance to the work in the kingdom and the power of God. And so it sprang up, but then it died off, and other times it's going to fall among the weeds, but sometimes it's going to come to a ready heart. And when you throw the seed there, because the seed is good, the soil is pure, life is born, know that if you don't, you're going to get knocked off, because not everyone is one. The other thing he dealt with with the disciples about was something we struggle with as well. The disciples had this cock-eyed idea that serving God meant there wouldn't be any more problems. When the kingdom comes, everything's wonderful. No more pain, no more sin, no more death, no more discouragement, no more depression, no more disillusionment. Won't this be wonderful? Some Christians, maybe they don't have that exact theology. We do have sometimes the impression that if I do it right, if I say the right words, if I live the right way, everything's going to be great. Jesus gives these disciples a wonderful gift when he tells them the truth. Listen, folks, the kingdom of God is like a field, and into the field has been planted the wheat. That's you. You are the redeemed. The kingdom of God is within you, and within you there is all the power and the resources of powerful kingdom living. But you have been planted in a field that is the world, and when God planted the wheat, that is you, Satan oversold it. And he oversold it with pain and death and sin, discouragement, disillusionment, rejection, reviling, and you need to know that while the kingdom is within you and the kingdom is here, it is being planted and it is in the midst of tears, which would move against and mitigate all that God wants to do. You are going to get discouraged, you are going to get disillusioned, but you also need to know this, that while it is right in the middle of pain and despair and death and sin, the kingdom is also like a little seed of mustard. And while it looks insignificant and you feel like you don't have much to say because you're surrounded maybe in your family or in your church or in your world with all sorts of negative things, that little insignificance grows and grows and grows and grows and nothing can stop it. And it's like leaven put into dough and it permeates. And the other thing you need to know, disciples, is that one day, even though sometimes there's pain and discouragement, now you keep being weak because one day, verse 43, the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their father. And that's a true thing. The kingdom is like a treasure too. It's like a pearl. When people find it, they sell everything they have. It's like a dragnet which spoke of eternal judgment. The reason I give you all that review is because as we come to verse 53, we're not done with the parables. We are in a sense, but let me explain. It's as if now when we come to verse 53, we are leaving the classroom context. He's been teaching the disciples. When he finishes with the parables, it says he then departs and he is now beginning a whole new aspect of his ministry. From verse 53 through chapter 16, we are going to see eight specific incidents of Jesus and the disciples involved in ministry. And guess what we're going to see? Almost every one of these parables are going to be experienced. They're going to be fleshed out. They're going to be the parables revisited in our living. I told you the kingdom's like this. Now let's do ministry and you're going to meet some hard soil. I want you to meet some hard soil. I want you to meet some shallow soil. I want you to see what weedy soil looks like. I want you to feel the tension of tares and wheat as we have a confrontation with the Sadducees and the Pharisees in verse chapter 15. I want you to also see what it looks like when somebody really believes. Watch that. See that woman over there? Look at her weep. That's what belief looks like. See that? That's good soil there. Got that? Parables lived out, fleshed out. This is going to be exciting. The adventure begins in verse 53 when he finished the parables, departed from there. Coming to his hometown, he began teaching them in their synagogue so that they became astonished and said, where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? Is this not the carpenter's son? Is this not Mary, his mother, his brothers, James, Joseph, Simon, Judas, and his sisters? Are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things, meaning the power and the wisdom? And they took offense at Jesus. but Jesus said to them a prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household and he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief the focus of this is going to be the power of unbelief let's pray Father as we begin this new section we know that you have truth for us to understand and know and live in and in the name of Jesus I am aware again that mere words even good words do not move unless they are energized by your spirit. And we ask your spirit to be energizing all we do right now. Anoint this time in Jesus' name. Amen. What we need to do to begin with is get some background stuff done. It says he finished the parables and he departed from there. From where? The there that he's leaving is Capernaum. If you've been with us these last several months, you know that he's been in Capernaum since chapter 4. He left where he was. He went through Nazareth. and he came to Capernaum where he did his ministry for one full year. You also know that it was at Capernaum that he set up what we would call his headquarters. Almost all of his teaching went on in Capernaum. Many of his signs and wonders, his miracles, were being experienced and done right in that place. The other thing we also know about Capernaum is this, that while they heard the voice of God, and while they experienced the presence of God because Jesus was there, and while they saw the power of God, Capernaum's response to the presence and the word and the power of God was what? Indifferent. Remember that? Basically, they were the ones who said, we don't really want to play, he's kind of a glutton, he's a drunkard, he doesn't make any sense, just don't pay any attention to them, to him. We also found out that as they ho-hummed what God had been doing through Jesus at that place, the result in verse 23 of chapter 11 was that Jesus cursed Capernaum. He said this, It's going to be better for Sodom and Gomorrah, for Sire and Tidon, than for you in the day of judgment. Because Sire and Tidon and Tyre and Sidon, you guys fix that, don't you, when I do that? After you laugh at me. Having a bad day, okay, you know? Give me a break. Tyre and Sidon, is that right? That's right. Sodom and Gomorrah, it's going to be better for them because they didn't hear the things you heard. They didn't see the things you saw. They didn't experience the presence of God in their midst. And so the judgment on you is going to be greater than what was on them. As we come to verse 53, it says, And he departed from there. That might just look like words that are kind of stuck there. You need to know that those words mark the literal end of Capernaum's history. If you go to Capernaum today, you are going to see one of the most beautiful places on the face of the earth, and nobody lives there. It's over for Capernaum. when I think of that concept I think of churches and it's a scary thought to me churches, movements, denominations families possibly who at one time enjoyed the presence of God who had at one time heard the word of God it was in their midst they at one time saw the power of God but when the power of God was there the word of God was there the presence of God was there their response was he's a glutton, he's a drunkard it's indifferent We're not going to respond. And he departed from there. You know any movements like that? Know any churches like that? It happens all the time. He departed from there. Then, verse 54, and coming to his own hometown. Stop right there. The hometown was Nazareth. That's where he grew up. When he got there, he began teaching them in their synagogue. Stop right there. Little background. I just want you to know that what he is doing here in verse 54, he also did a year ago. When he began his ministry, according to Matthew chapter 4, according to Luke chapter 4, it says in Luke 4, one of my favorite passages relative to the introduction of the kingdom. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Jesus said when he came to Nazareth, went to the synagogue, sat down, and he opened the book of Isaiah, which said these words, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, sent me to proclaim the release to the captives, recovery of sight to the blind, to set free those who are downtrodden, and to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord. And then he closed the book, gave it back to the attendants, sat down and said these words, today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing. He then went on in that same place, at that same time, to teach them about the kingdom and also tell them that it wasn't the pious and the performer and the religious that were going to go into the kingdom. Like them, it was going to be the broken and the hungry and the mourning. Those were the ones who were going to come in the kingdom, and they, because of that, kicked him out of the temple. It was the place where they brought him to the edge of the cliff and wanted to throw him off, but it wasn't his time. He walked through the crowd and lived. A year later, he's back, and maybe that's why it says this, that after he preached, they were astonished. Why were they astonished? Part of why they were astonished is possibly they were looking at him and going, he never learns. He's back. We tried to kill him last time. Why is he here? that could be part of it. There's also another reason they were astonished, and it says that in the text, because of his wisdom and his miraculous powers. They were amazed. By the way, that is often the response to Jesus when he teaches. Matthew 7, it says the people were amazed at his authority after he spoke. It didn't mean they believed, they were just amazed. He didn't speak the way the scribes did. He spoke with authority. It meant, in that context, conviction. He acted like he meant what he said. In another place, Luke, John 7, it says, They marveled at his knowledge. Luke 4, they wondered at the graciousness of his words. Luke 4, again, they were amazed at his power. And here they were astonished. But while their initial response was amazement, while their initial response was being impressed, while their initial response was that they were astonished, the result of all of his miraculous power and the result of all of his powerful words was they took offense. Look at that in verse 57. They took offense at him. They got angry at him. So just because they're impressed, happens here, come to church, impressed, like it, it was neat. Being impressed doesn't mean diddly. Excuse my Greek. Doesn't mean anything. A lot of people get amazed. Oh, that was so what? That impression that was positive turned to offense. And the reason the positive response turned to a negative response is revealed in verse 58. Because of their unbelief. And now I'm on what I want to talk about this morning. The power of unbelief. The power of unbelief has the power to take an initial response that is positive, turn it into offense, and result in rejection. It has power to do other things as well. I want you to ponder that concept for a minute. it's important that you get it. We talk a lot about the power of faith. Faith can do things. Faith can accomplish things. Faith can move things. We've heard sermons like that. If you were going to hear a sermon on faith, you would be expecting to hear a sermon that would tell you all the neat things that could be accomplished by faith. So let's have more faith. John 1.12 says, But as many as received him, or believed in him, to them gave he the what? The power to become the sons of God. So faith, or belief, has the power to save. It has the power to turn someone from a child of Satan to a child of God. That's power. That's the power of faith. It does things. It says also, Jesus said this, if you have the faith, the signs of the grain of a mustard seed, you could save that mountain, be moved, and it'll be moved. In other words, if you've even got real small faith, you can do things that are beyond belief. They are seemingly impossible. You need to know that while on one hand we are very aware of the fact that faith can actively move things and do things, unbelief has the same kind of power in another direction. Unbelief has power to do things in your life. It has power to do things in the life of a church. Denomination, movement of God. Think about that. It has power to move. It has power to do. It has power to accomplish. The opposite of God's intention, but it moves. I want to clarify something, too, as I talk about unbelief and the power it has to do things. But I want to clarify that unbelief is different than struggling faith. I don't want some of you who are struggling in your faith, and you love Jesus, but you got some doubts, and you maybe sound like that guy who said, God, help me, I believe, help my unbelief, to take this passage as an indictment on you. Unbelief is not just weak faith. Unbelief is active unbelief. It is a mind set against, is literally what it means. Unbelief, a mind set against God. Set against the power of God. Set against the voice of God. It is more than the absence of faith. It is more than deficient faith. It's an active, aggressive no. An active, aggressive no, a mind set against, has incredible power. Let's look at the power it had in this little town called Nazareth. And as we do, let it affect yourself and your own spirit. There's four things that unbelief accomplished in the hearts and minds and lives of these people. The first thing that it accomplished in Nazareth was it helped them make invisible what was visible. What do you mean by that? Power has the incredible capacity to make what is normally visible invisible. Say it like this. Unbelief is so powerful. A mindset against God is so powerful that a mindset against God could look a miracle right in the face and not see it. Follow that? Let me explain. It says here that initially when they heard the word and saw the miracles, they were astonished. And then they ask a question. Where did the man get this wisdom? And where did these miraculous powers come from? Now, that might slide right by all of us, except for one thing. We need to understand some background here about the person who's saying this. This is a Jew who's asking this question. There are certain things that Jews just know. If this was a classroom and I was the teacher, and I asked you a question, let's take Jesus out of it, let's take all the messiahship, signs and wonders, power, words, all of those things out of it. And now I ask you a question. Class, here's the question. Where does supernatural wisdom come from? You don't get that right. You wear the dunce cap for a week, okay? Supernatural wisdom comes from one place, one place only. From the time you could talk, you knew this. Where? God. God. Every time. Got another question for you, class. Where does the miraculous power to heal, deliver, redeem, forgive, where does that come from, class? You don't get this right. You wear the dunce cap for two weeks. Easy answer. God, that's the only source of power. That's the only source of miraculous words, miraculous power. Nicodemus knew that. He was a Pharisee. He was one of the ruling Pharisees, and he came to Jesus wanting to know about eternal life, but there was one thing he understood. He said, for we all know that anyone with your words and your power is from God because we all know as Jews that wisdom and power come from God. They had just seen miracles. They had just heard truth. And now they ask a question. I wonder who did that? I wonder how that happened. Let me explain how that fleshes out in our lives. Take someone who is possibly an atheist. I picture him sitting in my office. He doesn't believe in God. God isn't real. There is no reality that is encompassing the presence of a God. So what I do is, after I establish the fact that he doesn't believe in God, I say, okay, let's go outside. Here we are. We are outside. Take a look at the trees, the ground, the grass, the air, the sky, the birds, the stars, the planet, all of that, everything that's here, all this nature you look at. If there is no God, how do you explain that? If you've got a mindset against God, I can tell you how to explain that. Either I don't know and it doesn't matter that I don't know, or I'm going to find some sort of explanation that will tell me how all these things came here. But I can tell you one thing, it isn't God. If I'm an atheist, it's not God. How is that? Because I've got a mind set against that. There's no way it's God because I've already ruled that out. So even if it was God, I'd never see it. Why is that? I've got a mind that is set against it. Okay, I'm getting a little frustrated. I really like this guy to believe in God. I'll tell you what, George, whatever your name is. What if right now God, the God that you don't believe exists, did a bunch of miracles? Let's say he knocks over a tree right now. Let's say he dims these lights. Let's say your best friend gets healed. Okay? Would you believe then? Would they? Well, sure. No, they wouldn't. You know why? You know why? A mind that is set against God, you can have a miracle right in front of their face and they won't see it. The tree falls over. The lights go dim. The guy gets healed. The tree fell over because of the wind. I know what happened. The wind did that. Don't tell me God did that. And then the tree hit the power line and made the lights dim. That's what happened. And your friend got healed because people just get healed once in a while. That's all there is to it. I got a mind that is set against God and I don't care what happens. I will not believe. That is why, by the way, the ones who hear the word of the kingdom and believe it and receive it are who? They are the broken, the hungry, the morning, the ones who are hungry for righteousness, the ones who are eager for that, they're the ones who see the work, they hear the words. There are other people who Jesus says of them these words, their hearts have become dull, their ears scarcely hear, and hearing they don't hear, and seeing they don't see. Unbelief has incredible power. You could look right at a miracle and not see it. For years, and this one's a little closer to home, for years I personally had a mind that was set against. Now, I'm a believer, and I had a mind that was set against the power of the kingdom of God, a mind that was set against the gifts of the Spirit. Two fundamental reasons I had that mind set against. Number one was a theology that I had that said the gifts are not for today. God doesn't do what he did anymore. We worship the great I used to the great I was. It was a wonderful thing. We would get tears in our eyes, sing wonderful hymns about all the things that God used to do. Isn't it great that God used to do that? He doesn't do it now. Don't forget that. But he used to. Great. Well, Dave, if God doesn't do those things, and if gifts aren't for today, then why do some people speak in tongues? They're stupid. It's easy. That's easy. I've got a mindset against it. I know exactly why they speak in tongues. They're wacko. I'm satisfied with that. Well, why is it that some people are healed? They fake it. Okay, well, why is it, Dave, that some people report deliverance from lifelong bondage? They're nutcases. What can I say? It's just the way it is. It's incredible. A mind that is set against something has the enormous capacity to not see, to not hear, no matter if God himself would speak. Luke 16 is the story of the rich man who went into Hades and the poor man named Lazarus, not to be confused with the Lazarus who... Lazarus, was he the one? Oh, anyway. There's two guys. One went to hell, one went to heaven. And the guy who was in Hades began to talk to God and say, could this guy give me even a drop of water on my tongue? And no, that's not going to happen. And he said, well, would you send someone to my brothers and to my father and maybe send me to my brother, that was God, and my father's house? Ha! Ha! Ha! Proves it. No, it was him. Oh, no. Okay. Well, you send someone to my brothers and tell them about this place where I am so they can be warned and avoid it. And God said to them, listen, the problem isn't more proof. The problem, and by the way, this is, whether you know I'm giving you this or not, this is an incredible ministry tool. An incredible ministry tool. When people are resisting, they don't want to see, they don't want to hear. The problem isn't more proof. We beat ourselves up like crazy. If I only said it better, if I only did more. Baloney, the problem is not more evidence. The problem is a hardness of heart and unbelief. Unbelief, a mindset against, has incredible power. You could raise him from the dead. They wouldn't believe it. That's what Jesus said to the guy. We could raise him from the dead. They don't believe the prophets. They don't believe the law. They don't believe the scriptures now. There is nothing that's going to get them to believe. They've got a mindset against. There's another thing that gave me a mindset against the works of the Spirit, and that was what every one of us struggle with. See, you all didn't have the same theology I did, but you all had the same worldview I did because I live in the same world you do. It's called a Western mindset, a Western worldview. If you've been in training center, you've heard this before. I've done this. A Western worldview just defined is this. It is affected by what we call rationalism. Rationalism says this, that truth and reality, what I accept as truth and reality, can be defined only within the parameters of what I can touch, taste, feel, measure, define, and control. Especially measure, define, and control. Now, anything outside of the parameters of what I can taste, touch, feel, measure, define, and control isn't real. It's just not real. Now, if somewhere along the line I run into some sort of experience that isn't definable, controllable, measurable, it's supernatural, and I can't deny it as being unreal, what I will do is come up with a rational explanation. I guarantee it, I will, because I've got a Western mind view, a world view, a mind set. Let me give you an example. Acts 28. And again, if you're in a training center, This is the one that we use there. I think it's perfect. Acts 28, Paul gets bit by a viper, poisonous viper, but he doesn't die. The worldview at that time of the people who were watching that incident determined what their conclusion about someone who gets bit by a viper but doesn't die is. Their worldview dictated that if you get bit by a viper but don't die, the obvious conclusion is this. You are a God. Anybody here come up with that kind of conclusion? If I got bit by a viper up here and didn't die, you'd go, oh, Dave's a god. No, you wouldn't do that. Why? You don't have that mindset. You don't have that worldview. We've got a different worldview. If we saw Paul get bit by a viper and not puff up and die, we'd say this. That's probably a really old snake. Couldn't be the power of God. I mean, we've ruled that out. I've got a mindset against that. Wasn't an old snake, huh? Okay. Well, okay, it wasn't an old snake, but you know what? You didn't know, you've got to do some history background here on the snake, the etymology of the snake's life. What you do is you go back and you find out that it bit 17 people before it bit Paul. It was empty. Okay? It wasn't empty, huh? Okay, see, here's another thing you didn't know about Paul. He got bit several times before he got bit. This time, he had built up an immunity. That's how it happened. Couldn't be God. couldn't be his power, couldn't be miraculous, couldn't be kingdom life, couldn't be. Why is that? I got a mind set against that. I could have a miracle right in my face and not see it. Happened all the time through scripture, happens all the time now. Point, the mind set against. A mind, and I like this phraseology here, get this, a mind that is empowered by unbelief. I like that. We think empowered by faith. Empowered by unbelief has the capacity to totally miss the reality of the power of the kingdom, and ultimately they hold to a form of godliness that denies its power. Unbelief has power to make visible things invisible. Secondly, it has the power to make things that don't matter at all matter the most. It has the power to take things that are irrelevant and make them paramount. I love this one. Here's what happens. these people in Nazareth from their own mouth have just admitted they just saw the power of God miraculous powers not only that incredible wisdom having seen the miraculous power heard the wonderful wisdom they walk away from the meeting saying wow did you see that power did you hear the wisdom wasn't it glorious let's just praise God and worship him they walked away from the meeting going isn't he a carpenter son you know Isn't Mary his mother? I've seen him. Aren't Judas? By the way, Judas is not Judas of Iscariot. Judas is his brother, his physical brother. Simon and Joseph and his sisters, we've seen them guys. I play ball with them. They're idiots. What did they just do? They just saw the miraculous power of God. They heard the incredible wisdom from God, and now they're talking about something that is totally irrelevant. When come to church, you see the power. we hear the word and you might even go wow that was kind of neat by the time we get home what are we talking about boy god came today what a sweet spirit i just sensed that or i didn't even that would be a spiritual thing i just didn't sense god today that's even on a spiritual level okay that's okay to do that that's okay to say boy i don't know there was some spiritual warfare going on church today and we need to pray about that but you're still on a spiritual plane what we sometimes do is go home and irrelevant. You know, the lights were really dark today. The music was too loud today. We talked too fast today. On and on and on and on. It's incredible how a mind that is set against has the power to make things that do not matter at all matter the most. In Matthew chapter 12, Jesus was in the synagogue and there was a guy there with a withered up hand. He reached out his hand, touched his hand, and the withered hand in front of everybody got healed. Whoa! And everybody went home going, Whoa! You won't believe what we just saw. God came to church today. Glory to God. I believe in him. I want to serve him. And we fall down and worship him. Well, believing hungry hearts saw that. It was right in front of their face. What did the Pharisees see? Remember that one? They saw that he did it. When? On the Sabbath. It's amazing. the power that unbelief has. You know, we sit here and go, boy, those stupid Pharisees, how could they do that? You've got to know, you've got to know. The power of unbelief is incredible. It has the ability to look right at a miracle and not see it. Look right at a miracle and talk about something irrelevant as if it were. He did it on the Sabbath. Who cares? Marries his mother. Isn't he a carpenter's son? You know who didn't care whether he was a carpenter's son? You know who didn't care who was his mother or his brother or his sisters? You know who didn't care at all? The leper who got healed. Jairus' daughter who got raised from the dead. Jairus who had his daughter back. None of them cared. You see, one of the things about his being a son of a carpenter discredited him. If we're going to hear a man from God who's got wisdom from God, he would need to be a Pharisee's son or a scribe's son or a rabbi's son who went to the scribe's school and got his education. Where's your degree, Jesus? What seminary do you go to? You know who didn't ask that question? Jairus' daughter. What seminary do you go to? You got a degree? No, I got wisdom and power. Want some or not? Unbelief has an incredible capacity to make things that don't matter at all matter the most. You've seen it in churches. If you're a kingdom person, it drives you nuts. What you need to know now is that thing which frustrated you all the time when things that didn't matter mattered the most. What you didn't know and you know now is that capacity to make things that don't matter matter is the spirit of unbelief. You need to know that there is a mind set against the moving and word of God in those people. That's what that's about. Know it. You know it now. I got a call this last week from a friend that I haven't seen for a long time from California. It wasn't any connection to this trip we just took. This guy was in Southern California. He's coming out to this area in the fall, and he was telling me about this church he's in. It's in the largest Baptist church in his particular conference, and in spite of that, the kingdom of God is beginning to move there. I'm just kidding. I came out of a Baptist church. I came out of a Baptist church, so I can do that, I guess. that's the truth he was telling me about how i mean miracles and deliverance and healing and some incredible things but those things don't happen without some degree of tension and the sad thing in his particular situation is the person who was most resistant to the moving of god in supernatural ways that you can't explain in that church is the pastor who was a friend of his resisting resisting resisting well what they did finally was they went to a church that was fairly close to them happened to be a Wimber church. Some of our people are going to a conference in a few months. And it was interesting, as Tom was telling me about his pastor's response to this normal service where God did what he did, and it wasn't anything crazy or anything like that. But what was interesting, as he walked out of the service, he said, here's what the pastor noted. He said this, what I noticed most was that the service started 10 minutes late. When the preacher began to talk, there were eight pauses that felt uncomfortable to me, and the drums were too loud. Isn't that beautiful? Did God move? It doesn't matter. A mind that is set against something has an incredible capacity to look at things that don't matter as if they do. Whenever you see that, it's the spirit of unbelief. Know it. It is. I spoke in a seminary a couple years ago. In the first service, I mentioned the name of the seminary, And then I felt awkward about having named it, so I'm not going to name it. It's the one I want to. Ha, ha! And what happened is not indicative of everybody at the seminary, but I spoke. And it was important to me when I went there. I'd gone there, and I wanted to give something back. I really had a good heart going on. And I preached, and I preached my heart out, and I exegeted the text they wanted exegeted, but basically I shared my heart with what I thought that was. And when I was done and just feeling good about really praying beforehand that God would do some kingdom stuff there, there wouldn't just be a speech that they'd either go yes or no to, but they would receive something from God. There were many good comments, and it was clear that God had really connected with some people, but I'll never forget as long as I live the comment of one person who came up to me with kind of a pad, and he looked at me, and this is all he said. He said, do you realize how many words you say per minute? No. It is incredible the capacity, the power, when you have a mind set against hearing a heart, when you have a mind set against hearing something deeper than information, it's incredible how you can miss it. Unbelief is powerful. Has the power to create hostility. Verse 57. And they took offense at him. I'm not going to dwell on this very long. I think what's interesting about this, this is just something I've seen. I mean, that just confirms things I've seen. When the word of God comes with clarity and power, it cuts like a sword. When the power of God begins to be put on display, it is amazing how hostility comes and the hostility doesn't seem consistent with the offense. What was the offense? Jesus spoke the truth and he did miracles. And they got hostile. Does that connect? You know what I'm saying? It doesn't. Why would they get mad about that? In fact, what's really interesting, and I think it's needing to be noted, there he did the miracles, he spoke the word with power, they were astonished. So their initial response to what he said was, Hey, this is great. Wow! Jesus doesn't do anything more. He doesn't say anything more. But their astonishment turns from astonishment and joy to offense without him doing one more thing. That is the power of unbelief. See it? The power of a mindset against. Without saying anything, you can get people mad at you if you're doing the kingdom stuff. You better know that. One of the things we've seen and principles that we've seen emerge all through Matthew. So I'm not giving you a new one, but I want to just connect it with this one. We've said this all through. Whenever the word of God begins to be proclaimed and whenever the work of God begins to be done in a family, in a church, in a denomination, whenever those two things happen, the Pharisees that are in those families, the Pharisees that are in those churches, the Pharisees that are in those denominations will do two things. Number one, they will not see the work of God. They'll always be seeing what doesn't matter. God could be doing miracles and saving people and healing marriages and doing all sorts of neat things right in front of their face, what they're going to see is the pew got scratched. What they're going to see is something got ripped, irrelevant things. And not only will they not see the work of God, they'll be angry about it. Watch it. Just look around. It's just the way it is. I've seen that here. When I went to California, I saw that there as I dealt with pastors who've gone through that kind of thing. as soon as they began, to quit talking churchy talk and get down to what's real about God's word, about his power. Oh, man. Didn't see God's power, didn't like it, one they couldn't deny it. The last thing is this. Unbelief has the power to hinder the hand of God. Verse 58, he did not do many miracles because of their unbelief. Again, I don't think I need to elaborate real profoundly on that at all. I hope that the reality of that is just a knife through our hearts. That is a sobering word right there. And I think it's a sobering word to churches. The picture I've got is the picture that evolved out of Matthew 7, 7 when we heard Jesus say, Ask and you shall receive. Seek and you will find. Knock and the door will be opened to you. And if you ask me for bread, I won't give you a stone. But what we were asking for there, remember, It wasn't for a new Cadillac or for a big church. What we were asking for there, and Jesus in the asking was saying, if you ask for this, I'll give it, I promise, was kingdom stuff. You ask for grace, I'll give it. You ask for forgiveness, I'll give it. You ask for a new heart, I'll give it. You ask for redemption, I'll give it. You want the kingdom of God? You want my name to be hallowed, my will to be done, my kingdom to come? I'll do that. But I believe, and I don't know if this is the voice of a prophet right now or not, but I believe in our land. I believe that in churches today, there is such a powerful spirit of unbelief that what God wants to do most, he can't do. Here and there, somebody gets saved, you know, kind of trickle down. Here and there, there's a movement, you know, couldn't do many. But there is a mindset against. We're going to do it our way. The people who are going to run this church are the rich ones. They're the ones who've been here for years and years. It doesn't have anything to do with sensitivity to God. We're just going to try harder. We're going to get a better method. We're going to form another committee and study revival. Great. And he could not do many miracles among them because of their unbelief. The God who made the world has a desire to redeem, to bless, to heal, to come. The God who made the world has power. Belief, unbelief is so powerful that it can hold his hand back. That's incredible to me. The power of unbelief can make what's visible invisible. It can have a miracle in your face and not see it. The power of unbelief can make what doesn't matter matter. The power of unbelief can make hostility out of nothing. The power of unbelief can stop the hand of God. I want to end with just a story that illustrates this whole thing. It's a story in John 9. You can turn to it if you want. Otherwise, just listen along. the disciples are walking with Jesus and they see a blind man and they say whose sin created this was it his father or his mother and Jesus said no sin at all created this blindness but this guy was created in his blindness for this purpose that at this time right now he could bring glory to God by his healing so he reached out in verse 6 spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and applied the clay to his eyes and he said to him go and wash in the pool of Siloam so he went and did that and came back seeing he got his eyesight the neighbors therefore of those who previously had seen him as a beggar were saying isn't this the guy who used to sit in the marketplace and beg we've seen this guy before others were saying yeah that's the guy still others are saying no but it's just like him it looks like him it's not really him and he kept going no I'm the guy I'm the one it's really me therefore they were saying to him how then were your eyes open how'd you get your sight and he answered the man who was called Jesus made clay anointed my eyes and said go to the pool of Siloam and wash. I did that, and I received my sight. And they said to him, where is he now? And he said, I don't know. So they did a very wise thing. They brought him to the Pharisees. It's like saying they brought him to Capernaum, or they brought him to a church like Capernaum, where they have seen God's presence at one time, heard his word, and seen his power. And they brought him to a place like that, this guy who was formerly blind. Now, It was on a Sabbath day that Jesus had done this whole deal. So he's in trouble. And by the way, the fact that he did it on the Sabbath, what's going to see that? Unbelief is going to notice that. Unbelief won't notice the blind eyes got in sight. Unbelief will notice the Sabbath. So therefore the Pharisees were asking him how he received his sight. And he said to them, he applied clay to my eyes, I washed and now I see. Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, this man isn't from God, how do you know that? He doesn't keep the Sabbath. irrelevant who cares they do unbelief always does but others were saying how can a man who is a sinner perform such signs so there's a little glimmer of belief there there was division they said therefore that a blind man again what do you say about him since he's the one who opened your eyes and he said i think he's a prophet the jews therefore did not believe it of him that he had been blind and received sight they figured he was always in sight and now he's pulling a fast one. So they called his parents, the parents of the very one who had received the sight, and they began to ask them, saying this, is your son who you say was born, is this your son who you say was born blind? Then now does he see. So was he blind once and now does he see? His parents answered and said, we know that this is our son, that he was born blind, but how he now sees we do not know. Now this one here sounds like Jeff. Don't ask me. Talk to him. You know, you have your issue with him. Take your issue to him. Okay, he says this. We do not know. Ask him. He is of age. He can speak for himself. His parents said this because they were scared of the Jews. Jews had already made it very clear that if anyone should confess Jesus to be the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. For this reason, his parents said he's of age. Ask him. Not because they were straight. So a second time, they called the man who had been blind and said to him, give glory to God, not to Jesus. We know that this man is a sinner, Jesus. And he therefore answered and said, whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know. One thing I know once I was blind, now I see. Deal with it. This is incredible. They therefore said to him, remember as I read this, they've already asked him this a dozen times at least. Not quite. What is it that he did to you? how did he open your eyes unbelief has an incredible power to not see to not hear a miracle was right there i told you already he put mud on my eyes i was blind now i see tell me again what did he do how come this happened they don't see they're blind that's what unbelief does he answered them and said i told you already and you didn't listen then you're not going to listen now why don't you hear it again. You want to become his disciples? And that made him mad. They reviled him and said, you are his disciple. We are disciples of Moses, the good old days. We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we don't know where he's from. The man answered and said, and this is great. This is a blind man who was a beggar. Now he's speaking to the Pharisees. Well, here is an amazing thing, he says, that you don't know where he's from, and yet he opened my eyes. See, you never let me in the synagogue. I'm kind of playing with this. You never let me in the synagogue, but I sat outside the door, and I heard your teaching. Anytime wisdom came, it was from God. Anytime miracles happened, it was from God. You amazed me. We know that God does not hear sinners, verse 31, but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will, he hears him. Since the beginning of time, guys, It has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person who was born blind. If this man were not from God, he couldn't have done what he just did. And you know it, Pharisees. That's what you teach. And they answered and said to him, you were born in your sins. Totally irrelevant, right? What does that have to do with the fact that God just healed you were born in your sins? Totally irrelevant. Unbelief has incredible power, doesn't it? To make what doesn't matter, matter. you bet he was born in his sins and so were they and so are you. And they put him out. Jesus then heard that he had been put out and finding him, he said, do you believe in the Son of Man? And he said, and who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him? And Jesus said to him, you have both seen him and he is the one who is talking with you now. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. The power of unbelief. The power of belief. life, death. It may be that some here this morning are unbelievers. You're unredeemed. And maybe till tonight, this morning, you've had a mind set against. And if your mind is set against, nothing you heard today is going to change that. Unless something, by an act of your will, by the energy of the Spirit, something begins to crack through that spirit of unbelief. There are believers here too, though, who are redeemed. And you know too, this happens to me. Remember a few weeks ago we talked about the four soils, different kinds of people, but we also said all four of those soils are in my redeemed heart too. I've got areas of hardness in my heart that I'm not even aware of. There are areas in my life where I've got a mind that is set against the voice of God in a certain area, that is set against the power of God in a certain area, and so do you. And you need to know that wherever it is that I've got a mind that is set against hearing His voice, doing what He's told me to do, responding to what He's instructed me to move in, wherever I've got a mind that is set against it, he could unleash all the power of heaven, and I still won't see it, and I still won't hear it. Search me, O God, and know my heart, know my mind, know my anxious thoughts. The spirit of unbelief unleashed in the church can stop absolutely right now the work of God. It can stop it in your life. I want to pray as we sing. In fact, I want you to stand. We're just going to have a short time of response to this. And I want to bind the spirit of unbelief, if it's here in any capacity, and unleash the spirit of belief, the spirit of faith that could be coming as a gift. The Bible tells us faith is a gift. And unleash that and just be encouraged and built up. And maybe nobody needs to come forward today, and you can just receive some gifts of faith as we sing and acknowledge God. We also want you to know every time we close, The front area is open for ministry. If you have a need or you want to be prayed for, for anything, for any capacity, whatever, we want you to come. Father, I am just real aware, even after I say what I just said, that whole sermon, that even the logic of it couldn't change anybody's mind. Some could even here be in bondage to literally a spirit of unbelief. And in the name of Jesus, I release your power. on any spirit of unbelief that would be here that would cause us to make things that don't matter matter, that would cause us to absolutely not even be able to see the hand of God and hear the word of God. We rebuke it and command it to leave so that faith can come. So that faith can come and maybe change your mind about who you are, change your mind about what you're saying to someone, and maybe nothing more than just deeply encourage some people who are discouraged and low on faith. Just bring your gift of faith. Bless us, God, with your gift of faith as we sing in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you.
