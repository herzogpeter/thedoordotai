Ephesians 4:1 I don't know about your Bible, but mine is getting pretty worn out here. I hope I can read it when we're done. I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, entreat you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing forbearance to one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Moving on to verse 4, There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. Let's pray as we begin. lord jesus once again the feelings i have at this moment are the same every week as i feel very small and insignificant in comparison to the power and the magnitude and the depth of your word and i feel terribly inadequate to in any way communicate that power and magnitude and depth to the hearts of people here and that is why lord jesus in a serious way we need to quiet ourselves and ask that your Holy Spirit would be our teacher. Not only that we would sit and nod our heads in approval concerning the things that are right and in disapproval to the things that are wrong, but rather that by the power of your Holy Spirit within us as we hear the word that it would affect our living. We ask this in Jesus' name. Amen. What it means to walk a worthy walk. It was about six months ago, or seven months ago, that we began the book of Ephesians, and I introduced you to a term that possibly you heard before, but the term was positional truth. Positional truth. We talked about that because that's exactly what Paul is talking about in the first three chapters of Ephesians. He is talking about the position of the believer before God. And we have learned that our position before God in Christ is that we have been blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places. We have learned that our position before God because we're in Christ is holy and blameless. When God sees me, he sees me in Christ, and therefore I am accepted. That's another position. I am accepted in the beloved one. I am redeemed through his blood. I am forgiven of my sin. I have become an inheritor of the kingdom of God. I am a recipient now of the Holy Spirit. I have been sealed in him. I have gone from death to life. And I have been united into one body, the body of Christ. And I am at peace with God, Ephesians 2. And those were wonderful things. And then we came to chapter 4, and the exhortation or the teaching began to change a little bit. Because he was no longer talking about positional truth, my position before God. he began to talk about practical truth. He's saying simply this when he says walk worthy, make your practice equal with your position. Walk a worthy walk. We discussed the fact that walking worthy simply means to balance the scales. We have been given a high and lofty position in Christ Jesus, and worthy walking is simply making my living balanced to what my position is. And we talked about the fact also that that's a very intimidating exhortation. I begin to think of all the things I need to do to walk a worthy walk. And immediately mostof us begin to think of all the rules we need to keep and all the deeds we need to do in order to walk a worthy walk. And so we figure, what I need to do to walk a worthy walk is I need to go to church. It's good to go tchurch. I need to read my Bible. It's good to read your Bible. I need to pray more than I do. I need to serve on the board. I need to get involved. All those things are wonderful. That isn't what Paul tells us is the worthy walk, however. He says there's something more important than those activities. In fact, he doesn't even mention any activities. And then I think there's all sorts of things I won't do in order to walk a worthy walk. Well, there are things as believers that we're not going to do, but they don't have anything to do with what Paul's talking about here. I figure what I really need to do to be a Christian is I won't do this, and I won't do that, and I won't drink, and I won't smoke, and I won't chew, and I won't go with anybody who do, you know, that whole thing. And then Paul, much to our chagrin, indicates to us simply this. When Paul says, walk worthy, here's how, He doesn't mention any activities. What he goes right for is the heart. He says, I want you to have the right attitude. We discovered in our study in chapter 4 that living the Christian life is not so much a matter of what I do, while that is involved in its coming later, at the very heart of things, at the very heart of the worthy walk, is having the right attitude. Having the right attitude. we've discovered that there are plenty of people who can do the deed there are plenty of people who can keep the rules there are plenty of people who can play the role and never be the person the person who does that Jesus calls a hypocrite the person who does the deed and keeps the rule and plays the role but isn't the person internally Jesus calls a hypocrite that's exactly who the Pharisee was by the way they were always busy doing the deed They kept the rules. They went to church. They served on the board. They did all the things that religion required of them. And Jesus looked them in the eyes and said, woe unto you, you Pharisees, you hypocrites. Why? Because they did the deed, but they had a lousy attitude. When Paul talks about a worthy walk, he's talking about something inside. Let's look again at the text. We know that it breaks down into two basic parts. That first verse, we see the call to the worthy walk. I therefore entreat you, I beg you to walk in a manner that's worthy of the calling with which you've been called. I beg you to balance the scales, make your practice equal with your position. And then as that intimidating exhortation comes, we have to have the question answered, how do I walk a worthy walk? And that's the second dimension of this text. It's the characteristics of the worthy walk in verses two and three. And here Paul gives these inner attitudes, five of them to be exact. The characteristics that God says constitute a worthy walk. How do I walk worthy of that high and lofty, exalted position? We joked around about the fact that sometimes we think what I do to walk worthy of that high, exalted position is stick out my chest, hold my head high, say I'm a king's kid and I'm going to live like a king. No, he says, if you're going to walk worthy of that high, lofty position, you're going to live in all humility. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt you. We've learned also that these truths, these characteristics are progressive. One leads to the other. Humility results in meekness. I am not even able to have the characteristic of meekness in my life, that lion under control, pouncing only at the right kinds of things, unless I've already dealt with humility. Humility results in meekness, which results in patience, which results in a forebearing love, and all of it, I want you to get this right now at the very beginning, the ultimate end of my individual walk with Jesus Christ, my individual worthy walk, having all these characteristics begin to be functional in my life, is unity in the body of Christ. Being diligent to preserve the unity. I want to tell you something right now, that God's primary concern for the church of Jesus Christ is that we be one. Jesus prayed to God the Father, and he says, My prayer for you is this, that they would be one, even as I am one with you. That they would be one. I want you to get this, because this is where the teaching comes in, and it's very important that we grasp this. Again, what have we been talking about for the first three chapters? We've been talking about positional truth. Who I am in Christ, positionally. Now he's saying, I want it practical. And that unity, we've already discovered, is positionally true. We discovered and were moved, you know, in our hearts as we went to chapter 2, verse 19, and discovered that you and I positionally are one. Whether I like it or not, that's a fact. Verse 19, so then, you are no longer strangers and aliens, but now you are fellow citizens with the saints and are of God's household. Like it or not, you and I are one, positionally. God looks at us and sees us as one. Over in verse 6, he's exhorting them again, and he says, To be specific, what I want you to know is the Gentiles, these people you don't like and aren't at all like you, whether you like it or not, they are fellow heirs. And they are fellow members of the body and fellow partakers of the promise of Christ Jesus through the gospel. You and I are one. We may be different. We may have all sorts of different ideas and perspectives and backgrounds, but you and I are one positionally. And you know what he's saying here? Again, we don't Galatians 3, 26. There's no distinction. Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, we're one positionally. and the problem that paul is addressing right here in this third verse of the fourth chapter is that even though positionally that's true the problem is too often practically we never see it we never see it you and i are one and i go yeah i know and uh yeah we're one but we never see it there's never that joy there's never that living there's never that life positionally and what he's saying here is i want to see that in your practice i want to see that being lived out in the church of Jesus Christ. One of the things that we're learning in the book of Ephesians is that this unity in the church is the single most effective manifestation of Christ through the church in the world. And we know that too. We've learned in the book of Ephesians that the church is the body of Christ. Not just a body, but the body of Christ. We've called it body two. Remember that? Jesus Christ incarnate, God incarnate, was body one, the body one. We are body too. We are the manifestation of Christ in the world. And the best way we do that is through our unity, our love for each other. But there's a problem with unity. Always has been, always will be. It's this, that we're different. You and I are different. We have different tastes. We have different opinions. We have different economic statuses all through this church. We have different races. We have different goals in our lives. We have different needs. Result of that is what? The result of that is factions. The result of that is separations. You know, it's real hard for me to handle you if you've got a different opinion than me. You see, I can handle people who think like I do, who feel like I do, who respond like I do, who like the same kinds of things. And those are the people I gravitate to. And there's the people over here who like this, and there's the people over there who like that. We're all in the same church. We call it unity. It isn't. And those factions that come just because we're different is something that is very normal to humanity. It's something that the world knows all about. It's something that the world has never seen anything different than that. I hope that made any sense at all. What is typical in our world and what we have all experienced over and over again is disunity, discord, dishonesty, and distrust. And so Jesus, when he was thinking before the foundation of the world of what the church of Christ was going to be, he thought this. in a world where all we know is distrust, dishonesty, disrespect, discord, and dishonesty, I'm going to build a church. And that church is going to be the manifestation of me. And that church, in the midst of all that stuff, is going to have unity. And they're going to love each other. And they're going to be the demonstration to the world of what society can be when I am at the head, when I am at the center of that society. The question we have to ask then is, how do we get that unity? we all agree that unity is something important that's important how do we get that unity the answer to that is easy we'll get the board together and i can just see me as the pastor getting together and i say i know the answer to the problem of unity in church of the open door it's simply this if they would see it my way we'd have unity right if you'd all agree with me we'd have unity that's right now it'd be great if those goofy people would do what i wanted them to do we We have unity. Everybody would agree. We'd all be doing the same thing. We'd all be thinking the same way. It'd be great. We'd have unity. I see some snickers out there because we kind of think that way. One of the biggies, I'm afraid, in the evangelical church today, and it's one that I just need to grab you and say, let's not ever get into this, and if we've slipped into it all, let's be rebuked and deal with it. It's this, that I think sometimes the church of Christ sets up a little subculture. and we have all sorts of written rules and we have even more unwritten rules that nobody really knows they come in and they're supposed to kind of pick it up and basically the pressure is this when you come into the church you're going to be most accepted when you think like us and so we try to create a little subculture where we're all alike where we think alike where we talk alike where we act alike where we dress alike where we look alike where we cut our hair alike, where we eat alike, we go to the same places, we like alike and we dislike alike. Everything's alike. It's great. And then we call it unity. The problem with that kind of unity, I think you know what I'm talking about, that kind of thing where we're all the same. The problem with that kind of unity is simply this. It's not very special. It's not very special. It's not the kind of unity that the world looks at and says, ah, that's something special. That's the kind of unity I could go to the moose lodge and find, you know? Wear the moose lodge, they're all the same. They think the same, they talk the same, they wear the same stupid hats, you know? The grand boobah, I think of Fred Flintstone, you know? But think about that. I really want to grab you here. We kind of set churches up to be the same way. And we call it unity. That's not unity. There are churches, big and grand. You know, I was thinking about this as we're doing the distinctives of a dynamic church in the evenings. And one of the things I indicated last week as we began that a dynamic church, it has nothing to do with the size. And one of the cases in point is the fact that I know of churches that are huge. And their whole building and their whole work is built around this fact that they have legislated people's thinking, they have legislated people's behavior, and the result is everybody's the same, everybody thinks the same, everybody acts the same, they walk the same, they talk the same, they look, it's wonderful, and they call it unity. And if you're different, if you come in and you're different, they'll instruct you real quick as to how to get in line, and if you don't get in line, you're going to be made to feel so uncomfortable that eventually you leave, and it all remains pure, you know. We're still united. the problem again is that the world doesn't look at that and say ah that's something special the world i'm afraid looks at that and says ah that's another organization just like the moose lodge if you're like them you'll get loved i you know i call that big deal unity that kind of unity that i'm where everybody's the same and thinks the same it looks that's big deal unity i want you to move to matthew chapter five jesus talks about big deal love. Big deal. Big deal you're united like that. Makes no difference. Matthew chapter 5 verse 43. He says this, you have heard that it was said, you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. Sounds like good advice. But I say to you something different. I say love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you in order that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven. for he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. Verse 46, I love it. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax gatherers do the same. What he's saying there is a big deal. So what, you love people who are like you? Big deal. Verse 47, and if you greet your brothers only, what do you do more than the others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? There are people in the world who don't know Christ, don't even know his name, and they do that. They have that kind of unity. They have that kind of love. It's big deal love. It's big deal unity. So what? We're all the same. We think the same. So we're united. That's not the kind of unity that Jesus had intended for the church of Christ to have. You see, the unity of the body of Christ that is a manifestation of Christ in the world, this supernatural unity that causes a fragmented, disunited, a society that's full of discord, that causes that kind of society to look and take notice and say, aha, there's something special, there's something different, there is something that is not of this world, is not the kind of unity that takes people who are different and makes them the same, like little cookie cutters. It's the kind of unity that takes people who are different and leaves them different, but they love each other. the miracle of supernatural unity is taking people who are different worlds apart worlds apart and in the midst of all those differences they love each other they care about each other that's the kind of unity that causes the world to sit up and take notice that is special that is the kind of thing that will have an impact on crystal the kind of unity I'm talking about is the kind of unity that takes a Jew and a Gentile, chapter 2. Jew and a Gentile not only makes them positionally one, isn't that nice? Jew and Gentile, you and I are one. I know in Christ, and I can talk theologically all day long about how you and I are one, Jew and Gentile. But we're miles apart. You will never be a Jew. I'll never be a Gentile. And we're one. But this kind of unity is the kind that takes a Jew and a Gentile and makes them love each other and care about each other and be involved in each other. And neither one of them has to change first. Takes a slave and a free and makes them one. Takes a male and a female and makes them one. Takes a black and a white and makes them one Takes a long haired person and a short haired person Let's get a little closer And makes them one And makes me not so I'm looking down my nose That somebody doesn't look like me And they don't have to cut their hair before I love them And they don't have to grow their hair long before I love them That's the kind of unity that makes a difference It's like taking a guy who's wearing a three piece suit in our church And a guy who's coming in blue jeans and a flannel shirt And making them one and love each other And you don't have to wear a three piece suit before I love you but that's the kind of love we know about and that's the kind of love a society that's fragmented knows about it's all conditional i know they'll love me when i'm like them it's the kind of unity and love that takes a liberal and a conservative and puts them together that may not hit any nerves here but there are people who hate each other because of the political point of view a democrat and a republican rich and poor baptists and charismatics and puts them together and they love each other and they don't have to change before they do old and young parent and child all the differences are still there these people are never going to be the same there are people who are going to come into our church and are responding to christ and they're never going to look like you and me and they're never going to they're never going to wear the three-piece suit and they're never going to be just the way we want him to be. And we are called to a unity that loves and loves and loves and cares about everybody just the same. It's realizing that we are part of one body, one spirit, have one calling with one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father who is of all, who is over all, who is through all, and who is in all. Folks, that is the kind of unity that causes the world to sit up and take notice, when it sees black and white, when it sees long-haired people and short-haired people, when it sees three-piece suit people and grubby people, when it sees liberals and conservatives, when it sees rich people and poor people, old and young, not just sitting in the same church, not just sitting there and putting up with them over there, but when he sees those people with those kinds of differences coming together and caring about each other and loving each other. Then the world, that society that all they know is fragmentation and discord, the world can look at a structure like that, a society like that, and say, aha, I see all these differences, and they still love each other, and they still care about each other, and there's not all these conditions placed upon it. Maybe I could go there too and get loved. I've stayed away from the church for years because I felt if I went in there, I would just feel like I'm on the outside, and I have to change. I have to be just like them. And now I'm looking at a society that everybody's loved. Maybe I could go there too. maybe I could get loved just like it looks like they're getting loved so we go and we give it a try and so often too often what happens when we go and what happens what we see and what we experience is that while we talk about unity it's positional it's positional unity and I don't see it in practice because the truth is if I dress a certain way and if I talk a certain way and if I think a certain way and if I have a certain background and if I do certain things then you're one of us you're one of us we love it we love people who are one of us and it fits so nice and there's unity and good fellowship because you're one of us because you're just like us the result the result is the people who kind of feel like you're one of us and I'm looking for people who are just like me the people who are like that, the problem with them too often is that they kind of have settled down into a sense of self-satisfaction. There really is no need for me to reach out to anybody who's different than me because my little needs, because of my five friends, are meeting all my needs. And I'm not even aware that anybody else in our church or in our community has any kinds of needs like that. And the problem for the newcomer, who isn't just like us, what happens when he comes is he doesn't know the criteria he doesn't know the credentials he doesn't know how he's supposed to talk or how he's supposed to look or da da da da and he begins to wonder what does it take to be one of them you know what it takes to be one it takes three three things three possible things can happen if someone comes into a church and they don't sense that kind of acceptance no matter what three things can happen the first thing that can happen is if i come in and i don't feel accepted because i'm so much different see you know i've never been i've never been the victim of that because I'm always like them. You know, I'm always like most church people. I come in with three-piece suit, and it's real easy. But I sometimes need to put myself in the position of that person who isn't like me and doesn't look like me, and it's hard. And there's three things that can happen if you come into a place and you're feeling that pressure. One is just to leave. I come in, I feel it, I don't like what I feel, I feel, and maybe they're valid feelings and maybe they're not, but I leave because I'm just too uncomfortable here. These people aren't like me, they'll never accept me, blah, blah, blah. The other thing is I can find out all the things I need to be. I can find out what are the hoops that I'm supposed to jump through. What are the little things I'm supposed to say? What are the little ways I'm supposed to look? And I'll find out what they are and I'll do them. Whatever it is I need to do, I'll do them. Those are the people we love. Those are the people we think are the greatest. They came in and they just did it all. They cleaned their house and they changed their clothes and they cut their hair. And boy, they're just like us now. Unity. Great. The other thing you can do is form your own group. You just come in and form your own group. You know, if you come in and let's just reverse the whole roles. We've got a church full of grubbies, okay? Just a church full of grubbies. All you ever do, you just come in flannel T-shirts and blue jeans every Sunday. And then somebody comes in with a three-piece suit. Well, he'd leave if he was the only one. But all of a sudden, he looks across the aisle and he sees somebody else with a three-piece suit. I'm going to sit by him. Go over there and sit by him. We got our own group. We're the dressy people. And then they have their own group. And they're cut off from everybody else, but they've got their own group, so they've got some sort of thing. And then all of a sudden we've got these little groups all over the church. And the world looks at that and sees nothing special. Nothing special. We've got a group of rich people and a group of poor people and a group of fancy people and a group of grubby people and a group of athletic people and a group of people who like to read and things like that all through. nothing special. We fit into that sometimes. We do. We get into this kind of thing. You know, it hasn't really happened in the same day, but it seems like it. I'll have someone come to me. I remember someone coming to me in my former church and came up to me and just was so flustered. Oh, Pastor Dave, how can that person come to church dressed like that way in jeans? They have no respect. They have no respect. What do you think, Pastor? I think it doesn't matter. I think it doesn't matter. And you know the reason I don't think it matters is because 10 minutes ago, that person came up to me and says, you know these people walking around with three-piece suits, they think they're so sharp. I don't think there's any need to wear a three-piece suit. What do you think, Pastor? You know what? I don't think it matters. I don't think it matters. You know what? The unity that manifests Christ comes when? It comes when those two spiritual babies I just talked about come together and embrace and realize that positionally they're one and now practically the call of God on their life is to practically be one and love each other and not have to change first. I heard a story of a church in California. I just think this, I think I might have even told you this before, but they were having a problem. The spirit just began to move in that church and young people, they were having an especially effective impact on young people in the area. And that was the day when the hippie movement was going and all that kind of thing. And it was really a lot more volatile then than it is now. We really don't have that kind of thing anymore. But these kids started coming to the church. And the amazing thing was they were just brand new Christians and they were so hungry to hear the word that you just couldn't believe it. You couldn't give them enough. They had a Bible study, they were there. They had a prayer meeting, they were there. Sunday school, they were there. Church, they sat right in the front row. Problem was, they didn't learn that they were supposed to cut their hair yet and put on three-piece suits yet. And so what they did, they came in their blue jeans and they had rivets in their blue jeans and they started scratching the pews. Oh, brother, I'm talking about serious problem. And so some of the people came and said, Pastor, we've got a serious problem. And the problem is this, the pews are getting scratched. What are we going to do about that? And he scratched his head a little bit. And a light went on and I think it was a revelation from God. He said, I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll get rid of the pews. Just move right out of here. you know i don't know if they did that or not but that i think he made his point i think he made his point unity in the church doesn't come because we're all the same and think the same and act the same and like the same and dislike the same unity in church that becomes a manifestation of christ of the world is the kind of unity that brings everybody and anybody and tells them about jesus and changes their life on the inside. And people get loved. When people come here, they get loved. The big question is how. You know, really, it's just pious stuff I'm saying now. You know, like a pep talk. How? How do I do that? You know, it's become so much part of our lives that we gravitate. And, you know, it's natural to a point that we are going to gravitate to people that are like us. My best friends are going to be a lot like me. And you too. And I think we know the difference. But it's become so much a part of our lives. How do we break it up? How do we break the crust off of those kinds of things that would in any way, even subtly, exclude someone who isn't just like us? So that anybody can walk in the door of our church and feel, right now, the warmth and the love, and not only just right now, but consistently through their lives. There's a lot of people. This just came to me. There's a lot of people. We have a warm and loving church. You come here, I think you get mobbed. I see it all the time. The kind of thing that we're looking for, though, is consistently over time where we're caring and involved and over at the house and that's the kind of thing that demonstrates it. What's going to break through that? What's going to establish that as part of our lifestyle? Oh, I know. I know what it'll do. A committee. Form a committee. A task force. Dave, we need unity. We need it now. Dave, let's take action. We'll call it the committee for consulting upon church unity. Consulting upon church unity. We'll call it the cuckoo committee. No. No, I think every one of us know that there is no program that can make a church manifest Christ. There is no program that can make a church manifest Christ. There is no program that can stimulate people to meet the needs of other people. There is no program that can promote fellowship that reaches out beyond my five friends. None. You know what it takes? It takes a change of heart. It takes a change of attitude. It takes humility first. It takes somebody, one person, one person who would have the attitude in them that was also in Christ Jesus, who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, I'm going to take it for myself, but emptied himself and did what? He became a what? A servant. One person. You break through the crust with humility. One person who will come and say, I have come not to be served but to serve. And then another person, and then another person. And when you got the whole crazy church living like that, you manifest Christ. what our church needs is not a program to promote unity what our church needs is people who like isaiah say i have seen the lord and i am insignificant and so now i'm going to serve and now i'm going to give i have come to serve you you break it up with humility you break it up with meekness all these qualities are the worthy walk one one person who will come and being reviled will not revile and return and all of a sudden for the first time in somebody's life someone comes here and they they go and the person goes okay and they don't revile and return and they go what did he just do i never saw that before patience you break it up with patience next week we're going to study that you know i've been going through these characteristics one by one and i was doing my final draft last this friday and i was dealing with the whole word was going to be patience we're going to study patience because what it really is is endurance and it's important and it's good And the Lord, I just, I really believe the Lord just intervened and changed the whole thing to make the theme unity this morning. But in a couple weeks, we're going to study what that means, patience, endurance. But 1 Thessalonians 5 says, admonish the unruly. Excuse me. Encourage the fainthearted. Help the weak. Be patient with everybody. Be patient with everybody. Put up with it. Care about them. Stick with them. Hang with them. That's what it means to hang in there with them. Somebody. You know how you break up the crust of all that lack of living? is for somebody, one person to come in and stick with you when you're not doing it all right, to hang with you when you're not saying the right things, to love you, to be patient, forbearing love, forbearing love. You get in my way, you're going to get loved. Just last week I went to visit Earl Goodrich, a couple weeks ago when he was in the hospital and so seriously ill. And he was in the ICU. And I've been there many times, and whenever you're in ICU they have your heart on a monitor and it bounces up and down, when the bounces bounces when the bounce is bouncing that means you're alive it means everything's okay when it's going straight it means you're dead and that's bad news but seeing that heart monitor reminded me of an illustration that i had heard when jeff van vandren came and did his his um seminar on relationships just a tremendous time we had by the way i think all of you who were there know about that but it was an illustration and it was he was using this this heart monitor that bounces up and down to be an indicator of what relationships are like. And relationships that are alive and thriving and healthy are bouncing up and down. And all of these little characteristics of good relationships are like a bounce, love, boom, trustworthiness, boom, respect, selflessness, bounce, bounce, bounce. All of those characteristics are things that keep that relationship alive. Caring about each other, boom, it keeps the relationship alive. The sad part about this whole thing in terms of relationships is whether or not those signs of life are there, one thing happens in every relationship. It's this, that a bonding takes place, okay? The problem is that this bonding takes place whether or not those characteristics are there. I'll give you an example. If there's a divorce and you're married and something happens and there's a divorce, you can be separate from her or him for years and all of a sudden you come back and you're sitting in the same room and there is no love, there's no communication, there's no trust, there's no respect, nothing is happening in terms of life, but there's still this sickening bond, okay? There's something there. There's something that connects us. You can go to a high school reunion, you feel the same kind of thing. No love, no communication, no respect, nothing really happening in terms of a living relationship, but you go and you feel something. You feel a bond of some kind. Some families have the same kind of thing. They live together, but there is no honesty there no life there's nothing that would bounce that way there's no respect there's no honesty there's no love in that family so basically what you have is a straight line but there's a bond and we all stay together because we're supposed to stay together and it becomes a big should but it's dead it's like a straight line like a straight line nothing's happening and everybody feels trapped we're stuck and when i thought of that illustration i thought of the church in regards to this whole unity thing positionally what we are one aren't we and That's like the bond. Whether I like it or not, you and I are one. It's a bond. And there may be that there is no life in that bond. And there's nothing, there's none of the trust happening, there's none of the love happening, there's none of the self-respect or the selflessness between you and me that's going on that's making it alive. But there is this bond. And so we sit together and we stay together and we kind of, it's just a bunch of shoulds. I should love you. I should stay here. I'm supposed to do this. I'm supposed to do that. But there's nothing. It's dead and it's icky and nobody enjoys it. There's no joy. There's no life. You know what they do with someone on a heart monitor when the level is straight? You know what they do? They shock them. Boom! And if you have to take it again, they shock them again and hopefully it'll get the signs of life coming back again. You know what I think Paul is telling us to do? To break up the deadness of positional unity into a living, loving unity of the Spirit? You know what you do when it's dead and all you have is, you know when I should be one? You shock it with humility. I like that. You come into a relationship that's dead and you just blow it right off its foundation by being humble. Oh, what would you do? You shock it with humility. You shock it with meekness. You shock it with patience. I'm going to hang with you. I'm going to hang with you. And I'm going to love you. You shock it with forbearing love. people who consider the needs of others as more important than their own who come together to serve all these qualities working together to produce a unity and a love in society in a society that knows nothing about that and that kind of unity causes a fragmented society to look and say that has got a supernatural source I therefore the prisoner of the Lord entreat you for walking a manner worthy of the calling with which you've been called with all humility humble yourself with all meekness gentleness with patience showing forbearance to one another in love being diligent to preserve the unity diligent to preserve you know I love that you know preserve means it means the unity is already there positional what we need to do is preserve it keep it the only thing we can do with unity is destroy it God's already given it to us we need to preserve it the word diligent means start right now do it right now Thank you.
