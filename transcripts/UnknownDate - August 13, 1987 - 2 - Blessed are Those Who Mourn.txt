Matthew 5:1, our continuing study in the book of Matthew. We read these words: "And when he saw the multitudes, he went up on the mountain, and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. And opening his mouth, he began to teach them, saying, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." We learned a couple of weeks ago that that meant, "Blessed are those who are broken, for theirs alone is the kingdom of heaven." are those who mourn, for they alone shall be comforted. Let's stop right there. That's as far as we're going to get. Let's pray. Father God, I thank you for just being here. God, this day means a lot to us as a church. It means a lot to me. It is a culmination of prayer. It is a culmination of an overwhelming sense of your direction in speaking to us and speaking to me about what we need to do and where we need to go. And I feel, God, this morning that you are pleased because I feel like we've been obedient. And this is scary and it's exciting. It's frightening and uneasy for some. For others, they can't stay in their skin. But God, I pray in Jesus' name that as we consider this as being a culmination that we also see it powerfully as a beginning of a whole new day for us as a church. And Father, may our focus not be Cooper. God, get that out of here. And may it not be growing. God, we pray that our focus would be you and your kingdom and nothing, nothing else. And Father, this morning as we sit at your feet and hear you preach to us as you did to the disciples on that hillside, I pray that as disciples, we would have ears to hear. And even in our questioning, Father, we would be willing to fight through what we do not understand so that we can, as a church, as individuals, bring our hearts and minds and lives into subjection to you, our King. I pray, Jesus, by your authority and anointing on this time of ministry through your word. I pray that in ways that we can clearly identify, we would hear your voice this morning. And I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. As we pick up our study, one of the things that's extremely important for us to do is be reminded of the context. I've told you this many times before as we teach through any passage of Scripture, that in order for us to understand what he's saying, whoever the author is, we need to understand why he's saying it. and the situation that is surrounding Jesus sitting on a hillside and teaching his disciples kingdom life principles, the situation that surrounds it gives this sermon a tremendous amount of meaning, and meaning that if missed, we will miss, I think, the whole point. That's a serious thing to miss, too. The context is this. You remember in chapter 4 that the ministry of Jesus had just begun. Up to that point, everything that had happened was preparation. Matthew had been presenting Jesus in his birth as the king. We saw him baptized. We saw him accept his mission to be the redeemer of the world. But nothing has really focused on Jesus himself. It has been, as it were, the loading of the gun. But in chapter 4, verses 12 through 25, we saw Jesus pull the trigger. In chapter 4, verse 16, the light dawned. Verse 16 says this, the people who were sitting in darkness saw a great light. The work of Jesus has begun. That's what that meant. And to those who were sitting in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light dawned. But we learn more than that. A light went on, but that light was a kingdom. And he talked about that in verse 17. But we learn more than that. The kingdom had an army, and he went about all of Galilee, finding these fishermen who would follow him, and he began to teach them what it meant to be followers of his. But then we learn, and so it demonstrated that the kingdom that I bring, Jesus said, you need to understand is not just the kingdom of words, but it is a kingdom of power. Let me show you what I mean, verse 23. And Jesus was going about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, simply meaning this, the reign of God has come. And he began to talk about that, but he didn't just talk about it, he began to do what God does, what the kingdom does. He began to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people and news about him went into all Syria and they were brought to him, all who were ill, taken with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics, and he healed them. What we have here now is an overnight sensation. Right now, we've got credibility, Jesus does. He is the hottest thing going. There is excitement, there is energy, there is enthusiasm, there is success. Look at it in verse 25. And when all those things happened, you see, and people were being healed, and demoniacs were being set free, multitudes followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea. and even from beyond the Jordan. We're talking about hot stuff. This is the first church of what's happening now. The place to be is here. Wouldn't you agree? It started in Galilee, but when they heard about the neat stuff going on, from all over the place, people started coming. Because there was something real, and there was something powerful. And then in chapter 5, verse 1, Jesus ruins the whole thing, and he says this. And when he saw the multitudes, and when he saw the bandwagon effect, because he knew that they were coming for the razzle-dazzle stuff, he said, hold on just a minute. And he went up onto the mountain, and after he sat down, his disciples came to him, and opening his mouth, he began to teach them, saying this, Friends, I've got some good news, but I've got some bad news. The good news is this, the kingdom that I have brought is indeed a kingdom of power, And it's a kingdom of authority. And it's a kingdom of healing and setting people who are in bondage free. And it's better than you could possibly imagine. And the kingdom that I talk about is a kingdom of blessing. Blessed are the... Blessed are the... But the bad news is this. The kingdom that you seek is not going to be obtained the way you think. Beloved, if you're coming along for the ride, and if you're coming to me out of Decapolis and Jerusalem and all these other things, because of the wowee-zowie things, you are never really going to understand the principles of kingdom life that actually release the power that you just saw. And with all of these people coming, and by the way, I need to just clarify something. The word disciples there, we in our minds would think that disciples would be the 12. We've got this little thing with 12 people around. The 12 hadn't even been fully formed yet at this particular time. And the word disciples there is mafetes, followers of Christ. There's a place later on in the Gospels where we find out that a whole bunch of disciples left Jesus because his teaching confounded them. We've got a good group here. It may not be the whole multitude, but there are followers of Christ, a good number of people who are listening. And then he begins to say, Blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are the gentle. Blessed are the hungry. How do you think they reacted, those people? Again, you've got to remember why they came. It was all this neat stuff happening. You think he just popped their balloon? I think he did. If I was sitting there, and if you were sitting there, and we had come because all this neat stuff was happening, I think I'd be a little frustrated with what Jesus said. I think I'd be a little confused with what he just said. Lord, I realize this is neat. You know, you're a God guy, and, you know, blessed are the poor. I know that's really a spiritual thing, and we'll kind of get poor. And I'm going to wait for you to finish this sermon, because the questions I really got are totally different than this. I don't want to know how to be poor, and I don't want to know about mourning. What I want to know is how you healed that guy. I want to know how you cast that demon out. Now, really, Lord, the question I got, you did something to your voice. You did. You did. Indeed. I heard that. Could you teach me how to do that? And when you cast that demon out, shush, shush. I'm preaching. Don't interrupt me. And when you cast that demon out, you did something with your hand. You held it a certain way. You touched him there. And I want to know about that stuff. And I want to know how to be big. And I want to know how to draw a crowd like you just did. And I want to know how to be a success. And how can we learn to do all that stuff? And how can we learn to be popular? And when he saw the multitudes, he went up on the mountain and sat down. And his disciples came to him and opening his mouth, he said, Blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are the gentle. Dave. Come here, I've got to talk to you, Dave. This is really neat, this blessed are the poor stuff. This is spiritual stuff, and you're a God guy. Happy are the sad. And I really think that that's a sermon you need to preach. Don't get me wrong. I think this is good stuff. But look at where we are today. This is Cooper. We've been waiting for this for months. We've been thinking about this and praying about this, and we're excited about this. And now, with all this enthusiasm and all this good stuff happening, you're getting this happy are the sad. I saw it in the bulletin. You know, I like this expository stuff, but you get rigid. You need to kind of go with the flow here and come up with something else. Let me give you some ideas. We're at Cooper. We got all sorts of new things coming. You should have gotten something out of Joshua. Possess the land. Step out in faith. That would have worked. In fact, you know what you could have done. You didn't even have to do that, Dave. You could have just timed it better. If you would have done, if you could have milked chapter 4 a little bit more. you could have been you could have been preaching about jesus casting out the demons and doing all the kingdom work on this sunday do you remember all the people who came forward that day and says i don't want to be part of the audience i want to be part of the army with tears streaming on our cheeks people came wouldn't it have been neat if that was here didn't you learn anything in seminary today dave we want to hear about how we can't fail and we want to hear about how successful we're going to be and we want to hear how big we're going to get and we want to hear about the impact we're going to have in the city and the state and the nation and even in the world and onward christian children and make us feel good about this and use the moment and give it a push when jesus saw the multitudes he went up on the mountain and after he sat down he said blessed are the poor in spirit and blessed are those who mourn and blessed are those who hunger and thirst this is what the kingdom is all about beloved a couple of weeks ago when i was anticipating coming here and knowing what i'd feel in my spirit about what i think it does mean for us as a church i was a little frustrated knowing that i I was going to be talking about this on this day. And I thought to myself, this doesn't fit. But I want to tell you something. God has begun to deal with me in the last several weeks. And he began to reveal to me powerfully that there is no passage that could possibly be more appropriate for us on this day than this one. You see, as we enter into a new day, beloved, and we enter into change, and as we enter into growth, that I don't think we have any idea how impacting our fellowship might be. As we enter into that, there are questions that have got to be going through your minds. I know there are questions in my mind, and one of the things that goes in my mind is this. What kind of church are we going to become? Are we going to become? What are we going to look like? What are going to be the things that characterize us? Let me ask you another question. What do you want us to look like? As we begin to emerge, what is our neighborhood going to see? What's going to characterize us? Are we going to be a big one? we're going to be a big church we're going to be a successful one we're going to be a well-known one we're going to be a rich one not with this group um we don't want to be a rich one we that's that's not really a big lure to us but we would like to be known as an innovative one we could feel good about ourselves if we were innovative hey we're going to cooper yeah that's really different is that what we're going to be known as that innovative church that with it church that on the cutting edge church what will characterize us and again i ask you this in your own spirit as you come with us and make this move with us in your spirit as you consider yourself part of this body the question is what do you want to characterize us as we come into this neighborhood and the and our church emerges i think as a force that people hear more and more about what do you want people to see what do you want people to say that open door is big that open door is successful on the cutting edge they do it right or is what in your is in your heart and mind as far as what you like us to be characterized by and what people say is that open door crazy church is full of broken dependent mourning hungry people who really don't care too much about being big and about being successful and they're not trying real hard to be innovative what they want more than anything in the world is to be like their king. What they want more than anything in the world is to be the salt of the earth, to be lights in a dark world, to be a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid. If that is what you want more than anything in the world, you stick around. You know what's interesting? When we genuinely, from the depth of our heart, make those things our focus, a lot of those other things are going to be added unto us. It's amazing when you just start focusing on God and asking him what to do, how innovative you get. And how people are drawn when the life of God is flowing. It's called seeking the kingdom first. And all these things are added unto us. But beloved, this passage comes as teaching to us, but it also comes, I think, as a word from Jesus Christ himself to us on this day. With all the excitement, we better never forget what the kingdom life is all about. Blessed are the broken. Happy are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. With that introduction, sorry, that wasn't a sermon. I want us to see ourselves sitting at the feet of Jesus on a hill in Galilee and eagerly saying, Lord, teach us what this means. I'm going to break it down into two parts. I'm simply going to define it, and then I'm going to apply it. It's real simple. Define it. The way I'm going to define it, let's do it this way. You kind of enter into it with me a little bit. When you see that passage, blessed are those who mourn, in the bulletin it says, happy are the sad. I'm going to talk about that in a minute. But blessed are those who are mourning. What are some of the impressions you get? What are some of your first reactions to that? I would dare say that your first reaction is kind of negative. That's my first reaction. It doesn't really ring true to me. It doesn't ring real exciting to me. One of the ways I deal with it is by saying this. Well, that truly is a virtue, being mourning. And if Jesus said it, it must be true. And this is the Bible. And it really is a good thing if we're all sad and mourning, I guess, because that's what the Bible says. And we really shouldn't laugh as much as we do. And we really shouldn't be as happy as we are. And maybe we should just kind of get sad and poke ourselves or something. You know, that is our perception of what spiritual life is all about. Every once in a while, I'll hear a group of people, maybe after church or somewhere in the church context, and they'll be talking about something and maybe even they're talking about the Lord and all of a sudden they'll just burst out in laughter and then they'll all silence each other kiddingly saying, hey, oh, this is church. Can we do this in church? Because you're supposed to be sad. And I'm afraid that some people do indeed take passages of scripture like this and use it as a proof text for a sour disposition and a miserable, grumpy life because they're so terribly unhappy and they never want to deal with the pain in their life and they even begin to think that they're somehow spiritual and everyone else is trivial because they're walking around in tune with how miserable life is. There's a problem with that perception as being this, what Jesus is trying to say here. The problem with it is found in Galatians for one place because the fruit of the Spirit is first of all love. The fruit of the Spirit is also joy. The Proverbs talk about a merry heart doing good like a medicine. So something's missing there. Maybe one of the reactions you have to that is the one, excuse me, that is reflected in the bulletin that I wrote. You feel more like David when it comes to mourning and sadness, where you'd like to be like a bird who could fly away. Excuse me. And get rid of all those things, and the pressure gets to be too much, and the things that are driving through your life, and the pressure that you feel becomes so much that you just like to get away. And being able to correlate mourning with blessedness is something you just can't do. Let me bring you in here together and focus on something. First of all, we've got a lot of misimpressions relative to what Jesus is saying here. But also, we need to affirm the fact that what Jesus is saying is a true thing. It is true that blessed are those who mourn because they will be comforted. What we need to discover is the sense in which that is true. Let's get down to the word and actually define it. The word mourning is the word penthos in the Greek. It means to grieve or to sorrow or to mourn. It's a big help. You can write that down. I'm sure that just kind of blows you away. That doesn't help us at all. To grieve or to sorrow or to mourn. something you need to know about this word something you need to know about the whole concept of concept of sorrowing in the new testament there are nine greek verbs for the concept that describes sorrowing this one is very specific in what it's trying to communicate specifically this word penthos that is here called mourning is a word that is not just an internal sad feeling specifically it is an external expression of an internal condition. It is an outwardly expressed sadness. It is expressed with tears. It is expressed with your body. It is expressed with sobbing. In the Old Testament, people knew how to mourn. When something bad happened, they would wrap themselves in what? Sackcloth and ashes. An external expression of an internal sadness. So what? You're still not moving me very much here, Dave. That doesn't really help me much. It does help you if you understand something. The reason that is so specific is this. It is very possible for people to be sad, to be very sad, but to never get the sadness that is in them out here. And if you're just sad in here, but you don't deal with your sadness out here, you will never be comforted. It is only those who have the sadness that is in here being able to come out here where they can deal with it, whoever get comforted, them alone. We walk around churches, and you've been in churches, and I hope this is not the case here, where we see a lot of happy people. Because you can't come to church sad. You can't come that way. You come to church happy. In fact, sometimes when you're sad and you feel inadequate and you don't feel very good, the last place in the world you're going to go is church. Why? Because I got to be happy when I go there. And sometimes you come anyway and your spirit is grieved and you feel far from your wife or far from your husband and your life isn't working. And you wish like crazy you could come into a place and be on the outside the way you feel on the inside, but there is no freedom. So even though you're sad on the inside, you look happy on the outside. You've got some bad news for you. No comfort for you. Talking about the kingdom, we're talking about being a kingdom church. What kind of church are we going to become? I hope and I pray and I trust that this is your desire joining with me as well, that more and more and more we are a church where broken people are free to come and broken people are free to express the pain that they've got and free to confess the sin that they've got. And when they do, they get something. What is that? Comfort. The reason that is, you know, you might say, yeah, okay, that's okay. The problem is what I just said is a bombshell in some churches. You know why? Because in some churches, if you go there and express the inadequacy you feel or confess the sin that you're in, you do not get comfort, you get condemnation. And you know what? That does something to your spirit. It's this. A vow is emerging from your spirit that says this. I will never do that again. I will never share an intimate feeling. I will never confess a sin because when I am in this church, what I get is condemned. I don't get comfort. A church like that, beloved, hear this, is not a kingdom church. It could be a big one. It could be a successful one. but where people who are mourning over sin, mourning over pain, getting it out here, get condemnation, the work of God does not happen there. I was talking to Jeff Van Vaughan this last week about these concepts, and one of the things he shared with me was that one of the problems with churches that are exciting and successful and big and emerging into some very exciting things is that pretty soon they do begin to get focused on their success and on their bigness and how their impact, you know. and you know if we're going to get as big as we need to be and as impacting as we want to be then broken people are going to get in the way you see broken sad people don't pay the bills oh get them out of here don't call it a kingdom church anymore just call it a big one just call it a successful one that's the true thing that's the definition i want to apply it now and it gets applied two ways. First of all, psychologically, this statement is a true thing. You've already gotten the feel of that from what I've just said. Psychologically, it's a true thing. Spiritually, also, it's a true thing. Let me hit the psychology aspect of it first. Every once in a while, people say things like this. Well, I went off and I had a good cry and I got it all out and I feel better. Psychologically, that's basically what's happening here. What happened was I got it out. There was something in me that was sad and I didn't just sit here being sad. I got it out. That's what mourning is. You haven't mourned until it comes out. And when I mourned and got it out, that's when I got comfort. I feel better. Whether we like it or not, or whether we understand it or not, the ability to get out here, what is in here, is absolutely essential to emotional health. I believe that we have been given by God a gift. It is a pressure valve. It is an emotional pressure valve. And if that emotional pressure valve is not allowed to function because I'm such a good Christian, I don't ever have pain and I don't ever get sad and I always need to look strong and it's frozen sometimes when you're two years old. I believe that people whose emotional pressure valve is frozen get poisoned because that stuff that's in there, if it never is allowed to get out, will poison your emotional system. I'm going to tell you a true thing. That is this, a fact. The sickest people you will ever meet, the most unhappy people you will ever know, the hardest people for you to ever be around are people who have never been given permission inside of themselves to be out here the way they are in here. They are the saddest people of all. Because they're sad but they haven't mourned. They haven't gotten it out. I had the privilege this last week to be at a place where people were dealing with some very, very severe depression. Depression that had debilitated their ability to live normally and to function. And one of the things that came out as I was listening to people go around this circle and share things that had been happening to them over several weeks was this, that over and over tears came and tears that normally didn't come to people who were really tough and held it all in and were real strong. And some people, one person in particular, had gotten in touch with some pain that was so long that this person had totally forgotten about it, ended up spending an entire day sobbing, getting out here, what was in here. And you know what happened to that person? Isn't that a fun thing? Wouldn't you love to spend a day doing that? You know what happened to that person though? That person got comfort. That person got healing. That person got healthy. Blessed are those who get out here what is in here, for they alone shall get comforted. Most of the time I'm afraid it is indeed Christians too, who somewhere along the line have gotten the message that good Christians don't fail, who somewhere along the line have gotten the message that good Christians don't hurt, who somewhere along the line have gotten the message that good Christians don't stumble, and they don't get confused, and they always know the answers. And the reason we go to seminars is so I can know the answers, not because I even want to grow spiritually. It's just so I can know the answers and never look stupid again, and never look weak again, and never be confused again, because I don't like how that feels. The problem is this. Good Christians do fail, and good Christians do get hurt, and good Christians do get confused, and sometimes good Christians don't know the answers, And sometimes good Christians fall on their face in sin. And every one of you know that. And even if it's true, I won't show it. I got bad news for you. If that's the case, no comfort. No comfort. Blessed are those, happy are those who get out here what is in here. And I pray to God that as we consider where we're going as a church, that we continue to be a church that encourages people to get out here what is in here. And when they do it, they do not get condemned. They get what? Comforted. And you know what that is? That's a kingdom church. That's a kingdom church. I would like to be known for that. How about that? There's different kinds of pain. There's different kinds of tears. years. Abraham had tears of grief when he lost his wife, and when his wife died, he said this, godly men don't get sad. Godly men don't get sad because godly men trust God, and godly men who trust God prove their trusting of God by being like this at the funeral. How are you? Comforting everyone else who's sad. The Bible doesn't say he did that. The Bible says that when his wife sarah died he wept and he wept and he wept and what he did was he got out here what was in here and you know what happened to him he got comfort and he got healing and he went on his way a man of god we have problems with tears and we have problems with grief and when we see people like that you know what our immediate response is we want to fix them oh don't do what we need to understand is they're not broken. And what we need to do is come alongside. In fact, that word comfort is parakletos. It means to come alongside and bring comfort to those who are in pain, for they shall get made whole. Timothy had the same kind of issue. He cried. He had tears, but it wasn't because his wife died. It wasn't anything near as noble. It was because he was discouraged. He had things in his life that he looked at, and the things he looked at kept speaking to him. They kept saying this, Timothy, you are inadequate. You don't have anything to give. You don't have anything to share. People don't like you. And Paul wrote to him and said, Timothy, you're a wimp. Timothy, he didn't say that. In 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy 1, 3 through 4, he said, Timothy, I long to be with you and I pray for you endlessly because I'm mindful of your tears. It's okay to be sad, Timothy. Get out here what is in here so that you can move on and do the work that God has called you to do. Quit pretending. David wept. All you have to do is read the Psalms. In Psalm 42, it says that he wept because he was lonely. Things were not going well in his life. Circumstances were lousy. He was abandoned by people. And when he got abandoned by people, you know what else he felt? That he had been abandoned by God. And when he was abandoned by God, he felt lonely. And he said this, As a deer pants for water, so my soul thirsts after thee, O God. The fact is this, that as his sorrow was released, healing came. Jeremiah couldn't preach a sermon without tears. In chapter 9, verse 1, he said, Oh, that my head were a river and my eyes a fountain. Why? Because I got so much inside me and I got to get it out. Blessed are those who get out here what is in here. In Mark chapter 9, there was a father who brought his son who was possessed by a demon to Jesus. And he began to speak to Jesus. And as he spoke, tears started streaming down his cheeks. And knowing that Jesus could heal him, and knowing that he needed to have faith that Jesus could heal him, he was aware that he didn't have enough faith, and he began to weep, and he said, Jesus, I believe, but help my unbelief. A good Christian would have said, I believe, and pretended he believed. The tears of that man were tears of a parent who wonders if there is hope, and there are tears of inadequacy, not sure if he's got enough faith. The key was he got out here, what was in here, the result was comfort. second way this applies to us spiritually and i really believe by the way that this is the fundamental way in which this is meant by jesus the spiritual application is found in luke chapter 7 verse 37 and following and in that passage of scripture we find a woman who is known as a prostitute who came to dinner to see jesus and the dinner that she came to was a dinner that was filled with dignitaries and they were church dignitaries pharisees okay you need to get the picture here. It was the picture of someone who was broken, who had come face to face with her sin as a prostitute, who was coming into a dinner of some sort where the elders of the church were all around. And the elders of the church were all in tune with what appropriate behavior was. And they knew about propriety. And their robes were all pressed very nicely. And they knew how to say grace at the beginning. And this woman came into the thing, stood behind Jesus, and just didn't say a word but began to weep and her stupid tears started falling on the floor and started hitting the feet of Jesus and she was embarrassed so she went down and started to wipe the tears off of her feet off of his feet and then she broke this vial of alabaster that was worth that was priceless as far as she was concerned and poured that on his feet and with the hair and the tears and the oil all mixed together made a mess of it. And the Pharisee again knowing about propriety and knowing very well how to control passions was absolutely horrified and told Jesus so and Jesus explained to that Pharisee something that self-satisfied self-righteous people understand and that is that people who have been forgiven much, love much. And people who have been forgiven little, love little. This lady who came to Jesus at this dinner understood this kingdom truth that Jesus is talking about in Matthew chapter 5. And the way she understood it was because somewhere along the line she came face to face with her sin. There was no more hiding. There was no more pretending. There was no more blaming anybody else. There was no more delusions. You see, the difference between this prostitute woman and this Pharisee wasn't that the woman was a real bad sinner and the Pharisee wasn't a real bad sinner. The difference between the two was that they were both real bad sinners, only she knew it. And she came face to face with her sin. And when she did, you know what she did? She felt sad about it. No, she didn't. She mourned over it. She grieved over it. She was like the publican in contrast to the Pharisee who said, Lord, but merciful to me, a sinner. And she got out here, what was in here, confession of sin. It isn't their fault, and it isn't their fault, and it wasn't that, and I can't rationalize it. I am sorry. Please forgive me. And you need to know that in Luke 7, the tears we see in the Pharisee's house in front of everybody are no longer tears of mourning. She's not mourning there. Those aren't tears of that anymore. She's already got the comfort. She already knows she's forgiven. The tears we see in the Pharisee's house are tears of gratitude. I know I am forgiven. I know I am made clean. I know I am one with God. And I don't care who knows it. I love you. People who know they're sinners receive God's grace and the result is gratitude. Do you know that? David understood that. said in Psalm 32, when I kept quiet about my sin, my bones waxed cold within me. But when I confessed my sin, I was made right. I was made clean. And blessed is the man whose heart has been made clean. We stress grace here. That's one of the things I think we're known for. Not only grace and salvation, but grace in your living. You don't get your value from any place but Christ. And what makes you okay is not your performance. It's the blood of Christ and you need to remember that over and over and over again. But one of the things I hear once in a while is people saying things like this. And again, they don't say these words, but you can just tell that their attitude is kind of flowing that way. It's great. I love to talk about heaven, but I'm going to live like hell. That's wonderful. I like this great stuff. I got to tell you, I don't meet a whole lot of people like that. But the ones I do and the ones I see, I know something about them. It's this. They don't understand grace at all. They have never received grace at all. Because the only people who get the comfort, the only people who get the grace, are the ones who have mourned over their sin. Who have come face to face with their inadequacy. Realize that they have no hope other than Christ. They fall on his knees and you know what he does? He graces them, forgives them, redeems them, makes them a son, makes them a priest forever. and you know what issues from people who know they've been graced who mourned over their sin and now know they are forgiven you know what issues from them? gratitude love devotion obedience hungering and thirsting for more righteousness blessed are those who mourn I think we see the value of it I beat it to death last question even though that's a true thing and we can even see the value of it why is it that so often even in our own spirits there's so little brokenness in the church of Jesus Christ why is it that we see so little brokenness sometimes I think the reason is because of despair what do you mean what I mean by that is sometimes I think we have people who really believe their path's forgiving and we might have people here this morning who think this is really neat Dave but you don't know my situation I'm past forgiving it's too far I've gone too deep you need to know that that's a lie from the pit of hell and that lie that tells you you can't get the grace of God to restore you and make you absolutely clean before God is the fundamental thing that Satan would do to have you from ever moving into blessedness from ever having you to move into kingdom life it could be as i said before that some of you have been in churches before and the spirit of god prompted you and you sense the real brokenness in your spirit over sin and you did confess it but you didn't get comfort you got condemned and again you made a vow without even knowing you made a vow i am never going to do that again so even now when the spirit of god begins to move on your heart relative to your your need to be broken and come to grips with some things that need to be cleaned out of your life. You just hang this white knuckle time, you know, on the front of the seat. No way I'm responding to this. I did it once before and I got abused and I got hurt and I will never do that again. All I can say to you is this. If God is touching your heart, don't. If you hear the voice of God, don't harden your heart. Don't harden your heart. there's another reason sometimes the brokenness doesn't come and that's because of deceit not despair deceit what is that that's simply that self-righteousness of the pharisee whose value comes from his performance and he surrounded himself with all the good little things he does and he actually believes he's okay not because of christ though he thinks he's okay because of how good he looks and how rich he is and how many verses he knows and how many bible studies he leads and there's never a sense of brokenness and he wonders why though he looks good and his church is big, the power of God never flows. Sometimes, quite frankly, it's just because you love your sin, and it's become your source, and you've made a real clear choice. That's going to be my source. I don't believe God can meet my needs. The only thing I can say to you, I'm not going to try to beg you. I just think this, you're just probably going to need more pain until you find out that what you're looking at to give you life, can't give it. And God will bring you to that. There's another reason, and I close with this one. I think one of the reasons sometimes we don't see the brokenness that the kingdom is being characterized by in this passage is because we don't call for it. I think in many ways the church of Jesus Christ has become trivial. I've said this before, but it's this kind of attitude where we kind of appeal to people to come to God and he'll give them a nice big lollipop and oh come on please let let let God you know be nice to God let him in we need to hear something here in this verse Jesus is saying this kingdom dwellers are not people who've come to me looking for lollipops kingdom dwellers through whom the power of the kingdom will flow are people who have come to me looking for forgiveness because they've mourned over their sin they've confessed their sin and they're looking for comfort and they're looking for grace. And I want to tell you something Jesus says, there's nothing that delights my heart more than when they come to give them grace, to give them comfort, to give them life. And those broken, messed up people are the ones I am choosing to rock the world with the kingdom of God. What are we going to be characterized by? Richness, bigness, success, innovation, garbage. God make us a mourning people over our sin. make us a place where people who are hurt have the freedom to get out here what is in here make us a people who are confronted by our sin and not shamed by it but joyfully come confessing it knowing that we receive grace and help and comfort and power to serve fill this church father with broken people who know their dependence on you is their only hope hungry people thirsty people who want to see more than anything in the world the life of Christ reflected in them who don't care about anything else Lord God make us that kind of people Amen Amen.
