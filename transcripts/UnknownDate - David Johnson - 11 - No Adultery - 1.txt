We are coming to date in our continuing study of the Ten Commandments, which we've been in for actually a few months now, to the Seventh Commandment, which is recorded for us in Exodus 20, verse 14, where very plainly and simply says this, you shall not commit adultery. There are two requests that I have had of the Lord this week, and actually they are requests that I think God planted in my heart to bring back to him relative to this word, and that's this, that as I deliver this, that God by his spirit would grant two things. Number one, that there would be, with this word, prophetic edge. And what I mean by that is, around this issue of adultery, that there would be the ring of truth. That there would be a line that is drawn relative to what is right and wrong. A line that is very clear in a culture where this line has become quite fuzzy. The second request was this. that along with prophetic edge that speaks clearly the truth, the whole thing would be saturated with pastoral care. And those are sometimes things that feel like opposite. Prophetic is strong and confrontive and lay down the truth, and pastoral care is soft and inviting. And my prayer is that both of those would happen, specifically for those who have crossed the line that I'm going to draw very firmly. The pastoral care piece needs to say to you that you can come back and that there is authentic restoration and healing in this particular area. What I'm actually asking for is the work of the Spirit and the Word today that would embody the ministry of Jesus, which was characterized by two things, grace and truth. Let's pray to that end and then begin. Father God, in Jesus' name, I pray by the power of your spirit and join with my brothers and sisters in this room for the same thing, that through this word delivered today, there would come grace and truth. I pray it in your name. Amen. I think we all know what adultery is. I would like to define it nonetheless. To adulterate at its most basic level means simply to contaminate or to make impure. literally it means to add to the mix a foreign element in that case it's possible to adulterate a cake mix simply adding an ingredient that doesn't belong but the consequences for an ingredient that doesn't belong in a cake mix is not that high just tastes lousy or doesn't look right or we throw it away in the case of a marriage the foreign element the added ingredient that doesn't belong is another person. Often, but not always, adultery includes sexual activity. Not always, because emotional attachment can be, as most of you know, just as adulterous as sexual activity, for you have allowed into your marriage a foreign element, an ingredient that doesn't belong. In fact, most people who've fallen into adultery will report that long before there was any sexual activity, there was emotional attachment. Todd Mulliken, in his book, The State of Affairs, a book we highly recommend. It's not in the bookstore now, I've been told, but it will be, I think, next week. It says it this way, affairs aren't just about sex. When any relationship with the opposite sex affects the level of intimacy, emotional closeness, and commitment of a marriage, you've crossed the line into an extramarital affair. While a sexual relationship clearly strengthens an affair and makes it more difficult to break off. An emotional affair also can cause irreparable damage to a marriage even without sex, end quote. Now, however it is that you define adultery, the seventh commandment says of it, you shall not do it. God, in effect, in this commandment is saying this, I'm going to put a boundary around your sexuality. Sexuality is a very good thing. It's a gift from God, but I'm going to put a fence around it, and I'm going to put a fence around your marriage and around your family. I want to put a boundary around your covenantal promises, and I am doing it for your safety, for your sanity, and for your longevity. Not only the longevity of your marriage is at stake, but literally the longevity of a culture as well is at stake. So I'm going to put a boundary around this. These are sacred things, says the Lord, and the boundary serves to protect not only your marriage, but the children of your marriage and your children's children as well. Indeed, as I've already said, it serves to protect the very culture within which you live. But there's a problem with these boundaries. It's this. We will not have them. We don't need to be protected, we say. We have a better way. All this law stuff is far too restrictive. November 16, 1997, a British paper, the Sunday Times, reported this, that the Church of England's liturgical commission decided to remove the Ten Commandments from the Holy Communion service and the New Millennium Prayer Book. Philip Gore, a synod member for the Manchester Diocese, said that the decision reflected the church's fear that any kind of religious challenge would alienate people. earlier that year it had been revealed that the church had suffered its biggest drop in attendance for more than 20 years many in the church do not want a God who makes too many demands on them Gore said therefore we want to dismiss the commandments the commandments as irrelevant to our modern age and many might like to dismiss particularly the commandments forbidding adultery adultery How irrelevant to forbid that in our modern age. Some time ago, I heard a joke. I love a good joke. I think you know that. It went like this. Moses, coming down from the mountain, had received the laws, the tablets are in his hand. And he announces to the people this. I got some good news, and I got some bad news. The good news is this. I got them down to 10. the bad news is this adultery is still one of the ten I'm glad you didn't laugh you see that's bad news because I was really hoping we could do that that joke reveals some things about how people think about the law in general and about adultery in particular You see, the law of God was given, some people think, to restrict our joy, to spoil our fun, to keep us, you know, word from doing what we really want to do. And what we really want to do is adultery. That's where the joy is. That's where the fun and the action really is. I have been a pastor for 22 years. I have been pastor of this church for 18 years. And I've had to deal in those years with the reality of adultery among us more times than I care to remember. In those 22 years of ministry, I have seen up close the agony of a spouse betrayed several times. I've also seen the agony and the remorse of the spouse betrayer, the one who did the betraying. their incredible agony and shame and if there was anything I could do to undo what I've done I've seen that agony as well I've sometimes sadly seen the arrogant defiance of a man or a woman who has betrayed their spouse and now is embracing their betrayal as if this newfound relationship outside of the marriage is a gift from God I've found true love for the first time in my life and I have to follow my heart as if following your heart outside of your marriage for true love is some sort of virtue. I've seen that several times in our church. I have seen the long and painful process of recovery. Not just recovery back so that the husband and wife are living together in some sort of quiet, maybe even peaceful coexistence but I have seen the long and painful process necessary to bring it back to intimacy. And I need to tell you that that is a possible thing. I've seen it often. The painful process would be the operative word, for I've seen the effect of adultery on children and on the church and on the community and the ripple effect of even undermining confidence for when that happens, It sends out shockwaves of undermining confidence. And what I mean by the confidence there is this underlying thing. Who can you trust? If even they, who? Who on earth could I give myself to? And after experiencing all of those things many times over, I'm here to tell you that there is nothing fun or funny about adultery. not one thing some in fact argue that the betrayal of a spouse is more painful and difficult to recover from than the death of a spouse my initial response to that is kind of resistant I'm not sure about that the reason I kind of hesitate in saying that is because three people very dear to me this year have lost their spouse due to death my mom is one and I've watched her in her process of recovery and the pain that landed on her in ways that has been harder for her than me. She lost her husband. I lost my dad. It was hard. She lost her day-to-day companion. Also, my friend in Chicago that I shared with you, with Jody, our age, who died of brain cancer and then last December 19th when Dave Busby died, LaWanna Busby lost the best friend she ever had. This last year, I've watched pretty close with those people, their loneliness and loss. It's excruciating pain. And how even after a year, they're still going through it with visitations of grief that feel as fresh as the day it happened. Meaning this, that after a year, they're not done yet with their grief. But with all that they have had to deal with and the loss of their spouse through death, they've never had to deal with, in addition to the loss of their spouse, betrayal, humiliation, Subtle implications that their spouse's betrayal was probably in some way their fault. After all, if you were a real man, she wouldn't have left. If you were a good wife, you wouldn't have looked at somewhere else. So now you're having to deal with the fact that maybe their fidelity, their infidelity, was your fault. I think another thing that people who've lost a spouse to infidelity suffer, that people who've lost a spouse to death don't suffer, is a lack of support. And what I mean by me, just picture, if someone loses a spouse, everybody on earth, neighbors, friends, even distant acquaintances, run to support. And assure the husband or the wife who lost their dear friend what a wonderful person they were. And they're there and they bring meals and they're supported and it's horrible, but there's support. And if you're the victim of adultery, it's like we don't know what to say and you're very often all by yourself. and you didn't do the behavior but you're full of shame and the person who did the behavior is full of shame themselves. People have lost a spouse to death with enormous grief to bear but they don't have to deal with the blame and the shame of betrayal. Murder, which was the sixth commandment we dealt with the last time is an assault in the sanctity of human life. Then adultery is a similar assault in the sanctity of marriage deeply wounding the soul ripping asunder the union of trust. There are many reasons, says Mulliken, again, that people divorce. Sudden job loss, physical abuse, the death of a child, alcohol, drug, or sexual addiction, financial trouble, even the pressure from the culture that promotes a me-first attitude as if it were a virtue, have all led countless couples into despair and eventual divorce. But the single greatest threat to any marriage is adultery. Recent studies show that 65% of married couples who experience an affair are unable to recover, ending in divorce. No other pressure in marriage, says Mulliken, even comes close to the emotional devastation of an affair, of adultery. End quote. Which undoubtedly leaves some of you who in this room have experienced adultery either because you did it or because you were betrayed by someone else who did it. That statement leaves you in despair. Asking this, is there any hope for our marriage? Can we ever recover? Well, the answer to that question is absolutely yes. Indeed, one of the things that affected me all week and gave me real strength to plunge deeply into this topic was that there are marriages in this room that I know of, many of them. And while I've seen some hard things over 22 years of ministry, I've seen some wonderful things. And many of you are in this room right now whose marriages right now are healthy and whole. Marriages that serve as living proof that authentic recovery, and again by recovery I do not mean just being willing to come back and live in the same house, but recovery to a place of intimacy and affection and joy for one another, that that is a possible thing. But if those couples that I know of are here right now could come up on this stage and speak to you, each one of them I am quite sure would tell you this. Number one, it is possible to recover true intimacy again, But number two, know this, that if you are interested in that kind of recovery, it will be the hardest thing you ever do. Requiring massive and consistent doses of often hard to come by and rarely experienced Christian virtues. Aspects of character needing to be developed in both of you. that quite frankly, had those character issues been realities in you before you had the affair, you probably wouldn't have had the affair. It really is a frightening thing when I see people go through this because the very lack of character that caused you to fall into an affair, that lack of character, you need character to recover from one. It's going to be the hardest thing you ever did. There's going to have to be some of the most profound and painful growth you've ever experienced. Christian virtues are necessary for genuine recovery. Every one of which has the power to release the reality of God's kingdom in your life. And marriage virtues like genuine and deep repentance. Maybe a kind of repentance you've never ever experienced before. Repentance changing your mind about turning around from that wrong ingredient that you have embraced. And to come back, without repentance, I promise you no hope whatsoever of recovery. Maybe without repentance, someone will relent and will agree to live together. But I promise you without deep, profound, and probably a long term kind of repentance, you will never have intimacy. Ever. another virtue that will be necessary to grow in you is honest to God truth no more deceit no more lying no more hiding no more double life and I promise you without that no recovery certainly no intimacy it takes oceans of grace and rivers of mercy somewhere along the line, you're going to have to find forgiveness, and probably not just once. Remember a few weeks ago when we talked about honoring our parents, that part of what it takes for most of us to honor our parents is to forgive them, and forgiveness is not just a magic one. Oh yeah, I forgive you. We talked about getting on the road of forgiveness toward forgiveness, where we forgive, and then we forgive again, and then you're going to have to forgive, and then it comes up again, and you forgive again, and that is a long process. And I promise you if you want to experience recovery from adultery, you won't have a chance without perseverance. It occurs to me that if you had perseverance, you might not have committed adultery in the first place. So this is going to be a major character growth time for you. But maybe the most necessary ingredient for recovery is going to be courage. Courage for the betrayer to really face your sin to, in the words of Dave Busby, one of the sermons, Well, there's not a sermon he ever preached, I don't remember, but this is when he talked about tasting our depravity. Our need to taste our depravity. And the value of tasting our depravity is not to just make us feel bad. The value of our depravity, of tasting our depravity, is that we will then come up hungry for amazing grace. And then when you, having tasted your depravity, now come up hungry for amazing grace, you're going to need courage. You know what the courage is going to have to be for? You're going to have to have courage to now accept the amazing grace that God desires to lavish on you, even though you've committed adultery. There is grace for you. And accepting it after genuine repentance will be, for some of you, the most courageous thing you've ever done. But there's going to have to be courage for the betrayed as well. To stick with this process long enough when you have every right to bolt, To stick with this process long enough in order to offer real forgiveness. Not just the quick after the initial pain has subsided. Yes, I forgive you. And now we're done. To stick with this process of real repentance. Facing the truth. Getting it all out here. Both our pain and our sin. To go through that long enough to offer a real. You know what? I forgive you. I'm going to let you off the hook. and I'm going to let you back into my heart. That does not happen with a magic wand. One of the most needed ingredients would be courage. If because of adultery, anyone among us here, even today, have to do this kind of work, I promise you, it will be the hardest thing you ever do. Early in the week as I began to study this and feel the weight of it, it became apparent to me that to deal with this well was going to require more than one week. In fact, what I'm giving you today is kind of an introduction to what will be at least two weeks, maybe more, but at least two. While the reasons that I want to spend more than one week on this are many, I came up with four around which I want to build this talk and probably the next four reasons. I feel compelled to sit on this topic of adultery for a while, are these. Number one, because of adultery's pervasiveness. What I mean by that is that all of us have been, by adultery, affected. Whether you know it or not, you have. Even if you've never committed adultery or even had it in your family, you have been, by adultery, affected. Let me illustrate this with this. As I was thinking about this and the possibility of having to deal with this for several weeks, I thought, man alive, you know, this is going to feel like we're talking to married people every week Because that's the issue of adultery is in marriage. And, man, we have lots and lots of singles, and you're just going to feel like, hey, you know, get on something for us. This is marriage, and it's good teaching. But so I want to talk to singles just for a second. We do have, indeed, and I'm delighted, a very high percentage of singles among us. And in our culture, single people are remaining so more and more. In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul says of that, that's a good thing. Singleness, he says, making a confrontation on that culture that believed that the only way you could really be fulfilled is if you were married. Paul blows that up with a lot of energy, calling singleness not only a virtuous thing, but in fact, he really pushes it and says, yeah, I prefer it. I recommend singleness to you because it allows you to devote single-minded devotion to God. The fact is that some of you are single because you want to be, and you know what? You ought to be, and God bless you. Do not let anybody pressure you to feel like unless you're married, you're not whole. That's a lie. Problem. Some of you are single not because you want to be and not because you ought to be. The real reason some among us, and not just in this gymnasium, but in our culture are not married is because they're scared to death to be married. Having become pretty much convinced that there are very few people who can ever be trusted, who will ever be faithful. And you've come to believe that. Not necessarily because you've ever experienced adultery. Or even because it's even been in your home. It could be that your family, your parents love each other, stay together. But because adultery is in the culture. And you have seen it. And because adultery is in the church. And it's in our church. And you've seen it even in the leadership of church. over and over you've seen it it has gotten to the point for some of you where it's almost as if wisdom is speaking to you this don't go there what I'm saying is adultery is pervasive even those of you who think this isn't going to be an issue for me it's an issue for you it's caused you to guard your heart from even the possibility of letting anybody in because nobody can be trusted. Where'd you get that? I'll tell you where you got it. From the culture. From what we see. I'm not blaming you. It's in the church. From what we've seen. These things don't work. People don't keep their promises. Two weeks ago, our staff, a number from our staff, went out to a conference in New Mexico dealing with the preparedness of the church to minister effectively to what's been called the postmodern culture, called the post-Christian culture. Talked a lot about Generation X, baby boomers, busters, that whole kind of thing. And among the things that became clear that the church needs to be ready to deal with relative to Generation X and the generation that is coming up that we're going to have and have already, we're going to have to learn to deal with their anger. Because while this generation has some incredibly exciting characteristics and hunger for very real things from God, they're a pretty angry group. Why? Well, there are many reasons. One of the primary reasons that they're angry is because their parents, who, by the way, are my age. So I mean, it was really weird, by the way, to go to a conference of a bunch of pastors where I was the old guy. I've got to tell you, I'm used to going to the pastor conferences where I'm the young guy, and I'm kind of the maverick, and I've got some new ideas, you know. And all of a sudden, I'm at a conference with about 400, 500 pastors, and I'm the old guy, and they're blowing up my ideas. Yeah, old guy over there. Be nice to them. Anyway. One of the reasons they're angry is because their parents, not me particularly, but my age group, what we were doing in the 60s and 70s and early 80s, we were getting in touch with our feelings. You know what? It's really good, important to get in touch with other feelings. But you know what? When we did, you know what we felt like doing? We felt like leaving. And guess what? Because doing what you feel became the highest virtue for our generation, us baby boomers, when we felt like leaving. Guess what we did? We left. You know what else we felt like doing? We felt like doing adultery. And guess what we did? When we felt like doing it, we did it. You know why? Because the highest virtue for baby boomers is to do what you feel. You know, bang. I'm being true to myself as if it were a virtue while I leave my husband or leave my wife and leave my kids. You'll understand. In fact, you'll admire me because I'm being true to myself. Ah. Anyway, I don't know. I don't know. I didn't mean to get that animated. well I visit my kids on the weekend you know I was at a conference where I was with a bunch of young pastors about 25 years old who are real in touch with this and you know what I heard from them that visit on the weekend it wasn't enough they kind of wanted you to stay we got some pretty angry kids coming up and they're wondering if anybody is faithful, if anybody's true. And they're almost looking at each other, we're going to be the ones who are faithful, we're going to be the ones who are true. And so God is really raising up some incredible energy in positive ways. What's my point? My point is this. Adultery is pervasive. All of us have been by it affected. Even if you've never committed it, you have been affected by it. Second reason, we're going to spend some time on this. It's because of adultery's growing permissiveness or acceptability in the culture. That's as far as we're going to get today. I'll just give you the last two where we're going. Because of its painfulness, we're going to spend time, and because of its complexity. There's more than one reason people commit adultery, and there's more than one way to commit adultery. Let's just finish today with point number two. Adultery is permissiveness. Growing acceptability in our culture. The fact is this, that things are getting worse. It's not your imagination. We live in a culture that not only accepts adultery, it promotes it. Wednesday afternoon, I was at a place where I had spent all day Tuesday wallowing in this stuff by way of my research. And I just noticed that Wednesday, I experienced a kind of despair come over me about this. A voice mocking me said this. So you're going to deal with adultery, huh, Dave? Good for you. Are you against it? Are you going to preach against adultery? Big deal. So what? Whatever you say won't matter. It may be a noble effort, but I promise you, when you come against adultery and say, it's wrong, Sunday, you're going to be spitting in the wind. J. Allen Peterson, in his book, The Myth of the Greener of Grass, echoes that same sentiment when he says this, a call for fidelity in the 90s is like a solitary voice crying in today's sexual wilderness. What was once labeled adultery and carried a stigma of guilt and embarrassment now is an affair, a nice sounding, almost inviting word wrapped in mystery, fascination, and excitement. It's a relationship, not a sin. What was once behind the scenes, a secret closely guarded, is now in the headlines, a TV miniseries, a best-selling novel as common as a cold, end quote. A Harris poll of thousands of men in 1979, note to date 20 years ago, concluded this prophetically, I think, that the increased emphasis that people are placing on self-fulfillment, pleasure, and doing whatever I want to do will eventually alter dramatically America's traditional value system, end quote. That was 20 years ago. Guess what? I think they were right. Applied to marriage, this philosophy says this, fidelity is out, adultery is in. If your marriage doesn't provide at all times all you ever expected, dreamed, or fantasized, and fails to bring you the constant sensory pleasure and fulfillment you deserve, find it elsewhere. Enjoy what Dr. Albert Ellis, a prominent therapist in New York City, calls healthy adultery. That was a new one for me. Dr. Ellis urges couples whose romantic love has faded from their marriage that adultery, quote, could be a healthy thing to rejuvenate their relationship, end quote. no suggestions of how to invigorate from within no discussion of intimacy that can be restored or help as to how to rebuild love just this, go out and do what feels good and do it now, it's called healthy adultery and by the way it's not just men like Dr. Ellis who recommend this, women's magazines according to Katie Roffey in the New York Times Magazine, October 12, 1997 says this that women's magazines recommend extramarital sex to their readers as a fun, healthy activity, like buying a new shade of lipstick or vacationing in the Caribbean. Elle magazine, E-L-L-E, I'm not sure how you say that, Elle magazine tells us, quote, that an affair can be a sexual recharging, an escape from a worn-out relationship away into something better. Harper's Bazaar breathlessly tells us about women whose marriages are improved by affairs because they get their rapture elsewhere, these wives are not as apt to complain, nag, or find fault with their husbands. So their husbands actually are grateful. A woman is having an adulterous affair. She is, according to Harper's Bazaar, asserting her femininity. Eva Beguder, I'm not sure I said that right, it's B-A-G-U-E-D-O-R, in her book, Is Anyone Faithful Anymore, offered what may be the most compelling evidence of our culture's acceptance, indeed its promotion of adultery, when one woman shared with her this. I was at lunch last week with 11 women. We've been studying French together since our children were in nursery school. One woman, the leader of the group, asked this question. How many of you have been faithful throughout your marriage? Only one woman at the table raised her hand. That evening, my husband looked devastated when I told him I was not that one. But I have been faithful, I assured him. Then why didn't you raise your hand? Get this. Because I was embarrassed, ashamed to admit that I hadn't committed adultery. Something has been twisted. All of that leads me to the third reason that we're going to spend some time on this, and I'm not going to go into this because I'm just going to give it to you. It's this, that in spite of the growing acceptability of adultery in our culture, and the message is that it's not only okay, but it's good, the fact remains that with adultery comes an enormous amount of pain. Here's the deal. Someone is paying the bill. It may be you. It may be your spouse, while you go get fulfilled, they're paying the bill. It may be your children who are paying the bill. It may be your children's children who pay the bill. Ultimately, unarrested, the whole culture will pay the bill. Point number three, the third reason we're going to deal with is because of adultery's painfulness. See, somebody needs to pick up the pieces. Somehow we need to find healing and hope. And among the things we're going to talk about next week around the painfulness of adultery is not to just establish, again, this painfulness. We've done that pretty well, I think, actually today already, but to talk about, among other things, why? I mean, other things can destroy marriage. Why is adultery so devastating? I want to get into that. But let me close with this. Especially if because of adultery in your life, either it's happened to you or you have done it yourself. If because of that you feel despair out of this word I've delivered, I want to give to you words from Matthew 12, verse 20 that say this to us about Christ. It says this, that a battered reed, Jesus, will not break off, discard, and a smoldering wick he will not put out. The battering reed analogy is powerful when you understand what reeds were used for. They were cut off, they were hollowed out, and holes were made in them, and you would use them as a flute and it would make music, and that's a metaphor for your life. And some of you who have either committed adultery or had it done to you, You could look back at another time in your life when you made music. You made music. You could sing a song and there was joy in your heart. And now you're bruised. But you know, if all it is is a reed, it doesn't make music anymore. Just throw it away and make a new one. Jesus is saying to battered reeds in this room right now, I need you to know that I don't throw away battered reeds. I heal battered reeds and smoldering wicks. That would be someone whose light wants to show. The light would be light of passion. Love for a spouse. Love for life. some sort of reason to live again tomorrow. That light has been snuffed out in your smoldering wick. Jesus says, I want you to know about who I am. Who I am is this. I am the one who does not put out smoldering wicks, but delights in fanning back to flame that which you believe will never come again. The word is this, that people devastated by the realities of adultery, maybe even your own adultery, people like that matter to God and can by him be healed. And burn bright once again with hope, life, and passion. I'd like you to stand as we close. Altar team, I'd like you to take your place for people who need prayer. Father, I thank you again for your word. I pray in Jesus' name that you would bathe as I close. Not my words anymore, just the hearts of the people who have heard this, and it's landed on us in a variety of ways, raising old issues, nailing new issues, exposing things that have been hidden. I pray, Father, that your Spirit's work would be grace and truth. I pray grace and truth be with us as we leave in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen.
