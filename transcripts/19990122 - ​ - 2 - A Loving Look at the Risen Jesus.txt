As most of you know, my hometown is Brooklyn, New York, and that's the largest Jewish community in America. And over the years, one of my hobbies has been a study of Yiddish humor. Some wonderful stories in the Yiddish tradition, like the story of Israel Schwartz. One day, Israel Schwartz said to Yahweh, Yahweh, is it true that for you a thousand years is just a minute? Yahweh said, yes, I said, that is true. Z. Schwartz said, Yahweh, is it true that's for you? A million dollars. It's just a penny. Yahweh said, yes, that is true. Z. Schwartz said, Yahweh, give me a penny. And Yahweh said, certainly. It'll only take a minute. And so I'm just going to speak for a minute here this morning. and turn your attention to this wonderful word of Jesus in chapter 13 of Matthew's gospel, verse 44. The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone has found. he hides it again goes off happy sells everything he owns and buys the field the word passion basically means to be affected by and passion is the essential energy of the soul it may seldom strike us that our capacity to be affected by is truly a source of energy. But in this gospel, we find a luminous illustration of this. It's just another day of manual labor in the weary round of time, and the peasant is out there with the ox and the plow, and suddenly the ox stops and starts to tug at the ground. So the peasant drives the plow chair deeper into the ground than he normally does, turns over furrow after furrow, and then he hears this harsh metallic sound. He pushes the plow aside, and now the peasant is just shoving the dirt aside frantically. The dirt's flying everywhere. And then the peasant spots his handle. He lifts out a large earthen pot, trembling. He yanks the handle off the pot. He's stunned, and he goes, and that makes the ox blink. and the pot is filled to the rim with coins, expensive jewelry, shining gold, shining silver, glittering gold. He rifles through all the stuff and there's precious coins, rare earrings, sparkling diamonds through his fingers and then the peasant looks around. Does anybody watch him? No. Nobody sees him. So he passes all the dirt back and covers the pot, puts a little marker up, continues to plow in the field and when he goes home that night he has been deeply affected by his splendid find. Now just one thought obsesses him. One desire consumes him. He can't even sleep at night. He's got to buy that field so he can possess the treasure. But as long as he remains a peasant he doesn't have enough money. So what's he going to do? He throws caution to the winds and he borrows large sums of money from neighbors, relatives, family, friends. He sells everything he owns, gets a nice price for his little hut, the few sheep he's got. And then he's got enough money. He goes to the owner of the field, who's delighted with the lavish amount of money that the peasant's going to pay him. And he sells it to him without a second thought. And the poor peasant's wife is apoplectic. I mean, his three sons are inconsolable. And his friends reproach him. The neighbors wag their head. They say, you've been out in the sun too long, man. Out in the sun. And yet they're baffled by his incredible energy. And the peasant remains unruffled in spite of all the opposition from people who love him. He knows he stumbled upon an extraordinarily profitable transaction. And he rejoices at the payoff. the treasure, which apparently had been buried in the field for security by a previous owner, and the owner had died, that treasure is going to return a hundredfold on what he paid for it. So he pays off all his debts, and he builds himself a mansion, the equivalent of a mansion in Malibu, and the peasant is a man whose fortune is made, he's envied by his enemies, congratulated by his friends, and he's secure for the rest of his life. Jesus says the kingdom is their treasure. Hidden in a field which somebody's found. He hides it again. Goes off happy. Tells everything he owns. He buys that field. In 1956, I found the treasure. By the grace of God, I stumbled upon the treasure hidden in a field. and 30 years later I forfeited the treasure I traded it for bourbon and for vodka and during those years of sour wine and withered roses when I was stashing whiskey bottles in my bathroom cabinet the glove compartment of my car the desk in my office the geranium pot outside my condo I was hiding from Jesus amidst tears and under hollow laughter all the while in those drunken days I knew the whereabouts of the treasure. What I'm getting at is this. It's one thing to find the treasure and it's quite a second thing to claim it. As Dallas Willard says in that lovely book of his, The Divine Conspiracy, grace is opposed to earning. It is not opposed to effort. And we claim the treasure in the field through ruthless determination, through tenacious effort. The paltriness, the shallowness of so many Christian lives is largely due with our preoccupation with trinkets, treasures, with hype, hoopla, with sex, drugs, pursuit of money, pleasure, power, even a little bit of religion. All these things that help us suppress the fact that we have found the treasure in the field and we don't break through into claiming that treasure and living out of the awareness of our own belovedness one day at a time. The pursuit of money or prestige even temporary unconsciousness can conceal the terrifying vacuum in so many of our spiritual lives fanaticism for religion cynicism about it indifference toward it how many many subtle subterfuges we employ to deny ourselves the awesome awareness that we have won the Powerball prize. We've won it. It is ours. Whatever our addictions are, whatever our attachments are, be it a smothering relationship, a dysfunctional dependency, or mere laziness, our capacity to be affected by Jesus is numbed. I was talking to a pastor in Southern California, very dynamic guy, large church, over 10,000 members. The guy's an extraordinarily gifted preacher. He's a great administrator. He's got a Pied Piper gift with young people. He's got a great bedside manner with sick people. The older people love him. And the guy is running around in Lancelot's office in four directions at one time. And one night he comes to my room and says, Brennan, may I talk with you? I said, yes. He said, I would like to confess my sins to God. I said, I'm very honored that you trust me. He said, the major sin in my life is sloth. I said, did I hear you right? You're about the most active, alive, dynamic pastor I've met. He said, sloth for me is my refusal to go on the inward journey. he said I'm afraid of passion and my refusal to go on the inward journey is my way of protecting myself from living a passionate life for Jesus Christ when we are not profoundly affected by the treasure in our grasp then apathy or complacent mediocrity are inevitable If our passion for Jesus is not to degenerate into nostalgia or mere sentimentality, we've got to go back on days like this and renew our life at its source. A contemplative is someone who takes a long, loving look at the real. And in that long, loving look at the real, who is the risen Jesus, we discover the mystery of our own belovedness and we live out of that awareness toward others and the action that flows from the contemplative lifestyle is a life of compassionate caring for those around us the treasure is Jesus he is the kingdom within just for a moment would you gently pause with me close your eyes and become aware of the treasure within you. Acknowledge its presence. Thank God that he's led you to the discovery of it. And claim it in faith as your very own. Amen. vessels wealth untold one treasure on me the Lord the Christ in earth and vessels Light has shone in our darkness God has shone in our heart With the light of the glory Of Jesus the Lord Behold a treasure Not made of gold In earthen vessels wealth untold One treasure only, the Lord the Christ, in earth and vessel. He has chosen the lowly Who are small in this world In His weakness, His glory In Jesus the Lord We hold a treasure Not made of gold In earthen vessels Wealth untold One treasure only A broad but bright In earth and vessel There is a lovely story in the Hasidic tradition, the Hasidim Jews, about a very pious couple who fell in love, they married, they stayed in love, and the deepest desire of their hearts was to have a child so that their love could walk the earth with joy. However, there were problems. But since they were pious, they prayed and they prayed and they prayed, and lo and behold, nine months later, a little boy came rumbling into the world. And the parents named him Mordecai, and he was a delightful child. The sun and the moon were his toys. He was rambunctious, zestful, gulping down the days, dreaming through the nights. he grew in age and wisdom and grace until the day dawn when his parents told him the next day he would go to the synagogue to learn the word of God. And they told him how important the word of God was. And they said without the word of God you will simply be in order of belief disappearing in the winter wind. And Mordecai listened wide-eyed. But the next day he didn't go to the woods. He didn't go to the synagogue. He went out to the woods. and then he climbed the trees and he swam in the lake. When he got home that night, the word had spread through the entire village. Mordecai had disobeyed his parents. He had dishonored the word of God. He was a child of shame. The parents didn't know what to do, so they called in the behavior modificationists who modified all of Mordecai's behavior. So there was no behavior of Mordecai that wasn't modified. But the next day he still went to the woods and he swam in the lake and he climbed the trees. So now the parents called in the psychoanalysts and they unblocked all of Mordecai's blockages. So there's no blockage for Mordecai to be blocked by. And yet the next day he still went out to the woods and he swam in the lake and he climbed the trees. The parents were utterly in a state of despair. They didn't know what to do but the next day the great rabbi arrived in the village. Ah! The rabbi said to the father, we'll take Mordecai to the rabbi. And they did. They told him their tale of woe. The rabbi said, leave that boy with me. I'll be talking with him. Now the parents were terrified. I mean, it was one thing that he wouldn't go to the synagogue but to leave him alone with this great line of a man. But they'd come this far so they left him. Mordecai's out in the hallway. The great rabbi's in the parlor. The great rabbi bellows, boy, get in here. Trembling, Mordecai walks into the parlor. The great rabbi reached down, picked him up, and held him silently against his heart. The next day, Mordecai went to the synagogue. And after the synagogue, he went to the woods. And the word of God became one with the word of the woods, which became one with the word of Mordecai. And he swam in the lake. And the word of God became one with the word of the lake, which became one with the word of Mordecai. And he climbed the trees. And the word of God became one with the word of the trees, which became one with the word of Mordecai. And Mordecai grew up to become a great man. People who were seized in her panic came to him and with him they found peace. People who didn't have anybody in their lives came to him and with him and they found communion. And people who couldn't find an exit out from their pain and their shame came to Mordecai and they found a way out. But until the day he died, Mordecai said, I first learned the word of God when the great rabbi held me silently against his heart. You know, the heart is traditionally understood as the seat, the center of our feelings and emotions. But that's a very limited description of heart. It applies to only one aspect, one facet of our total selves. And obviously, this is not what we have in mind when we pray, create in me a clean heart, O Lord. It's not what Jesus meant when he said, blessed are the pure in heart. In the scriptures, heart refers to the very core of our personality. It's the symbol we employ to capture the ultimate interiority of a person. So Shakespeare spoke of Richard the Lionhearted. In that one sentence, we get a glimpse of what the entire person is. The heart symbolizes what lies at the core of our being. It defines irreducibly who we are. When Mordecai listened to the heartbeat of the great rabbi, he heard more than the systole and diastole of a palpitating human organ. He penetrated into the great rabbi's consciousness, entered into his subjectivity, and came to know the rabbi in a way that embraced intellect and at the same time transcended intellect and emotion. Heart spoke to heart. Or as that provocative French proverb says, the heart has her reasons of which the mind knows nothing. When I went out to make an eight-day silent directed retreat in Grand Coteau, Louisiana, it's out in Cajun County about two and a half hours southwest of where I live, my spiritual director said, Brennan, I'd like you to spend the entire eight days in the Gospel of John. And he said, whenever a sentence strikes you, causes some sense of a stirring within you, write it down in your journal. That's what I did for the eight days. And at the end of the retreat, I realized the first entry I made was also the last. I'd written the one verse 26 times. John 13, 23. The disciple Jesus loved was reclining next to Jesus, and then he leaned back on Jesus' breast. If you will stay with this passage today, I promise you, the very structure of your faith will be intrinsically altered. It is saying that John lays his head on the breast of God, on the breast of the sacred man defined by the Council of Nicaea as being co-equal and consubstantial to the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God. I beg you today to engage this passage, not simply with your memory, but embrace it with your life because it radically affects your understanding of who God is, what your relationship with Jesus is meant to be. God, the transcendent, omnipotent, almighty God, allows a 23-year-old Jew to listen to his heartbeat. Have we ever seen the human Jesus at closer range? clearly John is not intimidated by Jesus he is not afraid of his Lord and Master the Jesus that John knew was not some hooded mystic he wasn't some spectral face in a holy card with wrong hair and a little with many foals John was deeply affected by this sacred man when John leans back on the breast of Jesus and listens to the heartbeat of the great rabbi he enters into the subjective consciousness of Jesus and arrives at a direct knowledge of Christ's personality. He is passed beyond reason, beyond intellect, into a higher way of knowing. And what a world of difference we know there is between knowing about somebody and truly knowing somebody. We might know all about a person, his or her name, a place of birth, family of origin, educational background, habits, personal appearance, etc. All those vital statistics, so clinically cold, they tell us nothing of the man or woman who lives and loves and walks with God. But that night, when John lays his head, what an incredible gesture of intimacy. He's reclining in the rags of his 23 years, and as he listens to the heartbeat of Jesus, He experiences him as the human face of the God who is love. And in coming to know who Jesus is, John discovers who he is. Who are you, John? I'm the disciple Jesus loves. Years later, about... probably some 51, 52 years after this John, an old man now he sits down and like an old goldmine a panning stream of his memories he writes his first letter and reflecting on that night in the upper room he writes in love there can be no fear for fear is driven out by perfect love because to fear is to expect punishment and anyone here who's afraid, you don't know Jesus. If you're afraid of him, you don't know him. You are imperfect in your understanding of the love who is God. There's a very gifted woman down in Faf Town, North Carolina, named Beatrice Boutreau. And she wrote a marvelous book called Radical Optimism. She's a very trustworthy spiritual guide. And in that book she wrote, to know the subject, that is the other person, you have to enter into the subject, into that person's own awareness of themselves, and then have their awareness of themselves within your own subjectivity. So Paul writes, let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus. I really believe this is what happened to John in the upper room on the night before Jesus died. Not only did John, the beloved disciple, come to know Jesus, but the meaning of everything Jesus had taught during their three years together suddenly exploded like a starburst, and John cried out, I first learned the word of God when the great rabbi held me silently against his heart. For John, Christianity was not a message. It was his own experience that became his message, and the message of everything John writes is, God is love. He who abides in love abides in God and God in him. That is why the famous Canadian philosopher Bernard Lonegan wrote every authentic spiritual experience is an experience of unrestricted and unconditional being, with a capital B, being in love. Once again, every authentic spiritual experience, every true contemplative experience is an experience of unrestricted and unconditional being in love. My friends, the recovery of passion begins with the recovery of my true self as the beloved of God. If I find Christ, I will find my true self, and in finding my true self, I will find Jesus. And that is the goal, the purpose of your life and mine. John didn't believe that Jesus was the most important thing in life. John believed that Jesus was the only thing in life. Anything less than that for John was not real faith. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that that night in the upper room for this 23-year-old kid was the defining moment of his life. To me, it is very significant that 60 years after the resurrection when John, now this old man in his 80s, is sitting down to write his gospel. And he recalls everything that's happened in his life from the time he was a kid, growing up, meeting Jesus, Jesus' death and resurrection, and all that's happened in the ministry since. John, when he writes the last chapter in his gospel, makes a pointed reference to that holy night when suddenly everything came together. And he writes, Peter turned and saw the disciple Jesus loved, following them, the one who had leaned on his breast at the supper. If you asked John, John, who are you? He wouldn't say, I'm an apostle. I'm an evangelist. I'm a Jew. I'm a Christian. He'd say, I'm the one Jesus loves. Where did he learn that? By laying his head on the breast of Jesus and listening to the heartbeat of the great rabbi. This moment did not pass unnoticed in the early church. In the year 180 AD, when Irenaeus is writing an essay to establish. At this point, the canon of the Gospels had not been established. What were the four inspired Gospels? There were others out there, the Apocryphal, Gospel of Thomas, and the Gospel of Peter, and so forth. So Irenaeus writes an essay to establish that John is truly the author of the fourth Gospel, and he wrote in that essay, last of all, there was John who brought out a Gospel while he was at Ephesus, And by John, I mean the disciple who had leaned on the breast of Jesus at the supper. To read John 13, 23 without faith is to read it without profit. If we are to risk the passionate life, if we are to be deeply affected by Jesus as John was, then we must engage his experience with our lives, not just our memories, until I lay my own head on the breast of the Lord Jesus and listen to his heartbeat, until I make the experience of the eyewitness John my own personal experience, until it happens. I can only repeat what other people have told me about Jesus. I've got a borrowed spirituality. I've got a derivative spirituality. But I can't truthfully tell you about the Jesus of my own journey. some of you will remember when I was here three or four years ago I told a story that radically marked my life there was a summer day in New Orleans and a doorbell rang there was a woman about 35 and she said are you Brennan Manning and I said yes ma'am she said obviously we never met I was given your name by a friend and I was wondering if you would it be possible if she started to cry I asked her how may I help you And she said, my daddy's at home dying of cancer. Best to pass to my own church three times to go and pray with him. Each time he promises that he will, but then he gets so caught up in his sermon preparation, his administrative agenda he forgets. I don't think my daddy has long to live. Could you go and pray with him? She said, he'll be there in 10 minutes. Get over to the man's house, walk back into his bedroom. Lying on his bed, and his head is propped up in two pillows, is an empty chair beside his bed. I said, hi, guess you're expecting me. He said, no, sir, who are you? I said, honest, because that guy saw the empty chair. I just thought you were expecting company. He said, oh, yeah, the chair. You mind closing the door? I closed his bedroom door wondering to myself, what is going on here? This little guy says to me, Brennan, I've never told anybody this in my life, even my daughter. But all my life, I've never known how to pray. Go to church on Sunday. My pastor talks on prayer. Goes right over my head. Finally, one day I get the courage to say to him, pastor, I get zero. Zilch out of your sermons on prayer. he reached in his desk drawer takes out this book and says here read this it's by Hans Urs von Balthasar Swiss theologian best book on contemporary prayer of the 20th century he said Brennan I take the book home the first three pages I gotta look up 11 words in the dictionary next Sunday I gave it back to my pastor saying thank you very much under my breath for nothing that day I abandoned any attempt at prayer one day four years ago my best friend who I don't think is very spiritual says to me out of the blue, you know, Joe, prayer is just a simple matter of having a conversation with Jesus. What you do is you sit down in a chair, you place an empty chair in front of you, in faith, see Jesus on the chair, and he's there because he promised I'll be with you every day until the end of time. Then you speak to him and listen as you would in a conversation with your best friend. This old guy says to me, Brendan, I've been doing that two hours a day now the last four years, and I love to do it. I'm careful. In fact, cautious. I don't want my daughter to see me talking to an empty chair. You know, she'd say, funny farm for daddy. But he said, Bernie, you've got a background in this. Do you think it's prayer? I said, Joe, you don't have to ask me. You know, that is so simple, so unsophisticated, so honest, so real. Yeah, that delights the heart of Jesus. He said, yeah. I done him with oil, pray with him, go back to my house. Two nights later, his daughter returns. They tell me her daddy died that afternoon. I asked her to die in peace. She said yes, but I left the house at 2 o'clock to go to the store. He called me over to his bedside, told me one of his corny jokes, kissed me on the cheek. When I got back just before 3, I found him dead. But she said, Brennan, strange, beyond strange. This is weird. At the moment my daddy died, he leaned over and put his head on an empty chair beside his bed. the risen Christ the Christ of faith is no less accessible to us in his present risenness than was the Christ of faith in his human flesh to the beloved disciple John so urgent is the truth of this conviction that of the four evangelists, John alone quotes Jesus saying, I tell you the sober truth, it is much better for you that I go. Why? How could the departure of Jesus benefit the community of disciples? And Jesus says, because if I don't go, unless I go, the advocate will not come to you. But if I do go, I'll send him to you. and second because while Jesus was still visible on the earth there was always the danger that the apostle would be so caught up in the sight of his visible body his human body that they would leave the certainty of faith and lean upon the tangible evidence of the senses that's why John alone of all the evangelists says yes it's an extraordinary privilege to see Jesus in the flesh but blessed are you who've never seen him more blessed are you who've laid your head on the empty chair that kind of trust in Jesus in laying your head on the empty chair as I'll be discussing tonight he finds so enchanting that he would die for love of it. In those five days, or eight days rather, when I was at a Grand Coteau, going through John's Gospel, one thing that struck me was his choice of verbs and adverbs. Like when Martha's told that Jesus arrived in Bethany, Jesus says, go and tell your sister. And she tells Mary. And it says, Mary got up quickly and went to him. When Peter and John hear the word that the tomb is empty, they set out together to go to the garden. The verb, they ran together. But the other disciple, John, running faster than Peter, reached the tomb first. Mary of Magdala, heartbroken, fearful when she finds the tomb empty. And when the man she thinks is the gardener, she rushes by him. And Jesus calls her name Mary. By the way, if you stand in that garden long enough, you'll call your name. When she turned around, what did she do? She clung to him. She clung to Jesus. and finally when the utterly despairing depressed community of apostles is out on the sea of Tiberias not knowing what to do they spend the whole night fishing and then dawn comes and they spot a man on the beach nobody knows who it is except John you see in John's gospel he supersedes Peter in Matthew, Mark, and Luke Peter's always the leader in John it's he's the leader of the community he arranges for Peter to get in the courtyard of Caiaphas he's the one who gets to the tomb first but doesn't go in he is the first believer in the risen Jesus and now out on the Liberian seashore when he spots Jesus he says to Peter it's the Lord what does Peter do? Peter, who had practically nothing on, wrapped his cloak around him and jumped, jumped into the water. And John notes the boat was about 100 yards offshore. Here's what I'm getting at. These biblical characters, however clean or dirty their past lives may have been, were not paralyzed by their past in their present response to Jesus. Tossing it aside, shame, guilt, fear. Tossing it aside, self-consciousness. They ran. They clung. They jumped. They raced to Jesus. Peter denied him. Peter deserted him. But when he saw Jesus on the beach, he was not afraid of him. Just suppose, in a sudden flash of insight today, you learned that all your motives for ministry, all your motives for living a Christian life, were basically egocentric. You were going to the church or the open door, another church, just to impress your friends. Or suppose a week ago Saturday, you went out one night with some friends, you got drunk, you had a one-night stand. Suppose a month ago you got a call at 2 o'clock in the morning. There was some kid who was strung out on drugs. And the kid said, I've got to talk to you right away. He said, hey, it's 2 o'clock in the morning. I'll tell you what, I'll meet you for breakfast at 8 o'clock. And that night the kid committed suicide. In any of these three situations, you discover your motives for being a Christian are all wrong. You got drunk and committed adultery. or you let down a kid who died, what would you do in those situations? Would guilt, self-condemnation, shame, self-hate it consume you? Or would you jump into the water, swim those hundred yards at breakneck speed toward Jesus? Would you be haunted the rest of your life by feelings of unworthiness? Would you allow darkness to overcome you? or would you let Jesus be who he is? A savior of boundless compassion, unbearable forgiveness, infinite patience with our failings, and a love in his risen heart that keeps no score of our wrongdoing. On every page of his gospel, John is saying that the apostles ran to Jesus because they were crazy about him. Oh, in the more restrained prose of biblical scholar Raymond Brown, Jesus was remembered as one who exhibited love in all that he did. And he was loved deeply by those who followed him. John sends a message to the American church today. It says he sends a message to any sinner here this morning who is covered with shame and remorse and low self-esteem and depression and self-hatred. And he also sends a message to the local church that is so slow to forgive a public sinner because of the fear of appearing lax or liberal. Speak in my own denomination, the Roman Catholic Church. At every evangelical church I visit, it's a minimum 40% former Catholics and as high as 75%. The number of people who have left the Catholic Church because it's too patient and too compassionate is negligible. The number who have left because it's too unforgiving, because they couldn't find Jesus there, is tragic. John is saying come lay your head on the breast of Jesus you listen to the heartbeat of the great rabbi and you'll finally understand what the Christian life is all about that you are to be a contemplative in action I'll close by sharing something about my wife Rosalyn. When we were courting, we met in 1975 in Morgan City, Louisiana. And two years later, we fell in love. And so I was taking every opportunity I could to visit her in New Orleans. I was living in a bachelor pit in Clearwater Beach, Florida. But every invitation that came from Louisiana, I'd accept it. Well, I got one invitation to lead a retreat for 100 American and Canadian priests in Assisi, Italy. So, everybody flew here to the Twin Cities. We got a chartered flight from Minneapolis-St. Paul over to Rome. They went to Assisi. We're there for eight days. Just a wonderful retreat. Then we fly back here to the Twin Cities. We arrive at 2 o'clock in the morning. And all the guys split to go home because they're all, you know, from this area or they're going to drive up to Canada someplace. Well, I'm all alone there in the airport, and I've got to speak the following day in San Francisco. Well, obviously, the prudent thing to do was to catch the first flight to San Francisco, have the whole day for R&R so I'd be fresh the next morning. Instead, I wait until 6 a.m., I get the first flight down to New Orleans on Northwest. Roslyn's there at the airport, she's packed a picnic lunch, and we go out to Lake Pontchartrain, and for about five hours we played Kissy Face and Huggy Bear. Then I race back to the airport. I catch the latest flight there. I arrive in San Francisco at midnight. The next morning, I'm giving my first talk. I am bright, alert, energetic. I am fired by love's urgent longings. That morning, I was in love with love. You know, the root meaning of the Latin word infatuation comes from two Latin words, in and fatuus, meaning to make foolish. And infatuated people do look kind of silly, right? I mean, they never walk anywhere. It's always running. And yet our human experience tells us that life is not always lived to that lyrical beat. The excitement, the enthusiasm of infatuation must eventually give way to quiet, thoughtful presence. And a love that's genuine has to weather separation, loneliness, conflict, tension, and those patches of boredom that challenge its capacity to endure. If love is to survive, the illusory intimacy of the first fascination must mature into authentic intimacy, characterized by self-sacrifice, appreciation, and communion with the beloved. My friends, at some moment in each of our lives, we were deeply affected by an encounter with Jesus Christ. It may have been a quiet, transforming experience. It may have been a blinding moment of light, like Paul and the Road to Damascus. It doesn't matter. However it took place, it brought consolation, peace, joy. We were swept up in wonder, certitude, and love. Quite simply, we were infatuated with Jesus. For me, that experience lasted nine years. And then, I got ordained. And suddenly, I was shanghaied by success. I was assigned to teach theology at the University of Steubenville in Ohio. And in my first week there, there were six students enrolled in my class. They had to get it as an elective to graduate. And at the end of one week, 358 students had transferred into my class, and the word was out there's some new guy talking about a Jesus I never heard of. And then I was asked to be the head of the campus ministry team because only 40% of the students were going to Mass. So I said, I'll do that. If you'll give me full authority, I'll take full responsibility. They did, and I started a midnight Mass every Saturday night. And in a short time, the girls moved their dances to Sunday afternoon and the guys their beer parties back to Friday night. And within two months, we had 96% of the student body coming to the Midnight Massacre, which lasted two hours. And you know, in the Catholic Church, we're trained when you preach, if you can't say it in 10 minutes, it ain't worth saying. And I'd preach for an hour on the G's of my own journey. We had people coming in from Wheeling, West Virginia, from Pittsburgh, north from Cleveland, 125 miles away from Columbus, Ohio. And suddenly, I was the toast of the campus. And then I'm invited to the great Catholic universities, the Loyolas, Notre Dame, Georgetown, talking to priests, 40 years older than I am, how to present biblical theology in the dynamic fashion. I can't tell you what a giddy feeling that was. To have my person admired, my ministry required, and as my unconditional availability to the ministry increased, My intimacy with Jesus decreased, but I rationalized. This is the price you have to pay for a generous service to building the kingdom. And several years later, when the fame faded and my popularity waned, when I had my first experience of rejection and failure in the ministry, I was spiritually unequipped for that kind of inner devastation. Loneliness, sadness invaded my heart. And in search of a mood-altering experience, I unplugged the jug. And with my predisposition to alcoholism, it has savaged, it has ravaged my family. Eight years ago, the best friend I've ever had in the world, my brother Rob, married with six children, died of alcoholism. He doesn't drink anymore. Well, within 18 months I was a raging drunk. I met in the street at 7 o'clock in the morning looking for a bar that was open because I was shaking so violently with the tinglys and the crawlies, the withdrawal symptoms. And I started to hide liquor bottles everywhere. I wound up panhandling in the street, sleeping under the bridge and doorways out on the beach until the cops caught me, just to get enough money to buy a pint of taka vodka and a plastic bottle and stick it in my back pocket. For two years, I abandoned the treasure, and I took flight from the simple sacredness of my life. And finally, the absence of God for me was so unbearable. I couldn't look at those bloodshot eyes in the mirror any longer. I came up here to Hazelden, Minnesota for two months of treatment. And then when I was released and the alcoholic fog had lifted, I knew there was only one place to go. I went back to the monastery. And for nine months, I did no preaching, no teaching, no writing, no counseling. For nine months, I lay my head on the breast of Jesus and listened to the heartbeat of the great rabbi. I do not want to give the impression that the years since that time have been an unbroken upward spiral toward holiness. There have been lapses, relapses, fits of pique and frustration, times of high anxiety and low self-esteem. The good news is their hang time gets progressively shorter. I share this about my own life, not to appear humble or false modesty or appear like a crepe hanger. I share my own life story as a word of encouragement for anybody here this morning who was caught up in the oppression of thinking that God works only through saints. I offer a word of liberation to anybody here in whom the prophetic word of Jesus to Peter has been fulfilled before the cock crows. You'll have disowned me three times. And I've disowned Jesus more than three times on my own journey. I offer a word of hope to anybody who is caught up in sheer intellectualism, skepticism, cynicism, indifference, or despair. Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. The way he related to John, to Peter, to Mary Magdalene, is the way he relates to you and me. As the 14th century mystic Meister Eckhart said, if you call Jesus goodness, he'll be good to you. If you call him love, he'll be loving to you. But if you call him compassion, he will know that you know. The best name for the Nazarene carpenter is Son of Compassion. My brothers and sisters, the recovery of passion starts with reappraising the value of the treasure. It continues with letting the great rabbi hold you silently, against his heart and it comes to fulfillment in a personal transformation into Christ that you will not even be aware of. Once again, would you gently close your eyes? And let this song be a cry of faith from each of our hearts. Amen. I don't need to follow any rainbow Search the world to find my dream come true And I don't need a love star to guide me I found my treasure in you I don't need to climb another mountain Set myself across the seven seas The paradise that I was always longing for Was found when you loved me And now my greatest joy is loving you The hope I lost was found and made anew Now my lonely days are finally through I have found my life in loving you I don't need to pray a prayer, an answer Make the wish that will never, never come true. For I have found my every answer. My every wish is you. And now my greatest joy is loving you. The hope I lost, found, and made anew. Now my lonely days are finally through. I am out of my life in loving you I don't need to follow any rainbows. Search the world to find my dream come true. And I don't need a lucky star to guide me. I found my treasure in you.
