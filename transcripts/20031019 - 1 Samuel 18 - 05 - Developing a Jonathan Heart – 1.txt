I'd like you to open your Bibles to 1 Samuel 18, beginning in the first verse. As we continue today, what we've been referring to as a journey of the heart. Oh, by the way, I've got to do this this time. I started it in my sermon. There was a reception. I'm going to be in big trouble if I don't do this. There was a reception following the service in the gathering place. We have tons of cake left over. Get your kids. Call the neighbors. Okay. I'm going to be in so much trouble Wednesday at the staff meeting. Okay, but not now, so we did that. Open your Bibles to 1 Samuel 18. Continue today what we've been calling a journey of the heart, which last week I identified as a battle for the heart. As you're looking for that passage, let me just ask you a question to get our thoughts moving in the right direction. If you had to name the single most important factor in the shaping of human character and the forming of a human heart and it was a multiple choice question, the five options being these, books being the most influential in forming a human heart, teaching, relationships, solitude, or music. If you had to pick between those five, which would it be most important in forming the human heart? Well, books are certainly helpful. I've recommended several for this series that I think will help you in this journey of the heart, like teaching, which is also important, they tend to inform the heart. Music is important. It often inspires my heart. Solitude is vital, helps me center my heart. But for me, the answer to that question, hands down, is this, relationships. That the single most important factor in shaping the hearts and developing the character of people is other people, which should come as no surprise. For hardwired into our character, into our emotional and spiritual DNA by our creator, is not only the capacity, but the need for relationships. In the garden, at creation, one thing isn't good. It isn't good to be alone. For good or for ill, we are marked by the people in our lives. We are marked by relationships. And among the most important, particularly in this battle we are waging these weeks for the heart, are those we call our friends. And while I hope the person you're married to, if you're married, is a very good friend, I'm not talking about marriage today. I'm not talking about your relationship with your kids or your parents or your co-workers, though. In those groups, I hope you find your friends. What I'm talking about exclusively, pointedly, this morning is what it means to be and what it means to have a friend. But not any old garden variety, nice to see a fishing buddy friend. I'm talking covenant friend. I'm talking about I'll be there for you on your worst day friend. What I've referred to in the past as one of those middle of the night friends. But John Eldridge, whose book I've been recommending, Wake the Dead, consistently refers to as intimate ally, friends. And the reason we're going to talk about that this morning is because in 1 Samuel 18, using, again, the story of David as the guide for our journey of the heart, we get introduced to and we will begin to examine one of the greatest friendships of all time, that of Jonathan and David. And we will examine over the next couple of weeks what made that relationship great. And we will see, especially in the context of this battle for the heart, what made that kind of relationship so necessary. And we will wonder together what it means for you and me to have and to be a friend, to have a network of friends on this journey of the heart that is a battle for the heart. So here we go. Chapter 18, verse 1. Just the first four verses will give us enough to know the nature of this friendship. Now it came about when he, that is David, was speaking to Saul. Context for this is David has just killed the giant Goliath, comes in to speak with Saul, that the soul of Jonathan, who happened to be Saul's son, was knit to the soul of David. And Jonathan loved him as himself. And Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house, so there's no more tending of sheep for David. Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him. It was an outer garment. Gave it to David along with his armor. He gave him his armor. He gave him his sword, his bow, and his belt. To really understand the nature and importance of this friendship, We need to see it in the context of and in contrast to another relationship. Because this entire section of Scripture from chapter 18 through chapter 20 is really about two relationships. It's about the love and loyalty of Jonathan for David, obviously. That's the obvious relationship. But it's also the story about the jealousy and demonically driven hatred of Saul, Jonathan's father and the king of Israel at the time for David. That contrast between those two relationships existing together in this story create for us the context that helps us understand and clearly see how critically important the kind of covenantal friendship that David and Jonathan had is on this journey of the heart in this battle for the heart. So first thing I want to do in describing David's relationship with Jonathan is first tell you about Saul. a little bit. And the jealousy of Saul, it manifests in this story early and often right after David killed Goliath, Saul began to hear this song being sung in the streets. Saul has killed his thousands and that's incredible, but David has killed his tens of thousands. Saul's response to that is in verse 8, chapter 18, 1 Samuel. Then Saul became very angry for this saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed to David ten thousands but to me they've ascribed thousands now what more can he have but the kingdom and Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on verse 14 and David was prospering in all his ways for the Lord was with him when Saul saw that he was prospering greatly he dreaded him Saul had a shriveled heart verse 28 when Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David and that Michael, Saul's daughter, so not only does Saul's son, Jonathan, love David, but Saul's daughter, Michael, loved him as well. Then Saul was even more afraid of David. Thus Saul was David's enemy continually. Three times King Saul would try to kill him with a spear. Verse 11, it says that he wanted to pin him to the wall. Once Saul hired assassins to kill David. It didn't work twice. He offered his daughters in marriage to David, but with this catch, he had to prove himself in battle. The scheme was this. He will surely die if he goes in battle, and he set him into situations where he was incredibly outnumbered. Verse 17, for Saul thought, my hand shall not be against David, so let the hand of the Philistines do the job. For Saul planned to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. Verse 25. The point of all of that is this. Just kind of get the picture of what's going on here so that we can kind of relate to this picture and enter into it ourselves. That right in the middle of all of this murderous, hateful, jealousy, demonically driven insanity in the demonically driven part, you can see in verse 10, where Saul had so opened himself up by his own jealousy, by the shrinking of his own heart to the presence of a demonic power that would begin to drive his jealousy into an insane kind of murderous thing. Right in the middle of all of that stuff that was coming against David relentlessly, David got a gift. A gift that saved his life in the middle of the battle. A gift that protected his heart, that preserved his heart so he didn't lose heart. And the gift was simply this. He had a friend. But not just any old ordinary garden variety, nice to see you, fishing buddy friend. David had a covenant friend. He had a middle of the night friend, and I'll be there for you on your worst day friend. He had an I got your back friend. A little insight, a little note on the relationship that David and Jonathan had. It's a very unlikely relationship if you think about it at all. I mean, if anybody had reason to be jealous of David, it was Jonathan even more than Saul. You can see why Saul would be jealous, but Jonathan was the heir to the throne. And here is David usurping, not intentionally, but in some sense, usurping, going to take the position that he all his life thought he was intended for, that was his right, if you will. But rather than contention, there was love. Rather than rivalry, there's covenant. between these two. For God had knit their hearts together. A word about covenant. When it comes to friendships, we don't very often use the word covenant. We talk about friends, we talk about best friends, things like that. And I want to bring this word covenant to you and maybe even help you see that you may have some covenant relationships that you're not seeing that way and you need to. When I think of covenant relationships, I think of marriage. And obviously that's a covenant a man and a wife come together, and publicly, ceremonially, formally, they make covenant one to another. We don't do that with friends. It feels kind of weird, actually. Let me tell you a little bit about covenant friends. So it'll help you identify the ones you have. First of all, covenant friendship is mutual. Maybe that's too obvious to say, but covenant friendships don't happen when someone comes up to you and says, you want to be my friend? They don't happen that way. Covenant friendships are identified when, over time, you sense this drawing to a person. There's a mutuality that both of you experience, and there's a bit of a dance going on in that where you experience this mutuality. When it becomes a covenant friendship, while it can be ceremonial, it doesn't have to be. And partly, just because of our culture, it probably won't be. You know, when we were kids, some of us did that. How many of you remember when you were in the club and little guys, or there was no girls allowed or you had little girl clubs or no boys allowed we were buddies for life and you know cut your little wish and you become blood brothers and whatever. Those are ceremonial covenants. We don't do that when we grow up. I'm not even saying you should. I'm not saying you shouldn't. Covenant relationships need to be recognized. They need to be, they may not be formal. They might be as informal as when you're going through this relationship with this friend and it's getting more significant and you recognize that you're on the same page in so many ways and you need each other for the battle for your hearts, simply as saying over the table at lunch or in the car when you're driving somewhere, I just need to tell you something. It feels weird, but I love you. And I want you to know I'll be there for you. And then we go, yeah. After that, you just go, ah, ah, ah, ah. Something is pressed past acquaintance and even affection. And pressing past that affection and acquaintance into something that mutually is agreed upon that we really love each other and we're going to be there for each other is an enormous amount of risk. Pressing past the risk. And what covenant really is is simply about promise. Which says, among other things, I'll be there for you. It is declared, it needs to be declared And part of the reason I'm telling you this Is some of you have covenant relationships like that But you've never put it in that category Put it in that category You need to understand, you need to recognize Identify the covenant relationships Some of you already have And you're not letting it count, it needs to count Now some of you still need to develop these But some of you have them and need to notice it What about the robe and the sword and the armor The robe that Jonathan gave to David was not just a robe that you would casually wear to keep yourself warm. This was a royal robe. This was Jonathan's royal robe. It was a symbol of his right to rule as heir to the throne and giving it to David. He is saying, David, I recognize you as the Lord's anointing. I see things in you, David, that you may not even see in yourself. I recognize an anointing on you. Now, while in the story, there is something about Jonathan giving David this robe that you and I will never do. I'm not ever going to give my friend a robe. But there are ways that we can do this and probably do do this. In fact, as I think about it, I have done this. I've had people do this to me where you look in someone's eyes who's become or becoming a covenant friend. Across the table, they're going through a rough time. They're wondering if they have what it takes. You look them in the eye and say, I see on you. You are the Lord's anointed. I see an anointing on you, an empowerment of God on you, a moving of God in you that you can't even see yourself. And I'm here out of the strength of my anointing to tell you I see it and you have what it takes. And when you do that, you may not say it that way, but when you do that kind of thing, you know what you're doing? You're giving somebody your robe. So give your robe away to those covenant friends. The sword and the armor. In giving the sword and the armor, he is saying symbolically, essentially this, David, these implements of warfare, and the whole context here is a war for our heart, the battle for our heart, these implements of war, this sword and this shield, this armor that I always use to protect myself and to defend myself, I want you to know as I give them to you that that symbolically means that my weapons of warfare are now being used to protect you and defend you. In other words, the way we say these things, I got your back. I got your back. By the way, in what really is a covenant relationship, this is not like, it needs to be like this. You will just notice that it is like this. There will be times in the relationship where you will function like Jonathan. Other times you will be in the posture of David. What I mean by that is this. There will be times when you're the one giving the robe, you're the one giving the sword and the armor because your friend is in a place where they need to be protected, they need to know they're not alone, they need to be encouraged and reminded you are the Lord's anointed. There are other times when you're in the position of David when you need to hear that stuff, you need to see that stuff, and that Jonathan in your life, that you gave him your robe a week ago, this day he's given you his robe, or she's given you her robe, get it? And you'll see yourself in those, it's kind of a type, if you will. A word about Saul. We're gonna talk more about Saul in weeks to come when we visit what it looks like on this journey of the heart, to have a jealous heart, to have a shriveled heart. but today in the context of this particular story I want you to let Saul in your mind stand as a symbol for all the things all the people, all the forces in your life, maybe right now that are committed to and bent on assaulting your heart. Because what we've been saying from day one on this journey of the heart, about the heart, is this. Number one, your heart is absolutely central to your life. Particularly to your life in the kingdom of God, that your heart needs to be alive to God. And because that's true, in fact, precisely because your heart is so important, because that's true, it's under assault. You need to know that. Quote by C.S. Lewis that I'm probably wearing out that illustrates this so well, I think is this the story of your life? You need to know. It's the story of a long and brutal assault on your heart by the one who knows what you could be and fears what you could be. There really is a glory to your life that the enemy sees and he is hell-bent on destroying that glory so he assaults your heart. Your heart is central. Your heart is under assault. In this story, I want you to let Saul with his jealous, murderous, duplicitous, demonically driven hatred of David stand as a symbol of that assault. Stand as a symbol for everything and everyone and every circumstance maybe in your life right now that's being used by the enemy of your soul to steal, kill, and destroy your hearts. Now, if you really do enter into that imagery, it's a little disturbing. In fact, one of the ways you'll know you've kind of entered into it is you're feeling a little disturbed right now. See, I don't like to think that I have a soul. I don't like to even go into that place of analogy to think that I to think that you have someone something that like Saul is intentionally murderously jealously, unrelentingly unreasonably, insanely demonically, oh my goodness committed to and driven by a desire to take you out I don't like to think about that In fact, when I read the story and hear that David had a Saul coming at him just that way, I go, poor guy. Poor guy. I'm glad I get to read about it. You know, if I knew a guy, I'd pray for him. I'm glad I don't. I don't even want to think. I want you to know. You've got a Saul. But if I enter into that, I mean, I would just live in fear. Wouldn't you live in fear? If somebody insanely, relentlessly, murderously, jealously was after you to take you out, I'd live in fear. People would call that paranoia. People who are paranoid, we put them in the hospital. How many of you can tell that I'm using Saul here as a metaphor for the intent and the activity of the evil one? I'm using Saul here as a metaphor for what is really going on in spiritual warfare. Apostle Peter said it this way in 1 Peter 5.8, concerning this very reality. Don't be afraid. Now, it doesn't mean you're never going to feel fear, but don't give in to that fear. Here's what you need to know. The reason I'm informing you about Saul, Satan, is so that you be alert because you have a Saul. As surely as David had a Saul who was relentlessly, murderously after him, you have a Saul. For your adversary, the devil, prowls about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. And in his prowling about, he is intentional. He is murderous, jealous, relentless, unreasonable, insanely, demonically committed to take you out, to render you impotent, what do you do? Verse 9, resist him. Verse 9, how do you do that? Well, you resist, you go boo. I resist you, boo, go away, Satan. You know, sometimes that works, and that's great. Usually I think if that works, it's like you don't have any idea what's really going on. Some of us come up with little formulas and we chant our little things and we resist him. How many of you know sometimes resisting the devil is as easy as telling the truth and praying a prayer and having something? How many of you know it's that easy sometimes? It is that easy. How many of you also know that sometimes resisting the devil means for days and sometimes weeks standing in a place where the spears that are pinning you to the wall, that are salting your heart, are coming and coming and coming? And to resist him means not just a little prayer you shot up, but it means calling the people who you know how to pray to pray. It's about calling your Jonathans and your Davids and saying, you know what, I'm going through a season right now where I need your robe and I need your sword and I need your armor. Resist them. It sounds like, and you're done. Hardly ever. We're fighting for your heart and you need to know about how the fight is fought. Resist the devil knowing what? It says in the verse, knowing two things. Number one, that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. You need to know the battle in the big story way is already over. Satan is a defeated foe. You have authority on you that you don't even know. But you also need to know that you are not alone in two ways. You are not alone because greater is he that is in you. You're not alone. You have the life and power of God in you, but you are not alone in another way. For the same experiences, this is right out of 1 Peter 5, verse 9, for the same experiences of suffering that you are experiencing right now are being accomplished, are being experienced, pressed through by your brethren, other intimate allies all around the world. Don't be surprised when this stuff happens. You got a Saul who's absolutely committed to take you out. All of which leads me to say that this issue of covenant friendship and intimate allies in this context, when you put it in this context, it's not just a matter of, wouldn't it be nice to have, I just wish I had a friend like that. Well, it would be nice to have a friend like that. But when I put it in this context, suddenly a covenant friendship becomes a matter of life and death. You get that? Suddenly it becomes a matter of success or failure on this journey of the heart and this battle for the heart. We talk about small groups and the need for small groups. And some of you, I'm pretty sure probably, like I have, approach small groups as like one of the things on the list of good Christian behaviors that you ought to do. And maybe you'll get around that one day and check a small group and forget it. It's like, I don't know if you get it. Because this is like life and death. In fact, some of you are in small groups and you've done small groups and your reason you don't want to be in a small group is because you've been in one. And Dave, I was in a small group where I didn't have anything in common with the people. We didn't have the same passions. We didn't have the same heart. We didn't think the same way. You're in the small. You're in the wrong group. Big revelation. You're in the wrong group. Finding those people who have the same passion, the same heart, something in common. You know why that's important? Because this is about survival. This is about survival. One of the things John Eldredge is big on in both his book, Wild at Heart, and also in Wake the Dead, is what he calls mythic stories. A mythic story is a story that, the story itself isn't true, but it speaks to something that's true. An example of that is the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. Aslan is a lion, and the characters, none of them, it was a made-up story. But all of that story speaks to something that's a myth, it's mythic, but it speaks to a much bigger reality that is the ultimate reality. It's a fairy tale that is speaking to ultimate reality. One of the things Eldridge points out, it's very interesting to me, it's kind of mind-expanding to me that if you kind of get a handle on this, you'll kind of see that all of the great stories of adventure that stir you, that scare you, that call something out of you, they all have elements of the big story of the kingdom of God. Often if it's an adventure, there will be a mission that's dangerous, but the cause is noble. There's an adversary that's formidable and unrelenting, evil in many cases. There is a hero. In some cases, the hero is a superhero. And we like that, and he's Superman, but we don't identify. Like, the superhero type is the person I cheer for, but I don't have to be involved. The other adventure that is far more compelling, consistent like with a kingdom myth, if you will, the mythic reality of the story, not that the kingdom is a myth, but the picture of this being bigger is that the hero is a pretty common person. He's got a good heart. But the other piece of the story, this kind of story, is that this good-hearted, common person can't fight this adversary by themselves. They need a friend. They need a group of friends. In Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo was a brave and true hobbit, but he doesn't have a chance without Sam. And Sam is pretty common too. But together, they begin to make their move. In the movie The Matrix, we used The Matrix some weeks ago to illustrate how it illustrates the bigger story. In that movie, Neo is fast. He's really fast. But he didn't have a chance without Trinity. Morpheus in that movie is more gifted and powerful than all of them, but it took Neal and Trinity to save him. Well, these are just weird movies. The Apostle Paul. Now we're talking about the big story. 2 Corinthians 7, verse 5 says this. When we were in Macedonia, our flesh had no rest. We had conflicts without, we had fears within, but God who comforts the depressed comforted us by the coming of Titus. In other words, right in the middle of a great battle, said Paul, quite frankly, for my heart. Did you hear the battle for Paul's heart? We had conflicts without fears within, fears within. God who comforts the depressed, ready to quit, comforted me by the coming. God sent him a friend. I'm here to clothe you. I'm here to protect you. I'm here to remind you that you are the Lord's anointed. I'm here to give you my sword. I'm here to give you my armor. I got your back. Jesus himself, in dealing on one hand with multitudes who wanted to use him because he did tricks. Turn the water to wine. Do it one more time. And in facing, on the other hand, opposition that wanted to kill him, in the middle of all of that stuff, he had 12 that he called to himself. And of the 12, he had three. Remember that? Peter, James, and John. And of the three, there was one. It says the Bible says John was the disciple Jesus loved. That does not mean he didn't love the others, but there were different kinds of intimate allies By the way, one of the reasons that sometimes what I'm talking about today feels to some of us so foreign is because some of us have no sense of mission to our lives. Think about it this way. If you think about it, and you think about the relationships you either have or have had, those places where covenant kinds of friendships have been formed. You may not have them now, but you've maybe experienced them at some level. I think you'll probably identify this fact that those covenant kinds of relationships never happened when you were looking for a friend. In fact, in those moments, in those seasons when you were looking for a friend, that kind of, I kind of made fun of it, you want to be my friend? It's like people running for their lives. They didn't happen when you were looking for a friend. Most of the covenant relationships, you just kind of run this over your own spirit, your own experience. Most of the covenant relationships you have or have had came in the context of common values, common purpose, common mission, where in the context of pursuing that mission, whatever it was, you discovered you needed some help. You discovered you needed some allies. And in that pursuit of mission, and the mission, by the way, might have been fighting for your marriage. It might have been fighting for your kids. And in the fighting for your marriage, not necessarily fighting in your marriage, but you might have been. Fighting for your marriage, you start that pursuit and you start looking for, maybe there's some other couples here who are not looking to get out of their marriage, they're looking to stay in their marriage, and I wonder if we, and in that context of mission, fight for your marriage, you find some friends. And you're struggling. The mission of life right now that you are, and in that pursuit, you begin to find some friends. This happens at a number of different levels. One of the first places I ever tasted this sense of mission, and out of mission comes friendship, was in sports. Some of you have experienced it that way. I remember playing football in high school, in college. You line up, and you're on a team with some of these guys you didn't know four weeks ago, and all of a sudden, now you're in this place when the game's about to happen, that there's something inside of you, I think I'd die for this guy. What's the mission? To win the game so the girls like it. That's the mission. you know and sooner or later you kind of hope these people move into a bigger story but you got a taste of something you got to you know i know people so do you in fact it's weird i was watching football yesterday that's all there is to do actually and some of you think what do you mean there's something else to do clean news yeah whatever but i'm thinking of the of the way even in our culture we just go nuts over sports I love sports I think they're great and I think one of the reasons there's an attraction even especially for the guys who play and the women who play there is this sense of I have these people are in this battle with me but all it is about is putting a ball in a goal here's the sad thing some people never live in anything bigger than that story I have a friend, he's a great guy but he talks about, oh I wish I was in high school again oh those were the days he never entered into a bigger story he never thought, you know what, the things you learn on a ball field were really important things to learn so that you would learn about mission, like fight for your wife fight for your family, fight for your children, get in something bigger than yourself and in that you find your friends applause applause applause How about this for mission? How about this for mission? To respond to the invitation of our King Jesus, to partner with him, to be a people who are making deep inroads into the kingdom of darkness. Now it sounds so, you know, grandiose. What would that mean? There are a myriad of ways that we can begin to make inroads into the kingdom of darkness. You can do it by fighting for your kids. You can do it by fighting for your marriage. You can do it by feeding the poor. You can do it by holding a baby. Our mission is to break down the gates of brass that have kept people in bondage. Isaiah 45, verse 1, to cut through the bars of iron in order to rescue the hearts of men and women, to bring them back alive, to help them recover their glory that God intended for them to have from the beginning. And when you take even the smallest step toward that mission, you will very quickly know, number one, that your movement into that mission is being opposed, and number two, that you can't do it alone because it's being opposed. Well, here's a flash for you. You're not meant to do it alone. You don't have to do it alone, but that raises a question, which I'm going to address out a little bit more next week. How do I find these people who will help me not do it alone? These intimate allies. How do I find covenant relationships? The phrase that was going through my mind all week, where can I get me one of them? Where can I get me a Jonathan? Well, I've answered that question in part already. First of all, these friendships are formed in the context of mission. A lot of them are. So here's your assignment for the week. Ask yourself a question. Jot it down and then just pray over this. Just don't, try to make it, just pray over this. Ask yourself this question. What am I involved in that's bigger than myself? Because if you're in, what am I involved in that's bigger than myself that would require a friend like this? That would kick it out of that arena? Wouldn't that feel nice? No, I'm not talking about what it would feel nice. I'm talking about something that makes it life and death. And again, fighting for your marriage counts. That would be something bigger than yourself because you're in way over your head. You don't know how to fix this. Fighting for your kids counts We've been talking about going toward our lions and our bears and our goliaths That counts And you may just find that as you begin to do that you you have people Beginning to come around you that you you didn't you weren't looking for them. You just found your mission So what is your mission? That's a hard question by the way. I'm just throwing that out. What's your mission? What's your passion? Part of what needs to be recovered when we recover our heart is an awareness of the true desires of our heart that God put in us, that we've forgotten. Second thing, identify, simply notice who's already there. See, I said this earlier in the talk, and this is like before we go into some more ways in which you can form intimate allies, I really believe that many of you have them and you haven't recognized it. Or, formally, in a covenantal way that I think you need to do, you haven't said it out loud. So ask God to help you notice what's already there. Back up. Some of you, I don't have any. I've talked to many, many people who come and they say, I don't have any. Back up one step and think for a minute. You may have more there than you know. Now, they may not be perfect. And if you're trying, if you're looking for somebody who's going to solve all your problems, they're never, So forgive them right now for not being everything you need. But one of the pieces in this is recognizing that there may be somebody there, maybe more than one, and then to take the risk that you acknowledge it and it needs to be mutual, you'll be able to discern that. And then to verbalize it to make a covenant where together you can recognize it. Where you can say in ways that are, isn't as informal as this, I just need to tell you I love you. I really love you. And I want to be there for you. I got your back. Last thing. Just kind of entering into this, how do we discover this? How do we change the question? Last thing is change the question. What do you mean? Change the question from how can I find a friend like this to Lord, I want to spend some time asking you how I can become a friend like this. To be a friend like Jonathan who said to David, David, here's my robe and here's my armor. and here's my sword. I got your back. Let's pray as we close. Father, I think this is really important. As we're coming to understand, I think more clearly what the journey of the heart really is, as we're coming to understand that as our hearts begin to come alive, that there is an incredible battle going on against our hearts, this issue of covenant friendships, is no longer a luxury, a thing on this list of Christian things I ought to do. It really does become for us in the context of identified mission a matter of life and death. So I pray, Father, that as you are calling us into and are moving in so many ways among us around these issues of the heart and our passions and desires planted in us by you, I pray, Father, that in this issue of covenantal friendship that you, God, would be the God of this, that you would teach us and show us those friendships we already have. Help us to identify them, to affirm them, to, in some, even if it's an informal ceremony, to ceremonially bless them and say, you are my friend. But also, Father, to help us know those people who are to be trusted, we are to let in, to be these intimate allies in this battle for our heart. I pray these things in Jesus' name to be released powerfully among us. We pray it in Jesus' name. All God's people said, amen. Amen.
