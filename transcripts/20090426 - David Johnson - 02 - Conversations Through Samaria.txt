Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we go to the Word this morning. My prayer is simple, Father, this morning, maybe what it always is. It's simply this, for words of life that call forth more life, generated by the power of your Spirit through the clarity and authority of your Word. I pray this be done in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, last week in our introduction to Jesus' use of parables and other rabbinic methods of teaching, among the things we touched on that I want to return to today and expand just a bit has to do with the structure or the pattern I talked about last week that we find in Luke's gospel that refers to the parables as travel narratives. Because Jesus does the parables in Luke. Now, it's a structure that's not found in all of the other gospels. But in Luke, he does most of his parables on his way. Remember this? From Galilee, where his ministry began, to Jerusalem through Samaria. Galilee, again, where his ministry began, he would preach and he would teach. That was the kind of language he would use when he was there proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom that is preaching and teaching the precepts of God to people who had what we called last week a biblical base. They knew and cherished Torah, which is kind of just a way for us to say the Hebrew scriptures. And with those people, those kind of people, he would dialogue with them and preach and teach with them with the basis of the text. And in Jerusalem, which is where his ministry ended, he did there much the same thing. To people much the same as those in Galilee who had this shared frame of reference around Torah, common language, even though they argued about interpretations of Torah, they all kind of saw that as a basis, a starting point. And with them, just like in Galilee, when he was in Jerusalem, he would preach and he would teach, he would use the texts. But on his way from Galilee, which is where he began, to Jerusalem, which is where he ended, he went through Samaria not preaching and not teaching or referring to the text or even mentioning the name of God, per se. He told what we introduced last week as these simple stories. Using language, very common and earthy, he spoke of farmers and fields and judges and victims and coins and sheep and life. To people who didn't know the Torah, who had no understanding of nor desire for the Torah. Indeed, Eugene Peterson in that book I mentioned last week entitled Tell It Slant used Samaria as a metaphor for the way that Jesus uses language with people who have very little or maybe no readiness to listen to the revelation of God as it is revealed in the text specifically. Calling it, did Peterson, this Sunday to Sunday conversation. Galilee being a metaphor, if you will, for Sunday. Jerusalem being a metaphor for next Sunday. But in between is Samaria. And this kind of really works for me. I don't know if you get a picture of this. Because Samaria, in fact, is where most of us live from Sunday to Sunday, between Sundays. And when Jesus was in that environment, he didn't preach. And he didn't teach. He told these simple stories. to use common language, not religious at all, no God talk at all, all of which has become a metaphor to me as I've been thinking about this of the present day church. Indeed, our church, if you will, committed as we are to the centrality of the text and the revelation of God that comes to us through the text. But the fact is we live in Samaria. I don't know if this is a phrase you're familiar with, but I hear this all the time, and we talk about this all the time. We live in a post, what's called a post-modern culture. And it's a culture that, by and large, couldn't care less about the text. And sometimes Christians get really, really mad at people about that, which is kind of useless because it's Samaria. There is no devotion to the text, no common language around the text. But many times, not many times, but most of these people actually Have a built-in by God hunger for God. Because from Sunday to Sunday, we live in Samaria, and as I put all this together, it makes me wonder, can we learn as a people of God to talk about God without God language, without religious language, which might scare some of you, but Jesus did it all the time, particularly when he was going through Samaria. And all of that is why today, in this second week of introduction, and that kind of is what this is again, another kind of piece of the introduction dealing with the parables of Jesus. I want to talk this morning about preaching. And I want to talk about teaching. And in light of that, I want to also move us into this power of simple story, and common language, even the sacred potential of simple conversation. And I'm calling it this morning, the title of the talk is Conversations Through Samaria. I want you to wonder about Conversations Through Samaria, but first let's talk about preaching. Because it still has a place and is the kind of language, actually, both in meaning and in manner, that Jesus was all about. Indeed, the first words out of Jesus' mouth, as reported by Mark, who was the first to write a gospel, was preaching. in Mark 1.14, it says that Jesus came into Nazareth preaching the good news or the gospel of God, saying this, the time is fulfilled. The kingdom of God is at hand. It is within your reach. Repent and believe in the gospel that is preaching. And by the end of that sermon, there was an invitation of sorts when he said to a few of these people who became his disciples, now come follow me. And they did. His first converts were there. And when he did that, This preaching thing, he was standing as the latest in a long tradition, more than a thousand years before him of great preaching, that had actually been brought up to date by his cousin, John the Baptist. And after Jesus, this tradition of preaching continued through people like Peter and Paul. Peter, who at Pentecost took his stand with the eleven and said, men of Israel, listen to these words. he began to preach the good news of God, of the death and resurrection of Christ, and following Peter was Paul. And it's in the same line of people like Chrysostom and Cyprian and Luther and Calvin and Wesley and Whitefield and Finney and Spurgeon. Indeed, preaching continues to be among the basic languages for conveying the revelation of God in Christ Jesus, God alive at work and speaking through his word by the Spirit right here, right now for you and for me, and then there's teaching. Because Jesus uses this language as well, and while all the gospel writers present us with Jesus, the teacher, instructing us in detail through his teaching what it means to live in the kingdom of God, Matthew is the gospel writer who provides us with the most extensive witness of Jesus' teaching. five discourses in Matthew, in all the Sermon on the Mount, being one of those discourses that we just finished that whole thing, spending, I think, over a year on that. The purpose of which, indeed, it's the purpose of all great teaching, is not just to dispense information. Teaching does dispense information. But the purpose of teaching, ultimately, is in the giving of information to help people literally connect the dots. And if you've ever heard good teaching, and I hope you have, I hope you've heard some good teaching here. One of the things that happens is that it connects the dots to put the parts of everyday life and a biblical text. Because in a context like this, we are devoted to the text. But connect teaching connects the biblical text to everyday life, puts them together to make connections, to demonstrate relationships. And it's happening not just when you're taking notes, but it's happening when you go, oh, that's what that means. And when Jesus is doing that, when he's teaching, just as when he is preaching, he is standing in a long line of tradition, beginning with the books of Moses. We know them as the Pentateuch or Torah. Further on are the Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, and then the counsel and wisdom woven into the fabric of pastoral care that we find in the prophets and the priests of Israel. These are deep and rich and profound traditions, and it continues today. Does teaching as a critical part of developing an intelligent and faithful obedience that helps people connect the dots from the biblical text to the everyday realities of family and failure, of suffering and sin and business and just plain life. Bruce Akema, in his book entitled Listening to the Language of the Bible, says it this way, that effective teaching resurrects dead words and makes them live again. And Jesus was a master teacher, resurrecting dead words and making them come alive again. In fact, this Sermon on the Mount would be a classic example of that when he took Torah. You've heard it said, don't commit adultery. And for many people, that had just become dry as toast, dead words to them, wooden legalisms, and he brought those words to life, helped them connect these things to people's everyday life. He was a master teacher, a master preacher, and none of that is going away. But in Samaria, those kinds of languages are necessarily moving to the margins. You've got to lighten up on the God talk here because there's a third kind of language that Jesus used, not preaching or teaching, that he was, in fact, a master of as well this informal, conversational, give-and-take language, common and earthy, involving story and parable, coming in the normal flow of life. It wasn't teaching time. It came in the normal flow of life while eating and drinking with families and in workplaces places on playgrounds and shopping malls and grocery stores and airport terminals. The fact is, when I think of Jesus being a master teacher and a master preacher, and then this incredible weaver of story and weaver of parables, I get a little intimidated because he was so good at that. And if we're going to have to do parables to communicate with Samaria, I feel like I don't do this very well. I mean, he's a genius, and he was so creative. I'm not creative enough. Here's the truth. Here's one of the things I want to invite you into this morning. I think this third language is a language that many of you do better than you think. You do it better than you know. What you don't know, however, and I hope to call this out of you and encourage you in this, what you don't know and often fail to understand is how this normal conversational give and take language that all of us engage in, in the flow of normal life, how that kind of language actually does have the potential to be every bit as sacred and every bit as revelatory as any preaching or any teaching that you have ever heard. See, if you're sitting in a room like this, listening to a sermon like this, and it's on some text, let's say Galatians 5, or if you're in an academic setting, and maybe it's a seminar type of thing, and you're taking notes on some teaching relative to Isaiah 61, it's fairly obvious that you're listening to language that has the potential, because not all teaching and preaching is effective. Some is pitifully insipid, but it has this kind of, it has potential, and its design is to, rooted in the text, reveal deep truths about God, about his kingdom, its purpose is revelatory. We kind of get that. But how about when we're strolling down the beach with a friend or having coffee at a diner, expressing concern maybe for a friend or maybe making a new friend or maybe fishing with your son or playing catch with your daughter? Here's the question, that Jesus' language as he's going through Samaria raises for us, raises for me. In those contexts, can those words, in those contexts, be revelatory as well? Be ways of participating in God's presence and God's action in places and times not clearly signposted sacred. No chapter and verse, no God talk at all. Think about this. just wonder about this. Can we give witness to Jesus in revelatory ways, in ways that really do reveal who Jesus is without using the name of Jesus? In other words, can we talk about God without God talk? And some of you are kind of, something rises up, well, why wouldn't I use the name of Jesus? I'm not saying you shouldn't use the name of Jesus, but can you? Is it possible to speak in normal ways that people in Samaria might understand and identify with that really do reveal the realities of Jesus without using the name of Jesus? Can we convey, can we communicate deep trust in God without saying what we always said growing up in church when you were trying to tell people that you were trusting God, I'm just trusting the Lord. Can you convey deep. Trust in God without saying, I'm just trusting the Lord. Is it possible to praise with an exclamation or a gesture that didn't actually use the words, praise the Lord, but was in fact in the company of angels singing, holy, holy, holy? Well, the answer to that is yes, you can. And Jesus did. Though, if you reflect on times that you have, my guess is that you've experienced these kinds of things in retrospect. You bump into a friend at the grocery store or at the ballpark, and you're out shopping or whatever it is you're doing, and you stop for a while. It wasn't planned. It's just in the course of life. Just a few minutes is all, and you leave, and it's not until later, I know this has happened to you, that it dawns on you that in that conversation, unplanned, unstaged, no agenda, there was a touch of grace. Something of God was authentically revealed, and it was deep, and it maybe even brought you to tears on the way home, a perception of beauty, a sense of presence. I'm here to tell you, some of you are better at this than you know. But if you've kind of been trained on God talk, you kind of have this, well, if I didn't use, you didn't do any, yes, you did. Happens in the flow of life. You know, Bethany University has an interesting program that I found out about recently. They have a mentoring program for young men and women who are interested in going into ministry as a vocation and just have a lot of questions about that. So they try to hook them up with people who are in ministry so they can maybe kind of get a taste of what it's really all about so they don't get so enamored or that they really find out this is what they want. And we have a few people on our staff who are involved in that who are doing that. Steve Williams is doing it. Jen's doing it. I'm doing it. And I don't know, about a month and a half ago, I was going to Iowa State. And one of the things I like to do when I go speak some other place is bring someone with me. And often I bring my wife. And so I asked her first, honey, I'm going to Iowa. You want to come? I don't know why it was by Iowa. I didn't have a big draw to her. but honestly at the last minute again because this was kind of a new thing to me you know I'm going to bring this guy who we're in this relationship and I've been bringing him to meetings and stuff like that just giving him a taste of stuff and so he came and we sat in the car and we did a thing in the car for four hours and guess what we did in the car I preached I didn't there was no preaching there was no teaching where I was just talking along the way and we talked and he wouldn't shut up it was just bizarre and we talked about earthy things and gritty things and a few callous things and and kingdom things and ministry things and then there was three days at this in this hotel with this campus ministry and rubbing shoulders with kids and and at the end of the day after another four-hour ride back of just talking normal but God's in him and God's in me I don't you know he'd have to be up here to tell you this, but I think there was more learning, if you will, no taking notes. There wasn't taking notes, but there was more learning about what ministry is really about and what it really takes and what really matters in the kingdom of God and stuff about the Holy Spirit. He learned more there than in 20 years of listening to me preach and teach. And he has listened to me preach for 20 years because he's my nephew. Anyway. I was thinking about this when my kids were little. You know, you're always trying to, what are ways to communicate with them, principles of the kingdom and how to live. And, you know, you can just tell one of your kids is in one of these places where they're lying about something or there's something that they're hiding and they don't know how to get it out. And maybe they go through the agony of that and they finally do. And how do I explain that to them? And I have this Bible verse, and the Bible verse is of King David, who said, when I kept silent about my sin, my bones waxed old within me. And so I say to my seven-year-old, when I kept silent about my sin, Caleb. No. No, you know what I did to my kids? I don't know if they remember this, but you know, this thing where you're holding stuff in, and it's scary to say you're sorry or admit that you're wrong. My bones wax old. It's like barfing. See, now they're going to get this. You know how I'm telling you this is really true. When you need to confess something, there's this thing in you that goes, I did something wrong, and I need to say I'm sorry. And this thing stirs in you, and you hold it down for a real long time. I don't have to say it. I don't want to say it. I'm going to hold it in. Maybe I'll get over this. And then this stage comes when you're about to throw up that you can't stop anymore, and you puke everywhere physically. But confession's the same way, because you thought you didn't have to say you're sorry, or you justified it, and then you come to this realization, I can't hold this in anymore. I have to go to my mom or my dad or my friend and say I'm sorry. And it's horrible when you throw up. It's horrible when you barf, but after you do it, you feel better. There's your parable for the day. See, Jesus was a preacher And he was a teacher But on this walking trip You know, on the way to Iowa State On the way to Jerusalem From Galilee through Samaria He didn't preach And he didn't teach He used a different kind of language that had just as much power to reveal God as preaching and teaching, so it was Jesus answering questions, and it was Jesus around a supper table and sitting around a fire and walking along the way, mostly telling stories, many of them parables, none of them patently religious. He talked about farmers and fields and coins and sheep and wayward sons. He talked about life. No God talk at all, though. It was all revealing God. Part of the reason he talked this way in the context of these conversations through Samaria was to prepare his disciples. Part of it was for the disciples themselves and to teach them something all of us need to learn, and that is this, how to connect the ordinariness of your lives into conscious awareness of and participation in the kingdom of God and how it's in everything. thing. Because sometimes we separate without even knowing that we do it. We separate kind of our spiritual life from our actual life. And when we start talking about our spiritual life, you know, the tone of your voice changes. And if yours doesn't, you've been around that kind of people, and all of a sudden it gets lofty and the language is misty, a little unreal, and disconnected from what's real and religious language, spiritualizing God talk just inflames all of that. And in some ways, cements all of that and is a primary indicator that you are actually probably disconnected yourself from the real. I kind of want to say it this way. Could we just talk regular? It was supposed to be funnier. Anyway. But there's another reason that Jesus talked this way. He used this other language, not preaching or teaching, because the other reason he did this was because of the Samaritans, which you've already made clear. The Samaritans, through whose world he was walking, in whose world, at least for a period of time here, from Sunday to Sunday, he was living. And Samaritan, says Eugene Peterson, then and now, and I'm quoting him here, have centuries of well-developed indifference, if not outright aversion to our God language, at least the kind used by synagogue and church people. They have their own ideas on God and how to run their lives and nothing but cool contempt for the messianic opinions of outsiders. Samaritans are well defended against the intrusions of God language into their affairs, particularly when it comes from Jewish or Christian lips. So as Jesus goes through Samaria, he is very restrained in his use of explicit God language. Preaching and teaching are not eliminated, but they do recede to the margins. Jesus circles round his listeners' defenses. He tells parables. And one of the first, indeed, it is the first on the journey through Samaria. Now, it's not the first parable he tells in Luke. I did that once a week, don't I? And it's always a service. What's the matter with you? Anyway, it's not the first parable he tells in Luke, But this is the first parable he tells after they've left Jerusalem and they're just getting into Samaria. And this kind of just makes me smile. It's why I picked this. Because ironically, this first parable in Samaria still involves a preacher-teacher type, someone who is full of God language and really knew the text. This guy approaches Jesus, it says, to test him to see if Jesus knows the text, to literally determine if he's Orthodox or if he's not, if he's a heretic, or if he's not, if he's in, or if he's out, he's called a lawyer. In Luke 10, 25, let's read the verse on the screen. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and put Jesus to the test. But this law, he's being identified professionally with. There's obviously not secular law. He's called a lawyer. it's God's law, that he is a lawyer of the law of Moses and Torah. So an accurate rendering of him being a lawyer would be he is a religious professor, possibly, a Bible scholar, possibly, whose primary responsibility was to defend the law of God, to rightly interpret the law of God, something that these ignorant Samaritans, which is where we are right now, would never do, could never do. so he's going to kind of maybe even protect them. See, because these Samaritans will fall for anything, would be his belief and concern. They'd probably watch Oprah. But not me, not me, would this guy be saying to himself. So I will help these Samaritans discern whether this guy, Jesus, is kosher or not, though they would care, saying to Jesus, Teacher, verse 25, or Rabbi, What shall I do to inherit eternal life? Dial into this, because you need to know this question he's asking isn't a question he wanted to know the answer to. This is very important. This guy knew the answer to that question. What he wanted to know, he's testing Jesus to see if he's okay. He wanted to know if Jesus knew the answer, and Jesus said to him, in classic rabbinic style that we've been studying the last couple of weeks, answering his question with another question, Jesus begins to turn the table, saying, verse 26, well, what's written in the law? I mean, you're the Bible guy. How does it read to you? And the lawyer answered and said, verse 27, you shall love the Lord your God with all your hearts, with all your soul, with all your strength, with all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself. This lawyer gave Jesus chapter and verse, directly quoting, not just Leviticus 19, 18, but Deuteronomy 6, verse 5, stuck both those verses together, so he got the answer right, which is what Bible guys do, which isn't bad, but the key is not just to hear the word and know the word, which the Bible guy did, it's to do the word, which is what Jesus says next, verse 26, when a lawyer says love God and love people, Jesus says do this and live. and sensing a trap and wanting to justify himself, it says in verse 29, because he knew so well that Jesus knew, and so did, by the way, all of the Samaritans who were gathered around this scene and watching this thing unfold, they all knew that as a good Jew, one of the things he would do to prove he was a good Jew would be that he would not have anything to do with a Samaritan. he wouldn't consider a Samaritan a neighbor or a friend and so he asks partly to justify himself and partly to see what Jesus would say and maybe trap himself who is my neighbor and it's at that point Jesus shifts the whole language stops talking religious God talk and arguing over the text he tells a story, a parable. Indeed, it's again the first one on this journey from Galilee to Jerusalem through Samaria. And I don't know if you know what the parable is, but it's just fascinating with this kind of setup. It's the parable of the Good Samaritan. That's the first one he tells in Samaria, where the two Bible guys, if you remember the parable, the priest and the Levite, who are just like this lawyer guy and would have undoubtedly, just like the lawyer guy, gotten the answer right. If Jesus would have asked the priest and the Levite what is written in the law, both the priest and the Levite, like the lawyer, would have been able to quote Leviticus 18, Deuteronomy 6, love the Lord your God with all your might and strength and soul and your neighbor as yourself. But in the story Jesus tells, the Bible guys, priests and Levites, walk right by. The man who had been beaten and robbed and left for dead, the man who needed a neighbor to act like a neighbor. I mean, this guy beaten up and left for dead naked there dying didn't need to be loved. Just a little compassion would do. Which, by the way, this is fascinating to me, especially since we just kind of came out of the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus was teaching. Here he's telling a story. But this story is a powerful picture in the form of a story of the teaching Jesus gave in the Sermon on the Mount, The final word he gave, we dealt with it just a few weeks ago, Matthew 7, 26, about people who hear the words of God and know the words of God, but do not do them, being like people who build their house, their lives upon sand. Because that kind of life, where you know the word, but you don't do the word, is going down. That is going down, and great will the fall be. But the Samaritan, in the story Jesus is telling, Because after the priest and the Levite who've heard the words and know the words, didn't do the words, this Samaritan who neither knows the words of God nor has ever heard the words of God, he just does the words of God by loving his neighbor and binding the wounds of this Jewish man, actually, which makes the story even more interesting. And this is, again, one of those reversal themes I talked about last week because it raises this question. so, so, who's the good guy? Who's the bad guy? Who's in? Who's out? Who is orthodox and who is not? Who passes the test and who doesn't? And he does it with story, with language that the lawyer guy might have resented, but the Samaritans understood. And all of them got saved. No, no. I mean, there's no indication. of that. But something's happening through this kind of language that hadn't happened before a door is open. A dialogue has begun. And if you're a Samaritan listening to this story where the Bible guys are the bad guys and the Samaritans who are always the bad guys are the good, if you're a Samaritan, you're going, this is the first Jew I've ever seen or Christian I've ever seen who doesn't automatically think we're the bad guys. Maybe I'll listen to him. It's fascinating. As I was putting this thing together in my mind, I thought of a guy in our day who speaks this third language of Jesus. Now, he can preach and he can teach, but he just somehow knows this language of Jesus. He's able to talk about God without God talk, as he does it as well as anybody I know in our day. His name is Rob Bell. who in certain circles is very controversial. In fact, at the beginning of this series of Jesus is a Rabbi, I told all of you some of the books that I've been reading and references I've had to kind of give some research. And there were several, but one was Rob Bell and a few people left our church because I actually read that guy. So anyway, he's like a bad guy. And if you're the theology police, you won't like him. But guess, while some theology police are all over this guy, guess who listens to this guy, Rob Bell? Samaritans. They understand him. And his speech is revelatory of the kingdom of God. Who understands you? Anybody? Anybody? But, you know, your little, very small neighborhood? Well, to all of that, add this, that as Jesus continues to walk through Samaria on his way to Jerusalem, he continues to use it as his primary language, not preaching or teaching, but this telling of the simple story. In casual conversation, very little God talk at all, even though the end was near. What do you mean? Well, the crucifixion and the resurrection is where he's going as he's going to Jerusalem, so there's not much time left, which means that this is the last time. The Samaritans are going to see or hear Jesus, so why in the world is he still telling these unpretentious stories about farmers and fields and coins and sheep? Why isn't he preaching the clear word of God, calling the Samaritans to repentance in biblical language? Indeed, as the end approaches and Jesus gets closer to Jerusalem, his language becomes even less direct and more relaxed, even more conversational. Instead of high decibel rhetoric, which we in the church often engage in, pressing hard for decisions before it's too late, he hardly, if at all, even mentions the name of God, choosing instead to speak of neighbors and friends, losing a lamb in the courtesies of hospitality, none of which means that decisions don't need to be made before it's too late. They do. Or that Jesus in some way was unconcerned about the lostness of the Samaritans. He was. But it does mean this, I think, that the power of the Holy Spirit can be as present and as active in normal conversation using ordinary words as in preaching and teaching using chapter and verse. Let me ask it. Again, is it possible to give witness to Jesus in ways that really do reveal Jesus without using his name? Can we convey, can we communicate deep trust in God without saying, I'm just trusting the Lord? Is it possible to praise with an exclamation or a gesture that didn't use the words praise the Lord, but was in fact in the company of angels singing holy, holy, holy. If you couldn't use God talk. I mean, if you like the equivalent of tying your hands behind your back, you couldn't do it. But like Jesus, you were full of God's life and full of God's truth. Would there be enough of that life in you for anyone to notice it, for anyone to hear the good news of the gospel of the kingdom? But you couldn't use God talk. You'd have to use this third language that Jesus was fluent in. Can we talk about God in ways that are revelatory without God talk, without religious language, without chapter and verse? Because while preaching and teaching always have and always will have a place of centrality among the people of God, some of us have much to learn about conversations in Samaria. But the good news is this. Even if you are not very good at this, that like always, our teacher in this is Jesus. And he will show us how if we pay attention. Why don't you stand with me as we close. for all the ways Jesus that we have devoted ourselves to follow you and all of the ways in that following that we've had to admit that we're not doing very well right now we just and I just want to say we want to follow you well here as well as people who are a people of the book and that is who we are learning how to move through Samaria in language that everybody can find access to life in the kingdom of God through. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
