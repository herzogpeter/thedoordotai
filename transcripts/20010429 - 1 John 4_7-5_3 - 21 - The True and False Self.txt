These past months we've wondered together and pondered together at many of the Apostle John's words in 1 John to us. And Dave has been camping very specifically on the call to love that came to us through 1 John, particularly in chapter 4. Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. This is love. Not that we love God, but that he loved us. No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. Davis talked a lot about disordered love versus rightly ordered love, and two weeks ago, Dave preached on the importance of our being a people who can recognize in others the image of God stamped upon their souls. And last week, Dave took the issue deeper. And he told us that we find it so difficult to see that image in ourselves, and it makes it really hard then to see it in others. And we need to be able to recognize it within ourselves first and to see God rightly first. And the problem, as Dave pointed out last week, is that we have a false self, a mask made up of the qualities that we want other people to think are true about us, a person that we create so that we are protected and well thought of. I'm going to talk a bit about the false self tonight, so even if you weren't here to hear Dave last week, you'll be able to come up to speed. But mostly, I have the great delight of talking about the true self. But I can remember well a time in my life when I first started to hit my false self in a really distinct way. It was many years ago, and I'd had a really difficult summer, and I had all kinds of things pressing in on my character. All kinds of little things were blowing up in my life left and right, and I was not looking too good. I was looking pretty broken, both to people who were safe in my life and to people who were unsafe. It was not a good time. I was unable to publicly present a mask of calmness and control, wisdom, the person that I desperately wanted to be. And one day I was out on the front steps of my apartment building, kind of stewing, kind of thinking about things. And I had one of those rare, clear, very direct conversations with God that I have every so often. And I sat there and I heard in my spirit God say to me, do you know why you're so upset? And I said, no, tell me. And I heard the spirit of God say in a very gentle way, you're acting as weak as you are and you can't stand it. And I said, that's it, that's right. And it got me to thinking, if I really am a weak person, And why is it not okay to look that way sometimes? Or why do I have to be this other person? And for once, I quit trying to reassemble the shattered pieces of my mask, as Dave talked about last week. And I started instead a journey of knowing God more intimately through knowing the intricacies of my false self. Brendan Manning had just published his wonderful book, Abba's Child, and I devoured it. And in the pages of that book, I started to learn about the imposter, the persona that we create to help us cope, to feel good about ourselves, to just do life. Some of the things I've learned is that identity is the foundation of our journey with God. It is the very bedrock of our spiritual lives. Because the spiritual life always begins with who we are, never begins with what we do. And each of us possesses two basic selves, a false self and a true self. And these identities are tied to the kinds of relationships we have in life, human-centered relationships and God-centered relationships. And as Dave said last week, our false self emerges because we have internalized certain messages about ourselves from culture, family, all kinds of voices. And they boil down to two distinct ideas, That we are irredeemably defective and we have to earn love in order to get love. And the false self is a wounded identity that believes these ideas are its core truth. Paul speaks of the false self in scripture. He identifies it as the old self. I like the term false self because I think it gives the idea of a mask and old sort of intimates done with. We're not powerful anymore. And I'm going to have a couple scriptures come up on the screen. There we go. The first one's from Colossians 3, just to kind of give a biblical basis for what I'm talking about here. Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, greed, which is idolatry. Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. You used to walk in these ways in the life you once lived. But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these, anger, rage, malice, slander, filthy language from your lips. do not lie to each other since you have taken off your old self with its practices and have put on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its creator. The second one is from Ephesians. This one I like very much. You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires to be made new in the attitude of your minds, and I love this last line, and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. I want you to notice that in both of these biblical passages, Paul is not urging non-Christians to put on a new self, but believers who have carried into their new life with God a sanitized old man, rather than fully embracing the glory of the new creation, the true self. I'm going to say a few things about the true self, and I want to throw out a disclaimer. I want you to pay attention to your reactions as I'm talking about these things, because one thing I've noticed about talking about the true self is that it doesn't always like it to be exposed. It doesn't like you to talk about itself. And some of you may find yourself making lists of people that you wish were here to hear this message on the false self. Because they really need it, boy. I think the other reaction is to just become uncomfortable and distracted. And to suddenly think that the bulletin is Pulitzer Prize winning material that should be read right now. So I encourage you to pay attention because when I talk about the true self, I am talking about you. Not your spouse or your friend or your neighbor. I'm talking about you. And I'm talking about me. And some of us need to come out of hiding. Now last week Dave talked about two identities that arise out of this false self system, the performing self and the degraded self. Just to review the performing false self, here's the negative messages, irredeemably defective, got to earn love, and it decides to prove them wrong by creating a competent self that runs around, very busy performing and clothing itself with all its great behavior so everyone likes it. The God the performer images is a judging God who keeps score of the performer's activities. The degraded self, on the other hand, hears those same negative messages, and just internalizes them completely. Doesn't try to fight them. Wears them, so to speak. And its own defectiveness is who it is. And it images a judging God who condemns. The gavel comes down every time, and the verdict is the same, guilty. The false self is an illusion. It's not real. It's driven towards all these outward emblems of security and steam and power so that it at least has some sense of realness, makes itself feel real. and scripture speaks to this dynamic I think Luke 13 Jesus talks about the people who align themselves with the Messiah but do not enter the narrow door quoting from that passage once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door you will stand outside knocking and pleading sir open the door for us but he will answer I don't know you or where you come from then you will say well we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets but he will reply, I don't know you or where you come from. Question to ask is why couldn't the owner of the house, who is clearly Jesus, not recognize people who so clearly recognized him? For me, part of that answer has to be because when we are in a false self, Jesus cannot acknowledge us because we are trying to be someone who doesn't exist. Ultimately, the false self wants to not need God or to be good apart from God. The self always seeks a source of life other than God, which the Lord confronts in Jeremiah 2. My people have committed two sins. They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water. The false self seeks to draw its life from false wells. It seeks to get life from people and things that aren't capable of giving it. The false self is an idolater. And we all struggle with the false self. People pat us on the back and praise us, and we feel whole and we feel competent. And then the next day the rug gets pulled out from under us, and we wander around the emotional ruins of our lives, utterly depressed and filled with self-hatred. Most Christians spend their whole lives just bouncing around and orbiting around inside the false self, never breaking out or rarely. When we're in that place, we can't love ourselves well, much less love others with the love of Christ. because we can't see God rightly. And year after year, so many among us are caught in this cycle. And we might go to church, and we might read all kinds of books on the spiritual life, go to lots of Bible studies, but if we're really honest, we would probably have to say that something is missing. You ever feel that way? Ever feel like maybe there's this spiritual glass ceiling? and that other people have fullness. Other Christians might have abundant life somewhere, but not you. I know what that feels like. And it feels like frustration and despair and hopelessness. And our solution to our problem is usually more of the same, more church, more conferences, join more ministry groups, all that's all right. but it doesn't solve anything. And trying to use behaviors to fix this problem anyway is like rearranging the deck furniture on the Titanic. We don't need more behaviors. The false self loves the behavioral fix. What we need is much deeper. It's much more important, and it's much more precious. We need to change direction. We need to change our minds about who we are. We need to forsake the false self and allow God to call out who we really are, our true self. And if you are in Christ, you have a true self, a self God thought up at the foundations of the world, a self he fashioned and loves forever, and this true self is closer than your next breath. as near to you as Jesus is at this very moment. The true self is Christ dwelling within us. The personhood expressed from Christ in me, the loving union of the Spirit of God and the human soul. And the core of this self's existence can be easily summed up. The life of the true self is bound up in giving and receiving the love of God. In fact, the true self has no life, no reality, no existence outside of the love of God. And Thomas Merton says, there is no spiritual life outside the love of Christ. We have a spiritual life only because we are loved by him. So when the love of God is received in authentic ways, our true self is called out. And unlike the false self, which is an initiated self created by our woundedness, our true self is a received self. You don't have to figure it out. You don't have to do a bunch of behaviors to call it into being. It's a restful place. Our true self, simply put, is in residence any time we are authentically giving or receiving the love of God. and that seems easy doesn't it? maybe not I think the problem is we have a split between our head and our heart we know plenty about God and his love but we experience it so little in our hearts, our experiential selves we also have little idea of how to receive it's not always modeled to us but in order to have the true self called out we do need to authentically receive, authentically experience the love of God in all that we are. And one of the most distressing things to me about contemporary discipleship is that this type of true self is called out. Love God, love other people, but it seems to be divorced from a foundation of receiving the love of God first. You know, and I grew up in the church, and I went to Christian college, and I teach at a Christian college. But I can probably count on one hand the number of sermons I have heard on receiving the love of God in my life. And whenever we attempt to love God and others, apart from that foundation of the received love of God, we're just placing heavy burdens upon ourselves. And if there's no true self-love of God to give away, then guess who steps in? The false self takes over. So we must take seriously this call to receive the love of God. It is a much needed spiritual discipline. We tend to think of making time just to be in God's love, to soak in the presence. It's something kind of fluffy, peripheral. It's kind of out on the edge there somewhere. Serious disciples don't take that kind of approach. Well, that's how the false self sees it. And it simply isn't true. The true self exists as a response to love received. And when we receive this love, it opens up a life of worship. And I don't just mean ascribing worth to God, because that's too limiting, wonderful as it is. The true self lives to worship, to see God everywhere, and to love him everywhere. And within that, as Bruce Balgard pointed out last month, to bow and to serve. and loving God back not just as a should or a have to but loving God back freely because it's now part of your spiritual DNA has great value the true self is the self in love the self lost in intimate attraction with Jesus and I encourage you to expand your mind and think about how does God see this return of love from us has it ever occurred to you that your freely loving God and others in the personhood that he himself created has great value to him that just as a child's best scrawls with a crayon on paper are of an estimable value to the parent because they're drawn with love that even your feeble attempts at genuine love have sway and are treasured in the heart of God I think he wants us to know that in his wonderful book Life of the Beloved Henry Nowen says the unfathomable mystery of God is that God is a lover who wants to be loved there is a holy beauty in living in and loving God back and this is the true self's life a life completely identified with the love of God and which has no sense of itself apart from that love in fact so central is this love to our core identity that Brennan Manning points out that the apostle John always refers to himself in his gospel as quote the disciple Jesus loves and I'm quoting from Brennan from Abba's Child if John were to be asked what is your primary identity your most coherent sense of yourself. He would not reply, I am a disciple, an apostle, an evangelist, but I am the one Jesus loves. And when, like John, we have experienced Jesus' love through real and intimate connection, we are translated. And we can move from seeing ourselves as a shifting collection of roles and behaviors to a people more and more completely anchored in and identified with the love of God. Let me say all this another way. The love of God is who you are. Did you hear that? The love of God is who you are. the compassion of Christ is the only solid identity the only objectively real identity you will ever walk in ever that's who we are when we receive the love of Jesus it is our true self and then we are the beloved and we get to stop racing around trying to build self-definitions and build ourselves up with all kinds of things that are just rust and illusion. The love God freely gives you is your identity. And we must dare to believe that this is who we are. We must be brave enough to consent, to contradict the numerous voices in our lives that would align our personhood with wounds and performance. and place ourselves inside the love of God. Spiritual life begins with identity. It's bedrock. So our response to this issue is crucial. And Henry Nouwen points out that our belovedness is a fact. It is our identity, but we also must become the beloved. It's a process. our belovedness can't remain just a magnificent idea that we pull out on rainy days to keep ourselves from getting sad and depressed it must also be a sacred encounter in our daily lives and this happens little by little and more and more but it is through living in our true self in the love of God that the distorted images we have of God in ourselves begin to find deep healing because you cannot heal how you see God. You can't do enough spiritual and mental gymnastics. We can only receive his love and then be changed. And it's in this giving and receiving of love that the wholeness of our souls comes. Because healing is not something God does. It's who he is. Healing is who God is. And to open our awareness to God and to walk in the presence of God is to bring healing as close as our next breath. And as I begin to journey with God into my middle years, I hate to say that, I realize that who I am and what I do has got to begin with the reception of God's love. And I need to treat this receiving as the serious discipline that it is and make room for it in my spiritual practices. Because when I don't, I notice a hollowness in what I am giving to others, even if I am, quote, unquote, accomplishing more. Henry Nouwen says, The greatest gift I have to offer is my own joy, my own inner peace, my own silence and solitude, my own well-being. And I hear those words, and they sound like another language in a culture, and I mean a Christian culture, where productivity is the mark of spiritual stature and maturity. Through letting ourselves be loved by God and loving him back, there is presence, capital P, in our presence. There is no greater offering that we can bring to life and to ministry than this. And the world is dying for lack of it. One morning last June, I was going about having my morning devotional time with God. My practice is typically I worship a little and then listen to scriptures, maybe intercede for people and myself, do some centering prayer. Well, this particular morning I programmed two different worship songs. And just was listening to this. And I don't know what happened because I was not feeling particularly spiritual. but God showed up in kind of a significant way and I was listening to the second song and I was singing along, I could sing of your love forever and I was completely, absolutely absorbed in God's loving presence. I was amazed. And the song ended and I just sat there in stillness completely immersed in the Lord. And then my false self sent a little telegram saying, okay, worship portion is over. Shouldn't you move ahead with your little program here? And I just waved it away like a gnat because I was simply sitting in the presence of God, loving him and receiving him. And it was incredibly sweet and intimate. And later I thought about how countercultural it is to just sit, To just receive. To just be. And to have that being be my identity. And I thought about something Thomas Merton had said. He's talking about prayer, but you can really expand it to the whole spiritual journey. I want you to hear his words. We were indoctrinated so much into means and ends that we don't realize there is a different dimension in the life of prayer. in technology you have this horizontal progress where you must start at one point move to another and then another that is not the way to build a life of prayer in prayer we discover what we already have and you realize that you are already there we already have everything but we don't know it and we don't experience it. Everything has been given to us in Christ. All we need is to experience what we already possess. The trouble is, Merton concludes, we aren't taking the time to do so. You will never have more Jesus than you do at this moment. Do you know this? If you are in Christ, you are already at your final destination. There is no place else to go, no way to perfect the reality that already lies within you. There is no progress. No point A to point B because there is no point B. There is only point A and more of point A and more of point A, which is to say there is only Jesus and more of Jesus and more of Jesus. Until his presence envelops us more and more in our daily consciousness and we receive love and we love others rightly. This series on love we've been in in 1 John since late January, it's drawing to a close. And it's more or less culminated with Dave talking about the false self and then concluding that with the true self this week. And you could lead these two sermons fixated on avoiding your false self, focusing on being a good true self person, maybe trying to figure it all out or doing some sort of true self rain dance so that call it into being, bring it on. And if you do this, you would probably just end up with a nicer false self. Still a counterfeit. We need to not be true self-focused. We need to be God-focused. To use Leanne Payne's language, we need to stand straight up into who we are in Christ and let Jesus alone be our vision. Hebrews says, let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith. C.S. Lewis gives us great wisdom here. He says your real new self will not come as long as you are looking for it. It will come when you are looking for him. As true self-emerging persons, we must seek God. Not a true self or even a healed self. But inasmuch as we seek him, we will find our true selves. And we will walk more and more in his presence. Brothers and sisters, here is what I know. To live and move in the true self is the closest to heaven we can come here on earth. And the kingdom of God is composed of such persons, both above and below. True self-emerging people are kingdom people. As Dave stressed last week with Philippians 3, even those of us who want to live this way haven't arrived, but we do press on. the life of Christ in me is a life of continuous transformation I always like to say our souls are converted all at once and the rest of us takes a lifetime I have days where if I'm in my true self for five minutes I think I'm doing well but failure is an illusion and I know what I want to move towards I know what the trajectory of my life is what the desires of my heart are and it's to be a true self-emerging person, the beloved of Christ, and not just to know that identity cognitively, because I think we all do, but to have it become a real and working reality in our daily life. I want to be part of a kingdom church where all who bear the image of God upon their souls are authentically loved. And I hope you want that too. This is the vision of our church. Till Christ be formed in you. And to enter into this means to see ourselves rightly and to see God rightly because everything flows from that foundation. Everything. Receiving the gift of Christ in me begins with coming into the presence. Last week Dave asked, what are you in? And I'm going to ask the same question. What are you in? Are you caught on the hamster wheel of endless need to perform? Tired, maybe, of hiding yourself in a homemade competence? It's not working anymore? Or maybe you're stuck in a degraded swamp of self-loathing and guilt, feeling hopeless and alone. Because if you are, I have really, really good news for you. There's a safe place for you to go. The love of Jesus is your true home. And you can go there. You can go there. So we are going to make time to receive this gift of our true self. Many among us have been deeply wounded, find coming into the presence difficult, scary. But I invite you to come as you are able since our deepest healing will always originate in the presence of God. I'm also mindful that there might be some people here today that may not know Jesus. And if that's true of you, and if something is maybe stirred around this talk of true self, false self, then I invite you to ask Jesus in. Offer him ownership of your life. Ask him to call out who you really are, your true self. We're going to open up a time of prayer and ministry, and I invite you to enter in, to use this space that we're creating, to bring to the Lord yourself, your whole self, with all of your fears and your inconsistencies and your lukewarmness, because whatever place you're at is the right place to pray from, because that's where Jesus is. Bring all that you are into the presence and open your awareness. Open your awareness to the God whose love is who you really, really are, both now and forever. I'm going to pray a prayer of repentance around our false selves, and then pray for Jesus to come and call out our true self by receiving him and coming into his loving presence. After I pray, I'm going to read some paraphrased verses that Henry Nouwen put together. and Ashley's going to sing over us. And I invite you to just be in the Lord's presence, to just receive from him as this time unfolds. So please pray with me. Jesus, we ask you to call into the light of your love and mercy, our false self. Show us the false person we've created out of our woundedness. A self that has clung to external forms of security, esteem, and power instead of finding its identity in you. Lord, we invite you to show us specifically the false wells we have gone to as our source of life. I encourage you as you sit to just let things come up and take them to the Lord as they do. Jesus, we repent of the false self, the woundedness and the performance that we have allowed to define us. the places we have gone to for life that are not you. And we leave our false self at the foot of your cross of forgiveness. Help us to forsake the false self in our lives and in our practices. Jesus, we acknowledge that you are here, closer than our next breath, closer to us than we are to ourselves. Father God, help us to open to your love, to receive you, even if we don't have a clue how to do that. Jesus, we declare that your love is our true self. Bring the Father's love to us now. Let it surround us. Rest upon us. Holy Spirit, we ask you to come. Call out who we really are. We are the beloved. Help that sink deep into our hearts, Lord. Let these words that I'm going to read kind of wash over you and call out to your true self. Let them call you home. Let them call you home. I have called you by name from the very beginning. You are mine and I am yours. You are my beloved. On you, my favor rests. I have molded you in the depths of the earth and knitted you together in your mother's womb. I have carved you in the palms of my hands and hidden you in the shadow of my embrace. I look at you with infinite tenderness and care for you with a care more intimate than that of a mother for her child. I have counted every hair on your head and guided you at every step. Wherever you go, I go with you. And wherever you rest, I keep watch. I will give you food that will satisfy all your hunger and drink that will quench all your thirst. I will not hide my face from you. You know me as your own, and I know you as my own. You belong to me. Nothing will ever separate us. We are one. My Jesus, I love Thee. I know how I die for Thee. All the flowers of sin I desire. My gracious Redeemer, My Savior, our God If ever I love Thee My Jesus is now I love thee because thou hast first loved me And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree I love Thee for wearing the thorns of Thy brow If ever I love Thee, my Jesus, tis now. Won't you wrap your arms of love around me? Wrap your arms of love around me. Wrap your arms of love around me. Write your arms of love. I sing a simple song of love To my Savior To my Jesus I'm grateful for the things you've done My loving Savior Oh precious Jesus My heart is glad that you called me your own And there's no place I'd rather be Than in your arms of love In your arms of love And you're holding me still Holding me near In your arms of love I sing a simple song of love To my Savior To my Jesus I'm grateful for the things you've done For my running Savior Oh precious Jesus My heart is burned That you call me your own And there's no place I'd rather be Than in your eyes of love In your eyes of love You're holding me still You're holding me near In your arms of love. I'm going to give the benediction. But many of you may need to just sit a bit and just continue to receive whatever God's doing in you or dialoguing with you about. And if you would like someone to pray with you about maybe something that's stirred in the service or any other need, there's going to be prayer ministers out front here to pray with you. But otherwise, as you leave, please be mindful of the holy space that God has created here. receive the benediction. This is the message you heard from the beginning. We should love one another. Dear friends, let us love one another. For love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. This is love. Not that we love God, but that he loved us. No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us. And his love is made complete in us. Lord Jesus, accomplish this in us and among us. as we gratefully receive your love and your mercy and your grace. Amen.
