Matthew 24, verse 1. Entering into a very significant, exciting section of Scripture. Let me set the stage for you and remind you just a little bit of where we are contextually. It is the final week in the life of Christ. I think we were mostly aware of that. Most of us were. Only two days before the crucifixion, Jesus has just... Jesus has, I think I should start over. He has completed his confrontation on the Pharisees in chapter 23. Leaving then the temple, we pick up the drama in chapter 24, verse 1. And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away when his disciples came up to point out the temple buildings to him. And he answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone here shall be left upon another, which will not be torn down. And that was a reference to the destruction of the temple, which did indeed happen in 70 A.D. And as it was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age? And Jesus answered and said to them, See to it that no one misleads you, for many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will mislead many. And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end. For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom in various places. There will be famines and earthquakes, but all of these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs and not the end. Then they will deliver you to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations on account of my name. And at that time, many will fall away and will deliver up one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. And because lawlessness is increased, most people's love will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end, he shall be saved. Let's pray as we begin. Jesus, first of all, I pray for the work of your Spirit here in a way that would make clear to us what your heartbeat for these issues are. As we deal with issues of the end times, many of us are mindful of debate that moves on through the church and sometimes even causes us to divide from one another. And Father, we pray that by your Spirit, as we go through the text, that we would hear the word from you in a clear way that would cut through the things that do not matter and allow to have the truth that does indeed have to have bearing on our life, that it would indeed land on us. I pray that this would be done by the work of your Spirit. In Jesus' name, amen. There are a few topics that generate more interest and also more heat among Christians than does the topic of eschatology. Eschatology is a word that comes from the Greek eschatos, or last things, the study of the last days. What on earth is going to happen? Having grown up in an evangelical church, I have been exposed to just about all the theories, all of the theologies, all of the prophetic fads that kind of came down the pike throughout the years, at least in my days. I vividly recall as a young boy, prophecy conferences, especially when I was a young boy and into my teens, it was almost the rage of the church to be doing those kinds of things. And at those conferences, all of the possibilities for the apocalypse were discussed. And all of the ways in which it was going to happen was being brought forth to people. Terms like pre-tribulation rapture, millennialism, pre-millennialism, post-millennialism, amillennialism were part of the vocabulary of this nine-year-old boy and I even thought it was normal. Some of the talk of prophecy and end times things wowed me. We would hear these stories and prophecies and hear it all tied into things that happened yesterday and we would just be, wow. Some of the things I heard confused me, to be honest with you. Most of it frightened me. If we would have a week of prophetic meetings dealing with the end times in our church, I could be counted on accepting Jesus every time we'd have the meeting. Hoping every time that he'd come in this time. And I hope you came in this time, because I don't want to get left. I wish we'd all been ready. And on and on and on. The whole issue of end times theology, it was an issue over which I saw many Christians willing, even eager to divide depending on what your viewpoint was, if it wasn't quite the same as mine. We saw that as a matter of paramount importance. In my circle of evangelical experience, if you were not a pre-tribulation person, that was tantamount to being a communist. Pretty serious stuff. Again, growing up, there was, in my experience, a constant run of people who were predicting the times, pulling out wonderful charts with elaborate detail, and we sat with our mouths open, believing it all and thinking this must be it. Someone was always discovering who the Antichrist really was. I still get chills when I hear the name Henry Kissinger. It's just... Whoa. I remember in high school, even before that, there was a theory going around that it was John Kennedy. And, you know, the Antichrist was supposed to recover from a head wound. And most of you don't know this, but the eighth floor of a hospital in Dallas, he's still there. Wow. You know. Latest one is that he's Gorbachev and he's got the sign of the beast on his forehead already. It's been interesting. I didn't know this about Jeff until just this week we got into this issue, and he's writing another book, and behind the scenes he's been doing research, and he has identified who the Antichrist really is, Jeff Van Vonderen has. It's Elvis. I've been waiting all week for that. He's got a little bumper sticker on his van that says, Elvis lives. You know, I pressed him on this. He looked at me. I was coming at him with some skepticism. And he says, yeah? Well, they call him the king. See, he grew up out of the same background I did with a lot of hysteria and a lot of predicting. And it had somewhat the same effect on him that it had on me. And that is to take this whole issue of end times and bring to it some discredit. It's desensitized us somewhat to the whole issue. caused us to treat it with some measure of disregard. To be honest with you, I don't have a lot of time for or patience with people who, what I call, do eschatological navel-gazing. It's just this incredible, you know, preoccupation. Is this it? I wonder, you know. I don't know. I don't know. I still don't know after I've studied all this. I don't know. But the fact is this. As I did come to chapter 24, I was brought back a little bit. and forced by the text to consider the possibility that there might be something between an unhealthy preoccupation with these things and an unhealthy disregard of these things, that somewhere there really is a biblically sound and theologically balanced position that we can move into. I am confronted with the text with the reality that this issue of end times things is significant enough for Jesus to sit down with the disciples just days before his death to give them some instruction, some warning for their own preparation as individuals. It is significant enough to be the major theme of books like Daniel, Ezekiel, major portions of Isaiah and Zechariah, and the entire book of the Revelation. Because of that, it is also significant enough for us to be carefully considering what these issues mean for us. But, and let me state this very clearly, which will be the theme for our entire study over these next weeks, We need to be carefully understanding them, not so that we can spend our life speculating, looking for signs, and trying to predict a schedule, but so that we can, with some sense of urgency, see again, affirmed in these passages, something that we affirm every Sunday from this pulpit, and that is this. We desperately need Jesus. Our only hope is Him. And that we need to hear the word from this, saying this. We need to hang on to Jesus for dear life, for our whole life, no matter what age we find ourselves in. That will clearly be the message of this text and the texts that will go through chapter 25. But the only way I know how to be balanced on this and come to any sense of truth is not to be spending a lot of time discovering everybody's theology and examining it. Our only way to get balanced, at least mine, is to deal with the text. Let's get to the text and begin to wade through it. We will do that now. In verse 1, I want to give you the picture. Jesus has just said something to the disciples that has been for them somewhat cryptic. It is a little bit haunting and somewhat prophetic. Verse 38, sitting in the temple, his last words to them is this, Behold, your house is being left to you a desolate place. Then somewhat prophetic, verse 39, But I say to you, from now on, you shall not see me until you say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. That is somewhat prophetic. That's big. the coming of the Lord, the full presence of God. And after he said that and those words were in the disciples' ears, they came out of the temple. They went probably down the backside of the temple mount, crossed the little Kidron Valley, began to ascend the Mount of Olives, which was right next to that. It is the end of the day. The sun is probably setting. As they were ascending the Mount of Olives and looking back on Jerusalem and on the temple, it had to be a magnificent sight. And as they were looking at Jerusalem, they pointed out the temple buildings to Jesus. And Jesus, in verse 2, as if to clarify for the disciples what he meant by verse 38, I'm going to leave this house desolate. I'm going to talk to you about desolation. I say to you truly, not one stone here shall be left upon another. I'm talking about spiritually a desolation, but also physically a desolation. Now, for the full weight of that statement to be felt by us, we've got to get visually a picture of the temple. Because this was an incredible thing that Jesus just said. A picture of the temple as it relates to its sheer size. We've done some teaching on what the temple looked like already in the book of Matthew. And as you know, the temple was on top of a mountain. It was surrounded by walls and inside of those walls were various buildings. It wasn't just a temple. It was a temple courtyard, a temple complex or campus, if you will. It looked probably somewhat like a fort. Josephus records that there were stones that made up the wall. Some of those stones were 40 feet by 12 by 12, 100 tons for one stone. There were some stones in there that were 300 feet high, 85 feet long, one stone that large. And all of those stones were cut and quarried and carried to this place on top of this mountain by somebody in some fashion. the western wall of the temple had retaining walls going down the mountain the retaining walls were there to kind of hold the mountain in place but also to have the wall built on top of the retaining wall so the retaining wall on the west wall went way down the mountain and then when the retaining wall came to where the temple was the wall was on top of that and if you sat on top of the wall looking down past not only the wall but down to the retaining the bottom of the retaining wall was like a thousand feet the place was massive visually it spoke of things we have spoken already in weeks past of how spiritually things were communicated by what it looked like but physically there was something else as well it spoke of permanence it spoke of stability it spoke of indestructibility and when Jesus says not one stone left upon another the disciples minds are quick to move into something apocalyptic this is big? What in the world would have a power to move these stones away? This has got to be the end. With that kind of background, that kind of feeling in mind, we move into their question, when will these things be? The question they're asking is twofold. The first thing they're asking is when will these things be? It doesn't take a Bible scholar to figure out what they mean by these things. They're not talking about anything other than what Jesus said. These things meaning when is this going to happen that not one stone will be left upon the other. But then the second part of their question is this, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age? Now work with me on this. Simply because of the gap of history, this event, this question, took place 2,000 years ago. We read that question differently than I think they asked the question. Let me explain. When will these things be, the destruction of the temple? That took place in 70 A.D. And when will be the coming? And when will be the end of the age? Because I know the coming didn't happen at the destruction of the temple, I hear that as two questions. I want to know, number one, when will these things be the destruction of the temple? And when will be your second coming? When will be the end of the age? The disciples would not have had that in view at all. They would have been looking with this question, when will these things be the destruction of the temple? When will be the end of the age? And when will be the fullness of your coming? Meaning, I expect them to all be the same event. And not only that, is it next week or the week after? where do you come up with that let's do some work one of the ways you kind of get a feel for this a picture of this is in the word coming when will your what are the sign what is the sign of your coming the greek word for coming there is parousia it is a compound it is actually two words in the greek para and the verb to be which means to be around to be present literally what they're asking is this jesus what is the sign of your full presence what is the sign of your really being here. When are you going to do the kingdom fully? Again, you got to kick back a little bit into study we've already done in the book of Matthew. And we are aware of something because of what we've studied already in Matthew, that what the disciples anticipated about the coming of the kingdom was that Jesus was going to bring the fullness of the kingdom. Remember that? Every time Jesus said things like this, I must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things and die, Peter and the rest of the disciples said, no, that doesn't fit in the plan because you're supposed to bring in the fullness of the kingdom and the lion will lie down with the lamb and Israel will be restored to prominence and it's all going to happen now. And when they ask again, when will be the end of the age? When will these things be? Suntelea to Aeonios. The full end of man's day. They're not looking down the road like we now would look down the road into the future when they're asking that question. Their question is in their mind one question. When will these things be? The destruction of Jerusalem. the full expression of your presence, the end of the age. They saw that as one event. Is it going to be next week or the week after? Knowing that that is what's in the mind of the disciples, it helps us to understand some of Jesus' answer. Jesus' answer is simply, theologically, the Olivet Discourse. From verse 4 through chapter 25, we are moving into the Olivet Discourse. And all of it is simply Jesus answering the question that we just heard the disciples ask. And his answer is going to be more complex than this as we move down through our weeks of study. But his answer is basically twofold. First of all, disciples, when you ask me about the end of the age and the full presence of the kingdom of God, I know you expect it to be now, but the first thing I want to tell you is this. The full presence and the full end is not yet. I want you to know that. It is not yet. Verse 8. But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pains. Stop right there and let me explain birth pains. It's a wonderful metaphor. It really works. When a woman is giving birth to a child, at the early stages she might have a birth pain. But it means nothing. We don't get alarmed. Later on she might have another one. Again, if they aren't very frequent and aren't very severe, we kind of ignore it. We don't pay much attention to it. It doesn't mean anything. But as those pains begin to be more intense and more frequent and closer together, that's an indicator that something's about to happen. The signs that Jesus is going to give are simply the beginning of the birth pangs. Don't become alarmed. These are going to be normal events. Part of his answer to them is to say, first of all, your eschatology is wrong, disciples. It isn't going to happen now. The full end, the full presence is not yet. But what I do want to do for you, disciples, is not prepare you for the end, but to prepare you for what will be in your life, because Jerusalem will be destroyed in your life. Persecution will happen in your life. Martyrdom will happen in your life. And not only that, disciples, but it will happen in the life of the saints who follow you. The saints who follow you in the early church and in history past that, they will also know persecution, and they will also know martyrdom, and they will also know wars and rumors of wars. And every generation, because of the wars and rumors of wars, including our generation, is going to look at those things and go, this must be it. This is so terrible. It's worse than it's ever been. Do you think that when Jerusalem was destroyed and the hundreds of thousands of people who were slaughtered, one or two people who had any view of prophecy were going, this must be it? Yes. Just like they do today. And they did the generation before us and they will the generation after us. But the word here is this, to them anyway, it is not yet, but I want you to prepare for what will be in your life and in the life of the generation after you and after them and after them and now and after us. and the point disciples that I am giving you these signs for of the birth pains is not so that you can be good predictors of the future I'm not giving you these signs so that you can be good sign watchers I'm giving you these signs so that you can be prepared to appropriately live no matter what age you live in no matter how intense the birth pains are that you in your life will experience, that you in your generation might know. I want you to be prepared, and the way to be prepared is hang on to Jesus. Hang on to the truth. Hang on to the truths of the kingdom and the reality of Jesus and his life in you. And the blood of the Lamb is how they overcame. From verse 4 to 14, with that teaching in the background in terms of what Jesus is trying to accomplish for the disciples, for every generation that followed, And also, however, for the final end, because these verses are going to speak of and to the final end, as well as the disciples' issues and every issue of every generation until the very end, he gives five warnings, five signs to be aware of, five birth pains that do indeed ultimately lead to the end. And every one of them, by the way, has a parallel in Revelation 6. And while these signs are being given to the disciples for their particular situation, they speak through history and culminate in Revelation 6 with exactly the same warnings and we're going to tie those in to see kind of a panorama of history. The first sign is verse 4. See to it that no one misleads you for many will come disciples in your generation and in the generations that follow and they will come in my name saying I am the Christ and will mislead many. See to it. Blepete is the Greek word there and it means this. Keep your eyes open, for many will come again in every age. We just got done with Matthew 23, with the warning by Jesus concerning false spiritual systems. We gave all the characteristics. And one of the things, again, that was affirmed was that those issues of false teachers was not a new thing. It happens in every generation, and it happens in ours. It happened in the disciples' generation, and it happens in ours. And it will happen in the end as well. But all through history, there will be what we can call for the sake of being faithful to the text. antichrists all through history, antichrists who will come and preach a message of hope. You know, the reason they're going to mislead people, it's a false hope that they preach, and the reason they're going to mislead people is because they will look good, they will be very appealing, there will be lots of promises they make, they're going to be a real hero, and they're going to solve everybody's problems. Sometimes these antichrists will rise up in a political arena, sometimes they will rise up in a spiritual arena, but people will be receptive to them because they will function very well and be well-received, especially when people are going through a time of tribulation themselves. Things aren't going well. I'm not having a very, very good success in my life. I'm kind of dried up. And all of a sudden, somebody rides in on a white horse and says, I will solve your problem. Come to Jesus and you get lollipops. It's wonderful. And the history of the church records over and over again the proliferation of charlatans. Somebody who had an angle. Beware. Keep your eyes open. The last thing Paul said to the Ephesian church in Acts chapter 20 was be on the alert. Beware that as soon as I leave from inside the church, grievous wolves will come in from among you every generation. Was this word for the disciples specifically for them? Yes. And also for every generation after them? And also the full expression of that was in the Antichrist or will be in the Antichrist. That's found in Revelation 6, verse 2. The scroll is given to the Lamb in this picture. It's an incredible picture. Some of you are familiar with it in Revelation 5. Remember, they were looking for one who was worthy to break the seals. It was the deed of the world given to the Lamb. And no one was found worthy. And all of a sudden they began to sing, They found one who was worthy. For he had purchased with his blood men from everyone. The deed of the world given to the Lamb. And no one was found worthy. And all of a sudden they began to sing, they found one who was worthy. For he had purchased with his blood men from every nation and every tribe and every tongue. And they began to sing, Worthy is the Lamb who was slain. Worthy is the Lamb who was slain. And the Lamb took the scroll, which was the deed to the world, and he began to break the seals. And the first seal, which was to be broken, was the seal that corresponds with the fourth and fifth verse here. And I saw, John said, a rider on a white horse, and he had a bow without arrows, and he conquers with peace. And this is not just an antichrist throughout history, but the Antichrist now, the culmination of the deceiver. Daniel 8, verse 23 tells us that he will be a medium who will be able to contact demons, and he will, quote, cause deceit to prosper, and by peace, by peace, will destroy many. Daniel 11, 36 says he will accomplish marvelous things and be seen as a solver of problems. He will have an amazing ability to negotiate and reconcile and unite, And while all sorts of tumultuous things are happening around him, he will unite and survive through the whole thing. And on the front end, everybody's going to go, Wow, what a guy! But beyond all that false peace is Satan himself, Revelation 12.9, and all through history, those kind of people will arise. In the end, there will be the fullness of the embodiment of that kind of falseness in the anti-Christ. it's a little hard for me to have been studying the things I've been studying pulling them together with history and current events without at least thinking as it relates to these kinds of things about the events in the world that are going on right now the events in Eastern Europe and as we look at Eastern Europe and the walls coming down and unity happening it's great, it's wonderful, it's terrific and please do not hear me say, I think that means this is it. I don't know if that means that at all. That kind of thing has happened probably at some other times in history. What I know is that it'll look like that. It'll look like that. But it'll be a false peace. It'll be a false peace. It'll be a peace that is really born of the enemy, not at all born of God when the end comes. Read an interesting article yesterday in the news, the Tribune, page 11, section A. So I don't know if these kind of articles are there all the time and I just ignore them. And now that I'm in this, I'm kind of going, wow, yeah. I'm becoming kind of weird myself about this whole thing. This won't last forever. But it was Mondale, Walter Mondale, who was commenting on all the peace and the wonder of what was going on in Eastern Europe. And he was kind of holding himself back a little bit, thinking this sounds good and it's wonderful, but I sense this to be a false peace. and he began to quote things that were going on in the Eastern Bloc and some things that were not as wonderful as it sounded like. And one of the things that caught my eye that he said was that, along with all the other things that make this feel like a false peace to him, is that in Russia, while all this peace stuff is going on, there's a tremendous upsurgence in anti-Semitism in Russia. And if you know anything about biblical prophecy as it relates to Daniel and Ezekiel, there is a tremendous clarity that in the end there will be a moving against Israel. So, again, I'm not saying that to go, this is it. I'm not into that at all. It'll look like that. But Jesus says these things are the beginning of birth pangs. I'm not getting you to try to look for signs. That's going to happen in every generation. There will be false Christ. There will be false peace. There will be false peace. And that's going to happen in every generation. It will happen in your generation, disciples. What I want you to do is be prepared. And the way you're prepared is you hang on to Jesus. don't look for signs don't get all big just just hang on to jesus following the false peace there is war and you'll be hearing of wars that's number two rumors of wars don't be frightened don't be afraid those things must take place but it's not the end it's not the end they're going to take place in every generation disciples and yours nation's going to rise against nation kingdom against kingdom you will be hearing of these things it's a future durative in the greek and it simply means you will continually hear all the time throughout history, throughout all the ages. Again, in the disciples' age, in the age after that, in the age after that, in our age, and in the age to come, there will be wars and rumors of wars. In Revelation 6, it says, in the end, the wars and rumors of wars will be symbolized by not a white horse, but a red horse when the second seal is broken. And war, that false peace, will be exposed as being a false peace, and war will begin to move over the earth. And another thing that happens is famines and earthquakes. Famines and earthquakes, the end of verse 7. Luke adds, not just famines and earthquakes, but pestilence, fearful sights, and signs in the heavens. By the way, if the only way we read this is these are the signs of the end times, we're missing everything Jesus is saying to the disciples, because famines, earthquakes, all happen in the disciples' lives. And it says, at various places, there will be famines and earthquakes. There might be that the disciples never experienced the famine, but sometime in their experience on the earth there were famines and there were earthquakes. But that's in every generation, and in the end it will be intensified because the birth pains are going to be closer together and more intense. But again, Luke adds pestilence to the famines and the earthquakes. Pestilence, Revelation 16, 8, is described as an incurable disease. Literally it says this, They are loathsome and malignant. It doesn't get much more specific than that. Loathsome and malignant. And I just have an idea that when the plagues were moving across Europe and hundreds of thousands of people were dying, anybody who had a handle on Scripture was saying, this is it, this is it, this is what was spoken of in Daniel, this is what was spoken of in Matthew and in Revelation, this incredible plague, look for the coming of the Lord. A few years ago that would have sounded far-fetched to us. Pestilence, incurable disease, Maybe a few years ago we would have thought, well, maybe cancer will run amok. And that will be the parallel of that. And then a couple years ago, AIDS becomes the big thing. I am not saying AIDS is it. Now we're there. I'm not saying that. I'm saying it'll look like that. It's not as far-fetched as we think. Not only pestilence, but Luke adds, again, fearful sights, literally terrorizing happenings. Revelation 9, 1, and 2 describes what those things might look like. well what they are actually. In Revelation 9, 1 and 2 it says the key to the bottomless pit was given to Satan and he opened the bottomless pit and out of the pit came smoke and out of the smoke came locusts and power was given to those locusts to have influence on men. It was at prophecy conferences and there was always a speculation they always had to come up with a parallel for what were the locusts? And locusts were helicopters with machine guns on them and they were coming like that. And maybe that's what they'll be. I don't think so. I think clearly from the text that those locusts are demons. When the pit of hell is opened up and demons that have been bound for centuries are released. And again, there was demonic activity in the time of Christ. There was demonic activity in the time of the apostles. And they would have seen that as something he's speaking of for them right now. That fearful sites will happen. Terrorizing things will happen in your life, disciples. But in every generation after that, and it will increase. and it will get closer together, and in the end time, it will be bigger than ever as the pit of hell begins to open and demons get released. And again, I'm not looking for signs, but it's hard to hear that and not listen to the 10 o'clock news, where in our city this week, the lead story for a number of days was that of a body being stolen out of a cemetery and mutilated in a variety of ways, and come to find out that it was all of the work of a Satanistic group, that those things are on the rise is no doubt. That it had been kept secret for a long time makes you wonder how many other things we don't even know about. Is that something that's been going on for a long time and now we're just finding out about it? Or is there genuinely a birth pain that's coming closer together and becoming more intense? I even reflect on our experience as a church. My experience individually is I understand some of the realities of the demonic realm and where two years ago, three years ago, if somebody came to me with issues of demonic influence in their life, I would have said, yeah, yeah, fine, okay. I'll send you somebody who does demons because I don't do demons. And God began to work in us and make us aware that we had authority in some of those areas. And one explanation for the reality of a deliverance ministry in our church could be that God, just by his spirit, moved on us, enlightened us, and gave us authority that we already have and we began to move in the reality of what was already there Everyone became aware of something that was always there. Or maybe there is more activity. Maybe the reason we're seeing it now is because there's more of them. And maybe the birth pains are closer together, and maybe they are more intense, and I don't know. Luke also talks about signs in the heavens, changes in the sky, alteration in the atmosphere. Revelation 16, pollution of the waters, verse 8 of Revelation 16, the sun scorching the earth. then that might sound far-fetched. And then we hear weird things about greenhouse effect and global warming and ozone layers. And some of that is even debatable. We don't know if that's all true. Scientists are going back and forth all the time. But the fact that the environment is in trouble is something I think most of us would agree about. And those verses don't sound quite as far-fetched. But all these things, verse 8 says, are the beginnings of birth pains. And the end is not. So go out and dig a hole and live in the hole. he's not telling them this and i'm not telling you this so we can go maybe it is maybe it is there it was for the disciples every one of these things were in the disciples life and a generation after and a generation after and a generation after if we don't look for signs we'll find them whether it's the end or not who knows the the point that jesus was giving to the disciples they weren't going to go to the apocalypse experience the apocalypse but they were going to experience their own personal apocalypse what was he saying be prepared hang on to me I'm your only hope and the generation after you same message hang on to Jesus it's your only hope and the message for the next generation same one and the same one and the same one until the great tribulation and the saints of that time are going to have to hang on to Jesus too just like the ones here here here here here here did the disciples while those are the beginning of birth pangs i want you to know the next thing and this is the fourth sign it's persecution they will deliver you to tribulation will kill you and you'll be hated by all nations on account of my name get some perspective on this boy in the end times they're going to deliver people to tribulation and going to kill people that's not just an end times verse that's that happened to the disciples did that happen to disciples were they tribute did they experience tribulation were they arrested were they martyred yes has that dynamic happened since the disciples time did it happen in the early church yes did it happen in generations following that yes read fox's book of martyrs does it happen now maybe not to you but someplace in this world right now people are dying for their allegiance to the king it happens in every generation and he is speaking to every generation from the disciples until the end to be faithful to me. Hang on to me for dear life your whole life because every generation is going to have their own tribulation. Again, the point, don't be, I'm not telling you this. Jesus is saying to the disciples so you can predict. I'm telling you this to be prepared in the way you are prepared is to hang on to me. Revelation 6, 9 does give us a peek. It gives us a look, a view of how what has always been happening, and that is tribulation of some sort. It's always been happening to the church, what it's going to look like in the full expression of the great tribulation. It says in chapter 6, verse 8, And when he broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had maintained. Saints, in the tribulation, chapter 7, verse 9, And after these things I looked and behold a great multitude, which no one could count from every nation, from every nation and all tribes. This is, by the way, for you prophecy scholars, this is not the 144,000 Jews. This is men from every tribe and every nation, redeemed people, standing before the throne in the tribulation, before the Lamb of God, clothed in white robes, palm branches in their hands. You know what they're doing, they're worshiping. They're saying with a loud voice, salvation to our God who sits on the throne, salvation to our God and to the Lamb. Powerful, passionate worship. And you wonder who they are. Verse 13, an elder wondered the same thing. And one of the elders answered, saying to me, those who are clothed in white robes, who are they? And where have they come from? And I said to him, that is Jesus, my Lord, you know. And he, that is Jesus, said to me, these here who are worshiping me now, these are the ones who come out of the great tribulation. And they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. For this reason, they are before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple, and he who sits on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them, and they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun beat down on them, nor any heat. For the lamb in the center of the throne shall be their shepherd and shall guide them to springs of water of life, and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes. That's the great tribulation, but I want you to know something, disciples. You are going to have your own, and the generation after you is going to have their own, and their own, and their own, and their own. And the call to every generation is, hang on to me. I'm your only hope. And everybody who overcomes, overcomes how? By the hair on their chinny-chin-chin. They overcome, no, by the blood of the Lamb. They overcome by the blood of the Lamb. My only hope is the power of God at work in me, giving me the strength to live in this generation, and this generation, and this generation, and that generation, too, for that was something God made to be our destiny, the great tribulation. it says in chapter 13 of revelation verse 7 it was given to satan to make war with the saints that's during the tribulation to make war with the saints i'm not even going to get in you know what's your position a preacher or posture yes um but it's not in this text it's not so much the part of jesus doesn't deal with any of that he's talking to him about going through tribulation in their life. Then hang on to me. But you know that verse in chapter 13, verse 7, it says it was given to him to make war with the saints in the great tribulation? That's a true thing now. It was given to him to make war with the saints. Do you have any sense? I think you do. We do. We talk about this often, that Satan is at war with us, that we individually are targets, that we as a church are targets. We talk about that often, that we need to hang on to Jesus for dear life as a church to survive. because we're our target but every generation has their own thing then goes on for the fifth point you see because of that persecution because of that tribulation there is then defection at that time many will fall away at what time future time yeah but also disciples time i'm talking to disciples at that time when the heat gets turned up many will fall away and in the next generation when the heat gets turned up many will fall away and in the next and and the next and the next. Who's going to fall away? Fall away? This sounds like we can lose our salvation. Now I'm very afraid. Don't be frightened. Hang on with me here. Hang on with me. There will be people who fall away. They will not be the truly redeemed ever. Because of those that the Father has given to me, I have not lost one. Not one. We need to hang on to Jesus, but we better know that while we're hanging on to him, he hangs on to us too. There will be people falling away though. And again, consistent with messages you've heard here over and over again, in the church, in the assembly of people who go to church, there are those who are real and those who are false. There are those who have genuinely bent their knees to Jesus, others who have entered into a system. There are those who are genuinely Isaacs, born of the Spirit. There are also Ishmaels, born of the flesh. Both of them call God their father. It's very confusing. There are wheat, real, tares, false, hard to know the difference. When the heat gets turned up, you find out the difference because those who are false, those who are playing games, fall away. See, people will fall away, not truly redeemed, but gone, beloved. Whenever the heat goes up, gone will be the people who follow Jesus because they thought if they followed Jesus, they'd get a lollipop. Gone will be the people who believe that if they follow Jesus, they'll get rich, and they're working the scam. As soon as the heat goes up and they don't get rich, they're gone because they didn't bend their knee to Jesus. They bent their knee to a system that was going to... Oh, I'm on that again. Gone will be the people playing church. Gone will be the lukewarm. Gone will be the Judases who play the game all the way along the line and find out that Jesus is asking for everything when they find out that they're gone. I'll tell you one thing that can even bring that kind of heat is simply when we hear a message. A message can even apply some heat. A message like this, foxes have holes, birds have nests, and the Son of Man doesn't have a place to lay his head. And if you follow me and get in the boat and leave your security and all of your comfort, I promise you peace. I promise you power. I promise you presence. But I do not presence, meaning God's presence. But I do not promise you comfort. I do not promise you that. So come. People who are looking for lollipops don't. So people will fall away because the price will be too high. People will fall away because they get deceived, verse 11. Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. I believe those false prophets will come from inside the church. It's verified in the scripture. They will come in from among you, Acts chapter 20. Again, we spent weeks in Matthew 23 speaking of false teachers in the church, how to spot a false leader. We went over that. I think in a big way, one of the things that came to my mind when I thought of a big deception, not even the kind that would come up in the church, but that would be moving in the world, is what's going on right now in our world as it relates to the New Age movement. I'm not here to say that is the... You see, along with the Antichrist and the end times, in the final day, there is going to come a world religion that is going to be the return to Babylon. And there are some who speculate that the New Age is Babylon revisited. I am not here to say that. I don't know that. Nobody does. Every generation probably had a New Age of some sort that was it i will say this that new age stuff is born of satan satan is all over that stuff stay away and in the end times and in the disciples generation and every generation that followed those kinds of things would rise up and because of it people would fall away not truly redeemed i'll tell you another reason they'll fall away in defect is because they'll choose iniquity last one verse 12 because of lawlessness increasing most people's love will grow cold because of lawlessness increasing just the increase of sin just the increase of sin and the pull of that growing and growing and growing i believe that growing increase of sin is a demonic thing and i think it creates a demonic draw of people and some of you look at our culture and go yeah i've seen that this increase in sin a change in our culture from when i was a kid to now just an increase in sin. So maybe that's it. Well, the disciples would have said the same thing. They would have said, since I was a kid, it's worse now in Rome. When Jerusalem falls, it'll be worse. And the debauchery that attended the Roman experience was this right here. The point is this. I'm not getting you to look for signs. Jesus is saying to the disciples, I want you to be prepared for this. I want you to know that people will fall away because even a demonic pull from the world is going to be so strong that even after they've heard the gospel some of them are going to just go the other way and in this generation and this and this and this and this and then in the end it'll be bigger closer together more intense revelation 9 21 speaks of this they will not repent of their immoralities their murders and their sorceries word sorcery there would speak to me without doing a greek thing of dabbling in the a cult, okay? Well, the Greek thing is even more significant than that. The Greek word for sorcery is pharmake. I don't know if you heard it when I said it, but that's like pharmacy. It has to do with drugs. And it makes you feel like maybe the pangs are closer together and a little bit more intense. Again, these defectors, can they be believers? These ones who fall away because they choose iniquity, because they're deceived, because the heat gets turned up. No, they're not true believers. In fact, John, who wrote the book of Revelation, wrote also 1 John 2.19. He said, listen, you've got to know this. When people go out from us, he said in 1 John 2.19, they were not of us. For if they had been of us, truly redeemed, they would have remained with us. But they went out in order that it might be shown that they were not of us. But the one who endures to the end, verse 13, he shall be saved. You need to hear this verse. It's very important. That does not mean that you get saved by enduring. You understand that? You do not get saved by enduring. But the ones who genuinely are redeemed, who have the Spirit of God in them, will endure by the Spirit. You know how you can tell you're saved? Endurance. Genuinely redeemed people endure. Ishmaels fall away. Lollipop seekers fall away. Genuinely indwelt by the Spirit, made new by God, people endure. and some of you are thinking I have accepted Jesus and I love Jesus but I don't know if I can endure that I don't know if I can endure this my life I'll tell you something this might sound goofy but it's again the message you hear over and over here indwelt Jesus is going to endure you Jesus will Jesus who lives in you if you're really redeemed is going to empower you to endure things that you would never believe you could endure even if you go through the end. Our endurance, whether it be in this life and just the pain that we have to deal with in our own life is not being done by the hair on our chinny-chin-chin. It is by the Spirit in us. It is by the blood of the Lamb. And it is experienced by people who have received Jesus, not a religious system. and we need to be constantly aware that not only is our call to hang on to Jesus, but we need to know that as we hang on to him, even if we lose our grip, redeemed people, he hangs on to you. Remember when John was in a pit for a year and he even asked the question, I wonder if you're really the one. Are you really the one? Have I wasted my life? I told everybody you were the Messiah and now I'm starting to doubt it. That's a picture of somebody who just lost their grip, isn't it? Isn't that a picture of somebody who goes, I don't know if I'm hanging on to Jesus very well. I don't even know if he exists. And Jesus said, tell him this. The blind see, the lame walk, the poor are having their life put back together and people are being forgiven. You go tell him that Jesus went toward him. He didn't shame him. That's a picture of Jesus hanging on to him, even though he wasn't hanging on to him real well. Truly redeemed people will endure this life and the next. Revelation 12, 11, it says, They overcame. And this is speaking of saints in the tribulation. They overcame. How? By trying hard. No. They overcame by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. The word of their testimony. Think on that. I don't know if this is true, but I got a flash of insight. It might be insight. It might just be me. The word of their testimony. I don't think that means they stood up and said, I was saved when I was six years old, and that's what helped them endure. I think the word of their testimony, I think it was a word, and testimony is to simply martyria, to say out loud what is truth. You know, the picture I got was when we were worshiping, and we were singing about victory, and we were singing about the king, and I needed to be reminded that he is coming, and he is king, and he is Lord. And the kingdoms of this world one day will become the kingdom of our God and of his Christ, And he shall reign forever and ever and ever and ever. And the word of that testimony helps you endure. They will endure and so will you by the blood of the Lamb in this life. If we don't go through end times things at all in this life, by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of the testimony, there are people who did not love their lives unto death. So we look at all this prophetic stuff, the end times stuff, and we think if these really are the last days, if this really is it, and maybe all this stuff really does apply to us. It does apply to us. Whether we're in the last days or not, this does apply, just like it applied to the disciples and the generation after them and after them and after them and after them. All of these words apply to us. But the word is not given to us again so we can be good predictors of the signs. The word is given to us so that we can, in our generation, live in such a way that says this, our only hope is you. You know what I'm aware of as I close? It's this. That many of you sitting in this room today don't need an apocalypse that speaks of the sun scorching the earth and famine and earthquakes and wars and rumors of wars to have some sense of apocalypse. I mean, I'm going back to Maple Grove today, okay? And some of you, you know, you're going back to Brooklyn Park and Minneapolis and Robinsdale and some of you are visiting from Bemidji and, you know, you're going back to that. You know what I'm aware of? that some of you have personal apocalypse going on right now, where it feels like the enemy of your souls has moved on you in such a way to bring destruction. And end times are not. It's here now. And the same kind of dynamic of power and life and God necessity that would bring one of the saints, the blood of the martyrs through the great tribulation, that same power is needed for me, for you, right now. you know i'd like to ask what's your personal apocalypse right now without any of this big stuff just yours could be your marriage could be sin you just can't overcome because you're trying so hard you need the blood of the lamb i need the blood of the lamb maybe you're not even redeemed the only way you're going to overcome death ultimate death is by the blood of the lamb becoming redeemed maybe you are redeemed and you're so wounded you know one of the things that I told you in Revelation 13, 7, it says, It was given to him, that is Satan, to make war with the saints. You're a target for the enemy, and you may be here today, and you have been made a target, and you are in some sort of apocalypse of sorts right now in your life. You know what I believe? I believe the same blood of the Lamb that in Revelation covered and caused them to endure is the same blood of the Lamb that's available to us, that enables us to endure too. It says in Revelation that they overcame by the blood of the Lamb. personal apocalypse is one that we're just aware that people might have right here and the same blood of the lamb that was necessary for the disciples to endure what they had to endure every generation since and generations to follow is the blood of the lamb our only hope is Jesus we want to make available at the end of our time right now people who know they need a touch their only hope you've been trying to hang on you've been a target for the enemy and your strength is gone, I tell you this, the only way you can overcome is by the blood of the Lamb. It's God who's the overcomer in you. You can't try hard to do it. Some of you need a touch. If you do, our altar ministry people are in place or are going to be in place. The rest of you will be dismissed. If you need prayer, you come. There won't be any song. Just come forward and people will meet with you. Let's pray as we're dismissed. Jesus, I thank you so much that you did not give us these words and the words that are going to follow the next several weeks so that we could be good predictors, so that we could be good sign followers. I'm aware that scribes followed the signs all the time, and they always knew about when the Messiah was going to come. And they could tell everybody about it, but when you came, they missed it. We're not here to look for signs. We're here to hang on to you. We're here to declare that we acknowledge that in this age, whatever age this might be in the span of history, our only hope is the blood of the Lamb. And we need it applied to us, And we need the redeeming, cleansing work of that blood to be released in this body, to purify us from sin that would bring us destruction, from the power to be redeemed, but also as believers, that same blood applied for cleansing and rewashing and refocus and healing. God, bring it to us as people would come and receive from you what only you can give. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you.
