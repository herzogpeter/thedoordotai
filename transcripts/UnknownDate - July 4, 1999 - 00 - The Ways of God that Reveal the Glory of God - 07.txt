Last week in our continuing study in the book of Exodus, we found ourselves again in chapter 33 and 34, and we talked about the way of God that reveals the glory of God, especially to people who don't know God as being when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God. Philippians 4, 5. Let your forebearing spirit be the presenting issue of your life. Let your forbearing love be the first thing people see about you. Lead with that. Why? Because one of the primary ways of God that reveals the glory of God, especially to people who don't know God, is when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God. A week ago, Bonnie and I were enjoying dinner at the home of some friends when they shared with us a story about her brother, her being Peggy, Peggy and Dwayne, her brother who along with his wife and family routinely and regularly open their home to students, very often international students, going to someplace like the University of Minnesota and in need of a place to stay. They invite them in to live with them. Now with many stories about that, that they could have shared, the one they shared with us that night was of a young man from China. His name was E, spelled Y-I. Peggy described this young man as very bright, who to this day is living in the States. In fact, he still lives here in the Twin Cities. And to describe his brilliance, she said, I'm not exactly sure what he does. He's a microbiologist, astrophysicist, just very smart person type thing he does. Very bright guy. He made it clear when he moved in with these people that he was not interested in religion and a vowed atheist. They were fine with that, didn't preach, didn't debate or try to prove to him anything. They simply lived with him, opening their life to him. Well, it just so happens that this family lives out the love of God. Not syrupy sentimentality love, but real life, down to earth, care about each other love. forgive each other love, serve one another love, hold each other accountable kind of love. And as this young Chinese atheist watched this over several months, the predictable came to be. He became curious. And he began to ask some questions. What is this about? Where is all this stuff about your life from? They were happy to tell him, and guess what happened? This young man came to Christ. Both Peggy and Dwayne described this event with big beaming smiles, saying this, he didn't have a chance. Why is that? Here's why. Because one of the most powerful ways of God that reveals the glory of God, especially to people who don't know God, is when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God. But for every story like that, there are others with different outcomes. A few weeks ago, a number of us on the staff went to a conference in Chicago on spiritual transformation. One of the speakers, all of them were wonderful. One of the speakers was Raleigh Washington, who told a story of a debate that he had either heard about or gone to between Larry Flint and Jerry Falwell. It would be an interesting debate. I don't know if you know who they are. Larry Flint is the very controversial publisher of Hustler magazine, a pornographic magazine. Jerry Falwell, in some camps, as equally controversial, founder of the moral majority. They're in a debate. At one point near the end of the discussion, Larry Flint said to Jerry Falwell, something like this. I really like you, Jerry. And though we strongly disagree, obviously, in a number of points, I think you like me too, but I could never believe this Christianity thing. And here is why. Because Christians are no different than anybody else. They hate just like everybody else, and not just people like me do they hate, who are very easy targets, but they hate each other. Divisions and schisms, church splits, you're the family guy, you're the family values guy, Jerry, he said. Divorce is as high among church people as it is among everybody else. Believe it or not, Jerry Falwell had nothing to say. I've never seen that. and according to Raleigh Washington he lost the debate you see in a lot of ways the church is like a family when it works whether it's a family or a church when the people in it are reasonably healthy have the courage to love, the courage to forgive to hold each other accountable, to serve one another in love and to just plain sometimes stick around well there's just nothing quite like it the family or the church, for producing healthy people stability and strength. But when it doesn't work, when the family or the church is filled with people who are petty and small and selfish, well, there's just nothing quite like it for producing pain, instability, disillusionment, and despair. Why despair? Because if you can't find authentic love in a family, If you can't find authentic love in a church that claims to know the God of love, where can you find it? And that is why in Philippians chapter 1 verse 9, Paul prayed. He made it a prayer. And the prayer was this. This I pray that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment. And we touched on this last week, this verse, making reference to it briefly. Today, I want to look at it more closely and use it as we go to the table in just a few moments. Let's kind of look at it more closely. I want to, first of all, simply define some terms and explain what they mean so we can enter into the understanding. To abound simply means to turn out abundantly, to exceed, to overflow. The picture is that of a fountain spilling over more than enough. Now, that which Paul prays will abound is your love. I'm going to do something here. I don't know if you hear that noise, but I think it was from the fan. Maybe not. Oh, anyway. That which Paul prays will abound is your love. Now, I may be sounding a little nitpicky here, but he doesn't say, and this I pray, that your love for one another will grow more and more. He doesn't even pray that your love for God will grow even more and more, though those are both very good things. What he prays specifically is this, that the love of God resident inside of you will begin to grow in you and then abound from you, splashing like this fountain on everyone around you. So that the reason people around you are experiencing love or are getting loved is not because they are particularly lovable. The reason people in your family or in your church are getting loved is because love is abounding inside of you. It is spilling over from you onto them regardless. whether they're lovable or not. I thought of this picture of kind of, in fact, the way I said it last week was that so much of love abounding in you so that when people bump into you, what they get is love. So I thought about the picture. What dawned on me, sadly, was that I had a lot more experience with another kind of thing when you bump into people and what gets splashed on you because very often we've all experienced it and sometimes we're the splashy and sometimes we're the splasher. Quite often what we experience when we bump into people, especially when we bump into them in a way that rubs them somehow wrong, is we don't have splashed on us love, we have splashed on us anger. And one of the reasons is because what we have abounding in us very often isn't love. What we have abounding in us and what is spilling over on everybody else is our rage and our anger. Quite frankly, sometimes our out-and-out hatred. That's what road rage is. It's getting a lot of press. It ought to get a lot of press. And road rage, as you know, is that disproportionate explosion of anger that is sometimes resulting in people's loss of life because you didn't use your turn signal or you cut them off somehow or you had the gall to pass them. And this anger just explodes. What is that about? That's about abounding in rage. Sometimes you have an interchange with someone and they blow up and you hear them or you find yourself saying, well, what did I do to get that kind of reaction? Sometimes you hear that from someone else when you blow up over what really was a relatively minor infraction and you just get really, really big. And their response to you was, what did I do? Well, the answer to that is nothing. You didn't do anything that deserved the kind of explosion you just got. What you just got was somebody who was abounding in anger. Another sad reality around this dynamic is this, that many people never taste the kind of love that Paul is speaking of, never experience what it feels like to bump into somebody and get splashed with love. And the result of that is this. We end up spending enormous amounts of our energy trying to make ourselves more lovable. We've kind of given up hope that we'll ever just bump into somebody and experience love because that's what's inside of them. Our only hope to experience this love we crave is to become lovable. So we lose weight, buy clothes, say yes when we really don't want to say yes, get involved, do favors, and act nice. And there's nothing wrong with any of those things. But the problem is, for many of us, we're spending enormous amounts of energy doing those things out of an enormous love deficit. Hoping that if we do enough, we'll become lovable. We'll be loved, but it's never enough. Here's the deal, beloved. If people are ever going to be authentically and deeply loved in your family or in this church, It will not be because everybody in your family or everybody in this church becomes irresistibly lovable. If we're waiting for that before love begins to flow in families or in churches, it's going to be a real long wait. Here's something I know about everybody in this room, I think. And I don't know everybody in this room, but here's what I think I know about you. About every person in this church, this is true. There is something authentically lovable about you. There are things about you that draw other people to you. There are things about you that are lovable. There's something else I know about everybody here. There are things about you, every person here, that are altogether resistible. Oh, I think I could resist that. If people in families, if people in churches are ever going to experience the kind of love, that Paul is talking about here. It's the only way it's ever going to happen is if by a work of the Spirit inside people, the resident love of God that has come to them by amazing grace begins to grow and then abound and then spill over on people who are altogether resistible. Quite often unlovable. Third term in this verse I want us to see and understand so we can enter into it more fully is this phrase, really, in real knowledge and all discernment. I pray that your love may abound in real knowledge and all discernment. Simply put, Paul's prayer is this, that this abounding love is not seen as naive. We talk about love being blind. Paul says the love I would like to see released from you is not blind love. It abounds right in the middle of real knowledge and all discernment of at least two things. The love I'm calling for abounds in the real knowledge, number one, of what love is. We're going to talk a little bit more about that next week because I haven't really gone into the nuances of that. And secondly, my prayer is that it would abound in the context of real knowledge of what people are like and how people can sometimes hurt. And I want your love to abound even when you know that. Bonnie and I Bonnie is my wife have been married for 25 years and I have been in love with her for longer than that we have enjoyed what I think is an authentic love affair and I will be eternally grateful for that my whole life and into eternity I believe now while there are some things about me that really are lovable Well, true, there are some. What you probably don't know and probably wouldn't believe if I told you, and this might be a huge stretch for some of you, you need to understand that there are also some things about me that are altogether resistible. You seem real quick to believe that, actually. I thought that was funnier somehow. It's not a stretch at all, is it? Not only is that true, but you know what? Bonnie knows what they are. My wife of 25 years has real knowledge and all discernment of everything about me that's hard to love. She has real knowledge and all discernment of everything about me that is exceedingly resistible. And right in the middle of everything she knows about me, she loves me. You know why? because inside of her there is a love, resident love, that grows and abounds and splashes on me. And any time you get love like that, it's a gift. And I have that inside me for her as well. My prayer, says Paul, is that love would abound even when you know that love could cost, even when you know that people might hurt. And when you know that, And every instinct you have begins to kick in to self-protect. My prayer is that you will not self-protect, but you will allow the fountain of love that I've planted inside of you by my spirit to continue to flow, even when you know you could by that be heard. Now the reason Paul prays this, invokes the supernatural power of God upon this, is because he knows some things about this. Number one, he knows about love's priority. What I mean by that is this. As believers in Christ, we can't get out of this one. We may dodge it for a while. We may harbor a resentment for a season, but it doesn't go away. And sooner or later, if you are a child of God and the Spirit of God lives within you, he will press upon you the need to deal with your lack of love. Somewhere along the line, he's going to move on you. Because if you say you love God and hate your brother, you're a liar, says John. And the truth is not in you. And that's one of the reasons Paul makes this a prayer. Because we can't get away with not loving one another. Second reason he makes it a prayer is because of love's difficulty. C.S. Lewis, in his book, The Four Loves, speaking of love's difficulty and danger, said this. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping your heart intact, you must give it to no one, not even a pet. Wrap it carefully around with hobbies and little luxuries. Avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your self-protection. But just know this, that in that casket your heart will change. It will not be broken, and that's good news. Indeed, it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The only place, however, outside heaven, where you can perfectly be safe, be perfectly safe from all the dangers and struggles of love, is hell. End quote. I'm 47 years old. I've been a Christian for 39 years. I've been in the ministry for 22 years and I would like to think that after that much time I have some measure of depth in terms of my Christ life. I would also like to think that after that much time walking with God that this love thing would have by now become a little easier. But when I reflect honestly on my own life it isn't easy. You can think of two reasons for that right off. Number one, because I know a little bit more now than I used to about what real life is. When I used to think that love was syrupy sentimentality, warm and gooey, just being nice and having a public smile ready for everyone, when that was how love was defined for me, I felt pretty close to it. Because I can crank out a public smile pretty much any time. When I found out that love was deeper than that, costing and requiring of me more than that, I found myself feeling further and further from it. The second reason that time and even walking with God has not made this love quest an easier one is because after this much time I know a little bit more, not only about love, but I know a little bit more about people. That they can hurt you. They can disappoint you. use you and betray you. And beloved, the truth about everyone in this room is this, that the longer you live, the more likely it becomes that you will have real knowledge of that. You will have real knowledge, not in your head, I know people can hurt you, not just that kind of knowing, but knowing because your soul has been wounded, you will really know that people can hurt, disappoint, use and betray. See, as knowledge and discernment increases, as to what love is and what people are like. The question does not, over time, get easier. It actually gets tougher. And the question is this. Am I going to keep on loving? Am I going to keep my heart open to this dynamic of a fountain inside of me, planted by the Spirit, continuing to splash on people, even when the last time I let it splash on somebody, it cost me immeasurably? Am I going to keep that, or am I going to turn that spigot off and self-protects. The question is also this, am I going to keep on forgiving even when I know that if I forgive and if I love, it could cost and I might get hurt again. See, the reason Paul prayed this, beloved, was because he knew that the kind of love he was calling for from the Philippians was far beyond their capacity to do in the flesh. that in fact without the supernatural engagement and involvement of God himself by his spirit and work in their lives and in our lives, activating our wills and empowering our actions, this kind of love could never be tasted, and so he prayed. And this morning, in addition to praying for this kind of love to be planted inside of us, we will also go to the table. just a few moments we're going to do that and as we do it this morning take the bread and cup keep in mind that it speaks to many things it speaks first of all to something many of you desperately are going to need to receive this morning especially with a talk about love because some of you are here feeling such an emptiness and an inability to give any love away because you have lost touch completely with the love of God for you, the forgiveness and grace of God toward you. You're feeling an estrangement even there. So you need to know that as this morning you take the cup and you take the bread, that the bread and the cup, the death and the resurrection of Christ speaks to, first of all, the abounding love of God for you and that God loved you through Christ in real knowledge and all discernment of who you really are and where you're really at right now. God loves you with all knowledge and discernment of the mess you're in this morning. And the love that abounds in him spills over on you. And my deepest prayer would be that some of you would feel the splash of that fountain even as you take the bread and even as you take the cup. And put it in your hand and remember the blood of Christ for you. And the body of Christ broken for you. That's abounding love. This bread and cup also speaks of nourishment and empowerment. It's kind of odd. What do you mean? Symbolic. You know, we're going to take bread and we're going to take a cup. And we're going to eat it. And we're going to drink it. No, no, no. Physically, when you eat something and you drink something, you do it for nourishment. You're not going to get much. It's going to be a small cracker. It's going going a little cup. It's not going to be a whole lot. It's not going to be good for the day. It speaks symbolically, does this cup and does this bread. It speaks symbolically of nourishment. But it speaks symbolically beyond physical nourishment to spiritual nourishment. I am the bread. I am the water I am the wine. I am the source of life. In fact, I am the source of the love that you're praying might abound in you right now. And that's why I say at the table, the cup and the bread is a symbol of empowerment. Because I receive this body, this bread that symbolizes his body, this cup that symbolizes his bread. And in a way, I am receiving in that the very life of God. I don't mean I'm becoming saved. I don't mean that. People who are coming to the table are already redeemed. But I am acknowledging this bread, this cup, is what I need, is the nourishment I need to live this Christ life. I would plant that seed in your mind as you come to the table. Not only does this picture and speak to me about his abounding love to me, but it speaks to me of the nourishment I need to give this abounding love away because it was only by his life and his death and his resurrection that has now been implanted inside of me that I could ever hope to give this away. So come and eat and drink. Take the bread and take the cup, not only as a symbol of receiving his life and love for you, but as the source of giving his life and love to others. why would that matter that we would be able to give the life and love of God that's come to us to others here's why it matters because one of the primary ways of God that reveals the glory of God especially to people who don't know God is when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God let's pray and enter into this time now. Father, I thank you first of all for the fact that your love abounds toward us. For what hope would any of us have to have this love abounding in us if we had not had some taste of it? And Father, your love spilled out on us while we were altogether unlovable. Very resistible were we when we were lost and dead in our sin and yet you laid down your life. but I am very mindful that there are some men and women, boys and girls, even in this gymnasium this morning, who, though they are redeemed, feel far from this touch of amazing grace. That first love where your love splashed on them and refreshed them and renewed them and renewed them is a distant memory. And so I pray that before some of us even enter into this need to be loving, that there would from this table be a flow of grace that men and women, as they take the bread and take the cup, would be refreshed in how loved they already are, how forgiven they already are. And I pray in your name that that grace would flow from the table. But I pray as well empowerment would flow from the table. As we receive your love, the reminders of your body and your blood, that we would by that realize you are the nourishment we need to live this life of love. May it be real, energized by your spirit. In Jesus' name, amen.
