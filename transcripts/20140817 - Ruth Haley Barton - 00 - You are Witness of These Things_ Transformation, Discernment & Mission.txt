It says this, That same hour, they get up and return to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. And they were saying the most astounding thing. The Lord is risen indeed. And he appeared to Simon. And then they told what had happened on the road and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread. While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, Peace be with you. They were startled and terrified, actually, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. And he said to them, Why are you frightened? And why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet. See that it is I myself. Touch me and see. For a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have. And when he said this, he showed them his hands and showed them his feet. While in their joy, they were disbelieving and still wondering. He then said to them, have you anything here to eat? They gave him a piece of broiled fish and he took it and ate it in their presence. which is another thing ghosts don't do. And then he said to them, These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled. Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and he said to them, Thus it is written that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations beginning in Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And see, I am sending upon you what my Father promised. So stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. It was four or five years ago. My wife and I were trying to determine which it was four or five years. I was sitting on a beach with Bonnie on a vacation reading a book that had been recommended to me by a woman named Ruth Haley Barton. I loved the book. It was called Strengthening the Soul of Your Leadership. I couldn't wait to get home to tell the staff about this new discovery I had made, only to find out that everyone had read it but me. And it was amazing. On a number of levels, the things she said so resonated in my heart. so consistent with our journey as a church, so rooted in the text, which is something I'm always looking for. It gives me confidence in whatever the person is saying. But as I read that book and became excited about it, little did I know that Ruth Haley Barton would become more to us than a significant voice in our church's life. We've had those kinds of relationships in the past with significant voices who have had a profound effect on our church's life. It's actually part of our story. We talk about it from time to time, how 30-some years ago, it was the voice of Brennan Manning, and then there was the voice of people like John Wimber and Leanne Payne talking about inner healing and, more recently, Dallas Willard's voices. And significant voices are significant. Many of us have been mentored, discipled by people, men and women, And we've never actually met. They were a voice, though, that called us to something, that described something, that brought life to us in some ways. And they're very, very valued people in our lives. But you don't always develop a relationship with people like that. Ruth started out for me, for us, as a voice that was saying things that resonated deeply. She then became something unexpected. She became for us, for me, a friend, and even more, a kind of partner in ministry. We're moving in very much the same direction as I kind of reflect on our purpose as a church for existing. Our purpose as a church for existing is to become a community that is experiencing a radical commitment to spiritual transformation for the glory of God, for the abundance of our own lives, and for the sake of the world, the world it desperately needs to see something that is real of the life of God being reflected in the life of his people. That phrase is something that actually I think we got from Ruth. It resonates in Ruth. She's more than a voice. She's a friend. She's, I don't know how you'd be more than a friend. Yeah, more than a friend, actually a partner in ministry. It's a delight to introduce to you or bring to you again this friend, this partner, Ruth Haley Barton. Would you come? She says, you say, I can call you Ruth, right? God bless you. Oh, it's good to be with you all again. I had a bit of a moral dilemma as I pulled into the parking lot for the first time as I arrived on Thursday. I've been with you guys for three days. Some of you are very tired of me by now, I'm sure. So if you could just hang in with me for another half hour, you'll be done with me and I'll go home, I promise. But I had a bit of a moral dilemma when I came into the parking lot, and that was to determine whether or not I should park in the visitor's spot or in the regular parking lot, because I don't feel like a visitor anymore. I realize that I feel like I belong here and that I come here, you know, regularly now. And I was really happy to experience that kind of moral dilemma. I'll tell you that I resolved it by parking in the visitor's parking space because I was late and needed to get in here. But it was nice to feel in my heart that I really didn't know if I was a visitor or not because I feel like I'm here with you and that we're on a significant shared journey together, and I'm grateful for that. I'm grateful to have been invited in so deeply to the lives of your leaders, first of all, and then into your life as a congregation. And I think we know each other well enough now that I could share with you one of my guilty pleasures. Would you like to know about that? Yes, I'm sure you would. Well, the guilty pleasure is that I really do love these long-running TV series. You know, Downton Abbey, 24, things like that. I really do enjoy them. And it's kind of a new phenomenon. I mean, we used to have TV series, but not TV series that were like movies, you know, where they were big and bold and then left you at the edge of the cliff on the edge of your seat when they were over and you just couldn't wait for the next one. My favorite happens to be 24, and I think that was one of the first ones that got rolled out in this sort of genre. And people are always a little stunned when they learn that about me, because they think about me as being kind of a gentle soul. And so they cannot understand why I like a television show that has so much action and suspense, and of course some violence at times. And I've had to reflect on it too. Why in the world do I love this TV show so much? Because it is a bit out of character, and there's a lot of intensity, and sometimes I can't even sleep after it's all over. But as I've thought about it, I've realized that the reason that I love it is because every situation that the character, the main character, Jack Bauer, finds himself in involves truth and integrity, wrestling, wrestling with truth-telling and integrity and friendship and loyalty and love and choosing between the needs of some and the needs of others. You know, you see all of that going on, and I find the complexity and the questions that are raised in those situations to be absolutely riveting. And to watch someone wrestle and struggle with making those kinds of decisions and making a lot of them in one 24-hour period, you know, more than I ever have to make. I don't know. I just find it really interesting and intriguing. And so as I was thinking about coming back to be with you, I was certain that we needed to finish up the story of the Emmaus Road because that's what I unfolded for you last time I was here, and we didn't finish it, and we need to finish it today. but I realize that the Emmaus Road is sort of like that. It's sort of like, maybe you wouldn't have thought of it this way, but a little bit like a cliffhanger. When we left, these guys had had this encounter with Jesus, and they had been transformed in Jesus' presence, but we don't know what happens after that. We didn't finish the story. And so I sort of see what we're doing today here as being like a finishing up of a really exciting story. And we left the story before it was over, and I hope that maybe you even lost some sleep wondering what in the world happened to those guys. you know, after they encountered Jesus on the road. There must have been something more. So let's remind ourselves of what we did last time. And we were together last. We were talking about this journey on the Emmaus Road, these two disciples, one named Cleopas, one who was unnamed. And they were taking this walk between the trauma of the crucifixion of their friend and their teacher, Jesus Christ. They were not yet convinced of the resurrection. They had given up. They had left the scene of this terrible traumatic death and they were wandering back to their hometown, which was Emmaus. And they were talking about all these things that had happened. And we talked about these two disciples on the road and we don't know if they were two guys actually, because the other one is unnamed. It could have been a woman. We don't know. Could have been his wife. Could have been Luke, who is the actual writer of the book of Luke. Could have been someone else. We don't know who it was. But we know there were two disciples walking together, choosing to walk together in community, to walk together in spiritual friendship. Beautiful choice to make. It's a radical choice to make, to walk with somebody else between the now and the not yet of something traumatic that's happened in your life. You're still traumatized. You haven't been healed yet. You have no idea what the meaning of it all is yet, but you're choosing to share. And the scripture says that they were talking about all these things that had happened. And I love that phrase because it means they weren't holding anything back. They weren't holding back talking about any of the facts and all that, but they also weren't holding back their emotions either. They were talking about how this whole incident had impacted them, and I don't think that they were trying to put a brave face on it. I don't think that they were trying to spiritualize it. I think the biblical phrase means that they were talking about it all in a pretty unvarnished way. And we talked about the Emmaus Road as being the road between the now and the not yet. The road between something that's been taken from us, some ending, something that has caused us great confusion or upheaval, and we're still trying to plug along in life, but we have not yet been given what is next. And so there's this liminal space that we talked about last time, where we are letting go and trying to make sense out of one thing and trying to be on the road to someplace else. And we talked about the fact that all of us travel a road between the now and the not yet in our own lives. And I wish that I could sit with some of you and find out, you know, how you've walked that road since the last time I was here. How have you encountered Christ on your own Emmaus Road since the last time I was here? But I hope you have an awareness of your own encounters with Christ since the last time we were together. And so we noted together that there are some practices that we can utilize together that help us as individuals to come together in community and to walk our own road between the now and the not yet together. In spiritual community, we talked about the radical choice to walk together rather than to walk alone. We talked about the power of talking about all these things in open and honest ways and the fact that that somehow invites Jesus to draw near. Jesus loves to join in on a conversation where people are talking at a gut level with each other. That kind of conversation draws Jesus into the conversation. We talked about the power of welcoming the stranger. And that if these two disciples had not welcomed Jesus, they would have missed the whole thing. And how Jesus sometimes brings people to us who seem kind of strange, you know, some are stranger than others. But the brave choice to welcome the stranger is actually a way of welcoming Christ himself. We talked about the power of finding our story in the larger story of what God is doing. And I know that that's language and practice that you all do around here a lot and do it very, very well. And then we talked about the pattern that spiritual companions can have together where they take time to pay attention, where they look back on what they've experienced and they say, did not our hearts burn within us? In other words, didn't we experience the presence of Christ back there while we were walking on the road? And that all of those are spiritual practices that open us to the presence of Christ in community. So the story that we reflected on last time sort of ended with that experience of looking back and saying, did not our hearts burn within us while he walked and talked with us on the road? But the question is, what happens after that? What happens after you have this transforming encounter with the presence of Christ on the road of your own life? Is that the end of the story, or is there more? Well, there is more. There's a lot more in this story, because the whole story from beginning to end, and we just finished it up, illustrates how transforming community gets formed, what it means to be a transforming community, and what is the outcome of choosing to become a transforming community. The Emmaus road does not end with a nice meal and a good night's sleep, although that would have been a really good end to a very long day. Did you know that the journey from Jerusalem to Emmaus is about seven miles? So these two disciples had walked about seven miles. They had also prepared a meal for their guess they had also been through what they had been through over that weekend. So you could imagine that they might have been longing for their beds that night. But that is not the way the story ends. Because the truth is, these two disciples were way too jazzed to sleep. They had had this encounter with Jesus, and then he appeared, or he revealed himself as they were breaking bread together, and then he disappeared, which must have been a very confusing experience as well. But they were so excited, they were so jazzed by what they had experienced in Jesus' presence and the transformation that they had experienced, let's not miss it. They had been transformed from dazed, dejected wanderers to confident, joyful bearers of good news. And they could not wait to tell their story. And so the scriptures tell us that they got up that very same hour and they returned to Jerusalem to share their experience of transformation with the other disciples. And what they found out was that there were other people that had experienced the transforming presence of Christ as well. They were not alone in their experience. Jesus had appeared to other people as well. And can you imagine what it would have been like to get together and to share about these encounters, these very different kinds of encounters, the post-resurrection experiences that people had had with Jesus. And all of them were very personal. And all of them were exactly what that particular individual needed. And now they had made sense, significant sense out of the trauma that they had been through. And they were gathering now together to share their experiences of transformation in Jesus' presence. What an exciting conversation. Amen? To talk about life-transforming encounters with Jesus is one of the best kinds of conversations you could ever have. And so they found out that even though each encounter was unique, there were others who had experienced the transforming presence of Christ, and lo and behold, there was a whole group of Christ followers who had stories to tell about how Jesus had transformed them. And so they had the opportunity to ponder and to celebrate and to make meaning out of a journey that had taken them from Jerusalem or had taken them to Jerusalem in the beginning to experience the birth of a vision, and it was the vision that Jesus communicated to them about His kingdom coming to the earth. But then in Jerusalem, they had also experienced the death of their vision. And remember, not only did Jesus' death happen there, but the death of their vision died with Him. And then their journey had carried them away from that hub of religious activity to a very personal encounter with Jesus on the Emmaus Road, where they invited Jesus to be with them in the very intimate places of their hearts and lives. And now they were back in Jerusalem, in the very same place where it all began. And so like any good journey, it brings us home in some way. Any good journey, not a trip, but a real journey. And if you look at the myths and if you look at some of the big, huge stories that we love in our culture, oftentimes the hero will leave on a big journey, but that journey will bring that hero back home in some significant way. Nothing has changed perhaps except that they have changed. And that's what a journey does for us. That's what a journey does as opposed to just a trip. A journey takes us through life changes and we come back changed. But this journey was not just a physical journey from Jerusalem to Emmaus and back again. It was also a journey inward to a place of personal encounter with Jesus that had resulted in deep change and transformation for them. And now they were being propelled outward almost immediately, if not immediately, before they even had a good night's sleep. They were propelled outward. First of all, they were propelled to seek a larger community in which to share the stories of transformation that they had experienced, and to stay on that path of transformation. I have some sense that one of the reasons they wanted to gather together was not only to share their stories, but to hold on to it, you know, and to say, let's keep this going. Maybe if we at least sit around and talk about this stuff, we can continue to live in the reality of Jesus' transforming presence. So they were propelled immediately to go back to the larger community of faith and to share their stories with the larger community of faith and to experience being in community around these stories of being transformed in Christ's presence. And then, very shortly after that, they were propelled into the world beyond their community to share the good news of what had happened in their own personal life in Jesus' presence and also so that they could be Christ in the world. So what's happening here? a transforming community is being born right here in the Luke 24 story this is the conclusion of the Emmaus Road story is that they come back to share their stories and lo and behold a transforming community begins to be formed I'm sure that when the disciples left Jerusalem to return to Emmaus after the crucifixion I bet it felt like the end didn't it I bet they thought well that was nice but that's all over now and now I'm going to go back to life as I knew it before. I'm going to go back to be a fisherman. I'm going to go back, you know, to be this or that. You know, that was nice, you know, but I guess that's done with. But no, while it might not, while it might have felt like they were giving up, leaving all their dreams behind, maybe they even felt that they were being disloyal to the vision that they had all seen together. You know, I wonder if they struggled a little bit with that. But now they were returning in the knowledge that Jesus' presence is not restricted to any one place, and it's certainly not restricted to the religious center of their day. Christ followers can and do encounter Jesus in places that feel lonely and off the beaten path. I think that's one lesson that we learned from the Emmaus Road journey is that we can encounter Jesus on the lonely path, the path where it feels like all is lost, can be a place of profound encounter with Jesus. You could call that the solitary place if you'd like, the solitude place. But then when we have that encounter, we are drawn back into community with others who are being transformed in Christ's presence. As we gather to share and to support and even to catalyze these transformational experiences, look what happens. Jesus appears once again as the community gathers. Jesus appears on the lonely road between the now and the not yet, and Jesus appears when we gather together in community. And he comes to us in community in ways that all of us can recognize. And that's the story of this particular passage that we read today is that Jesus came in a way they could all recognize as they were together sharing their stories of transformation. And the first thing Jesus did was to bring his peace. Peace be with you. Peace about whatever it is that we have just experienced. Peace. Even though it seemed hard. Even though it seemed difficult. even though we don't fully understand it, peace, right into that place. Peace be with you. I promise you, everything's going to be okay. All of this is going to make sense, I promise. When Jesus comes into the life of a community, he brings peace. He speaks peace into those places that have felt like they were so full of upheaval. And then he brings not only his peace, but he brings his presence. He brings his presence, which is the ultimate assurance that we can have peace. The fact that Jesus is still here with us is the ultimate assurance that we can be at peace. And then he brings his presence, and he gives us assurances that he's real and that his presence can make a difference. He does things with us and for us that convince us that, yes, indeed, Jesus is really among us, and that's what we need in transforming community. We need to have a sense that yes, Jesus is still among us, no matter what we've experienced together. And then sometimes he looks into our faces and he sees that we're afraid. He sees that we still have doubts and wonderments. You know, the story tells us that the disciples still had fear and doubt and wonderment. And so he looks right into our face and he asks us another penetrating question, which is one of the best things Jesus does. One of the best things Jesus does is ask us the right question at the right time. And so his question is, why are you frightened? And why do doubts arise? in your eyes. And I don't know if anyone's sitting here today feeling fear and still feeling doubt, but Jesus speaks right into your heart, and he says, why are you frightened? I'm here. I'm bringing you peace. You don't need to doubt. And so Jesus brings his presence. He says, when I'm here, we don't have to worry about anything. You know, I make it right. And so then he helped them to work through their fear. And he said, look at my hands and feet. Touch me. See that I have flesh and bones, just like you have. This is for real. I'm for real. We're going to go on from here. And so he actually proves it to them by eating that broiled fish. So Jesus brings his peace to the transforming community. He brings his presence to the transforming community in ways that we can all affirm as being real among us. And then he brings us his perspective. Once again, Jesus opens up the Scriptures to them. The very same Scriptures that he had opened up already to the two disciples on the Emmaus Road, the very same ones he had unfolded to them so personally on the Emmaus Road, now he does the very same thing with the larger group. He unfolds the Scriptures to them, starting with the prophets and Moses, and he shows them his presence. He reassures them that he is the one who is being spoken of in the Hebrew Scriptures. And this would have been absolutely essential for these God-fearing Jews, okay? These people, before they were Christians, they were Jews. They were God-fearing Jews. They had been Jews longer than they had been Christ followers. And so for these God-fearing Jews, it would have been absolutely essential for them to understand what Jesus was saying through the scriptures. And so Jesus gives it to them in the way that they need to hear it. And it says he actually opened their minds to understand those scriptures in verse 45. Now, I really love that because it shows that there's a way of interacting with scripture that gives God a lot of freedom, Jesus a lot of freedom to open our minds, that we need our minds to be open to really get the meaning of scripture on some days, that beyond just cognition and intellect, we need to have help to allow the scriptures to penetrate our hearts and to penetrate our lives in ways that actually make a difference, and that's a work of God. That's not your own work. That's something God does in you. And so here's something that happens in transforming community. What Jesus says to individuals in private then gets confirmed in the larger community. Isn't that something? And we had an experience like that this weekend, didn't we, Vicki? Yes, we did, and I'm going to tell you that story because I want to be in the story with you. We're and a story together. So yesterday in our very last session on the role of community and discernment, I felt led to do something I'd never done before, which was to take the whole group, separate them out into little dyads, into little, you know, twosomes, and to move us through a very short and simple experience of group spiritual direction. And I just felt very led to do that. I'd never done it that way before. I'd done other kinds of things, but I'd never done it in that particular way before. And I felt God leading me to do it. And it felt risky because I didn't know, I hadn't done it before, so I didn't have any idea how it would go. And I didn't know if people would enter into it or not. So it was a very powerful experience to look out over this whole sanctuary and to see groups of two looking deeply into one another's eyes and sharing the deep things of their spiritual lives and sharing deep questions together. And it was nice. And I was thankful to God for it. And that would have been enough for me. But when it was all over, and Vicki had not shared this with me before, she told me that she had actually seen a picture of that about five weeks ago in her prayer. That she had actually seen the sanctuary with people in it, sitting in twos like that, sharing deeply about their spiritual lives. And I realized that's what happened, this, that Jesus doesn't just tell individuals about what's going to happen. If it's really from God, he's going to confirm it in the community. He's going to find a way to say it to the larger community so that we can all get on board together. This is the kind of thing that happens in transforming community, and when it happens, you know that Jesus is at work, and that's all we need to know on some days. Jesus also took them a little further, and he helped them together to understand as a larger community the nature of the spiritual life. What's interesting to me is that a lot of what he did on the Emmaus Road with the two disciples, he's now doing with the larger community as they gather. And so you know that on the Emmaus Road, Jesus said those profound words to the disciples, was it not necessary for the Messiah to suffer these things before going into glory? And Jesus was describing the nature of the spiritual life, what we call in the tradition the Pascal rhythm of death, burial, and resurrection, that this is a rhythm of the spiritual life that we need to understand, that the Christian life does not always appear to be up and to the right. And in that way, it really goes against American culture, because American culture always defines success by being up and to the right. But a true spiritual journey is never completely up and to the right. Jesus was teaching through his very life and through his interpretation that the spiritual life in its essence for all of us will always involve suffering, death, burial, and resurrection. And why is that? Because there are things in each one of us that are either sinful. Now, let me be clear. Jesus did not have sin, so that's not what I'm saying. There are sinful things in us as human beings that need to die, but there's also things in us that are just plain limiting. They're no longer needed for the work that God is going to do in our lives. There are things that we can set aside to run the race. And I believe that's what the meaning of Jesus' death was in his life, was that that physical body was no longer needed. It was needed for the three years that he was here on the earth, but it wasn't needed for what God wanted him to do now, and so he was able to let it go. And it's the same for us, and Jesus is saying it again. He's saying, you need to understand that this was necessary for me. I had to die and be buried in order to be raised to new life. And in fact, it's going to be the same for you as well. And this is such an important truth of the spiritual life that I want to tell all of you about it together so that you don't mistake it when it happens. That there are things within us that need to die, that we need to die to our life, small l, so that life, that which is life indeed, capital L, the kingdom of God, resurrection, newness of life, so that that can come in our lives, there may be some things that need to die. And so this was so important that Jesus explained it again now to the larger group of disciples in this transforming community so that they could all understand together the nature of the spiritual life and embrace the spiritual life together. And we can see also in this story that transforming community involves rigor. He goes on to talk about repentance and forgiveness. He says, you know, this is what's required. Practices like repentance and forgiveness are required for this kind of life to unfold among you. This is not a social club. Let's be clear about that. This community, transforming community, is not a social club that just makes you feel good all the time. There is a need for repentance and for forgiveness. There is a need for intention and rigor to take place around what we're doing here, around this issue of transformation. And then there's the punchline. We've got the peace that Jesus brings. We've got Jesus' presence that he brings. We've got the perspective that he brings. And then there's a punchline. you are witnesses of these things. Boom! Almost immediately we discover that yet another truth of the spiritual life is this, that even as our own journey of transformation brings joy and meaning to our own lives, it is also for the sake of others, for the sake of the world that God sent Jesus to seek and to save. You are witnesses of these things in the world that Jesus came to seek and to save. What are you a witness to? See, that's the question. Do you wonder that? I wonder that when he says you are witnesses of these things. What is the these things that he's referring to? Well, I think one thing he's referring to is you're witnesses to this transformation in yourselves and each other. You have witnessed transformation in yourselves and each other and even in me. Does that strike you about that passage? That Jesus is now transformed in their midst? Jesus doesn't look the same as he did before. He's been transformed too. And Jesus says, you are witnesses of these things. You are witnesses of these transforming encounters. These transforming encounters that have transformed you utterly. And your story has been given to you for the sake of others. The story of your transformation in my presence has been given to you so that you can witness to these things in the world beyond. What else? Well, the transformation that's taken place in this little community of followers. You're different now together. The things you're talking about are different together. What you're experiencing is different than what it was before. You've been transformed in community as well. You are witnesses of the transformation that my presence brings in your community. What else? You're witnesses to the ways in which this necessary rhythm of death, burial, and resurrection and your own life has brought you into new life, bigger life, more life, life with a capital L. You're witnesses of these things for the sake of others. And so we can see that this idea of going out into the world, there is this necessary chronology. Chronology is important, and that is that the journey inward, the journey into the presence of Christ, the journey in which we encounter Christ personally and privately must proceed the journey outward or else we have, number one, no basis for our togetherness in community. If we're not experiencing transformation in our lives personally in Jesus' presence, we don't have any basis for gathering together in community. And furthermore, we don't have anything to share. We don't have anything compelling to share to the world beyond. But when everything is working as it should, our own transformation leads quite naturally to the journey outward. So you have the journey inward and the journey outward. The journey outward to be with others who are experiencing transformation in Christ's presence and the journey that has to do with a sense of mission in the world beyond. And the reason that chronology is important is that we must be deeply grounded in the unconditional love of God for ourselves. We must be experiencing the transformation of Christ's presence in our own lives before we can invite anyone else to a transformational journey. Can I get an amen? Amen. So what I see here, and it's a rhythm that sort of connects the dots, I see here the sacred rhythm of life in transforming community, and that is that we experience transformation so that we're able to discern the will of God, so that we're able to do the will of God, which is our mission in the world. Transformation, discernment, and mission. Because it's impossible for us to discern what we're supposed to do out there if we don't have this live, living relationship with Christ where he says, you are witnesses of these things. This is where I'm calling you to be. This is your mission given to you by me here personally as we're together. And this is the rhythm of transforming community. You enter into your own process of transformation. That makes it possible for you to discern my will. then you're going to get out there and do my will, which is your mission in the world. And so I believe that that's our invitation as we continue and finish out this Emmaus Road story, is to realize that transformation in Christ's presence is what prepares us to have any kind of good news to share with others. And in fact, we could actually define evangelism as an invitation to spiritual transformation. That's how I like to describe it. We're not inviting people just to have some fire insurance for after they die. We're actually inviting people to a transformational journey. And evangelism is an invitation to spiritual transformation offered by someone who can bear witness to that transformation in his or her own life. So my question to you is, what's your story? What's your story of transformation? Do you have one? Have you claimed it? Have you grasped it enough so that you could tell somebody else about it? let me tell you my story 20 years ago 15 years ago now something like that I guess it's almost 20 now wow time goes really fast but I came to a wall as many of you know in my own spiritual life and at that point God just knocked me right out of ministry and right out of all the doing and the achieving because something inside just wasn't right and so I got off the treadmill of ministry and I went into a deep time of quiet and being present and open and receptive to God. And it was very, very scary to let go of all the ways that I had been achieving and performing in my Christian life up until then. And when I realized that there wasn't a real deep level of transformation taking place in my own life, and I realized that I was missing true intimacy with God, I realized that I needed to stop for a while and pay attention. And I did for a couple years. I actually left my life really in the company of others and entered into a long season of solitude and self-examination and reflection and spiritual direction. And I had no idea at the time, no idea at all that it was for anybody else but myself. I was just trying to get myself back on my horse. I had no idea. And so I stayed faithful to that journey of transformation. I stayed faithful because I believed that the work that God wanted to do in me was important work, and I wanted to give myself to it in an unencumbered way. And so I did that, and God did a deep work in me, and I met God in new ways in that time of solitude, silence, and spiritual direction, again having no idea that God would have anything else for anybody else from it. And lo and behold, a couple years into it, God began to call me back, and there were other Christians who said, you know, whatever that is that's going on in your life. Could you share a little bit of that with me? And then I was in a church, and there were some people there who said, you know, what you're experiencing. We think that would be really good for us. Could you share that with us? And my whole journey to coming back onto a church staff and doing a whole different thing that I'd ever done before took place right then and there. And then after a while, there was a sense that there were other pastors and leaders who needed to, you know, have some periods of time of paying attention, and were asking, could you come share that with us? And so eventually the ministry of the Transforming Center emerged. but everything I'm doing in my life right this moment which is so deeply for the sake of others happened because I was willing to do what God was calling me to do in my own personal spiritual transformation back then but it was not for myself and myself alone it was for the sake of others and when people ask me how in the world did you end up doing what you do here all I can think about is that tender little vulnerable fragile time in my own life when God was doing a work in me and that's my story, and I claim it, and this is where I stand. Every time I get up to speak to other people, I stand on the strength of my own story and what Jesus has done in my life, and so friends, what is your story today? What is your story of transformation? Do you have it clear enough in your own heart and in your own head to share it with somebody else? That's what Jesus says to us now. Jesus says you are witnesses of these things, both as individuals and as a whole community. You are witnesses of what Jesus has done in you and among you. And now get out there and share it. And so we discover also one last and final thing is that it is our own transformation that becomes that witness in the world. Not only is it about the words we say, it's about our very life that becomes a witness. Dallas Willard, who is someone who we all love and remember, he says that when the identified people of Christ reach a certain level of growth and don't go on, they limit their evangelistic potential. Why? Because the witness of the identified people of Christ to the reality of God in their own lives is weak, and it actually becomes a testimony to the contrary. So to have earth-shaking evangelism, you have to have a different quality of persons, and that is what spiritual formation is all about. Amen. That's our man speaking to us from eternity. So it turns out that the best evangelists are people just like the disciples on the Emmaus Road who couldn't wait to tell others what had happened to them on the road and how Jesus had met them. And so one last phrase from this story, and that is, let us be very careful not to go out and do this in our own power. Jesus says in the very final phrase of the verse, wait until you receive my power. And so be very, very careful that you don't get so excited about what God could do in and through your life that you go out there and try to wreak havoc on your own strength. But wait, wait for the call of God on your life. Wait until you have a sense of what your own story is and that you're empowered in that. wait for the power that is on high, and do it through the power that is on high. And that's where we see the connection between transformation, discernment, and mission. That we cannot discern our mission unless we've been involved in an intentional, ongoing process of transformation. And our mission, our evangelistic witness cannot be sustained without an ongoing connection to the power of God that He will give us to do what He is calling us to do in the world. Too many people have gone out into the world to try to do big things on their own power and their own power alone. And man, it's a flash in the pan. It can be a very big flash, but it only lasts for a certain amount of time because they can't sustain it. So in order for us to sustain our witness and our mission in the world, we have to keep relying and coming back to the place where God empowers us for what He is calling us to do. And so then we come back to attention to our transformation, and then God moves us to discern more of what He wants us to do in the world. And then we get out there and do the will of God in the world, which is our mission. And then we come to the end of our powers, and then we come back, you know, into that prayer place, and we receive the power that we need. And then we go out again, and that is the sacred rhythm of our life in community as our transformation is experienced as being for the world. So friends, as I have been involved in such a long-term journey with you, this is what I see for you. It's what I wanted to give you today out of the story of Emmaus. I wanted to finish the story. I wanted to make it clear that as we are together in transforming community, we discover that there is a shared mission that God has in mind for us, something we are called to do together for the sake of the world. And together we learn to live within a constellation of beautiful paradoxes that are held together in creative tension. And I know some of you are feeling the tension, but we're going to have to be willing to live in the creative tension. We're going to have to be willing to live in the paradox, the paradox of silence and word, the paradox of prayer and action, the paradox of solitude and community, work and rest, discerning and doing, formation and mission, just like the disciples who journeyed from Jerusalem to Emmaus and back again. Here in this community, we will learn how to move into the center and out and then back again, and at every point along the way, Jesus' presence is there giving us peace, assuring us that his presence is real, giving us perspective in and through the scriptures, and then always giving us that punchline, you are witnesses of these things. Let's stand together for a closing prayer. As we stand here together today, I hope that you can feel your story in your own heart, the places where Jesus has transformed you, and you're feeling the power of the Holy Spirit surge within you and through you to share that story with people who need to hear it. Claim your story. Grasp it fully. Understand how it happened to the best of your ability. And be willing to share it when that is what's called for. So let's pray this prayer for going forth into the world and turning our eyes to the world beyond. As Abraham left his home and the security of all he had known, so we lay down what is past and we look to the future. As Mary washed Jesus' feet with oil and hair, so we take into daily life signs of hope and healing, stories of hope and healing. As the disciples recognized Jesus and returned to Jerusalem to tell what had happened on the road, so we reach beyond ourselves to share the lives of others and touch a wider world. as Esther stepped out in faith for such a time as this, so we take courage to do what God has called us to do. Amen. Amen.
