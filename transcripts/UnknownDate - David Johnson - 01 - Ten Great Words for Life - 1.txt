Exodus chapter 20 holds for us one of the most magnificent expressions of God's heart for his people in all of Scripture. This is coming, as you know, in the context of a larger study, the study of the pilgrimage of faith of not only Moses but the people of God. We know this particular section, Exodus 20, commonly as the Ten Commandments. It is also known as the Decalogue. Deca meaning ten, log or logos meaning word or words. They are the ten great words of God for life. Delivered to, and it's very important that you understand this contextually, delivered to his already redeemed, purchased for himself by the blood of the Lamb people, designed to already redeemed people show them how to live and flourish in the freedom and deliverance that he had already brought them to. Understanding that these words were delivered to already redeemed people is going to open your mind and heart significantly to what these words really mean. The ten great words are these, starting in verse 3. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. You shall not worship them or serve them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. Verse 7. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. Verse 8. Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy. Verse 12. Honor your father and mother that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor. Now, my paraphrase of that is this. And I thought it would be helpful to do this. And I want it before us the entire time we go through this. The ten great words of God for life are these. Put God first and accept no substitutes. Revere God's name. Observe his day. Respect your parents. Don't kill human beings. Limit sex to marriage. Don't steal. Don't lie. And don't enviously desire what doesn't belong to you. Now it occurs to me that as I give that, while most of us know, probably all of us know about the Ten Commandments, it's possible that maybe more than we would like to admit, more of us than we'd like to admit, don't really know or didn't really know what they were. Maybe even this morning couldn't have listed them, so there they are. Now, as magnificent as these words, in fact, are, and they are, they are also often misunderstood and misapplied, even by some resented and feared, not only by the culture that would disregard them out of hand, but even by some who would identify themselves as followers of God and disciples of Christ. For the impression of many is this, that in giving the Ten Commandments, God effectively found a way to spoil our fun. That basically, God's heart and desire in the giving of these ten great words is to make our life as rigid, cold, and austere as was possible. To some people, the Ten Commandments are the spiritual equivalent of a sourpuss parent slapping the hand of a child who's reaching for their favorite flavor of cake or candy, saying, no, you can't have the really nice things. That would be altogether too enjoyable. Thou shalt not. And all the thou shalt nots need to come with the corresponding scowl on the face. And the impression begins to be built. Again, it's hardly ever articulated this way, but the impression in our soul is kind of like this. If you follow God and obey his precepts, you won't burn in hell, and that's good, but your life is going to be incredibly dry, dull, and altogether lifeless. There's only going to be one flavor. I hope you like vanilla. There's only going to be one color, maybe two, black and white. The Puritans had it right. Well, the fact is this, nothing could be further from the truth. For these great words of life are descriptions of life beyond what we could imagine. They are words that invite us to unspeakable joy. Regardless, there are still some who live with the impression that God gave them knowing that we'd break them and that he takes some special delight in hammering us when we do. Even for some believers, the Ten Commandments and any call for adherence to them smacks of legalism. And we cite scriptures when we would embrace that way of thought. Scriptures like this, we are not under law, we're under grace. Therefore, the law has no bearing on our life. Christ redeemed us from the law, having become a curse for us, so the law is set aside. If righteousness comes through performing the law, then Christ died needlessly, Paul said in Galatians. And here's the deal about that. All of that is true. The performing of the law has no power to save, redeem, or heal anybody. That, in fact, is the gospel. For we have been saved by grace through faith. And that not of yourselves, it is a gift, not of works, lest any man should boast. Problem. Some have come to believe that because it's true we're saved by grace and not by law, that the law of God is therefore of no value, of no benefit to our lives now. That it has no bearing or influence on our living today. That obedience to it and living by it is absolutely optional. and that those who preach it and call people to it as a healthy, happy, holy way of life are somehow branded legalists. And before you know it, we have self-proclaimed followers of God, disciples of Christ, who believe and act as if the law of God were a bad thing. It's restrictive. I'm free. It's confining. It's antithetical to grace, according to some. The frightening result of that is this. People calling themselves Christians but think and live and act no differently than the culture, the culture which dismisses the law of God out of hand. And if you are of that mental framework relative to the law of God, I need to say as gently but firmly as I can this morning, you are in very dangerous territory. Get this. The balance needs to be fought for and understood. The law of God as originally given by God to Moses in Exodus chapter 20 was not given. It was never given as a means by which people could secure redemption. Let me explain this. And it's part of the excitement I have around this text. Over the years, one of the delightful things that I've been able to experience, because we just go through texts, verse by verse, chapter by chapter, is often, my experience personally, is that I will come across something in chapter 5 of some book that has been preceded by months of teaching. And because of the months of teaching, because I knew what was coming, all of a sudden I look at this fifth chapter, whatever it might be, an entirely different way because of the context. Chapter 20 of Exodus is an example of that very kind of thing. What we need to keep in mind contextually is what has happened up to chapter 20. We need to remember that when God gives this to the people of God, they are already the people of God. They have already been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb. Know that? Chapter 3. They have already been delivered through the water. They have already come through the Red Sea. The elements of their old life, Egypt, embodied in Pharaoh, were coming back not to kill them, but to re-enslave them. all over again. And we talked a couple of weeks ago about how God called the people out, told them to go forward. He would part the Red Sea, and they got deliverance. They've already had their bitter water turned sweet. They've been experiencing healing. God has already provided for them water through the rock and manna for bread. And last week around the table, we heard Jesus in the Gospels say, I tell you what, Moses provided manna and water in the wilderness, and I'm here to tell you that I am the manna and I am the water. I am the daily provision. We're talking to people who are already experiencing Jesus as their manna, already redeemed people. The 10 great words of God do not come to Egyptians. They do not come to people who are already in slavery as a way for them to get out of slavery. These 10 great words of God were given to already possessed by him people as a gift. They were given as a resource, as an incredible resource to help God's people, you and I, the already redeemed, to know how to live in the freedom we already have. Now, the key to this understanding is most visibly apparent in chapter 20, verse 2. I didn't read this verse when we went through the 10 great words, but we have to do it because it sets up our understanding. And by the way, just so you know, what I'm doing today is kind of laying the foundation. I don't have an outline today, and it might make it a little more difficult than normal to follow. I'm quite confident you'll be able to follow, but it's absolutely critical for our understanding the next several weeks. Verse 2, let's start with verse 1, sets up the whole thing. Then God spoke all these words, saying, I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. It's very exciting and very significant that God begins, before he speaks the ten great words, by reminding them of two things. Number one, he reminds them of who he is. I am the Lord your God, who has already redeemed you, who has already delivered you, I have already turned your bitter water sweet, and I have already on a daily basis begun to provide you with water and manna. Secondly, he reminds them of who they are. You are my brought out ones. You are my redeemed. Chapter 19, verse 5. also part of setting the context for the ten great words, says this, You are my prized possession. You are my special treasure. Because all of that is true, therefore I am calling you, who are already my people, to live this way. Well, when I got that flow, that kind of structure, I got really excited because I've seen this before. Do you know that this is exactly what the Apostle Paul does in almost every single one of his epistles? If you've ever studied Paul, you know that in almost every one of his epistles, the first half of his letters, he spends telling his readers who God is, who they are because of who God is, and how it is that grace works. And what Paul says in Galatians and Ephesians and Philippians and Romans in a variety of different ways at the beginnings of all of his epistles is this. Here's how grace works. Grace redeems you. It's the only thing that has power to redeem you. Your works can't do it. Grace delivers you. Grace has the power to turn your bitter water sweet. And grace provides you as a gift of God's dear son the water that we need and the bread that we need. It is indeed his dear son that is the water and the bread. But I need you to know, says Paul over and over again, that the grace that has redeemed you and delivered you and healed you is now calling you, same grace, is now calling you to live a different way that is consistent with the freedom that you have. Romans, first 11 chapters. Paul speaks of who they are in Christ. It is the epistle of grace. And everybody who knows anything at all about Romans knows that it's probably the most complete anthology, if you will, of the gospel of grace. Eleven chapters. Here's who you are. Here's who God is. Here's how grace works. Chapter 12, he says then this. I urge you, therefore, because all of that grace is true, by the mercies of God, here's what I want you to do. present your bodies a living sacrifice acceptable to God. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. And through chapter 16, Paul delineates how it is that men and women already redeemed can continue to walk in freedom by the grace that's already been lavished on them. Ephesians, he does the same thing for four chapters. He tells them who they are in Christ. Chapter 1, verse 14. In him we already have redemption through his Son, the forgiveness of our sins according to the riches of his grace. Therefore, because that's true, chapter 5, verse 1, be imitators of God. Walk in love. Don't let immorality, impurity, or greed even be named among you. Why? Because those things are not consistent with who you are. You belong to me. You are my prized possession. You are my special treasure. In fact, you're twice mine. I want you somehow to hear the heart of God as it comes around that phrase. God, looking at you and looking at me, says, you're twice mine. What do you mean? What he means is this. I created you. Go back in your mind to Genesis chapter 1. As we're right now in Exodus chapter 20. It's not that far back. Genesis chapter 1. I made you. I formed you from the dust of the earth. And when I made you and I made Eve and Adam together, I looked at it and it was what? Good. And we walked in the cool of the day. And we talked eye to eye. And it was a communion and an intimacy that quite frankly you were made for. I made you for this purpose. but you wandered away into soul-stealing slavery. And in Exodus 3, the people had wandered away into Egypt and Egypt was a symbol of slavery but the slavery to sin relative to humanity had happened long before Egypt. Egypt, as you know through our study, has simply been a symbol of this kind of bondage. And when you wandered away, even in the garden, I came searching for you. God is relentlessly pursuing his creation has been from the beginning with words like this. Adam, Adam, where are you? Always seeking to reconcile. And in Exodus chapter 3, verse 7, the words of reconciliation sounded just like this. I saw your affliction. I heard your cry. I was aware of your suffering and even your slavery in Egypt. Therefore, I have come down. Why? to deliver you from the power of Egypt. Exodus 20, verse 2, same thing. I am the Lord your God who brought you out. You're twice mine. I created you, you wandered away, and I have purchased you for myself. To which Paul says wonderfully, and this captures the heart of truly redeemed people in 1 Corinthians 6, verse 20. He says essentially this, God, when it dawns on me that your view of me is that I'm twice yours, I want you to know that is exactly how I see myself. I see myself. My entire identity and reason for existence is wrapped up in this reality. I am twice yours, for I have been bought with a price. I was created by you, but I have been purchased by your precious blood. Therefore, my deepest desire is to glorify you with this body. Help me by your spirit's power, parentheses, by your spirit's power, because that is the only hope I ever have of doing this, to live continually in the freedom that you have already secured for me. Listen, extremely important that we understand this before any study of the law of God. The law of God was not given to people who were in slavery as a way to get out of slavery. The law has no power to save you or to heal you. And when you use the law for that, it will damn you. Only God can redeem. And when he does its all of grace, the law was given, the ten great words of life were given to people who were already possessed by him and they were given as a gift, as an incredible resource to help us learn how to continually live in the freedom that we already have. You want to stay free? You want to not be subject again to the yoke of slavery you had in Egypt? Well, here's how. Put me first. Accept no substitutes. Revere my name. And on and on through the list. Wednesday night at the Crystal Building we had a prayer meeting you know about it we called it a solemn assembly where we would gather to worship and pray the agenda was to bring our need for a church home as a body to the Father but as we went to prayer the instruction that we gave to everyone was to not just talk to God and bring our petition though we were going to do that, but we wanted to listen to God, even as we were praying. We broke off into small groups, and again, the instruction, we shared some things that we wanted them specifically to pray about, but we want to listen to God as well. And after about, I don't know, it was about half an hour or so of those small groups praying, we came back together again, and the first thing we wanted to know was, what were you hearing from God? Not just what you said, but what was God saying to you, and therefore to us? What are some wonderful things that came primarily among them was this. That more important than God providing for us a physical building, that God wanted to build among us, specifically here at Church of the Open Door, and experience a real experience of community like we have never experienced here before. In fact, one of the things that several of them pointed out, and in fact this was all independent, and all these different groups that came off really strong, that some of us have kind of had this idea that when we have a permanent place, that's when community will happen. Some of you might even thought, it's going to be so much easier. And you know what I think? I think it is going to be easier. When we have a permanent place, community is going to be easier. But the thing that we really believed God was saying to us that day was, you need to understand, I'm calling you to community now. I'm calling you to the community now. In fact, if you don't begin to walk significantly in that now, you're never going to get to the physical building. I mean, and that's even in nuts and bolts kinds of things. If people don't have a greater sense of their own identification, not with a church necessarily, but with a people. Remember a few weeks ago in Moses, I talked about the fact that there are times we need to come to a place where we say, warts and all, I identify myself with this people. Well, if that doesn't happen, the money's not even going to be there. If you don't feel invested to build a home, that's not even going to be there. So we were talking about community, how much more important that was than even the building. Well, as we were talking about that, and it felt very real to me, I was thinking about this text, obviously, because I was studying, and it had been all day. I want this talk about community. And with the word that was coming to me out of the text, I began to wonder, and what I would like to do as I go into this now is invite you into my wondering, invite you into my dream. My wondering was this. I wonder, Lord, what would it look like? How would it feel to be part of a community of faith, of already redeemed people? That's not even the issue. We already understand. We are possessed by God. But to be amongst a group of people like that, who had an unquenchable desire to put God first and accept no substitutes. Not even that we were always doing it perfectly, but I'll tell you what, from our toes, the deepest desire we had would be to figure out what that looked like, even to be open to the possibilities that we are fashioning God in ways we don't even see right now, to our own image and our own liking. And when we see that we're doing that, we repent. What would it feel like to be among a group of people like that? Wouldn't that be incredible? That's what I began to think. Wouldn't that be incredible? well what would it feel like Lord to be among a group of redeemed people where the agenda and direction of the church was not determined by the latest fad or some high powered spiritually sounding egomaniac pastor serious but to be among a group of people who really were committed to they had an unquenchable desire to be part of something that was being directed and whose agenda was being decided by the very breath and voice and hand and heart of God. Put God first. Accept no substitutes and I will give to you the kingdom of God on earth in your church. Dream with me. What it feel like to be in a place where the name of God was revered. I don't mean the name of God was spoken. I don't mean God speak I don't mean religious talk I mean a people who deepen their spirits when they hear the name of God and they understand the character of God and they get a taste and a glimpse of his glory and his grace toward them they just get a little weak in the knees because they recognize that that name of Jesus is above every name and one day at the name of Jesus every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father. And because it's true that one day every knee will bow, I'm bowing now. What would it feel like to be among a people who revered the name of God so that when the name of God was invoked, they believed that by this name people are redeemed and people are delivered and people are healed. What did that feel like? What did it feel like? Dream with me about being in a place where I didn't have to guard my heart, where I didn't have to be afraid of you. And there may be many reasons why I wouldn't have to be afraid of you, but in this great word list here, the reason I wouldn't have to be afraid of you is because this would be a community where people didn't lie. They told the truth. and so I didn't have to walk around wondering what you really meant by that you know what that feels like don't you and I didn't have to worry about the code that everybody used and how they would say this but they really meant that and spend the rest of the day wondering if I was insulted or not therefore creating a way of life that walks around with my heart guarded from would you just dream with me a little bit of what it would feel like to be where you didn't have to guard your heart because people didn't lie what would it feel like to be a wife who felt safe and secure in the exclusive embrace of her husband? What would it feel like to be a husband who felt safe and secure in the exclusive embrace of his wife and didn't even have to wonder if this husband or this wife was wishing they were somewhere else or wishing you were someone else, didn't even have to wonder. And some of you are going, well, you're living in a dream world. I'm telling you it's a dream. I'm just asking you, what would it feel like? And if you're tracking with me, one of the things that you'd be saying was, why that would be heaven. Exactly. The kingdom of heaven. this is a description of this is a call to the kingdom of heaven life there is a way that short of eternity we will never fully experience this but you need to understand we were made for this to be a people who put God first who accept no substitutes, who revere his name. This is exactly what we were created for, and it's exactly what he's calling us to. It's called kingdom life. You see, this is wonderful. It's exciting. The heart of God, you see, is so full of love for us that he could have been but was not satisfied with just redeeming us. It's incredible. Should have been enough. He wasn't satisfied with just delivering us from our old life. He wasn't even satisfied with turning our bitter water sweet, which he continually does all our life. He's not even satisfied with being our water and being our bread. You know where he wants to bring us? Not just to deliverance, but to the fulfillment of our destiny. He wants your fulfillment as a human being. Already redeemed, I call you now into kingdom life. Hear the heart of God for his people. In Jeremiah 29, verse 11, I know the plans I have for you. They're good plans. You're going to love these plans. They are plans for welfare and not calamity. They are designed to give you a future and a hope. And that is why I want you to walk in these plans, to experience them fully and realize your destiny. Here's how. Put me first. Accept no substitutes. Revere my name. Observe my day. Honor your parents, be devoted to and cherish your spouse. Don't steal, tell the truth. And as you walk in this kingdom life, you will experience, begin to taste the kingdom of God on earth. The law giver gives the law in chapter 20. The scowl on the face is how most of us hear the law. you need to hear and if you get nothing else this morning out of this then this, that will be enough you need to hear that the heart of the lawgiver is the heart of a lover Exodus 19 verse 4 I told you that over there sets the context for these ten great words as well and this is a verse that we dealt with a couple of weeks ago the imagery is wonderful, you yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. If you were here a few weeks ago, I told you what that meant. He's speaking of what his action was in their life when he brought them out of Egypt and through the Red Sea. What I was doing, he says, is I was burying you on eagles' wings. You were born on eagles' wings. And what I made clear a few weeks ago was that did not mean God was just carrying them the whole time. For the analogy of being born on eagles' wings is not just the eagle carrying its young everywhere they want to go, but of the eagle parent having a desire for the baby eagle to fulfill its destiny as an eagle. Therefore, there came a time when it was going to soar to the heights, bearing this little eagle on its wings, and then dip the wing and let it fall. And the eagle, remember that? I'm dying and not going to make it. And the father, the eagle, swoops down and recognizes, this is, you're not going to die. I'm going to soar. And they swoop him back up to the heights, and they do it again. And they pick him up and they do it again. And before you know it, however, that little eagle begins to fly and begins to enter into the fullness of its identity as an eagle and do things it never thought it could. And it wouldn't have happened any other way. You need to understand, says God in verse 4, when I led you out of Egypt and I brought you through the Red Sea, I did it on eagle's wings. I made the way. There is no doubt about it. I'm the one who brought the plagues. I did the miraculous thing. I shed the blood. but I did not just pick you up and bring deposit you for you know that even as I opened up the Red Sea you had to believe and had you not believed you would have never walked through the water I parted the Red Sea but you had to go and you had to move forward and you know what I provided the bread but you had to go pick it up and that bread would have been there every single morning but had you not walked out your door and gathered that manna for yourself You would have gone hungry. There were times in my interacting with you, my children, that you were terrified. Like the eagle. I'm so good at me. And one of the reasons I allowed that was because I had more in mind for you than just your redemption and just your deliverance. My heart for you was the fulfillment of your destiny as my child, as my holy people. in verse 5 chapter 9 he refers to them as my own possession among all the people other translations say you will be my special treasure for all the earth is mine I love that verse because it is the language of a lover drawing near an analogy we are familiar with in the new in the new testament is that we are the bride of Christ and Jesus is our groom. That is very much the imagery here. As he says, you're my special treasure. All the earth is mine. And it's as if the groom says to us, I'm a very wealthy person. And everything I have, I will give to you. I will share it all with you. Nothing will I withhold from you. Just one thing. Have no other lovers. Let me be your betrothed. Only me. I'm calling you to trust me and believe me and follow me above everything. Love me with all your heart and all your soul and all your mind and you will be a treasure to me. I will be to you the best husband. I will be to you the groom of your dreams. I will provide for you and I will empower you to reach your destiny as my child. Verse 6 And I will give you, as this continues to emerge, I will make you a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. the word kingdom there is wonderful we've taught on this before but it contains the notion of dominion and rule and in this particular context because of their prior slavery it speaks of regained rule think about that this way the story of our lives every single one of us is the story of some degree of disorder can I get a witness to that? yes it's a story of an inability to effectively manage our lives. That is just true of every single one of us. This word kingdom speaks to the recovering of what has been lost of our ability to regulate and govern our own lives. The kingdom of God, the rule of God, is to know the rule of God. That is to understand and live in His order of things. So that now, instead of my life running me, credibly, I run my life. I mean maybe I'm going to have to ask you to dream about that to even comprehend that as well but when I lay that before you and talk about the rule of God and his order of things this being his order of things this is how life works the possibility of our life not running us and us running our lives is called having dominion over your life. And guess what? Does that word sound familiar? You know where you heard it? Genesis chapter 1. When he made the earth and he gave to Adam and Eve dominion. I don't want life to run you. I want you to live as kings. See, we think rich and famous. No, men and women who have dominion over their life because they're living his order of things. What is the order? How does this work? It begins here where God's people more and more come together and say, Oh, Father, our deepest desire, we are so thankful for your grace. We are so thankful that you have made us new creatures in Christ because none of this would even be possible had we not been given brand new hearts by your spirit. But now with a new heart, We come to you and say, here's what we want to put you first, to accept those substitutes, for you to even help us see subtle ways that we've accepted substitutes so we can repent. And we want to learn what it means to revere your name and observe your day and honor our parents and all the work that that might be. And not to kill. Oh, that'll be an easy one. I might even skip that day because killing is nothing I have a problem with until you realize that there's more than one way to kill somebody. For with our mouth, we can shred people and kill a spirit. I don't want to kill anybody anymore. I want to walk in kingdom truth in order to be devoted to and cherish my one and only spouse. And not to lie. Be so committed to this image that you think this thing of me that I lie all the time. I don't want to do that. I want to walk in kingdom stuff. wrap this up I need to say it again or we will never move into this word as deeply as we need to these ten great words from God do not describe what we need to do to get redeemed they do not describe what we need to do to get God to like us more we are already, if redeemed, his prized possession in fact, again, if you use the law that way it will be for you death for there is none who are righteous there are none who have kept these words. No, not one. Our only hope for redemption, deliverance, and healing is the blood of Christ, the work of the Spirit, the power of God to make us new on the inside. The ten great words for life were written to people already redeemed. I am already your God. I have already brought you out. You have a new identity. You have a new name. You are already my possession, my special treasure. I know the plans I have for you. You know, I even hear that phrase now, almost with a tinge of frustration. As we walk away and do it our own way, I hear God saying, Oh, you guys, I know the plans. They're good plans. Believe me. Walk my way. Don't go that way. I have such good plans for you. I have great plans. Therefore, don't commit adultery. Why? Because it doesn't work. and it'll hinder the plan. It will damage your soul. It will wound the heart of your spouse and I don't even want to get into what it will do to your children in terms of long-going problems with trust and safety and even their own ability to walk in commitment and fidelity. Can God heal that? Absolutely. That's what healing's about. That's what deliverance is about. That's what redemption is about. That's what grace is about. But don't lie and don't steal and don't covet. Why? Because it doesn't work. And don't put your hope in gods of your own making. Why? It's really simple. Because gods that you've created for your own comfort and even to accommodate sometimes your own sin, those gods can't help you in your day of calamity. And those gods will have no power to redeem you, to deliver you, heal you, or provide for you. but if you put your hope in me I have such plans for you. I promise you that if my people will humble themselves and call on my name I will heal their land. You put your hope in me I will continue your whole life to deliver you and heal you and provide for you and sanctify you and transform you till Christ be formed in you. And that is your destiny. Right there. I asked God late in the week how to close. I wasn't sure. The only thing I got was this, that there may be a need for some in response to this word to repent. And not so much to behaviors. That may be there, but that's not what I got. What I got was a need for some possibly to repent. That is, to change your mind about the law. The ten great words of God. For some of you, because of what you think is your understanding of grace, have decided that none of this applies to you. I think you need to change your mind. You see, the ten great words of God are not the enemy. They are not restrictive, designed to steal your joy. This is not legalistic. Indeed, these ten great words call us to the deepest dimensions of kingdom life, where, by the living spirit of God within, the character of Christ is formed in us. My prayer for this series, and I pray that you would join me in this prayer, is that we as a church, as individuals and as a people, would echo the heart of the psalmist David when he said, Oh, how I love, I love your law. What a gift it is to us. For it is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. And when I think of the dark world I live in, I think, God, thank you. Thank you for a word that tells us where to put our feet and where not to put our feet. Oh, I love your law because it tells us the truth. And we live in a world that does nothing but tell us lies. It shows us where to walk and it points us straight to God. It points us straight to our Redeemer, who is our only hope of ever walking in this kingdom truth. But enter into this series with a spirit of thankfulness that says as we walk into them one by one, thank you, Father, for the ten great words for life. We would walk in them. I'd like you to stand with me as we close. I'm going to ask the altar team to come and take their place in front and receive anyone who needs prayer for anything this morning, even as I pray, but I'd like to pray as we close Father, this is my third time through this and even after three times, my heart is just full the wonder of your word the timelessness of this truth there is so much grace here you love us beyond what we can imagine but you call us to things that are deeper than what we know and they're good things so that we can fulfill our destiny as your children I pray in your name that those who may need even today to change their mind about your precious word relative to how we live would enter into that repentance so that even as we go through this series, their spirits would be ready to receive the word that will sanctify and transform by your spirit. Thank you, God, for your work among us, how you speak to us week after week through your word, and in the worship, minister to our lives and call us to yourself. I pray your blessing on us as we leave and all God's people said, Amen.
