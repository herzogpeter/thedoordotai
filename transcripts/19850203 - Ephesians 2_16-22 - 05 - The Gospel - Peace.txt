Turn with me to the book of Ephesians, chapter 2, verse 16. The work that's being done here is the work of Christ, and he's reconciling them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity or the strife, the hostility. And he, Jesus, came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to you who were near. For through him we both have our access in one spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and are of the household of God. Let's pray. Lord, again we come to you and we thank you and praise you for your word and what it can do in our lives. And Father, we pray that your word would do its work in our life. And Father, that you would be our teacher this morning. In Jesus' name, amen. We've been in Ephesians almost three months now. And this study has been rather theological, especially at the beginning. It's been rather theological. And I realize that. We've had terms like positional truth. We've been talking about things like election and redemption and security of the believer and being sealed in the spirit. A person came up to me not too long ago and says, you know, you're very cognitive in these sermons in Ephesians. It's very cognitive. And soon as I heard him say that to me, I went to my office to look that word up to find out what it was that I was being. But it is. It's theological. But I want to assure you that we're not trying to be theological. And we're not trying to be cognitive. What we're trying to do is deal with the text and deal with the things that Paul wants us to know. And one of the things we've discovered is that Paul has felt it very essential for the believer first, before he begins to talk about his practice, to begin first to talk about his position. You need to know who you are and what you have in Christ before you're ever ready to hear the exhortations to come on and live the Christian life. You see, there are several approaches to preaching, and one of them is the cheerleader method. We've talked about that. It's one that I enjoy. But that's where every Sunday we kind of get together and what we have is a halftime pep talk. And everybody just gets jacked up and pumped up and we're just all supposed to go out and do it, do it, do it, you know. The problem is that if that's all we're getting, then we go out and do it, but we don't exactly know what it is that we're supposed to be doing. And Paul says there's nothing wrong with cheerleader preaching. In fact, we're going to get to chapter 4 and he's going to get there and say, therefore, do it. Get out there and do it. But before you go out and fight the battle, you need to know how to fight the battle. You need to have some teaching. You need to have some theology. You need to know how to play the game. And that's why in chapters 1 through 3, we talk about theology. We talk about the position of the believer. We talk about who we are in Christ. We talk about what we have in Christ. And then in chapter 4, he says, Because of all those things, therefore, live it. Now do it. We've learned some important things. We've seen that before the foundation of the world, we were chosen in him so that we could stand before God blameless, holy. We talked about the fact that we've been bought out of the marketplace, that we've been forgiven and accepted in the beloved one, that we've been sealed in the spirit. And we've learned again how important it is to know our position in Christ, that we are accepted, that we are forgiven and it's complete and you can't add anything to it. And we just need to, by faith, begin to live like those things are true. And then two weeks ago, we moved into chapter 2 and this powerful, powerful statement here on salvation. As Paul began to move out of eternity past, where God was master planning this divine plan, putting the church together, then Paul backed off and began to describe the very act by which we become part of that magnificent plan. And the act by which we become part of that magnificent plan is what? salvation. And in chapter 2, we heard Paul tell us that man's basic problem is not that he's out of touch with his environment. Man's basic problem is not that he can't maintain relationships with other people. It's not that the society is crumbling. All those things are symptoms of a deeper problem. Man's basic problem is chapter 2, verse 1. He is dead. Spiritually, he is dead. He is incapable of responding to God. And he painted a graphic picture for us. The picture we were getting was that we are spiritual death walkers. We're going through the motions. Our eyes are open. Our hands are moving. Our mouths are talking. But we're dead. We look alive, but we're dead. Spiritual death walkers. Zombies. And what a picture we had in verse 1. Dead in your sins. Spiritual zombies. Verse 2. Controlled by the spirit of the age. We're not free at all. But if you're in sin, you're being controlled by the spirit of the age. And then verse 3, the result of all that is your bullseye for God's wrath. You come under his judgment, but God, verse 4. Then salvation begins to come. And we learn that what a dead man needs most is not resuscitation. What he needs most is resurrection. And that's salvation. That's salvation. And so the problem with man is that he's dead in his sin. And the reason Jesus came was to make him alive in Christ. Give him life. and last week paul introduced to us another problem of man the first problem is was that he's dead the second problem is that man is alienated not only from other people but he's alienated from god he's cut off there's a separation there's a gap and the second reason we talked about last week that jesus came was to break down the walls to say there is no distinction there are no barriers and he came and he broke down the barrier and he brought those who were far away close to himself. And the second problem with man is that he's alienated. We talked about the fact last week that even though Jesus came breaking down the walls between people and saying there is no distinction, Jew, Greek, Scythian, barbarian, man or woman, we spend an awful lot of time building those barriers back up. And just possibly at the very core of those barriers that we are continuing to build up, even though Jesus came to break down the barrier wall, maybe at the very core of that is this need we have in our hearts to feel superior. It's pride. See, I have to have something in my life that tells me I'm better than you. And so I developed some sort of external characteristic that would affirm to me that I'm, well, you know, we're all Christians, but I'm a Baptist. We're all Christians, but I'm a lion. We're all Christians, but I'm charismatic. And we all have these distinctions, and it all builds walls. And the reason Jesus came was to break down the walls. So a problem with man is that he's alienated. He's cut off. There is no relationship. He's far away. And the reason Jesus came was to break down the walls and bring us close to himself. But there's a third problem with man. And Paul introduces this third problem in this text we're dealing with today. By now, I don't know if you've caught it, but I'm going to tell you anyways. In the last three weeks, we have been dealing with one great, big, huge three-point sermon. You got that? One great, big, huge three-point sermon has gone over three weeks. Three basic problems with man, and God has dealt with all three. Point one, man's dead. What did he do? He made him alive. Point two, man is alienated. What did he do? He brought him close. Point three, man is at war. What did God do? He came preaching peace. He came preaching peace. man is at war first of all man is at war with himself it's so obvious it's so clear it's so manifest to every one of us it's almost silly to begin to talk about how men are at war and give you examples strife, anger, hostility hate, underlying tension it's always there isn't it it's part of life every one of us accept it every one of us live with it every one of us know it's never going to go away on a global level The threat of peace is very thin Right today as I speak The tension in El Salvador is mounting The problems in Poland are always before us We hear about Afghanistan The Middle East There's wars and there's rumors of wars And it's always going on There's tension, there's hostility, there's anger People just can't get along But that's even a little bit too distant for me That makes me a little nervous But I'm not directly involved in that A little closer to home On a national level I can open the paper I'm sure that if you open the paper this morning There's going to be some example of a rape Or a murder or some sort of theft There's hostility There's tension, there's fear People are afraid But even that's a little bit too distant for me If it's not touching me A little bit closer to home Is the breaking up of families People just can't get along There's hostility and there's anger And there's fear People are at war We're at war We're at war with ourselves and you know what we can shake our heads in dismay over the sad statistics of divorce and over the sad statistics of wars and all of these things that are going on but i'm not going to let you off the hook that easy because all of that is still out there somewhere it's outside the walls of our church in many cases it's outside the walls of my life but i want to tell you something that the most painful and most destructive kind of war that is waging in our lives is not the war that's waging out there. It's the war that wages inside our hearts. The anger, the hostility, a stirring kind of thing that's going on inside of us, annoying, there's an unrest, there's a problem with guilt, and I don't know where to go with it. There's tension, and it's just there. There's pressure, and I don't know where it's coming from. There's loneliness, and there's anger. And if I'm really honest, what I really feel is afraid, but who can say that? We're supposed to be tough. I'm afraid and I'm restless. I'm at war. I'm at war. There's this war going on. And in our fear, we desperately try to deal with it, don't we? And every one of us deal with it a little bit differently, the war that's being waged in our minds. Every one of us have a different way of handling it. Some people jump off buildings because of the war that's being waged. Some people lose themselves in a career. They stay so busy that they don't have to think. They don't have to evaluate. They don't have to look at themselves or anything. They'll just get so wrapped up in all the things that are going on around them that they don't worry about anything. Some people surround themselves with things. But face it, people surround themselves with things sometimes, And all of it is an attempt on our parts to kind of get away from the fact that I am at war with myself. There's hostility, there's anger, there's fear, and I don't know what to do with it. And you see, the problem with me is not me. It has nothing to do with me. There's nothing going on inside of me that's wrong. The real problem with me is my house is too small. I'll get a new house. The real problem with me is my car. If I only had another car, that would take care of everything. Some people go to drugs. Some people run to alcohol. And the problem is all the same. We're running, and we're scared. But that leads me to the second dimension of the war we're in. The second dimension of the war we're in is not only am I at war with myself, but I'm at war with God. Now, some of you are going to sit here this morning and say, I'm not at war with God. I don't have anything against God. I have good feelings toward you. I don't know if I love him or anything like that. I'm not a fanatic, but I don't have any negative feelings toward God. The problem is this, that the Bible says you may not know it, but you have a problem. Chapter 2, verse 1 of Ephesians tells us about that problem. You're dead in your sin. You're separated. That's a separation. John 3, 36 says this, And he who has the Son has life. And he who does not have the Son, what? What's the result of that? He does not have life. And the result of that? The wrath of God abides on him. There's a war. There's hostility. There's a separation. Jesus said, He that is not with me is what? He's against me. You're either one or the other. You're either at peace or you're at war. You're either in sin or you're in Christ. There's nobody who's kind of a Christian, you know that? There's no way to be kind of a Christian. It's like somebody saying you're kind of pregnant. You're not kind of pregnant, you're not kind of a Christian. You either are or you aren't. That's the third problem of man. And that's simply this, that he's at war with himself, and he's at war with God. And the situation basically is this, hopeless. except for one thing, that God's answer is simple and it's complete. And I love it. The end of verse 16, he says this, that through the cross, by that cross, he has put to death the enmity, the strife. I'm going to show you some other pictures and some other words so we get the basic thrust of this text. Romans chapter 5, turn to it with me. Romans chapter 5. starting in verse 6 Romans chapter 5 verse 6 for while we were still helpless at the right time Christ died for the ungodly for one would hardly die for a righteous man but though perhaps for a good man some would possibly would die but God demonstrates his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us verse 10 And for if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his blood much more, through the death of his son much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. We're at war. There's a war. There's hostility. It's going on and it's constant. But he came to bring an end to that war, to bring an end to that hostility. Paul says, believer, you need to know this. You need to know something, and it's simply this, the war's over. The war's over. God's on your side. Christ bore your sin away. He took the curse. He signed the truth. He opened the path, and I'm at peace with God. The message is simply this, peace. That's the gospel. He came preaching peace, verse 17, and he came and he preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. That's the gospel. That's it. That's all there is. It's about death and life. It's about being foreign and being brought near. It's about going from war to having peace with God. That's the gospel. It's very simple. And from the beginning, this was the message. Uang Alidzo, as he came and preached, preached Uang Alidzo. He preached it. He evangelized peace. He pushed peace. That was his whole message. From the very beginning, Luke 2.14, when the angels were heralding his coming, it said, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, what? Peace. That was the message. That was what he wanted to convey. Luke chapter 10, when Jesus sent out the 70 disciples to begin preaching two by two, he says, wherever you go, wherever you go, I want you to be saying at least one thing. It's simply this, peace. The war is over. The war is over. In Romans, we hear words like this, may the God of hope fill you with all peace. Romans chapter 14, the kingdom of God is not of food and drink, but of righteousness and peace. Tell him the war is over. Tell him that he came to preach peace to those who were far away in peace, to those who were near you. In the upper room, do you have the picture? I'd like you to get the picture in your mind of the upper room after the disciples had gone through this terrible experience of seeing Christ crucified. They weren't bitter. They weren't angry. They weren't somehow in some sort of deep kind of sin. They were a lot more like you and me when we're struggling. They were just afraid. They were ready to run. There just wasn't anything to believe in anymore. And Jesus came into their midst, and he stretched out his arms, and he showed them his hand, and he showed them his feet, and he said one basic thing. He just spoke to them the gospel. It was this. Peace. Peace. The war is over. You need to know the war is over. There is something to believe in. The war is over. Peter who had failed so miserably and had done it in a public way and in front of everybody I don't know if you've ever done anything like that but it's one of the hardest things to handle when you've done something and it's public and everybody knows and everybody knows that you're a failure and he wanted to run and all he wanted to do was go fishing and his heart was being ripped out of his heart out of his body and Jesus came to him and he preached one thing. Peter, I want you to know, I got to get a hold of you because I need to tell you, peace. I came to preach peace. The war is over. The war is over. Thomas the doubter, what a bad guy he was. Thomas wasn't a bad guy. Thomas is you. And Thomas is me. And Jesus came to preach peace to Thomas. And he came to preach peace to you and to me. The point is simply this, that Jesus goes to Peter's and he preaches peace And he comes to Thomas and he preaches peace. And he goes to the addict and he preaches peace. And he comes to the alcoholic and he says, peace. And he goes to the divorcee and he says, peace. And he comes to the businessman who's successful and doesn't think he needs anything. But a war is being waged in his heart. And he says, I came to bring peace. And he comes to the reprobate and he comes to the respectable. And he says the same message to every one of them. Hey, you can stop running because the war is over. that's the message you don't have to remember anything more the war is over the message is peace but you know what i need to know how i need to know how to move into that peace and that's why we have verse 18 for through him we both have our access in one spirit to the father verse 18 the message is peace the method is the peacemaker christ himself for through him we have our access. I love that word. It's a great word. The word means simply this. It's a term to designate a person who would introduce you to the king. The Persians had a person like that. The Persians had a person who would introduce you to the king. He was called the access. He was the official introducer. Okay? And what Paul is saying here is that the reason you come is not because you're so cool. The reason you can come into the presence of the Father is not because you're so religious. It's not because you're so sharp. It's not because you're so spiritual and wonderful and put together so well. It has nothing to do with that. The reason you can come into the presence of Almighty God is because you have an advocate. You have a door. You have an introducer. He is our access, and He brings us to the Father, and He pleads our case, and He presents me blameless, and He accepts me, and it's because of Him that I can rush into the presence of the Father and cry, Abba, Father. Romans 8.15 says this. You're no longer, no longer do we have a spirit of fear in our relationship to God, but now it's one of sonship. And I can come boldly, and I can come just as I am, crying, Abba, Father. Why? Because we have an access. We have a door. We have a way to go. We have an introducer. Paul thought we needed to know that. You know what, believer, I think we need to know that. I think we need to know that, that he came preaching peace. And I think we need to know that we have an access. One of the biggest problems we have, I think, as believers, is that when we're running into trouble, and when we're running into pain, you know what we do? We run away. And too often, and I don't know if this is an indictment on the church, and if it is, let it lay there. But if this is an indictment, let's just accept it and ask the Lord to change us. But too often when I'm in pain and when I'm really hurting and I've come into an inconsistency and I'm really about to just end it all and I don't know what to do, I'm really ready to run, the last place in the world I want to come is here, to the church. And you know what? That's just so inconsistent with the gospel of peace, isn't it? The first place I ought to, the safest place in the world for me ought to be here among God's people who know what it means to be forgiven, who know what it means to be accepted, who know what it means to love and be loved just the way we are. I'm going to ask you something this morning. Are you hurting? Are you hurting? Are you in pain? Maybe there's people here who are really afraid. And there's a lot of people you would tell that to. A lot of people you would express that to, that I'm afraid, and I don't know how to put my life together, and I know the Lord, but I don't know where to go with this. But the last place in the world you would say that would be here. Isn't that a shame? Are you angry? You know what? You need to know, believer, that you have a door. You have an access and you have every right to run into the presence of Almighty God and cry, Abba, Father, and jump up on his lap. Abba, Father, a term of intimacy. It's like calling him Daddy. Jump up on his lap and let him love you and let him heal you. Let him put you back together. Believer, the war is over. The war is over. There is now, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Christ. And you need to come. And we, if we would have a goal as a church, it would be that we would be able to create the kind of community and kind of atmosphere where it would be easy to come. You know why? Because he came and preached peace to those who were far away and preached peace to those who were near. And we all have an access. And when you feel like running, run. But run into his presence. And fall down on his knees and say, Lord, I need you. I need some help. I need some courage. I'm afraid. I'm hurt. I don't know what to do. I'm angry. Tell him. Tell him. You fall into sin? What's the first thing you do when you fall into sin, believer? You know what we do? We run away, don't we? We run away. I had a friend in my former church, just the neatest guy, a new Christian. And he really had a struggle with this. You know when he showed up for church? When he felt good. And Paul is wanting us believers to understand, you have peace with God. There is no condemnation. You come into the Father's presence and you confess your sin, and he goes, what sin? You're forgiven, it's covered by the blood. One of the things we need to learn to do, instead of running away, is rush as fast as we can into his presence and confess our sin and restore the relationship. No condemnation. He's on your side. The war is over. He came to preach peace. And what we need to do is to know that so well that instead of being afraid and running away, run into his presence, confess our sin, restore the relationship. The war is over. The war is over. you know what that's the message that's it it's simple it's direct i think it's terribly profound he came and he preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near let me ask you a question why are you running why do we keep on running if that's really true why are we still afraid? Why do we still fight? I just wonder, I wish I could get into your hearts and into your minds and just kind of anticipate what your reactions to this whole message was, especially if you're a non-believer. And we talk about peace and we look at the war and we look at the things that are going on inside of us and maybe your life right now is caught up in all sorts of escape little mechanisms. It could be alcohol, it could be drugs, it could be things, it could be your career and they're working. That's the best part. They're working. They're helping you escape. And you hear some stuff like this and you go, this is just a bunch of mush. It's just so superficial. It's simplistic. It's too complicated. How do you respond? You know what? This simple message that I just delivered to you very quickly is the very same message that the apostles and the early church was going through with. And it was ringing off their lips. Peter in Acts 10, 36, was preaching simply this, peace, that is through Jesus Christ. He stood up and said, peace. That's it. That's the message. The reactions to his message were very interesting. Acts 17, 1 through 9, we see him in the city of Thessalonica, and he came, and what did he preach? You know what he preached? Peace. That's all it was, just peace. I came to preach peace. The war is over. You need to know that. You know what their reaction was? They got angry. They wanted to kill him. They knew he was staying at the house of Jason, and they all went over to Jason's house, and they wanted to drag him out. They dragged Jason out because Peter wasn't there, and they wanted to kill him. It just made him so angry. What a paradox. Isn't that a strange reaction? When somebody's coming and saying, hey, friend, you don't have to run anymore. The war is over. I'm preaching peace. Their reaction was anger. Why do you think they'd be angry? It doesn't make any sense. Why would they be angry? Some speculation? Some reasons why, possibly? Maybe they enjoyed the war. Maybe they enjoyed the war in sort of a perverse way. The fear and the hate and the hostility and the running and all of the mechanisms and the games that they had established for themselves, even though they were hurting them and they knew it, it was kind of secure. At least they knew it. And someone was coming along and kind of rocking that up and saying, that's not the way you're going to go. The only real peace is going to be through Christ and come preaching peace. They don't like that. Don't rock it up. I've got my little structure. It's all set. Maybe they didn't like hearing they were wrong. You know, when you come preaching peace and that the only access to that peace is through the way, through the door, Jesus what you're doing is you're telling people that the way they're trying now is wrong, isn't it? that's what you're doing you're telling them that whatever way you're trying to find that peace is the wrong way and nobody likes to admit that I dare say that one of the biggest problems new Christians have in sharing their faith is with their own family because they go home and I bet you've experienced some of that when you go home and you try to experience or try to express to your family the peace, the war is over, and all you want to do is say, oh, mom, dad, I love you. I want you to know the peace I've found. It isn't superficial. It isn't mushy. It's real. The only access is through Christ, but what you're telling them and what they're going to have to accept and what you had to accept is all the other things you've been trying to do all your life to get the peace wrong, and I've got to abandon them. I believe firmly, again, this is speculation, but I believe firmly that part of the trauma that the Apostle Paul went through, yes, he was struck blind, but I also think that part of the trauma he went through was an emotional thing. You know what it was? He got hit right in the face with Jesus Christ. And it told him simply this, everything you've been giving your life to up to now has been a lie. Nobody likes to hear that. So there was anger. Maybe they resented their confidence, their narrowness. I could just hear Peter saying, I come to preach peace, the war is over, the access is Christ, that's the only way. And they would come and say, ah, you act as if you know for sure. What kind of arrogance is this? You act as if you know for sure that you can have eternal life. What kind of silliness is that? That's silly talk. That's arrogance. You act as if Jesus is the only way, as if Christianity, as if Jesus is the only right religion, you know. Everybody knows that there's all different ways we can come and they're all right, you know. you know the problem with truth i've shared this with you before is that it is always narrow the truth always is narrow and when we're dealing with jesus as being the only way that's kind of a narrow truth when i say again when i say one and one is two i'm not leaving a lot of room for the possibility that it's three is am i and when jesus comes and says i am the way the truth and the life he's not leaving a lot of room for the possibility of any other way. And so there can be anger because I don't like it that you say there's only one way. I'm trying my own way. I'm going to go my own direction. And the response is anger. There's another response. Another response could be simply laugh it off, philosophize it away, just kind of think, ah, this is silly. This is just a bunch of mush again. You can get angry. You can laugh it off. Acts 17 again, verses 16 through 18. Paul was preaching this. Paul was preaching now, and he was preaching this message of peace. That was it. It was simple. Through Christ, that was it. And it wasn't anger here. They were a little too sophisticated for that. He was talking to philosophers. And the philosophers, they were Epicureans, and they were Stoics. And their philosophy was basically this. An Epicurean was someone who was giving himself to pleasure. The highest form of good was that which gave the most pleasure. Okay? Hedonism, basically, is what it was. The Stoic was kind of a fatalist, a little bit existential. So very deep in their thought, you know. And then Paul, just imagine, it comes along with this simplistic, easy kind of thing that says, through the cross, that's it. Access is Christ. Peace is the result. The war is over. And basically what they said in Acts chapter 17 was, who are these idle babblers? And the literal word for idle babblers was garbage pickers. Who are these philosophical garbage pickers coming along and giving us this gobbledygook? It's a bunch of mush. I can just see it today, the playboy philosophy. He would have been a great Epicurean, a hedonist. Hugh Hefner, saying, oh my, what idle babble is this? What idle babble is this? And he'd laugh it off. You know, the responses to the gospel of peace may be different, but the message is the same. Jesus came to deal definitively with man's deepest problems. Man is dead. In Christ, he makes him alive. Man is alienated. In Christ, he brings him near. Man is at war. And in Christ, he brings peace. And we can run, and we can hide, and we can deny it, and we can fight, and we can be angry, and we can laugh. But he comes to you and he comes to me the way he did to Peter and Thomas and to every man and woman throughout history. And he says, oh, friend, you don't have to run anymore. The war is over. The price is paid. Your sins are forgiven. And you can have peace with God. You know what, this peace is not a matter of trying really hard to clean your life up. It's not a matter of trying really hard to get religious. You know what this whole peace thing is about is giving up. It is quit running. Quit hiding. Quit going to all the different escape things you found. Stop the running. Cease the striving. You have an access. You have a door. It's Christ himself. And you can run into his arms and cry, Abba, Father, the war is over. And he came and he preached peace to you who were far away and to you who were near. I wonder if there's anybody here who's tired of running. Believers. Believers, I think maybe you need to spend some time in your father's lap. And let him love you. And let him affirm to you again that the war is over. And maybe all of these promises that we've been talking about in Ephesians apply to you, but they aren't applying to you because you're running like crazy. and maybe you're here this morning and you need an introduction into the introducer you need an introduction into the place where you can have that peace and know the peacemaker this has been a very simple message very simple and I even struggled with it because of that the message is this the war is over and you can have peace with God let's pray Father I don't know what you want to do with this I have no idea how you may be working in someone's heart who is at war who is fighting and moving and manipulating and striving and maybe it's a believer Father may there be healing tonight this morning concerning that kind of war and Father for those who are here and don't know you at all have no idea what the access is all about that Father before that they would leave this morning that they would be introduced give us the courage to deal with what we need to deal with this morning in your name, Amen
