Okay, we're going to talk about now some other ways to look at shame-based family systems and how people learn to survive those systems. And the issue with these survival skills is not so much that they're bad and it's too bad that you learned them, but more like now we're in new relationships and it's time to learn new skills and not get stuck in turning our new relationships into places where we can survive so that we get to use all our old skills and our new relationships. So if you remember last night, I drew a picture of a family system, and after the family adjusted, then it looked like this, where there were four people around it and then one person in the center, and the system kind of gravitated or revolved around that person. Now I want to talk to you about the kinds of things that you would be able to notice in the lives of these people who are doing this, because I think that it's pretty observable, it's very common, the kind of dynamics I'm going to talk about, and I think that it'll make some sense of some things for some of the people here. So in the center of the system, we'll just call the person in the center of the system person A, and then person B will be up in the left-hand corner, and person C will be up in the right-hand corner, person D will be down in the bottom left-hand corner, and person E will be in the bottom right-hand corner, and there's going to be a person F, too, but I'll put that up there in a minute. And I'm going to be going back and forth between the board and the overhead on this one because we kind of run out of room on the board. So the person in the center, person A, when we see that person, what we see is the person who has gravitated toward the middle of the system, and that would be the dependent person or the dysfunctional person, or the one who everybody kind of looks at and thinks to themselves, if this person would just get well, everybody would be well. They're kind of the problem of the system. And so there are four aspects of each person that I want to talk about. The first aspect is the job that the person does for the system. So the first aspect is the job. What contribution they make to keeping the system dysfunctional or to adding to the dysfunction of the system. what's their job. The second thing that I want to talk about is what's observable on the outside. What you would see if you looked at this person. The third thing I want to talk about is feelings, what this person might be feeling. And while I'm not going to get into all the feelings that this person might have, I'm going to get into perhaps what is the primary feeling, the main feeling that this person would be experiencing. And then the fourth thing would be their core issue, the inside, what's going on on the very inside of them. And for every person in this diagram, it's going to be shame, meaning that they have a sense of something's wrong with them as a person. So they're going to be experiencing shame. So these are the four things for each of the people in the diagram, and it looks like this on the diagram. Number one is the job. So underneath each circle, you could just write the job. This is what the person does for the system. Number two would be the feelings. I'm sorry, number two would be what's observable. If you looked at this person, here's what you might see if you were looking at them. Number three would be how that person would be feeling. Whether they're aware of that feeling or not, we don't know. But it would be an under-the-surface kind of thing that you necessarily wouldn't be able to see, And they wouldn't necessarily be in touch with, but it's going to be there. And then the fourth, number four, would be their sense of identity or their sense of self, which for every person in this circle is shame because this is a shame-based system. So shame is the basis, and all these layers that you see here are to cover up shame. So they make it one step farther away from the shame that this person has about themselves on the inside. The job of person number A, or person A, their job is to be the focus of this family. So they're the person that everybody looks at and says, here's the problem, and if they would just get better, everything would be great. And so they provide a convenient distraction for everybody to not have to look at their own issues. And I'm not even saying, when I say that, that this person's not in serious trouble. I'm saying they are in serious trouble for some reason or another. I'm just also saying that the job they do is they give people an opportunity to look at them instead of themselves then. Because remember, this is a systems issue, not a person issue. Even though when I describe this, it's going to kind of look like they're the problem. The system is the issue. So their job is to give the system someone to look at. But the problem is that you can't look at them and say anything directly to them because then you get in trouble for doing that. So even though everybody focuses on that person, it's not okay to focus on them out loud because you become the issue. Now, in my family, like I said last night, we did not have an alcoholic. What we had was a person who was kind of pretty immature, easily offendable. And so what that meant was that person was in the middle of the system, and our job was to tiptoe around making sure they weren't offended and making sure that they didn't have a temper tantrum and make sure that they didn't leave the room and go lock themselves in the other room and those kinds of stuff. So all that stuff that we did was to protect or somehow not discover the shame of the person in the middle, even though we didn't have an alcoholic in the middle. What you would see if you looked at this person, the observable stuff that you'd see, is someone who acts angry. And because they're trying to control everything, They get their sense of identity and value from everything that's going on around them, and so they've got to be rigid and controlling of all those kinds of things, but the problem is they're not powerful enough to control everything around them, so they spend a lot of time being angry and anxious and rigid, perfectionistic. What's interesting is that even if this person is perfectionistic for you, they wouldn't necessarily be perfectionistic for themselves. In other words, they would have loopholes for themselves, even though they're very rigid about what you're supposed to do, they'd always have exceptions for why they themselves don't have to do the same kind of stuff. And so you'd see perfectionism, acting angry. And then here's an interesting thing, I think kind of a twist on this whole thing. They also might look charming. And the reason they look charming is because they have a lot at stake to protect their shame and to present an image out here that's inconsistent with what's going on on the inside. And so those of you who grew up in alcoholic families, for instance, probably liked your alcoholic parent in public too, just like everybody else did, and wished that you could get at home some of what other people were getting in public. And that's what makes it so hard to talk about, because they have so much invested in presenting an image out here of being this great, nice person, you know, everybody's buddy, that you feel like if you ever broke out of the system and talked out loud out here with what was going on in there, nobody would believe you anyway because they have such an image of this person as being everybody's friend. In an alcoholic family, or in a shame-based family, in a shame-based family, family members are treated worse than friends. In other words, friends get treated better than family members. In a shame-based family, family members are treated worse than strangers. Strangers are treated with more respect and more dignity than family members. In a shame-based family, family members are treated worse than enemies. Even enemies are treated with some degree of respect and carefulness in how we treat them, but not in the family. See, there's no care taken in how people are treated in the family. This would be then that you probably wish that you could be treated like somebody who wasn't a family member. If you actually weren't a family member, you'd be better off than being a family member. This is the person who's screaming and hollering at you, and they've got their finger in your face, and they're going, you... hollering at you, and then the phone rings, and they go, oh, hello, oh, it's so good, you know, and they're so nice on the phone, and then they hang up the phone, and they go right back to screaming and hollering at you, and you go, whoa, where did that come from? That'S because they have a lot at stake to cover up what's really going ON. You're getting what's real. The people out there aren't getting what's real. What's real is what happens in the system. but how this person feels is guilt now they feel all kinds of things like I said whether they're in touch with them or not we don't know but their primary core feeling their main feeling is guilt we think about we have a stereotype about people who are addicted and things like that that they don't really feel guilty but probably their primary feeling is guilt which is why the medicating behavior that they're doing fits so well because they do the behavior, they feel guilty the behavior, quote, fixes the guilt which generates more guilt, which generates more behavior which generates more guilt Vern Johnson, who wrote the book I'll Quit Tomorrow says that he doesn't think that a person can become addicted unless they feel guilt people who don't feel guilty make lousy addicts like someone who's sociopathic makes a lousy addict somebody who isn't feeling the guilt they should be feeling for acting the way they're acting, understand? They don't make a good addict. When I worked in treatment, I saw people come into treatment whose lives were out of control because of alcohol use. But they didn't feel guilty, and they didn't sober up because they felt bad and because they wanted to learn how to live in a new way so they would quit doing hurtful things. They sobered up because they realized that they could rip the system off better sober than they were able to do it when they had been using. And they look like model clients, and they look wonderful, and they are. And they're sober now, but they're not any less sociopathic about it. They're not feeling guilt. So this person feels guilt, and whether or not they're in touch with it, it doesn't matter. But remember I kind of alluded to the fact that my dad would have a tantrum or whatever, and then he'd storm out of the room and lock himself in the bedroom. And then we would think, well, we must have not done something right, but we weren't sure what it was. we never were sure what it was. And then when he'd come back out hours later, then we would try harder to fix what it is we did, but we didn't ever know what we did. I used to think, for many years, I thought that the reason he went in the bedroom was because of us. But see, the reason he went in the bedroom, I think now is because just before he went in the bedroom, he'd say such hurtful things and make such a big deal over something that wasn't a big deal that he felt guilty and shamed about it so as to not to be seen, he would remove himself from being seen. So actually, he was in the bedroom because of his stuff, even though it felt like it was about ours. For years, we thought we put him in the bedroom instead of he put himself in the bedroom, and we thought it was our job to keep him from going in the bedroom instead of it was his job to keep himself from going in the bedroom. We thought that we made him have colon cancer. Seriously, every time that he felt sick about something, It was because we somehow did something that upset him. And, you know, the natural conclusion then is he got sicker and sicker and sicker with a physical kind of thing. And it wasn't because he didn't know how to take care of himself. See, it was because we said something we shouldn't have said, which is just ludicrous. But when you're in that system, that's what it feels like. Understand this? So this person feels guilt, but on the inside, they have shame. And the reason they have shame is because there's something wrong with them. That's how they feel. There's something wrong with them. They're defective. The reason why this isn't working is because of them. They're a bad person. Now, once again, these inner layers that I'm talking about, layers three and four, this person doesn't necessarily have to be in touch with that. You don't have to be in touch with it for it to affect you and for you to do something to protect it. Some people live totally unintentionally in their lives, and everything they do out here is to protect something on the inside, and they don't even know what it is. Next time that you are reluctant to do something, you have something that you have to do, but you feel really reluctant to do it, ask yourself, what feeling am I trying to avoid by not doing this? What feeling am I trying to not have by not doing this? And you'll probably find a feeling underneath the surface that you weren't even aware was there that's generating this reluctant kind of behavior, and then all of a sudden it makes sense, you see. And so you are reluctant whether you are aware of the feeling or not. But you can use those kinds of things sometime to find out what's going on under the surface. Now, at the same time that this is going on in this family, the efficiency of the family is going down. So in other words, how the productivity and efficiency level of the family is going down. And so what we need is someone to raise the efficiency of the family. Last night, I talked about that the whole family adjusts to keep the family functioning efficiently. People pick up the jobs to accommodate the fact that somebody's not doing their job. Well, what I want to suggest this morning is that sometimes, very often, that job falls on one person primarily. It's not that other people don't do that job, but someone kind of rises to the top and becomes the person whose job that is. So their job, the job of person B, is to raise the efficiency of the family or to maintain the efficiency of the family. Their job is to keep the family together. Cause, let's say, cause peace. Let's not even say cause, let's say keep. Keep peace. So what you'd see on the outside is someone who's over-responsible. Someone who's over-adequate, over-responsible. Keeping the peace, you'd see that behavior. Making excuses. This is the person who is kind of the defense lawyer for the person in the middle. And their job is to make sure that nobody would get the wrong idea, which would probably be the right idea anyway. So they're making excuses, and they're protecting, and they take over the jobs that this person defaults. So when this person lets something slide, they pick it up, and they do it. What they would be feeling, primary feeling, would be anger. Whether they're aware of it or not, it doesn't matter. Anger. This is a person who, if you've given up your life and your goals and your dreams and your time and your health to fix this person and make sure they're okay and they're not okay and they're not fixed, you're angry. Whether or not you're aware of that, you know, we don't know. But on the inside, there's an anger and a bitterness that's there. This is the, when I see this person in counseling kind of down the road now in their middle-aged years, this is the angriest person with a smile that you've ever seen. Okay? They can, I call it a frozen smile of terror. They can be telling you about stuff that's awful and that they're angry about, and while they're telling you, they've got this smile on their face, and they're telling you all this horrible stuff that's going on, and it's painful and it's not working and while they're telling you that, they're smiling the whole time. So they're not in touch with their anger even though they have it. I've seen this person freeze tears. Have you ever seen anybody with frozen tears? Tears that just come to the edge of their eyes and then just freeze there. They never drop out. I have seen this person suck tears back into their head. I don't know if you've ever seen that. where the tears come back up and then they just smile and they work at it and then they just go back in. They just disappear. Where'd they go? They sucked them back in. They're so good at performing and being adequate for all tasks and doing it all. And, of course, then inside is shame. They have failed at their job. They are a failure. They haven't been able to do it and that's about them. another thing that happens is that if it's this person's job to keep the peace and peace happens they're out of a job so when that happens, even when they finally do experience peace that they wish was there and were trying like crazy to have, when that finally happens then they're out of a job, and you know how people feel when they're out of a job Nobody likes to be out of a job. So what happens is that they then kind of provoke some hostilities, and then when the hostilities erupt, then they have their job back, and then they can keep peace again. I have seen people run between their spouse and their child who are at war, and they spend all kinds of time trying to make sure they get along and people don't misunderstand and everything's nice and all that kind of stuff. And then finally, when the two are getting along, then they come to the spouse and they go, yeah, but did you know that he did this and she did this? And they go, what? And then they come over here and they say, well, did you know that when you weren't here, your father or your mother said this? And they go, what? And pretty soon there's a war. And then when the war happens, then they can come back in and try to make peace again. So they keep themselves in a job all the time. Person C. At the same time that all this is happening, there's such a thing as family esteem. This is not just about self-esteem. We know about self-esteem, your view of yourself or how you feel about yourself or how you assess yourself. But I think there's such a thing as family esteem too, how the family feels about itself as a family. What does it feel like to be here? Is this a good place to be? Does it feel safe here? Or is this an unsafe place? It feels terrible being here. Family esteem. Well, how we feel as a family is going down. People don't like to be here. It feels awful being here. So it becomes someone's job to raise the family esteem. And this would be then the person in the family who, what you see is they look good. And they are very successful. And they get good grades. And they're the president of the National Honor Society and head of the cheerleading squad, and they run with only the best friends, all the responsible people, and they're a high achiever, and they're self-motivated, and they're successful, and they do it. On the inside, though, because it's their job to raise the esteem, and because they're powerless to actually do that, they probably have a main feeling of inadequacy, which I think is even closer to shame than it is a feeling because it's got this little prefix on the front that is kind of a shame prefix, you know, inadequacy, not adequate. Something's wrong with them, and so they've got shame. If this family says that being a doctor is the really important thing, that's a really honorable good thing to be. This person heads off from medical school. And if they say that being in the ministry is the really great thing, then this person's off to seminary. And if they really want to do this right, then they eventually go to the mission field because it kind of goes like God, angels, missionaries. You know, that's the order of things. And then pastors and then lay people and then other primates, and that's kind of the order of things. This is the person that the family holds up to the world and says, see, you know, and they get their sense of value from this person. This is the person that I was in my family, kind of the hero. I was my dad's hero for sure. When my father died in 1982, I was very mixed. I had very mixed stuff about it when I finally got in touch with it because it felt to me, it seemed to me that my greatest fan and my greatest critic both died right then. He was my biggest fan because I was his hero. He was also my greatest critic because I was his hero. And so I did not have permission to do anything that wasn't right. But I was so much his hero that even if I did something wrong, I didn't even have to defend myself. He did it. So when I had a bad game in basketball for instance, I didn't have to say anything. He would just make up all the excuses and cover for me because I was the hero and nobody could think something bad about me. When I became a counselor in a treatment center, he said, that's great. when are you going to be the director? I mean, I called him on the phone and said, I got the job to be a counselor. He said, oh, that's really neat. When do you think you'll be the director? Wow. When I finished my work to do for my master's degree, I called up and said, well, you know, because they knew I was in the pit, I mean, working really hard and trying to do all this stuff and have a job and raise two kids and all this kind of stuff. And so I called him out of a sense of relief, like, whew, you know, it's over. I finished. I'm done with it. He said, oh, that's really neat. When are you going to get your doctorate? Okay. I did this job for the family. I was the guy that the family felt good about. Understand? But if it's your job to provide enough stuff for the family to feel good about, that's a shame-based family in the first place, you can't do it. You fail at your job, so it feels like you're inadequate and you're a failure. That's the shame on the inside. Person D, that'd be this person down here. If you follow this person in the family, you have your work cut out for you. I used to think, and I think that the thinking out there commonly is that this is usually the second child. Person C is usually the first child. And it's because the first child gets all the strokes and all the attention for doing it right, and so there really aren't any left, and so the only way you can get attended to is by doing it wrong. But I don't think that that's why this person is going to do what I'm going to describe here. I think it's because of the job that they have, see? And this person usually is the second child. Person C usually is the first child. Even in a healthy family, it's difficult to not have person C be the first child because even in a healthy family, I think that all parents owe all first children an apology, just right off the bat, okay? because we don't know what we're doing. You understand? Even in a healthy family, under the best circumstances, parents don't have a clue what they're doing with the first child. They're a trial package here. You know, we're just figuring stuff out on the first child, and that's why when the second child comes along, then the first child comes and says, well, how come you let her get her ears pierced when she was 10 years old, and you didn't let me get my ears pierced until I was 12 years old? Like that. And then the only answer that you can give is, because we didn't know what we were doing. And that's the truth. Person D, their job, and this is very important, and maybe I want to spend a little bit more time on this job. Their job is to refocus the attention of the family onto someone who's okay to confront. in other words this person gives us someone to holler at that you can get away with hollering at because if you try to confront the person in the middle you get in trouble so you've got all this stuff going on about there's a problem here but nowhere to put it, this person gives you some place to put it because they're a kid, so you can holler at them and blame them and shame them and say all kinds of stuff to them, and you can pull it off because they're just a kid. You can't do it with the adult in the center of the family. I know this is raising questions for you, and I'm going to try to answer them all when I finish with the diagram before you even ask them, because I've done this talk enough to kind of know what questions there are, and then after that, there will be some time for more questions in addition. But this person, what they do is they rebel. And they act out, and they run away, and they get pregnant before they are married or even before they're out of high school because it's a way to get out of here. And this is the person who, I think, gets most families into family counseling. Okay? And if you're a helper with a systems way of thinking about stuff, when you see this person, you're thinking to yourself, how can we get the whole system here? even though the temptation would be to say, let's fix this person because they sure look like they need to be fixed. And the family is kind of dropping them on your lap saying, fix this kid. And what you need to do is you need to ask yourself, how can we get the whole system here? Because this person may not really be the issue. They may just be wearing the pain of the family. Even in a healthy family system, Don't you notice that there tends to be one child who kind of wears the temperature of the family? They're kind of the family thermometer, and you can kind of tell how the family's going by what this person looks like. They just kind of wear the pain of the family. And so they're the thermometer, and they tell you the temperature. Well, see, if we take lunch break, and we go outside, and the thermometer says 150 above, and we walk out, and it's 150 above, the thermometer's not the problem. Do you understand? The temperature is the problem. You don't have to fix the thermometer, but a lot of families bring this person in and want you to fix the thermometer, and all they're doing is just telling you the temperature of the family. That's all. But it does give you someone that's safe to holler at because if you try to holler at person A, you get in trouble and you're the problem, so this person gives us somebody to holler at that we can get away with. What they would be feeling would be hurt because they're taking all the heat, and they know that they're not the only issue here. So their primary feeling would be hurt and maybe rejection. They could feel rejected. And they don't measure up, certainly to person C. And then if you have a family system that actually aggressively or overtly compares these two, they feel even more shame because they're told that they're not okay, but they would be okay if they looked like their other sister or brother over here. And so this is a tough job to do. Person E, that'd be the person down there on the right-hand side. Person E, if you live in this system, this is a heavy place to be. It feels heavy to be here. So it's someone's job to lighten up the system. So this would be the clown of the family. and how many of you were the clown in your family? How many of you have a clown in your family now? This is the person whose job it is to just lighten stuff up. So when it gets really tense and people are starting to not get along and you can feel that the fight is coming, this person does something really weird and breaks the tension. They come out running out naked in front of company and everybody goes, oh! Parents are horrified, but they go, oh! Aren't they cute? We're right in the middle of the argument, you know, and you've cornered them and you've asked them the really tough question about something they did, and they go, you know, and then it's like, it's like they're just a really funny person. And what you see is that they're funny, that they act, they clown around a lot. They could be the class clown at school. They would appear as a child to be hyperactive. They aren't necessarily hyperactive, but they might look hyperactive because they're zipping around, you know, cheering up the world and not taking things seriously. They would appear to have a short attention span. It doesn't necessarily mean they do, but they would look like they did because they're busy thinking jokes and things like that. On the inside, they would feel insecure. Now remember, all this stuff that each layer is to cover up the layer beneath. And it's the way that needy people look full. And shame. Because they have a job they can't do. And then if you have enough people in this family, you might have this person F, which I don't have on the board there, but this would usually be the youngest person. Now let me go back again and just make some general statements, and then I'll tell you about person F. person A does not have to be an adult does not take an adult to be this person it could be anybody who gravitates to the center of the family and becomes the focus of the family that's not okay to confront so actually in my family system I was person A as well although they didn't know it because most of my person A like behavior was when I wasn't physically geographically at home so my family revolved around me and bailed me out and enabled me and funded my drug problem so I was in the middle of the family but they didn't even know that I was actually and then when I came home one day having realized what was going on and that I needed help and that I was really in trouble and tried to apologize they wouldn't let me because I was also the hero so I couldn't admit to doing all this stuff because it would destroy their picture of me and so what they said was they said, we don't want to hear this. We don't want to hear this. We know that you were in trouble and we know you're okay now and that's all we want to know. And so I was kind of stuck with this apology right in my throat here because I wasn't able to say what I had done because heroes wouldn't do that in the first place and they couldn't hear that. So this person doesn't have to be an adult. It can be anybody. Person B usually is an adult. And the reason why person B is usually an adult is because it usually takes an adult to be big enough to pull off this job. This is usually too tough of a job for a kid, but it could be a kid, but usually it takes an adult. To be able to be powerful enough to make up for all the inadequacies of everybody in the family usually takes an adult, but could be a kid, usually an adult. Person C doesn't have to be the first child, but it usually is for that reason that I told you before, that we have unrealistic expectations. We don't even know what to demand from our first children, and we kind of find out as we're going along. And person D doesn't have to be the second child, and person C doesn't have to be the third child. It can be anybody in this system. Usually person F is the youngest child, usually, because they're so far away from what's actually going on in their understanding that they can feel the tension and the pain of it, but they're too young to put a word on it or know what to call it or know how to verbalize what's going on. And so what their job is, is they provide relief to the family in the sense that it gives us somebody we don't have to worry about. So this is the little angel of the family usually, and this is the one that parents say things like, well, at least we have one kid that doesn't give us any problem. Little Tommy or Judy or whoever, this little nice, you know. And that's their job. It's to provide relief to the family system. what you would see is that they're withdrawn they have a style and really that's what we're talking about here are styles, skills, their style is to disappear so person E the clown when it gets tense they make a joke, this person disappears they could be standing right there and as the tension starts to build you look around and they're gone and they just left the room they just went to be by themselves They do things that you can do alone, like music and art and reading and fantasizing and things like that. Alone kinds of things. What they feel, as you can imagine, would be lonely. Mean feeling, lots of other feelings too, but they're kind of invisible. That'd be back under number two again. They're invisible. They're just no problem. And shame. That's the message that they come out of this with. Not important, not loved, not accepted. Something's wrong with them. Okay. Now, what I want you to focus on more than the order that I gave you, more than the ages of the people, more than whose adults and whose kids, is the job. Like, my belief is, regardless of who does the job, somebody's going to do the job. These are the jobs that need to be done in order for this family to stay shame-based and stay dysfunctional. So somebody's going to do the job. Whether it's the first child, second child, we don't know, but somebody's going to do the job. How many of you had a sense that you were the hero of the family, but you weren't the first child? Okay, so that's quite a significant number. How many of you had a sense that you were the rebel of the family, but you were the first child? So there's a significant number there, too, you see. It doesn't have to be first, second, third, fourth child. How many people had the job of person B being the over-adequate and make sure everybody's efficiently doing everything and you were a child and had that job? So once again, these are all the exceptions kind of that prove the rule. Do you understand that we're not talking about so much adult-adult, first, second, third, fourth child as we're more talking about the job that needs to be done in order for this family to stay dysfunctional And then people come out of this with a shaming message. How many of you notice that as you've gotten married or as you've gotten to be an adult and left your family system that you kind of got out of doing the job that you had when you were in that family system, but still when you go back to visit, you kind of end up doing your job again? Okay, anybody? Okay. That's that gravity that I was talking about. A lot of people raise their hand. How many of you have a sense that you had one job in your family of origin, but you have another job with the in-laws? Anybody know that? Like maybe in your family of origin you were the hero, but now with your in-laws you're the scapegoat, you're the troublemaker. See, because they already had a hero there, which is your spouse probably. You understand? And so then you go over there, and you're the one who notices stuff, and you go, hey, wait a minute, why are we doing this? And all of a sudden you're the troublemaker, even though back in your family you were the hero, like that. how many of you were an only child? anybody here an only child? did any of the only children have a sense that you had more than one job? okay yeah, this is a really tough row to hold for only children because these jobs need to be done by somebody and usually you end up with lots of them how many noticed that you had different jobs at different ages? anybody noticed that? sometimes in this family system, person C that's the hero of the family because being a doctor is a really cool thing to do. They go off to Harvard Medical School and then all of a sudden person D, the person who's acting out and being negative and being rebellious, all of a sudden, last year they were getting D's and F's and now this year they're getting A's and B's. And we go, wow, where'd that come from? Well, it came from the fact that there was a job opening and person D applied for the job because this job over here pays better than this job, believe me. But see, what's interesting then is that you find out that it never was about that they weren't capable, even though they looked like they weren't capable. And it never was that they weren't smart. Even though they looked like they weren't smart, they just were doing a job. And now they've got a better job, and so they're doing that job. So you see how many different configurations this can take. Some families have a bunch of kids, and then they take a break for five or eight or ten years, and then they have a couple more kids, and this repeats itself. I've seen that happen. So the point of this is the jobs, not the order, not the ages, the jobs. Now, the order that I described is kind of a stereotype, but, you know, stereotypes tend to be based on somebody observed something at some point, you know, and I think that, frankly, that the order I gave you maybe is maybe common thing that happens. In my family, I know about this and I teach about this and we work on this on purpose, but I have to tell you that the main job as a parent that I have with our oldest daughter is that when I'm going to bed at 11 o'clock or 11.30 or whatever and I look under her door and the light's still on and I knock on the door and she's reading because she's got to get A's and I say, take a break. You don't have to get A's. It's okay to take care of yourself. It's okay to get some sleep. It's okay to not be driving yourself, because even in our family, see, she kind of ends up with this role. And the issue is that people take these kinds of relationship skills, which maybe help them survive this system, and they go off into their new relationship system and match up with people that allow them then an opportunity to use these old skills and new relationships, and then the system kind of repeats itself. If you spend your whole life trying to fix somebody in your family, like they're your missions project, and you can't do it, but that's your main goal in life, then you've got to go marry another missions project. You understand? They'll give you an opportunity to use all your relationship skills. Now let me say one more thing. Whether or not these people have become this way as a way of surviving the system, or they were born this way, okay? Because I know some people have that. Some people are naturally this way. Do you understand? There are some people who are built different, I mean, they're just built different from one another. So let's just call it a genetic thing. Whether you are this way because of genetics or because this is how you learn to survive is not the issue. The issue is whether you're stuck or not. Because remember, my definition of dysfunctional is being stuck. The issue for person B is not that they want to help everybody and they want people to get along and whatever. The issue for person B is that when it's time to let people fall on their face so they can learn the consequences of their behavior, they're still bailing them out. That's the issue. When it's time for people to have the argument and just finish the issue by looking at each other and talking about it, they're still in the middle trying to make peace. So they're stuck. If you're stuck, it's dysfunctional, not the fact that you are this way. We have people in the church that we say have a gift of mercy. You've heard that. And you know people who are kind of naturally merciful, right? Well, I think that when Satan puts a spin on a mercy gift, you end up having somebody be merciful when it's time to take your hands off the situation and let people get the consequences that they should be getting for living that way. So they're stuck. The issue isn't for that person C needs to not be so self-motivated or such a good performer or be so successful. The issue is that if they're stuck, when it's time to rest, person C is still cranking. That's the issue, okay? Because they can perform when it's time to perform, but they're still performing when it's time to rest and take care of themselves and pay attention to other relationships and do stuff like that, and they're still cranking. It's the stuckness of it that's the problem, not the fact that they're naturally that way. Whether they got that way by genetics or learning to survive their family, if they're stuck, that's the issue, and that's the help that they can get and the health that they can get and getting unstuck, not so that they aren't the way they are anymore, but so that they can take care of themselves and be unstuck and do what the situation calls for. Richard Foster says that a responsible person is someone who can do what needs to be done when it needs to be done. Well, this person's doing what needs to be done when it doesn't need to be done. And so in their over-responsibility, they're really being irresponsible. When you take responsibility for someone else, you're really being irresponsible and helping them be irresponsible too. Over-responsibility is just a prettier form of irresponsibility than irresponsibility. But it looks good and we get stroked for it and our culture kind of revolves around that kind of stuff. The issue with person D is not that they're rebelling and asking hard questions and bucking the system. The issue with person D is that when it's time to comply, they're still rebelling. When there isn't an issue, they're still having an issue. our job is not to get person D to quit being so rebellious and ask such tough questions and grate against the injustices of the world and all that kind of stuff our job is to help person D become the best rebellious strong-willed, tenacious person that God ever had working for him our job isn't to get them to be compliant our job is to help them use their tenacity and their stubbornness and their strong-willedness and their rebelliousness and their hard questions in a direction that's helpful. But see, when there's no issue and you could give in, they're still having a fight. They're still bucking the system. They're stuck. That's the problem. The problem over here in the situation of the clown is not that they're telling jokes. It's that when it's time to be serious, they're still telling jokes. Thank God for this person who, you know, sees the weirdness of life and can say it out loud so that you can see it too and have a laugh. You remember on MASH, Hawkeye was kind of the clown of the unit, and Sidney, who was the psychiatrist, was writing in his journal, and he always addressed his journal to Sigmund. And he always wrote in his journal as if it was a letter to Sigmund Freud. So he's writing this letter to Sigmund, and he's talking about Hawkeye, and he's noticing that Hawkeye can find a funny thing no matter what. He can be up to his elbows in blood and still find a funny thing. So near the end of the show, he says, how do you do that? Why do you do that? You know, even when it's time to be serious, you're still telling a joke. And he says, it's the only way I can avoid from screaming. It's the only way I avoid screaming. It's either find something funny and tell a joke or scream, you know, because of the horror that's here. So Hawkeye's kind of stuck, do you understand? It's okay to scream at horrifying things. but he doesn't scream, he tells jokes. The issue with person F is not that they are withdrawn and shy. Now I'm going to ask you a question that if it's true you're going to have a hard time raising your hand but how many of you were shy as a child? See if you were shy, all the shy people raised their hand. See it's kind of... Those of you who raised your hand as someone who had been kind of characterized as being shy when you were a child, How many of you, for how many of you also was that kind of a negative thing to be? Like people tried to fix you from being that. It wasn't really okay to be shy. Understand? Well, see, the issue isn't that you're shy. The issue is that when it's time to relate, you're still being shy. Okay? The issue, this is a person who can walk into a room of 500 people and feel like nobody cares that they're there or even notices that they're there. And they just can't connect. Now, what's interesting is that in the last couple years, what I've realized about myself is really I'm this person. In my family, there was no room for this person, so nobody took that job. There was a good job as a hero, and so I was that. And my brother was the rebel, and he was always compared to me, and he never measured up and all that kind of stuff. But there wasn't really a place for the job of being the shy person, so nobody had that job. Plus, there was only my brother and I, so maybe there just weren't enough kids around to have someone finally fill that job. In the last couple of years, what I've realized is the way that I'm really built, really, is I'm very introverted. Now, you maybe find that hard to believe, and the reason that is, is because, see, right now, it's time to talk. So I'm talking. But if it's about where I would rather be, I would rather be fishing, and I'd rather be alone. When my wife and I go to a party, I'm saying after 15 minutes, can we leave now? And 15 minutes after the party's over and everybody's left, my wife is saying, where did everybody go? We just got started. Okay? So it's time to talk, so I'm going to give the talk. But I'd rather just be alone, understand? But because there was no room for that job in my family, I didn't get to do that job. And so the issue isn't that this person would rather be alone or that they're shy or that they like to withdraw, like they like to do things that are alone kinds of things, like music and art. The issue is that when it's time to relate, they're still disappearing. When it's time to connect, they're still being disconnected. And actually, even though this is the person that tends to provide the family with the most amount of relief, this would maybe be one of the people that I'd be the most concerned about because if their style is to disappear, then I think that this person maybe is a really high risk for suicide and other kinds of behaviors that help them disappear because suicide really is the ultimate form of disappearance. And so what happens with all these people, though, sometimes is that their self-worth, their sense of identity or their sense of shame gets bigger. Their sense of self-worth shrinks and shrinks and shrinks and shrinks. And one day it disappears. And when it disappears, then they disappear. And everybody's all surprised because they were president of the National Honor Society. It's because that was an outside plant that was just masking the inside kind of pain. So the issue is not that people are the way they are. The issue is if they're stuck in that mode so much that when it's time to do something else that the situation calls for, they still are stuck doing the other thing. And then our job in helping these folks is to help them realize that this isn't working and that they don't have to do this job because all this does then is keep person A in the middle of the family and provide an opportunity for the family system to look at person A instead of look at itself. Because even though I've described this as if person A is the issue, the system is the issue, not person A. And people get well one person at a time, and anybody can get well even if the rest of the system doesn't. And with that, I'll take some questions. Yes? Yes? Yes. Yeah, the question is, would I include emotional abuse with the plant of abuse, with violence. And yes, I would. I think that the issue with violence is one of the hurtful ways people try to control this other person that they're getting their sense of okayness from and that emotional abuse is another form of control that people use. Anybody else? Yes. Jeff, something that happened to my family regarding the unspoken rules was don't do as I do, do as I say? Yeah. Because that to me was... Don't do as I do, do as I say was an unspoken rule because if you said that rule out loud, it would sound as inappropriate as it is. So you didn't say that, but yet you kind of knew you had to do that or else you were in trouble. Yeah, don't do as I do, do as I say. Usually you have to be a power person to pull off that rule. You know, you have to... That kind of rule spins off all kinds of other rules, like adults are more important than kids, or men are more important than women, or things like that. Well, just to clarify that, a big thing for my father was when I started becoming drinking age, he said he can always come home and drink, but yet he would take booze in his car and go out on a Friday night and drink in the car. He says, don't you ever do that. Okay. So there, to me, was the mixed message. Right, don't drink and drive, don't drink outside the house, but he could do it, yeah. There's all kinds of rules like that that communicate other rules as well, and that would be an adult-child thing. I remember talking to someone who had a rule that said that boy children were more special than girl children. Anybody know about that rule? But see, nobody says that. Maybe they do say it, but the way that we do sex education with our sons versus our daughters communicates that rule. because somehow women or teenage girls are supposed to be a little bit more responsible than boys are about sexual kind of things. But the way that it was communicated in this family was that when the daughter got to be driving age and got her driver's license, she went to the parents and asked if she could borrow the car, and the parents said, well, we have to talk to your brother. We have to ask your brother. And it wasn't the brother's car, though. It was the parent's car. And so the message was that boy children have an edge here. but if you'd have said that out loud they would have denied it if you'd have said well it seems like boy children are more special in this family they would have denied it they would have said no that's not true but yet that's what was communicated anybody else have a question? yes, Maureen is it possible in a family that's really screwed up for one person to take on more of the jobs because I'm like trying to sort out in my life it's like I fit bunches of those Yeah, the question is, can one person end up with more than one job? Okay, let's just ask the audience. Okay, so yes. It is possible, and not only is it possible, it happens. Because, you understand, it's more about the jobs than it is about the people or the age or the order or the sex or whatever. It's more about the jobs. And when people successfully take on these jobs, it helps the family be stuck, stay stuck. So not only do you have individuals that are stuck, but then you have a whole system that's stuck. The issue, once again, is not that this family has problems. Understand this? Or that people in this family have problems, it's that they're stuck. Because there aren't any families that don't have problems. There's no such thing. Anybody else? Yeah. What if one parent gives up their role as a parent? Yeah, if one person kind of abdicates their job as parent, then the other parent, because they care about their kids, picks up that job and kind of ends up doing both jobs as parent. But then even though they wish the other parent would take back their job, they don't really have to take it back because it's not there anymore. It's been covered, you know. And so that person's struggle then would be to somehow get some help sorting out what would be appropriate for them to do just what their job is and then let the deficiency look as deficient as it is so that the person who is not doing their job can even look like they're not doing their job. But the parents would advocate that role for the children. Oh, that... Yes. If the question is, can the mother give the daughter the mother role or could the father put the daughter in the mother role? Yes, that's true. And what that's called is covert incest. That's like non-sexually consummated incestuous relationship where people have to do the job of the female adult instead of the female kid. And it hasn't been consummated physically, but yet there are lots of daughters that come out of those family systems with a lot of confused messages about men and about women and things like that because they've had a job they shouldn't have had. A lot of times those daughters go marry their dad later on. You know what I mean by that? They go marry someone who's kind of a dad person to them. And what's interesting about that, I'm kind of spinning off a lot of different things here just to show you all the ways that this can go. But a lot of times when someone marries their dad, even though before they were married, they could have struggled sexually like crazy with each other because, of course, they were really attracted to each other and the hormones were in high gear and all this kind of stuff. As soon as they get married, six months later, their sex life disappears because they've got this dynamic of dad-daughter kind of thing, and it's really hard to make love to your dad. And so even though they can't put their finger on what it is about this, they all of a sudden aren't wanting to be sexual anymore, even though before the relationship, it was really a struggle not to be. And they were very attracted to each other, there's a lot of heat in the relationship, it cools down real fast, and it's because you married your dad. And it's really hard to be sexual with your dad. Same thing with your daughter or with your father or your mother or whatever. It's that kind of dynamic happens, and that's because people get squeezed into certain roles. And just because you leave this system doesn't mean you leave all your relationship skills, you know, and all your messages and things like that. So I'll take one more question. Yeah, what would be person number G? G. Well, I don't know. I haven't, I think that we pretty much cover all the jobs, but person G would, I don't know if there is a person G. Yeah, the question is if there was another job to do, what would that be? I'm not sure. You know, maybe you have an idea of, maybe there's a job that one of you in the audience have felt you ended up with that I didn't mention? Is there anybody here who sensed that you had some kind of job that I didn't really cover? That would be person G, whoever. I want the focus of this talk to be on the jobs that help the family stay stuck, not so much on first, second, third, fourth kids and stuff. There is a dynamic like that, and there are books written on birth order and all that, But more about when we're talking about dysfunction, it's the job more than the order. Someone's going to do the job. Thank you.
