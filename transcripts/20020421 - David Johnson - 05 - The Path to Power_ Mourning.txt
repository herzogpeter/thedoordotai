Let's pray as we go to the Word this morning. Father, I pray that by the power of your Spirit, through the Word, declared, your kingdom would come to and expand in our hearts. I pray that in your name. Amen. Amen. When our two boys, Caleb and Christopher, now both of them in college, were little kids, three and four years old, they went through a phase that a lot of kids go through at that age, where they were totally enthralled by a cartoon action hero with the name He-Man. So much so that several times a day, talking several times a day, In the course of their play, they would become He-Man. Running through our house in their He-Man pajamas and their He-Man sword, stopping only to strike the He-Man pose and shout the He-Man slogan with the clap of thunder and a flash of lightning that they could only see in their imagination, but I'm thinking it was real. I am the power. Proceeding then to, with their He-Man sword, kill all the imaginary evil doers who had, unbeknownst to us, somehow gained access to our otherwise quiet abode. Their antics actually made us feel safe. Especially their mother, who was the special object of their little boy protective instincts. They also made us feel very amused. Indeed, sometimes right in front of them, and sometimes later when we replayed the account in our minds, we laughed hysterically because all of us knew that these two little boys, three and four years old, weren't very powerful at all. Happily, they grew out of that, as kids tend to do. Later in their early teenage years, becoming enamored with something much more real and legitimate than he-man pretend, Now it was the WWF. The uninformed, the uninitiated, the unaware, those of you living in a cave, WWF is the World Wrestling Federation. They'd grown up. This is the real deal. No more cartoon character drawings. These guys are real. Their muscles are real, whatever else they are. Wouldn't you say they're real? no longer he-man we didn't hear about he-man anymore now with stone cold steve austin hulk hogan the rock also known as the scorpion king how many of you are wondering how i know this i'll tell you how i know this i called my son in middle of the week i called him at bethel College Christopher. I need some help on a sermon. Sure, Dad, what do you need? Exegesis, parsing a Greek verb? No, no, it wasn't that. What are some of the names of these guys? So early teen years, it wasn't He-Man anymore. It was these guys screaming their slogans and flexing their muscles, throwing the bad guy of the day out of the ring. Leanne Payne, I'm pretty sure, would call all of that disordered masculine strength. so would i but if you're into that kind of stuff they they really do put on a great show if you're into that stuff actually they're incredible athletes it's almost physical freaks for how they look even though the whole thing admittedly is scripted they're really powerful men and women too. But I've met some of those guys and I've heard of others who've come out the other end of that particular lifestyle when their physical power as impressive and imposing and intimidating as it has been begins to abate. And it always does abate sooner or later. And these guys, often having paid an enormous price physically for what it took to get that big, find themselves looking for and often unable to find access to a different kind of power. a kind of power that might help them do their life a kind of power that might go a little deeper and last a little longer and accomplish something a little bit more significant than shouting slogans shooting steroids lifting weights or throwing the bad guy of the week out of the ring externally they had experienced the kind of physical power few people ever enter into but when that physical power begins to do what it always does and that is abate they looked for a different kind of internal power and found not as big a guy inside as most of you know we are dealing these days with the issue of power and how rightly ordered power under God goes a little deeper and lasts a little longer and accomplishes a little more than raw physical power ever could for it is in fact an eternal kind of power of which we speak, an eternal kind of power that has the amazing and wonderful capacity to do more than just throw some guy out of a ring. It has the incredible capacity to help and to heal, To build and to create, to transform and to give life, and to, when necessary, authentically, really confront and defeat real evil. Not just Hulk Hogan, He-Man, pretend evil, where the bad guy, du jour, gets thrown out of the ring. What we've discovered also these weeks is this, that the path to this kind of power in the kingdom of God doesn't follow the normal course we would routinely associate with the procurement of power. For the path to authentic, rightly ordered power in the kingdom of God often doesn't look, sound, or feel very powerful at all, especially on the front end. Indeed, Jesus himself, in his path to power, began his path, according to Philippians 2, by emptying himself. He didn't ascend into power. He descended into power. He didn't pump himself up to get powerful. He emptied himself out to get power. Taking on the form of a slave, and like a slave, he became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. But that path, weak as it looked and felt at times, yielded for Jesus real power, eternal power, the kingdom of God kind of power, for God highly exalted him after he walked that path and gave to him the name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow and every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father, making his path the polar opposite, the mirror image of the cartoon character, the WWF wrestler who looks real powerful on the front end, but turns out in the end to be an illusion in every possible way, not very powerful at all, defeating no real foe and accomplishing no real good. Bottom line is this, beloved, that the path to power in the kingdom of God is the way of obedience even unto death, Philippians 2. It is the way of the servant, Matthew 20. It is the way of the basin and the towel, John 13. And it is the way of brokenness, dependence, and powerlessness that makes you dependent on the power of God, we found out last week in Matthew 18 and Matthew 5. Today, we add this again from Matthew 5, that the path to power in the kingdom of God includes also the way of mourning. Matthew 5, verse 4, Blessed are those who mourn. Which, like the others, doesn't look sound or feel very powerful at all, especially on the front end, until you know what mourning really does, Until you know what mourning really is. It doesn't look powerful at all. Turn with me if you would in your Bibles if you have them. Again this week to Matthew chapter 5. And as you do I need to tell you that I am struck with the poignancy of the fact that it was. That in this season of our church's life. Where right now we are feeling so clearly called to be preparing ourselves. and consecrating ourselves for the new and significant things we know God is doing and is about to do among us, embodied in some sense with our physical move to Maple Grove, but also the things that we sense him doing and calling and preparing to do among us spiritually. That we are revisiting a body of teaching that 15 years ago was foundational to and formational of the new thing that God was about to do among us 15 years ago. Speaking with obvious reference to the Beatitudes that we touched on last week and are going to again today. In fact, a week ago, Saturday, it dawned on me that as I was preaching Matthew 5, 3, blessed are the broken, that the very first time I preached that was 15 years ago and it was the last Sunday we ever had at the Crystal Building. The next week, we went to Cooper and preached the text I'm going to deal with today, Blessed are those who mourn. All of that setting a foundation for what God's done in the past, and it's part of the foundation of what God's going to do and wants to do among us in the future as well. It all began in Matthew 4, verse 12, as it relates to the text. When John the Baptist was taken in custody, it was as if the divine start of history had sounded, and Jesus began his earthly ministry. For from that moment on, from the moment of John's arrest, verse 17 of Matthew 4, Jesus began to preach, saying, Repent, change your mind, turn around, for the kingdom of heaven is within your reach. The reign of God, the power of God, is something that you in your real life can experience in a real way. Verse 18 to verse 22 of that same chapter, He began to gather, call to himself the original 12 in verse 23. His ministry actually began, and this is what he did. He was going about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and doing the gospel of the kingdom as well. He demonstrated it was not just of words, but it was of power by healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people. The result of that was predictable. Number one, news about him spread, verse 24, And the multitudes came to see what was going on and be part of it if they could, verse 25. So the picture is this, as I said last week, Jesus is the hottest thing in town, the senior pastor of the first church of what's happening now at the end of chapter 4. And then in chapter 5, verse 1, he does the most amazing thing. Seeing the multitudes, he withdraws from the multitudes and goes up on the mountain. And after he sat down, his disciples came to him. And opening his mouth, he began to teach them, saying, essentially this, you guys, I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is this. All that power that you just saw put on display is real and it's for you. It is for my holy church to do my kingdom work. It is my kingdom work. The bad news is this, that the path to that power is much different than you think. In fact, the path to that power that you all want is so different than what you think that some of you are going to miss it. See, the kingdom that I bring is not for the put together. It is not for the religious performer, but for the broken. Blessed are the poor in spirit who come up with begging dependence, who recognize they can't save themselves, they cannot transform themselves, they cannot buy themselves, do the work of the kingdom. The people who recognize that come up hungry for a power that is beyond their own, and they're the ones who get it. That's where my kingdom is going. Today it's as if he says this, my kingdom and the power of it is not for the skillful concealer. It is not for the external image builder, but I have reserved the truths of my kingdom, the glory and the power of my kingdom. I have built it for those who mourn. Blessed are those who mourn. All of which raises the question of the day. What does mourning have to do with power? Those two words don't seem to go together. Why is it on the path to power? To be honest, this beatitude, when I first look at it, doesn't even make sense, quite frankly. Blessed are those who mourn. Blessed means happy. Sounds like blessed are the bummed, happy are the sad. I don't get it. It also seems to contradict other scriptures that seem to say, indeed, the opposite of this beatitude. Galatians 6 says that the fruit of the Spirit, among other things, is joy. Not mourning. Proverbs says that a merry heart doeth good like a medicine. You're talking about healing, Dave? It seems like Proverbs says that laughter, not mourning, has the medicinal effects. So here's our work around understanding this beatitude. If what Jesus says in Matthew 5 verse 4 is true, and it is, that the power and the joy and the reality of the kingdom of God comes to and flows through those who mourn. The question we need to answer is this. In what sense is that true? What does he mean by that? Well, beginning to define the word itself helps to clarify it. The Greek word for mourn there is the Greek word penthos. On the surface it simply means what you would expect. It means to grieve, to sorrow, to mourn. All by itself it's not much help. What actually helps is realizing that penthos, that there are nine Greek verbs for the concept of mourning, and the Greek verb penthos, therefore, has some specific rendering that would help us. This one in particular, penthos, speaks specifically to the external expression of an internal reality. In other words, just because you're feeling sadness, just because you're feeling discouragement, sorrow, grief, or even remorse over sin, doesn't necessarily mean you've entered into mourning as defined by the Greek word penthos. Indeed, it isn't until you have externally expressed your sadness, discouragement, sorrow, or grief. It isn't until you begin to authentically repent if the issue is sin and enter into godly sorrow, mourning about that, That you have entered into the essence of this beatitude. This foundational word took root in our church and became part of how we thought and how we spoke. And one of the ways you've probably heard me say this beatitude for years is this. Blessed are those who get out here, what's going on in here. Blessed are those who quit pretending. Blessed are those who quit hiding. For they're the ones who will get the comfort. They're the ones who will get the grace. They're the ones who will enter into the healing power of the kingdom of God. Think about it just for a bit. I think all of us know that it is entirely possible to be sad. Some of you are right now. And it wouldn't take you long to find your sadness. I think we all know that it's entirely possible to be afraid, discouraged, lonely, hurt, angry, failing, some stumbling badly into sin, but to look at you, we never know. Because some of you stumbling badly in sin right now, some of you discouraged, lonely, hurt, angry, and failing, look great. Appear competent, amazingly composed, even powerful, some of you. Because spiritually, sometimes we do the spiritual equivalent of pump you up kinds of stuff. And the closer someone gets to what's really going on inside, we get like blowfish and we get all big and holy about stuff that isn't really holy inside. I mean, I'll just never forget our brother who's gone through, I'm just believing, some restoration years ago. Remember the Jimmy Swagger thing when he was going to a prostitute. At the same time, he was blowing up like a blowfish on Sunday about the evils of prostitution. looked really powerful on Sunday. Really little on the inside. Here's the bad news. People who have issues on the inside, people who are hiding and pretending their sin, their shame, their hurt, their discouragement, people who have those things on the inside, never allowing them to come to the outside, never get to comfort. In fact, in the Greek, this is in the emphatic. Blessed are the poor in spirit. They are the only ones who get the kingdom. Blessed are those who mourn. They alone, they're the only ones who get the comfort. Everybody else gets to keep their sin. Everybody else gets to keep their fear, their discouragement, their sadness, their sorrow, and their grief. But here's the good news. People who have the courage to do what on the front end is a terrifying thing. In fact, you'll never look weaker than the day you start to mourn. you're going to be the polar opposite of the pump you up guy. Blessed are those who begin to get out here and quit hiding what's in here because they are the ones who will get to comfort. They are the ones who will get to grace. They are the ones who will experience the healing power of God and the deliverance of the Holy Spirit. And it might look pretty messy for a while. You might not look real victorious on the day you start to mourn. you might not look real powerful, but you will begin to come to life. I'm wondering if I told you that a few weeks ago I got a picture. Did I tell you that? Yeah, I think I did tell you that. The building in Maple Grove, full of lights, and in my interpretation of that, for me anyway, that picture is symbolic of the reality and power of the kingdom of God come to us and being very alive in that community. Well, I want to tell you that part of what will make that vision a reality is a full functioning of this beatitude among us. So what's Open Door about? Who are they? They're mourners. They're just so, so tenaciously committed to not hiding and not pretending and not denying and not redefining. I want to walk in the light of God's truth and his grace. We have, for some time, behind the scenes, as leadership people have been working on, a clear articulation of our core values. And some of you know what they are, and in the membership process you're going to be exposed to them. In some areas, even of the church, we're going to try to tell you what they are, and I might even preach them. I don't know. We come up with four things that we think are critical, the core. The very first one, you know what it is? Be real. Authenticity. Oh, isn't that cute? It's kind of a cool way to make the church go. That's weird. No, I want you to know something. That being the number one core value. It's not even, by the way, in order of importance. But that being one of our four core values is not some trendy, let's get in touch with our feelings thing. It is at the core of the gospel that we preach. Our understanding of the reality of the kingdom of God and how power in the kingdom of God is accessed. Blessed are those who quit pretending, says the Lord. Blessed are those who stop hiding. Blessed are those who are not afraid to enter into true repentance and godly sorrow over their sin. And you know why we're not afraid? To enter into real repentance, to look full face in our sin and not call it something else, but call it what it is, sin. You know why we're not afraid to do that? Because on the other side of mourning is amazing grace. On the other side of mourning is comfort from the Holy Spirit. On the other side of mourning is healing. I'm going to tell you something, though. On the other side of mourning is more than healing, comfort, and grace. On the other side of mourning, which feels like death when you move into it, is life. Resurrection life. Just back off this whole concept, and let's kind of look at it from relatively superficial levels. You see, the wisdom and strength of this beatitude is not hard to spot, even at superficial levels. Psychologically, emotionally, people sometimes say things like this, I just had a really good cry and now I feel better. Well, you have not plumbed the depths of mourning with that one, but you've tasted it. You know what we're talking about. You're moving in that direction. What that means is you got it out, and now you feel better. Blessed are those who get it out. See, whether we like it or not, understand it or not, the ability to get out here, what's really going on in here, is essential to emotional health. It is a pressure valve, a gift from God, that if not allowed to function, poisons the human spirit, And the longer it is there, it's almost as if you will become less and less and less human. What's odd about this beatitude is that while many people struggle with it, I don't think it's easy to be honest out here with what's going on in here. Christians sometimes struggle with it more than your everyday person. I don't know if that's accurate. You know, that may not be accurate. It's my perception, and I'm kind of around a lot of Christians. but all my life. Christians who somewhere along the line got the message that if you're a good Christian, you just don't struggle. Somewhere along the line got the message that good Christians don't fail. They don't get hurt. They don't stumble. They don't get confused. They don't get depressed. And if they do, they pretend they don't. If they do, they just don't tell. So instead of mourning our sin or getting out here, our discouragement or fear, instead of of disclosing it, confessing it, repenting of it, whatever we have to do with it, we hide it, we deny it, we slap on a happy face and call it the abundant life and then wonder, why is it that people aren't attracted to this version of Christianity that we have that's pretty much based on hiding what's real? And they're not drawn into, hey, how are you, praise the Lord? Larry Crabb calls it victory through denial. creating frighteningly unhealthy people in the name of God. And if people are unhealthy in the name of God it sends a very confusing message, don't you think? About what it means to be a kingdom person or a Christian. One of my favorite scriptures that gets to the guts of what I'm talking about this morning is Galatians 6.12 where Paul describes people like this as being those who have spent the energies of their life. Now think about that. Think about where you spend your energies. The people he's describing are people who have spent the energies of their lives in making a fair show in the flesh. Say it a different way. They've spent the energy of their lives creating an image of what they want people to think about them. And here's the deal. If you have spent energy creating an image and projecting an image, you know what you have to do? You have to, having created it and projected it, now you have to protect that image. Is anybody here tired? That is very tiring work, creating an image, projecting and then protecting that image. You've got to make sure nobody ever sees you down, nobody ever sees the truth. People like this, two people like this, it doesn't really matter if they are good as long as they look good. It's about an image. For people like this, it doesn't really matter if they are loving, happy, or full, just as long as they look loving, happy, and full. And people who are projecting an image will from time to time do a loving thing. It doesn't mean they're a loving person. They have not been formed on the inside with love. They are not full of the Spirit, but they know the language, and they know this behavior and that behavior, and they'll do those things to appear a certain way. People like this have a creed by which they live. They may not be aware that this is their creed. They probably have never spoken this creed. They likely would deny it. And if they heard it, which they're going to hear in just a moment, they would think, well, that's a lousy way to live. The creed is this. How things look is what matters most in this family, in this church, in this circle of friends. Here's the deal about that creed and how it fleshes itself out in relationships. If you live in a family, go to a church, attend a school, or have a circle of friends where how things look is the unspoken creed. And the truth about your experience in that system is this, that how things are will not get dealt with. How things really are in that marriage, in your heart, in your life, will not get dealt with. Do you know why they won't get dealt with? because how things look is what matters in this church, this school, this circle of friends, this family. So nobody ever talks about what's really going on in the family, church, circle of friends, ever, ever, never, ever. Let's say you're struggling with your marriage. Lots of people do. I think everybody does from time to time. but you're in a church or your circle of friends lives by an unspoken creed how things look is what matters so here you are with an ache in your heart that you can't get rid of relative to a lack of intimacy or it's maybe worse than a lack of intimacy there's just some real evil things going on there in your marriage but everywhere you are is an unspoken creed how things look is what matters so you end up spending all the energy of your life in your marriage making sure everybody thinks you have a good marriage and all of a sudden in fact it's become more important that people think you have a good marriage than you really have a good marriage and what that means is you spend all your energy creating the image, making sure everybody thinks well and never getting to the real issues that are ripping your lives apart because it's more important that people think you have a good marriage than you have a good marriage let's say it's a spiritual problem and maybe you're just going through something that a lot of people go through from time to time. Maybe you're going through one of those cloudy moments where you just can't hear God's voice. You pray and he doesn't seem to answer. You don't sense his presence. You used to. You're in one of those places and you're wondering that the whole thing is real. You ever get there? Not me. I know some of you probably have. What if you are the pastor and you're going through that? What if you are the pastor? You know what I know about me? I never wonder if I've jumped off the cliff. You know, all my eggs are in one basket. I put them all in the kingdom basket. And I've jumped. And every once in a while, I feel in this free fall. It just crosses my mind. I wonder if that was the smartest thing to do. I see other people play it safe, and it seems safer. And I'll begin to wonder, is it real? So what do I do with that? I wonder if it's real if I'm in a system where how things look is what matters. Well, I can't tell anybody about that. And guess what I get to do? I get to keep my wonder if it's real. And you know what my wonder if it's real does? You know what it does if I can't get it out here with people I trust and talk about it and wonder about it and bring it to God? You know what it does? It doesn't go away. It grows. My wondering if it's real grows. What if it's not a spiritual problem like that? It's an emotional. You're discouraged. You're depressed. but you're in a system where how things look is what matters and you can't talk about your discouragement. You're a bad, good Christians don't get depressed. I've told you this before, you need to hear it again, 1 Corinthians 7. I'm not by this saying that depression or discouragement is a virtue but you need to understand it happens in normal people. Paul said this, when we were in Macedonia, our flesh had no rest. We had conflicts without, we had fears within. But God who comforts the depressed comforted us. When Paul got depressed, he said, he didn't pretend he wasn't. He said, I am. God comforted him. What if you're struggling with lust? Or your anger's out of control, but you're in a system where how things look is what matters. It's going to become more important that it looks like you don't struggle with lust than you really don't struggle with lust. And so, you won't ever tell the truth about your struggle. You won't ever ask for help. You won't ever mourn over your sin, Because you just got to look good all the time. And the problem with that is then you get to keep your lust. And you get to keep your anger until it just explodes. And then we find ourselves every once in a while saying things like this. Whatever happened to Harry and Sally? They just kind of disappeared. You know, I remember when Mary Harry met Sally. Sorry. I don't always pick the best times to lighten it up. You know, they looked so good. They looked so happy. And I don't know if this is always the case every time the Harrys and the Sallies just disappear. And we find out later that their marriage is a shipwreck. But if they look good and look so happy, what they were doing was spending all the energy of their life convincing us they had a good marriage. and they weren't spending any energy doing what you have to do to get a good marriage. And that is, look at all the stuff. And bring it out where God can heal it. By the way, nowhere is this principle of mourning more powerfully apparent than when it comes to sin. Psalm 32. The psalmist says this, When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away. My vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer. My hiding and pretending literally had a physical effect on me. But when I brought out into the light, now this is the language we were using in 1 John when John was talking about being children of light and walking in the light. When I brought out into the light what I had been hiding in the dark, when I acknowledged my sin and my iniquity, I did not hide any longer, deny, redefine, or blame someone else for. Then he did the most amazing thing. He forgave my sin, renewed my spirit, restored my joy. Listen to those three words. Forgave, renewed, restore. This is a person who is coming back to life. Mourning, real mourning, is not easy. So if you struggle or if the Spirit of God is even putting his finger on something that you need to mourn over this morning, and you're feeling anxiety, even fear, don't feel like the Lone Ranger. Mourning is not easy. I've likened it to the process of throwing up. Now, I know that's a disgusting image, and I lost half of you, but I just got your kids, so just... They're listening now. He's talking about barf up there. Yeah. I hate to throw up. I'll do anything to avoid it. Even when I think it's coming, I'll grit my teeth and... And then I pass the point of no return. But once you do it, you feel better. You get out here, what's going on in here? that image works for me because to tell you the truth when I need to repent and I've been rationalizing and redefining and trying to blame it and put it all somewhere else I don't know how else to describe it but a nausea that starts coming on me that I just know I'm full of it sorry and I got to go somewhere with this and I got to go say I'm sorry and I need to repent and enter into godly sorrow. But let me tell you, let me use that very illustration to clarify something. You see, we live in a culture that more and more really likes to throw up emotionally. Do you know what I'm talking about? They love to get it all out. Jerry Springer. They're getting it all out, aren't they? How many of you know that that's not what I'm talking about. See, we live in a culture that more and more would even take a word like I'm saying. And by the way, I think we need to know that every legitimate thing has a counterfeit. Love has a counterfeit. Mourning, what I'm talking about mourning that includes godly sorrow and true repentance has a counterfeit. And to me, the counterfeit would be just people who are, excuse me, just barfing out their stuff. I hate you. There, it's out. Now you know how I really feel. I just mourn. You didn't mourn. That's not mourning. You revealed what was inside you, that's for sure, but you revealed what needs to be transformed, and there's no repentance there. I'm not talking about Jerry Springer vomit. I'm talking about repentance and godly sorrow is what brings the healing beyond feeling remorse. How many of you have ever heard someone who's really wounded you deeply say something like this? Well, I said I was sorry. and how that somehow doesn't nourish your soul. And you don't even know how to respond because you don't want him to jump through hoops. No, I'm not wanting you to jump through hoops. I don't want to see you grovel. That's really not it. But what you just said means you've never, and you have not even tasted the damage you did. You're not willing to press through the cross of authentic mourning. Oh, I'm sorry. You're never going to feel the comfort. What you want to do is get off the hook. let me draw this to a close by asking some questions assuming we see the value of this getting out here what's on in here going on in here why do we see so little of it why is it still so hard to do well I think I've kind of answered that already let me just give you some other possibilities some people don't ever mourn because they quite frankly never see the need for it And some people never will. See, I think it's possible for some people to so invest in the external image I was talking about earlier that you begin to actually believe the image you've created is the real you. And I do know for a fact, and so do you, I'm quite sure, that you can get to a point where you have so invested in this external image that you want people to think about you, that you totally disconnect from who you really are so that you don't even know who you really are. You believe the image too. Happened to the Pharisees who spent so much time polishing the outside of the cup and of the bowl. That's where they spent the energy of their life, making sure you thought well of them. And they did all sorts of holy behaviors for people to see. Matthew 23, verse 26, that they didn't notice anymore that inwardly they were full of robbery and self-indulgence. And when Jesus has said that to them, you are those who policy outside of the cup and the bowl, and inwardly you're full of robbery and self-indulgence, they were mortified. They honestly did not get it. They could not see it. Because they believed it. That the image they created was the real them. People like that will never mourn. I can't get those people to do it. They won't. So that's one reason people don't mourn. They can't. Don't see the need. Second, another is fear of what people would think. Heard from someone between the services today, who said, you know, Dave, the first time I heard this word, I thought it was the craziest thing I ever heard. I did not believe it at all. I ran for my life as, in a sense. And then God, because I absolutely believed that if people knew about me, what was really going on inside of me, what my secret life was really all about, there was no possible way anybody, especially anybody in the church would ever love me. And then God gave me a grace gift. It was this, I got exposed. This person never even came out willingly. He got exposed. And he goes, now I have a place to put my feet because I found grace and healing. And I don't have to hide anymore. Sometimes we don't mourn because we're afraid of people new. They'd never love us. Sometimes it's despair that keeps us from mourning because we wrongly believe that we're past forgiving, we're past reconciling. I've gone too far and I've gone too far too often. So when the Spirit prompts you to get out here, what's going on in here and repent and enter into godly sorrow over that. The source of your resistance, it is real resistance that you feel. But for some of us, the resistance isn't hardness. It's actually a sense of shame and despair that you are beyond the pale. I just know this is part of the human condition. I've just talked to so many of you. I've even been in this kind of place myself where I will actually believe that there would be forgiveness and grace for anybody here, but not for me, not for you. it's just a lie from the pit of hell and I don't know I can't get big and get all puffed up like the external power all I can do is speak the truth into that lie and call you out maybe you did it once before and that's your problem with mourning now in a church, a bible study maybe with a trusted friend God moved on your heart and you did the most frightening thing you opened wide your heart at a vulnerable moment to get out here what was really going on in here and you divulged that hidden thing instead of comfort and grace they were horrified and condemned and when you felt the assault on your soul from that person you thought you could trust you made a silent vow it was this I will never do that again and you went back into hiding and pretending and to recreating the image that you had worked so hard to get I recall some years ago sharing this series of sermons, not just the ones I'm doing now, but the whole Beatitudes at a pastor's conference. And I don't know, maybe halfway through the time, it was in the middle of my speaking. I was just looking at the people and watching their response and being affected by it. God gave me a word. And it was this, that there were enormous, Dave, you need to know there are enormous levels of pain in this room. And especially, and this was the thing, it was especially in the wives. That was the impression I was getting. That being a pastor's wife and, you know, being in maybe some little church somewhere where there were all sorts of expectations and they, you know, not wanting to, but they almost felt like they had to create this thing because people were putting that on them and there was just enormous amounts of pain. And I started to poke at that and inviting them to get whatever they were feeling out and I bumped into some resistance. And it wasn't hard hearted resistance. In fact, this occasion came to talk and wonder. What got disclosed to me from some of them was, Dave, you just need to know if I'm afraid of doing this because if I ever start to get out here, what's going on in here, if I ever release the anguish and the pain and the weeping that I feel in here and I let it out here, I'm afraid I'll never stop. And so just keep it. buttoned down. The glory of that weekend is that some of them began to come out here with what was in here. And it was messy. And they came to life. Some people don't mourn because they love their sin. You know, we're talking about repentance a lot this morning. Some people don't mourn because they've embraced their sin and they love their sin. I don't have any energy and never have to try to wrestle sin out of your grip. if that's your mistress you know she's ugly no it's not to you my prayer is that before you die you're going to find out how dry that is and you're going to come up real thirsty and find out the blessed are the broken and hope you do that before you die another reason people don't mourn this is the final one is the general superficiality in the church we just don't call for it and without knowing it we end up treating the wounds of our people lightly saying it's okay to hide everybody does it's okay to deny it's okay to pretend you don't really need to repent you don't need to enter into godly sorrow just say sorry problem is you never enter into authentic comfort healing no kingdom power another question does anybody here have anything in here that needs to come out here today maybe fear rage confusion maybe sin maybe something that this time for whatever reason you just can't medicate with your busyness you know that that's why a lot of us are busy it's not that we're so busy it's that we it really is a way to not have to face what's really going on. Maybe something that's so big you can't medicate it with your good grades or your athletic achievement or your success in business or your circle of friends or your new toy or your He-Man imitation. What do you think would happen? If in this room right now, the people who are right now being prompted by God's Spirit to bring out into the light what they're hiding in the dark, what do you think would happen if they did that? If you did that? well I don't want to sound like a know-it-all but I know what would happen I absolutely know for certain what would happen the kingdom would come the power of the spirit would fall to heal beloved there is a path to power that yields real power but it's an odd path it's an unfamiliar path because when you're actually on this path it doesn't look sound or feel like the right path it doesn't feel very powerful at all at least on the front end and part of that path is the way of mourning it doesn't look good on the front end but the product is power to heal, to live and to be transformed. I'd like you to bow your heads and just be quiet for a moment. Thank you. The word I have to close is simply this. Very simple. Today, if you hear God's voice, don't harden your heart. Don't close your heart to what he's calling out. Some of you, before you leave this morning, need to mourn something. For some, it will mean entering into repentance and godly sorrow. some of you can do that by yourself and then bring that where it needs to go with appropriate people following this someone may be some of you who need to do that may be near a trusted friend and you can just stay where you are and do your work with God as you confide in a friend about something you need to do or somebody you need to talk to or something you need to make right but some of you may need some help sometimes we need help to get out here what's going on in here and the altar team will be here the ministry team will be here for those of you who need that and I encourage you to come don't harden your heart if God is opening your heart to this life producing path Father I pray that you would continue to strengthen and establish among us the foundation of this word that you gave to us years ago that clearly needs to be part of the foundation of where we're going now. To be a people who relentlessly with each other in community and with you refuse to hide, refuse to pretend, refuse to redefine and call it something else, but to walk in the light of what is real and true, about what's going inside so we can walk as free and living people. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
