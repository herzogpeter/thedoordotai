Let's start this morning with prayer. Father, I ask that once again in this service, by the power of your Spirit, there would come through the Word, to counteract and begin to diffuse the power of lies that we believe. In this arena that we are dealing with these days of our sexuality and the ways in which we as men and women have been wounded terribly, I pray that you would bring, once again this week, to your body a powerful move of healing and rediscovery of our wonderful humanity in light of your grace. Do your work among us in Jesus' name. Amen. I think most of you are aware of the fact that we are involved these weeks in a series of sermons that through some evolutionary process has come to be called the pain of pornea. Now, we didn't choose that topic out of the blue, but rather in the simple flow of our study in the book of Acts, We came several weeks ago, actually back in mid-December, to chapter 15, verse 20 of Acts, where the Apostle James, at the Council of Jerusalem, gave instruction to the Gentile believers, brand new believers, not from Jerusalem. These people would have been coming out of the secular society. He gave them instructions to abstain from four things. Among them was fornication, abstain from the Greek word pornea. Now, we have broadly defined that word over these weeks as sexual relations between a man and a woman outside the context of marriage. More specifically, we find that the Greek word pornea comes from the root porne, which means harlot for hire. The male form of that pornos is male harlot for hire. So that just brings up some other images. Barclay, in his book, Flesh and Spirit, brings this concept and added nuance, if you will, to the concept of what we're dealing with. When he says this, quote, Pornea is the love which is bought and sold. The great pain of pornea is that the person with whom such love is gratified is not really considered a person at all, but a thing to be used. He or she is a mere instrument through which the demands of lust and passion are satisfied. Pornea describes the relationship in which one of the parties is used as a thing is used, discarded as a thing is discarded, where there is no union of nor respect for personhood. And you don't have to be a prostitute on Hennepin Avenue to have felt the damage of that kind of porneia in your life. The Greeks took this term porneia, kind of rounded it off to apply to what they considered to be every vice. It would have included adultery, things like homosexuality, bestiality, incest, rape, etc., etc. Pull all of those things together. you've got pornea. More than pornea, we've discovered you find also the pain of pornea. And we have indeed these weeks been pulling back the cover on this thing, exposing the sin of pornea and the grievous wound that is its result. But all through this, believing that in pulling back the cover to expose the wound, there is for that wound healing and wholeness, holiness. There is hope. And there is grace for this. We believe that when God spoke through the prophet Joel, in Joel 2, verse 25, that He would indeed restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, that that is true. In fact, if that wasn't true, we would be very frightened to pull back the cover on this thing. Of all the letters I've gotten most sad over these weeks have been the letters often anonymous from some of you that I would love to somehow get my arms around who say this, I have been affected by the pain of porneia, either through my perpetration or my victimization, and I'm glad you're talking about this, but in one way or another, some of you have communicated to me, it's too late for me. Healing is beyond my grasp. And of all the lies, beloved, that like flies swarm around this issue, That message that says you are beyond health and hope and healing and grace may be the most lethal of them all. One of the things I want to indicate as we wade back into this issue is that during this series, odd as it sounds, I need to publicly say that parental discretion is advised. I also need to tell you that much more next week than this week, that will be true. Some of the issues we're going to be dealing with, material we'll be exposing, will be and consistently is rather explicit. And there is no desire on my part to shock or to be sensational about this, but I have a desire to speak the truth and speak as straight as we possibly can about this. Let me tell you where we are in our study right now. In the broader scope of this whole issue of pain of pornea, what we're doing right now is dealing with what I've come to call three whatabouts. The first whatabout is this. Whatabouts, in the light of the pain of pornea, healthy sexuality? Is there such a thing as healthy, holy, happy, safe sex? We dealt with that a couple of weeks ago. The second whatabout, going to deal with this week, what about singleness and sexuality? the third thing what about homosexuality and we will deal with that in a few weeks to come today's singleness and sexuality this issue I'm going to break into two parts covering at least two weeks I'm covering myself there at least two weeks if we go further we may this week what I want to talk about is singleness and being single the state of singleness and use that as an introduction to and a foundation for next week when we talk about singleness and being sexual. Just to kind of preview that a little bit, one of the questions I'd like to have in your hopper as you come even next week is this. What does it mean? What does it look like for a single adult male, for a single adult female in this culture, more specifically, in this church, to be alive physically, to be alive that is redeemed spiritually, and at the same time, be alive, aware, healthy, and holy sexually. Are there any parameters that would come around that for our single people, as well as marriage? Are there any principles? Are there any tracks to run on? Has God spoken to us as it relates to our sexuality and our singleness in any way at all? For sexual purity. Is there a helpful word beyond just don't do it? Here's the word. Don't do it. Here's the question. Do you have some help beyond just telling us, don't do it? Is the only hope as single people that we've got for sexual purity, a denial of and a repression of all things about me or about you that are sexual? Is that the only path we can walk down to move into sexual purity? We are going to deal next week with some things often unspoken in church, but spoken often in other arenas. We are going to talk about, I cannot get into sexuality, singleness, without talking about things like, I can't do it. I just have to say it. We're going to talk about masturbation. I needed to say that word this week to just kind of get you used to it. We're going to talk about it next week. I can't believe I said that word in church. I want to tell you some about that before we even get to it next week. This issue is not a singles-only issue. we're going to talk about something else that I don't think you can deal with sexuality at any depth at all in any depth at all and not touch on we're going to talk about pornography not an issue for singles only we're also going to talk about Christian singles who in the name of keeping the rules are pushing in their sexual behavior the limits of sexual activity to include literally everything but the one thing that is everything but intercourse and thinking by including everything but that one thing, they are maintaining their sexual purity. We need to talk about that. Now, with all of that as kind of a preview and a warning for next week, it occurs to me we're either going to fill this place up or empty it out. There's another thing that occurs to me, and that is this. I promise we're going to talk about that. I didn't tell you who we're going to get to talk about that. I wonder who we're going to get to talk about all this stuff. I'm going to talk about it. But today, as a preface to, as a foundation for that very important word, I want to talk about something else very important, singleness and being single. Let me explain at the beginning why I think it's so important to land on this for a week, to spend some time here. The priority reason for me, quite frankly, is this. When it came to my attention through what we think is a pretty significant survey in our body recently that revealed that fully 48% of our adult population in this church is single. Now, by single, I want to tell you what we mean. Single would fall into at least three categories, maybe more if we want to get a little technical, but three generally. One category of singles among us would be those never married. 1 Corinthians 7, verse 25, Paul calls this group, I hope not presumptuously, virgins. The second category of singles among us would be those who were formerly married, single again. First category in that area would be those divorced. 1 Corinthians 7, 8, Paul calls them the unmarried. I like that. It kind of sounds like the undead, the unmarried. Now, you've got to get a different mental image. If we've got 48% of our population single, it's important that all of us understand who you are. A divorced person is different than someone never married. In this category, you've got large percentages of people who are raising their children now by themselves. single parents. Moms raising their children by themselves. Dads raising their children by themselves. That's in our population. I want us to know that little sensitivity training for our church, if you will, that all of the singles in our church are not 19, 20-year-old juniors at Bethel College. Some of them are, but that is not the single profile of our church. Another category of singleness among us in our culture would be widows. Those formerly married, though through the death of a wife or husband, are on their own, and they would fit much into the same situation as the unmarried or the divorced, who are now, in many instances, raising their children by themselves. Now, just as you kind of get a profile of our church, it was interesting for me to discover in the last couple of weeks that the percentage of adult singles in urban areas nationally is right around 42%. I don't know if that clicks with you at all, but it kind of looks like, whoa, that means that we have in our church a pretty accurate mirror of what's going on in our culture. And I am even more affected by the fact that we have that in our church when I became aware of the fact that nationally, according to national surveys, in most churches, think about this, the single population is 15%. And the smaller the church, as you could predictably, I think, assume, the smaller the church, the less population of single people there are because I don't think hostility towards singles might be felt like that, but just this real focus on family and nothing else. Family defined as one man, one woman, three children, and a dog. New York City, interesting. population of singles in New York City is 58%. Does that sound high to you? It sounds high to me. In this category of 18 years old up through retirement, that, by the way, I don't know if I gave you that, that's singles from 18, it's in my mind, up through retirement. Los Angeles, it's 54%. The reason those percentages are so high is because of the very high percentage, 40% of those people are formerly married. That is, they are now divorced. in light of the study we're involved in right now, the pain of porneia, I just have a question about that very high percentage. How many of those marriages, I just wonder, did indeed break up because directly or indirectly the pain of porneia invaded, either because of perpetration or victimization, either because of issues that were brought into the marriage and made intimacy almost impossible, relationship very difficult, finally dissolving the marriage, or issues that maybe were brought into the marriage, brought into the marriage perpetration right there, and victimization right there. If porneia has anything to do with some of the breaking up of these marriages, then we've got a lot of wounded people. So, 48% of the population at Church of the Open Door is single. Some of you are single, never married. Some of you are divorced, single parents. Widows, single parents. This might sound a little corny, but we've never done this before, so I'm going to sound a little corny. To the 48% population at Church of the Open Door, those single adults among us, I say, hi. Hi. We recognize your presence. We're glad you're here. but I have a question as it relates to singleness and being single now it's really a question for the singles but I want everybody to get into this a little bit the question is this singles what does it feel like in our culture whether you've never been married now maybe you're unmarried and maybe raising your children what does it feel like in this culture to be single given the sea of pornea within which we swim cannot get out of that it's just the way it is given the pressures on your life just to live to raise your family in a single context given the messages that you get about the value of single people the place of single people in our culture what does it feel like to be single? Another question. Throw it in the pot, stir it around. What does it feel like to be single in this church? What kind of messages, I wonder, do you get when you're in our body? Subtle? Maybe. Blunt? Maybe. What kind of support or lack of same do you feel when you're here? Seems to me there must be some sort of support, must be some sort of welcome magnet of some kind for you to be here at all. But I wonder, is there any dissonance in you about being here as a single person? Let me ask you another question. Throw it in the pot, stir it around. Are you okay? Is it okay with you that you're single? Let me ask another question for the marrieds. Is it okay with you, marrieds, that they're single? It's a weird question. No, ask that question. And think about that question as I go through some of these other things. Are you settled about being single? It's really okay. Or are you mad about it? or are you sad about it? And in light of however it is you're doing with your singleness, ask this question. How am I living my life? In light of the fact that I'm pretty mad about being single, how do I live? In light of the fact that I'm just kind of sad about it, how am I living? In light of the fact that I'm really okay with it, how am I living? Some of you very well are living. Some of you, however, may be like one writer said, an airplane in a holding pattern waiting to get clearance so you can land. Landing is marriage. When you get to marriage, now my life can start. Now my plans can begin. Now my future will unfold. But until then, you're kind of like this plane in a holding pattern waiting for life to start. Another person put it this way. Some of what singles sometimes struggle with is this. They look at marriage like a box that needs to be checked before they can launch out with life's dreams. Looking at marriage as if into that, in that I will find my fulfillment, I will find my completion, I will find my wholeness. Because of all those questions that I just raised and have not yet answered, we need to deal with singleness and being single before we deal with singleness and being sexual. The biblical base I want to use for this discussion and wrestling match with this concept is 1 Corinthians 7. Let me tell you why. The priority reason I want to use this passage is because much of what was going on in Corinth as it relates to its culture and as it relates to its church in the area of the pain of porneia, confusion about relationships and distorted sexuality mirrors very closely both our culture and our church. First of all, what was going on in Corinth. Get this in your mind as you get a profile of the church. Much like the church in Antioch, Syria, the people who Paul was writing to were pretty much new believers. Most of them were coming out of a secular context into their life in Christ. They were not like the Jerusalem Jews who were coming to Christ with a real biblical kind of background. If I were to give it a contemporary picture, the people in Corinth were not people who grew up in Sunday school. Most of them didn't go to Awana. Most of you don't even know what Awana is. Great. They didn't. And they were coming into their life in Christ with a lot of baggage from their secular life. A little picture came to me that I think is really important to just notice as a church, even in terms of where we are right now in our pilgrimage. Several years ago, we spent some time in Matthew, three years to be exact. Almost all through Matthew, we dealt with people who were called the Pharisees. They were the embodiment of religious hypocrisy. On the outside, they looked good. They could say the words. They wore the robe. They put on the performance. But the confrontation of the Word of God and Matthew to them was, though they looked good on the outside, on the inside they were full of dead men's bones. And Jesus assaulted them. And in our church, we kind of waged war against pretend Christianity and called people to the reality of life on the inside. In Corinth, you don't have people parading their piety out here, But dead on the inside, you've got indeed exactly the opposite issue. In Corinth and in Antioch, Syria, Acts 15, you've got a bunch of people who have been washed by the blood of the Lamb. Brand new creatures on the inside, holy and fit for heaven. By faith made new. But on the outside, pretty messy. And the process of ministry to them, the work of sanctification was not to get them to quit pretending. The process of ministry to them and the work of sanctification was for them to get what was really going on on the inside, that is, a brand new heart, a whole new identity, perspective, and standing with God, and to get that to move to the outside. Which, by the way, is a much easier, much more delightful job than dealing with Pharisees where you've got to confront the external behavior to get to their heart. We're dealing here with people who've got hearts for God but need a work to come out here. So what are they coming into church with? Well, they're coming in with their culture. In Corinth, marriage was a mess. Divorce was rampant. Much like in Israel, divorce was happening for any cause. Different than Jerusalem. In Corinth, women could divorce as well. Jerusalem, Israel, Jews couldn't, women weren't allowed to divorce, but because women could in Corinth, the divorce rate was higher. There was in Corinth a militant, reactionary, understandably angry feminism that was polarizing people, sending them in opposite directions. That wasn't going on in Israel, but it was happening in Corinth. Sexuality, bestiality, pedophilia was widespread in Corinth and it was constantly pushing for a broader acceptance. In reaction to all of that kind of stuff, I mentioned a few weeks ago that in Corinth there was a rising influence of Stoicism that said all sexuality, indeed all physical pleasure, is evil and some were embracing that to find some form of sanity in the sea of pornea within which they lived. And woven into all of that stuff was a conflicting but powerful message to the single people of that culture. And the message strongly, clearly was this. Something is very wrong with you if you're single. In that culture, singleness and defectiveness were synonymous. Proverb of the day would have sounded like this. Seven kinds of people who can't go to heaven. Number one, a man who has no wife. Number two, a woman who has no children. The wisdom of the day sounded like this, quote, a man who has no wife or child has slain his posterity and lessened the image of God in the world. So here I am a single person and the mentality of the day is single people without wives, husbands, and children have lessened the image of God in the world. Ask yourself a question, single person in Corinth. Do you feel any pressure? Ask yourself this question. Let's be a single person, maybe formerly married, maybe never married, in Corinth. This question. What kind of work do you think it took for the single people in that culture and church to really be okay with their settledness? To walk into the Corinth context and kind of just walk in there and go, I am a single adult male, and you know what? It's okay. What kind of work would that be? I am a single adult woman, and you know what? It's okay. What kind of work would that be? How many years of therapy? What do you think? You know, I hear these messages. Seven kind of people don't go to heaven. Slain the posterity of God in the world. The image of God in the world. You've destroyed it. And I think, boy, good thing it's not like that anymore. Well, let's line our singles up and ask them if it's like that anymore. We don't say it that straight anymore. But let me tell you, as current, timely, contemporary as this week's newspaper, Thursday, February 18th, Star Tribune, the newly appointed Attorney General Janet Reno, quote, denied this week being homosexual after an extremist gay rights group, Queer Nation, interesting title for a group, called a news conference asserting, quote, she is more likely than not homosexual. Now, whether she is or not is something, apparently, we're probably going to see unfold in the papers. But the point is not whether she is or not. The point is this, according to the article, that the reason Janet Reno was open to these accusations was, quote, had to do, quote, with more to do with society's assumptions and expectations about women who reach middle age without marriage, without children, than it does any behavior on her part. So here's the culture's mentality toward single, adult, middle-aged women. Men too, I suppose. 35? Single? Oh, never married, huh? And no children? Something must be what? Wrong with you. Feel any pressure? You know, after a while, I would think the single people among us would not need anybody else wondering if something was wrong with them. If you get these messages long enough, even though subtle, the message pretty soon from your own lips is this, something must be wrong with me. Well, let me ask this question of our people that I asked of the Corinthian singles. Beloved, what kind of work does it take in this culture, in this church, for our single people to really be okay with being single? To really be able to walk into our culture and say, I'm a single adult male, and it's okay. And there's nothing wrong with it or me. And I'm a single adult woman, and you know what? It's okay, and there's nothing wrong with it or me. What kind of work does it take? You know, I would bet that some of you, in processing the work it's taken for you to get okay with being single, that sometimes you had to get angry. And it's kind of sad you had to get angry. Somewhere along the line, you kind of had to say it out loud, had to get in somebody's face and say, Leave me alone, Mom. You know, get off my back, Dad. Here's some truth. Counteract the lie. In singleness, there is dignity. In singleness, there is wholeness. In singleness, there can be found holiness. There can be found fulfillment. There can be experienced intimacy with men and with women. The opening up and the entering in of hearts that join people together. Single people can enjoy and experience that. There is among singles productivity, balance in life, happiness with singleness. It is seemly, it is good, it is godly, and to that sentiment, hear the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 say, Amen, that is right. This is the end of side 1. Do not fast forward the tape. Please turn the cassette over now to continue listening on side 2. In fact, quite frankly, the Apostle Paul in this chapter says, I prefer it. More than prefer it, he recommends it. Verse 8, listen to this. To the unmarried, that is those divorced, and to the widows, I say it is good for them to remain as I am. Now, I don't know that all of you know, so I'll just tell you that Paul was a single man. That's an interesting thing to keep in the hopper of our thinking as we go through this, because he can become a model for us in our singleness. Another thing you need to know, however, about Paul's singleness is most believe that he was formerly married. Some speculate that his wife somewhere along the line died. We don't have any record of that. Nor do we have record of his ever being divorced, except speculation is strong even in that arena. Having been a member of the Sanhedrin, that's why most believe he was married, to be in the Sanhedrin. You needed to be married. when he became a believer some speculate that his wife was forced to divorce him considering him as a dead man the point is this Paul was a single man and from his singleness he is appealing to singles in light of a culture that said something's wrong with you to be single saying out loud with whatever power or credibility I have in your life I want to counteract the lie and say it is a preferable thing. It is a good thing, seemly. And right. Don't automatically run from it because marriage looks more familiar. Verse 25, chapter 7, Now concerning virgins, those never married, I have no command of the Lord, not trying to put a weight on you like you can't get married, but I do give an opinion as one who is trustworthy. Hear me, it is good. for a man or a woman to remain as he or she is, that is a virgin, that is a single. Verse 40 says the same thing. Speaking here to the widows, who he says in verse 40 are free to remarry, but then he says, in my opinion, you will be happier if you remain single. So, here's my question. Why is he saying that? Well, for one thing, I think what he's saying is this. Singles, in light again of this incredible weight of the message we've gotten that if we're not married, we're not okay, I want you to at least stop for a moment and consider the possibility that singleness, number one, is a genuine, viable lifestyle to be actively embraced. Number two, marriage is not the panacea that some of you think. Marriage, singles, will not make you holy. It will not bring you wholeness. It will not cure your loneliness. It will not make you more productive. It will not make you more useful in the kingdom of God. And if you want proof of that, we'll line up some married people. you know it's interesting how we begin to think things and they just kind of become part of the fiber of our being without ever evaluating them and then when you throw a little truth up against it it looks as silly as it is this thing about being useful in the kingdom I was kicking this idea around as it relates to singles and I thought how many pastors of churches that you know are single I mean, that's kind of a place of spiritual authority. How many are single? I began to wonder if I was single. I even talked to my wife about this. Bonnie, I wonder if something happened to you and you died or something and it was a terrible thing, if I would continue to be the pastor to open doors as a single person. And the answer I thought was yes. And I think after 12 years of ministry, they would go, yeah, it wouldn't even be a thought. But I wonder if I came in that way, if I'd have been hired. Think about that. Think so? Well, the fact that you even have to think about that and search for single people who you know the church has embraced and given places of significant authority because of their giftedness. Think about this. Jesus was single. Well, that was different. That was different. You know, it's like Jesus wouldn't have been hired, you know? Do you think Jesus had to deal with this issue? Well, if the culture that I just painted for you is accurate, He probably did somewhere. And in this light, looking at Jesus as it relates to ministry, it almost becomes laughable. I mean, I can just picture some sweet, well-intentioned person coming up to Jesus and saying, Why, Jesus, why haven't you married? You seem like such a nice person. Did you hear that? Did you hear that? You seem like such a nice person. Seem. Must not be. Because you're single. And if you're single and you're middle age, around 30 here, ministry hasn't quite begun yet, something must be what? Wrong with you. Jesus, I really think you are a nice person. I have a cousin in Bethsaida. Doesn't that sound stupid? Pick another one. The Apostle Paul, the model for ministry, a single man, hear his voice added to what we are proclaiming today, saying, no, that isn't true. There are reasons to embrace singleness, to remain as you are, if you will. And while in chapter 7 he gives several, I'm not going to give them all, I do want to give you quickly three reasons he gives. To stop for a minute and before you run into marriage, because it's familiar, because the culture says that's where you have to be, stop for a minute, number one, because of the present distress, he says. Verse 26, chapter 7. I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that it is good for a man or a woman to remain as he or she is, that is, single. Now, most of the commentaries that I dealt with explained the present distress. The word distress is violence in the context of a persecution that was to come. It wasn't here yet. And in fact, historically, ten years from when this book was written, Nero, the emperor, came and made it his mission in life to violently kill Christians. And so their appeal in terms of what Paul meant about the present distress was this. You need to think about being single because if you get married, you're going to get tied in real tight with your wife or your husband. You're going to have children and your heart is going to be drawn to them and connected with them. And if persecution comes and you have to watch them die and suffer, your heart's going to get torn from you. Let me tell you why I don't believe that that is a good explanation of that verse. There is an assumption in that explanation. that I reject. You know what the assumption is? Some of you heard it. The assumption is the only people who will have intimate relationships that if I lost that relationship it would feel like my heart being torn from my chest is married people. Only married people know how to be really close to people like a wife or a husband or a child. Couldn't possibly be that single people might have a friend or several friends held so dear and so entered into and opened up to that if they died, it would indeed be the heart being pulled from their chest. Don't get married, no pain. That's not true. I don't buy that explanation. I believe the present distress, very possibly, maybe on one hand, more present than a persecution that's going to happen ten years down the road. Not only more present, but more temporary than a persecution that's coming ten years down the road. because, just keep this in mind, present distress is the present distress. And this distress might be worked through in a year or two. So what are you talking about? What is the present distress? I think possibly, throw this in the hopper, these are people who I described at the beginning as newly redeemed. These guys didn't grow up in Sunday school. They're coming out of their culture and they're walking into their new life in Christ with their culture all over them. And they're walking into their new life in Christ with all of their confusion about marriage, walking in with all their pain of porneia, all of their addictions not fully dealt with, all of their inability to have intimate relationships with anybody. And if at this time in their life, by the way, all those things being their distress, and if at this time in their life they were to start looking for a man or looking for a husband, they wouldn't even have a clue what to look for. In fact, if they did find a husband or a wife, they would probably find someone just like the one they came from that was incredibly destructive and altogether painful. In view of the present distress, in view of the issues you've got in your life, what you've come out of, what you're feeling right now in your life, take a little time to feel your pain to look at your sin to consider your addictions and in the middle of that stop a minute and embrace your singleness embrace that almost right now as a gift not almost as a gift as a gift One of the things you need to grasp and grapple with in your singleness is that whatever your present distress is, please stay single long enough to know marriage won't fix it. And that leads to the second reason Paul gives to remain single. Some of you remain single. And that is because if you do get married, you will have trouble. Verse 28. It's kind of backpedaling here at the beginning of the verse. And he says, if you should marry, you haven't sinned. I'm not telling you don't get married. And if a virgin should marry, she has not sinned. I'm not trying to put a weight around your neck here. But you will have trouble in this life. And I'm trying to spare you. If you get married, you will have trouble. Now, I refer to this, if you remember, a few weeks ago. The Greek word for trouble here is thlipsis, and it means to press together. The Greek word for life, interestingly, is sarx, and it means flesh. I think a way to understand it a little better is humanity. What happens in a marriage is a man and a woman come together, and they bring to that marriage, that union, their sarx, their flesh, their humanity. And as I indicated a couple weeks ago, kind of using my wife and me, we bring things into our marriage. Some of them are good, some of them are not. What it is is just our humanity, and they come together, and all of that stuff gets pressed together. Now, there are some aspects of being pressed together with my wife, quite frankly, that excite me. I like being pressed together with her, because I really like her. But there are other aspects of being pressed together that feel like we're pressed together. Like we're stuck. And in that process of being pressed together, all of the issues in your life begin to surface. All of the unreconciled issues begin to come to the fore. And the reason that we need to grasp this concept very well, singles and married people, is to break the lie that says, Your problems can be solved. Your addictions will be cured. Your loneliness will drift away. Your sin will disappear because marriage will fix them. The truth is, according to this word, thlipsis, that says they will be pressed together, your issues, your addictions, your sin will be revealed. They will be magnified. You know what I just said? What I just said is this. Let me just use sexual addiction as an example. Sexually addicted female or male goes into marriage thinking what, maybe? If I get married, this sexual addiction problem will be handled. It will go away. I have a promise for you. Here is the prophet Dave. Here's the promise. Your sexual addiction will not be cured in marriage. It will be magnified in marriage. It will get worse. So what's the word, Dave? It is not never married. It's not the word. Here's the word. Do not link anymore. Break forever the connection in your mind between fulfillment, health, joy, usefulness as a person, wholeness and value, and marriage. Marriage has no power to bring any of those things into your life. lots of married people are horribly unfulfilled and desperately lonely sounds like something else must be the issue see the issue for married people and single people is that I can't get my life from my wife or my husband or my children or a prospective promise of a wife or husband. I've got to get my life from another source. I've got to understand my identity in Christ. I've got to come to grips with me and who I am and what my issues are. Whether I'm married or not, I need to do that work. Our need as human beings is not sexual. We don't need sex. The number one belief of a sexual addict is sex is a need. If I don't have it, I will die. If you believe that, you will be owned by your need, supposedly, for sex. Sex is not a need. It's a want, it's a desire, it's a good one. Marriage is not a need. Having children is not a need. Those are wonderful things. What we as people need is intimacy. What we as people need is to know and to be known. And the truth that we need to proclaim today relative to this is this, that just because you're single does not mean you cannot know overwhelming levels of intimacy, knowing and being known, and still maintain sexual purity. It also does not mean that just because you're married that you will automatically experience intimacy. One writer put it this way. Marriage is like flies in a window. How romantic. The flies on the outside want to get in. And the flies on the inside want to get out. I think that's a great picture because what it does, what it does is it raises everything I'm saying here. It's almost like saying marriage is not the issue for you flies trying to get out. You're thinking marriage is the problem. If it wasn't for the stupid window, I would be free. Hello, hello. Maybe marriage isn't the problem. Maybe there's something else that's a problem because there's flies on the other end of that window going, Oh, marriage is the solution. No. Break. Break that lie. Holy Spirit, come and break that lie. Marriage is a gift. It's a wonderful thing. But marriage will not solve your problems. It'll reveal your problem. Maybe it's good for that. Third reason Paul gives for remaining single final. One real benefit, Paul says, and I want you to consider it, singles, especially in light of these lies you're getting told, that something's wrong with you if you're single. One of the wonderful values is this, according to Paul, single-minded purpose in life, single-minded service, free from what Paul calls, in verse 35, distractions. Verse 32, he says, Single people, I recommend you to stay there because you are free from concern. I'll explain what those concerns are. I have single people going, yeah, I used to have my life. I have lots of concerns. Verse 34, speaking to married people, your interests are divided because you've got a family, you've got children, you've got a husband or a wife. Verse 35, this I say, singles, for your benefit, not to put a restraint upon you because you are free to marry, but to promote what is not being promoted in our culture or in our churches. Something that is seemly. That is singleness. And in your singleness, to secure undistracted devotion to God. Now, sometimes biblical language, when we wade through it, we can get to the core of truth, but it confuses us and it sounds so lofty. What I hear Paul saying in these words to singles about single-minded purpose and service, undistracted service, is this. It's as if he's sitting here, heart to heart, eye to eye, saying, you know, you guys, I'm a busy guy, Paul. I'm a busy guy. I have a lot of things I'm involved in, and one of the glories of singleness, and what I would like you to join me in relative to the energy around singleness, is this. I get to do my passion with an incredible focus. My friend Peter doesn't get to do the same freedom thing that I get to do. Please get married. If God's given you that gift, it's great. It's great. But would you please consider that in singleness, there are some incredibly exciting opportunities. Do your passion. And quit putting your life in hold as if marriage is what's going to be the landing field. Land already. Do your dreams. I'm in a mode right now where I'm aware that in our church, I just can't take anything for granted and make assumptions. So I'm going to speak to the marriage just for a moment about these distractions. So I can hear some of us kind of hearing that these distractions that are part of married life. And some of us in marriage are going, yeah, you're a kid in distraction. If it wasn't for these distractions I got in my life, I would serve God. And you kind of like to get out of your distractions. You're on the window hoping to get out. The distractions that you have in your life as a married person, your husband, your wife, those are your distractions. Your children, those are your distractions. I have in my home four little children. They are my distractions. Those distractions for me are very often wonderful, delightful, roll on the floor, laugh and play. Other times, they're distractions. God has called me to those distractions, and I am less free to do everything else I want to do because of my God-given distractions. And I am called by God to invest my life first in my distractions. my four children and my wife, and she in us as well. And if I, in the name of serving God, ignore my distractions, you two married people, God's going to deal with us about that. He did with Eli the prophet. You might remember this guy. He had two sons. They were named Hophni and Phinehas. They were very rebellious, caused Eli lots of pain for two reasons. Number one, they had very stupid names. if my father called me Phinehas I would hate him forever or Hophni not much better here's the real reason they rebelled because they had incredible pain they had an absent father who in the name of serving God ignored the call of God in his life to pay attention to his distractions His godly, precious distractions. And singles, while in our culture, marriage is constantly held up as the way to be somehow, and that strong message is in the church as well. Would you please embrace yourself? Stop for a minute and look at your singleness. and embrace it before you run to what may not be a solution for you at all. Let me close by just giving a word to the singles among us. It is a word from me personally. It is a word that I can give to you on behalf of our elders. It is a word that I hope even has the ring of coming from God. The word is this, from us. Do not let anyone ever devalue your singleness. Singles. Do not let anyone cast even subtle aspersions upon your value, your place, or your usefulness in the kingdom. Hear this forever. The Apostle Paul, single himself, seemed to think you could be more useful, more productive, more focused. It was a status he clearly preferred. And even after all of those things, I still hear this little voice. Now, the voice is a little softer than it was in the middle of my sermon, but I can still hear it. And some of you are going to hear it when you walk out the door today. The voice is this, Paul, Paul, you seem like such a nice man. Why are you single? You are a bit intense. but you're an honorable man I have a niece just outside Damascus and you are going to hear that one way or another singles among us 48% of our population embrace your singleness hold it in honor and I'm going to tell you why because it is holy because it is healthy, because it is seemly. And I'm going to tell you one other thing, singles. It is welcome here. Yeah. Let's stand and be dismissed. The altar ministry will be here for people who need ministry. We're not going to sing a song. I just want to pray. But I really do want to pray and lift up our singles as I close. Jesus, my mind goes back right now to a time in our church's life when we dealt with the role of women in ministry. And as we went through the Word of God and heard your word as it relates to our women and saw that they had been what we thought was even under a curse that said you are insignificant and don't matter. And in that time in our church's life, we stood before our women and said, we're sorry for what we've done and we want to lift that curse off you. And you did a work of healing. I have a same sense of the same thing to some degree among our singles. That the messages of their value or lack of that because they're single is so strong that we need to come in the name of Jesus and break the power of that lie. So Jesus is the pastor of this church, is one of the elders among us, joining my hand and heart and voice with our elders. We speak into the heavenlies and we declare in this place that singles belong, that singles have value, that singles can be whole and can know intimacy, entering into and opening up their selves to the lives of other men and other women, that they can have focus and purpose and wonderful usefulness in the kingdom of God. Release that truth. Bring your healing with it. In Jesus' name, amen. This concludes the message on this cassette.
