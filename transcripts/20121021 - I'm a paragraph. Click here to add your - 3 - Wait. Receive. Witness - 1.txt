My name is Steve Wiens. I'm the associate senior pastor here at Open Door. And before we dive into the talk, I want to pray. But we need to pray for a couple things. One is Dave. Dave has been gone all week. He's been ministering, talking with other pastors, listening to elders, church leaders, helping them solve conflict. And he's been doing a great job. I've been talking to him. He's been texting, emailing. He's exhausted, but also exhilarated because what he's reporting, what he's talking about is he's emailing us, the elders, the staff, and saying it's the weirdest thing. Like, I don't have my yellow pad in front of me. But several times this week, at the right moment, the Spirit has given me a thing to say that's been very helpful. And so God is using Dave to, you know, bring grace all around the world. And so he's in Ohio right now. He's preaching this morning, preaching tonight. So you want to be thinking about him, and let's be praying for him tonight. And as we're watching our football or eating our popcorn or our movies or whatever it is, working, whatever it is we're doing, let's remember Dave. And then the second thing I want to ask you to pray for is as we come to open up God's word, that to remember the practice of cooperating, right? That when we break open God's word, it's not to hear a new insight. It's not to, woo, haven't heard that before. It's to hear from God so that you can cooperate with God in what God wants done in your life and the world. And so praying is just a great reminder. It's a practice of opening your hands, opening your hearts, opening your minds and saying, Lord, speak. And then give me the courage to move. Or stay, you know? So can we do that together? Can we pray together? Let's cooperate with God and what God wants done. God, first of all, we do pray for Dave. Pray that you'd give him your spirit, that you would anoint him to do what he needs to do, what you've called him to do, to be a blessing to the world. and that you would give him what he needs, and that you would put him back together, pour the blood back in, put his body back together for what's been given out. You would restore him. And then for us, God, we cooperate with you. Our desire is to cooperate with you. And what you want done in our lives, and in this community, in this city, and all around the world, we believe you have a heart for what you want done. And we want to partner with you in it. We want to cooperate with you, and it starts right here in our hearts. So open up our hearts, open up our minds, and open up our hands to you. We surrender to your whisper, and we surrender to your power. Amen? All right, well, open up your Bibles. It's 2 Acts chapter 1 verse 4 is where we're going to be. And you can use your iPhones or droids or tablets or whatever it is that you use to read the Bible. You can also look it up on the screens. But before we get to it, I want to tell you a quote. Maybe you weren't here last week. Even if you were, it's good to be reminded. Dave said this thing last week because the acts of the apostles are all about the movement and power of the Holy Spirit. And what Dave said last week was this. Whenever and wherever the Spirit comes with power, in all the different ways that the Spirit does, it's marked by one constant thing. dead and dying things are brought to life. So when we pray, Holy Spirit, come, when we say we're surrendered to your power, what we're seeing out loud, really, as a group of actual people that actually exist in an actual church in Maple Grove, Minnesota, is that we want to partner with God as God desires dead and dying things brought to life. That's what we're praying for. It's crazy, isn't it? So the question is, well, what would an actual community of people need in order to see that happening? Well, this is why we break open the word of God, because we have an example of a community of people that we're obsessed with that, that very thing. God, how can we partner with you in getting what you want done, done? And so open your Bibles again to Acts chapter 1, starting in verse 4. I want to read it to you. gathering them, that is his disciples, together, Jesus commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait. Awesome. We hate that command. We hate it any time it's ever given to us. I don't know one person that when confronted with something that they want to happen, enjoys that command to wait. Nevertheless, Jesus gives it to his disciples. I love it. They hated it, for which the Father has promised, Jesus said, which he said, you heard of from me. I've talked to you about this before. For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. What's that? They would have said. Not many days from now. So when they had come together, when they were asking him, Jesus saying, okay, Lord, you know, we heard the thing to wait. We We appreciate that. Thank you for that suggestion. I'll file that away as something that would be good to do. But here's the deal. I've got a question for you, Jesus, the disciples asked. Is it at this time that you're restoring the kingdom to Israel? They still have their agenda, right? I mean, they're following Jesus. They love it. He was raised from the dead, and they're still following. They're like, all right, this is awesome. We're back on track. Now, when you died, we were a little bummed out because we thought our agenda and what we thought was your agenda had been waylaid a little bit, but now that you're in the flesh again, I see your scars, I can touch your hands, I can touch your feet, I know you really went through it, but now you're back. And so now you can do the job that you were called to do, to restore the kingdom back to Israel. And by the way, we would love to sit on your right and your left as prominent leaders in this kingdom. So is it now? Is it gonna happen now? Which is a question that we love to ask, don't we? well here's the response of Jesus which we hate he said to them well it's not for you to know the times or epics which the father has fixed by his own authority it's not for you to know so don't spend a whole lot of time reading those books that promise that Jesus is coming back on you know May the 17th 2029 because Jesus says what that don't worry about that I got that the father's got that the father sets that by the father's own authority what you need to do is something very very different what I'm encouraging you to do and it's not even an encouragement it's a command what I'm commanding you to do if you're my followers is wait question what is it like for you when you try to force something to happen you ever been there so try to think of something this last week that you forced that you tried to force to happen maybe it was in a conversation and the conversation was going in a way that you know thank you very much but you didn't like and it was leading to an outcome that you didn't want and so can you think of a way in which maybe you when it was your turn to talk or even when it wasn't your turn to talk and you blurted it out anyway, how you tried to maybe manipulate the conversation so that a different outcome could be gotten. Maybe it's in a relationship. I can think of just, I've had more chances to think about this than you have because I've been preparing this message, but I thought about just many different ways that I've tried to force things to happen in conversations and in relationships and in work situations. just so many times where my honest prayer was, let my will be done on earth as it is in my own mind. That's our prayer, really. Most of our prayers are that. And I think God loves to hear those things. So bring what you want. Bring what you're passionate about. Bring it right to God. Because then God can say, man, that is an awesome desire. But my command to you might be wait. or it might be no or it might be yes you're right on track so bring all those things to God but what it's like for me when I try to force something to happen the picture I have is of a spinning top remember this toy that maybe you had when you were a kid it's a little cone shaped thing with a point on the end and you'd spin it as hard as you could on a flat surface and it would look pretty cool and it would move around you didn't quite know where it was going to go and it would last for about maybe 17 seconds if you were really good at spinning. And then it would just kind of crumple over. Lots of activity. Lots of speed and motion. And it didn't go anywhere. That's my picture of trying to force something that I want to happen. Lots of activity. Lots of energy. And, you know, there's even a way in which you can, we've learned to manipulate these things so well that, like, you know, how kind do I need to be to this person so that I can get what I want and make it look like it was their idea? Or what do I have to withhold so that I get what I want eventually? Or what do I have to give so that I can get what I want eventually? my wife several years ago journaled out what it's like for her to wait and she came up with these are some of the words that she came up with and she shared them with me as I was talking to her about this talk to be anxious how many of us carry our anxiety in our shoulders and in our neck so just place your mind at your shoulders or at your neck right now? Any tension there? Any anxiety there? You're like, thank you very much. I wasn't thinking about that at all. I didn't think about that. I wasn't even feeling that at all. Now it's all I can think about is the tension and anxiety that I'm carrying in my shoulders. That's your body telling you you're trying to force things to happen that aren't supposed to happen right now. To wish time away. To be irritated. I'm not familiar with that at all, but some of you are. What's it like to get to the place where you're like, okay, even though I desperately want to change this thing, I can't. That's a frustrating feeling. To be tempted to manipulate the situation or the person, and then to not have the power. Man, that's frustrating, isn't it? So you're in this place of waiting for something that you want to happen, and you're trying to force it, and you have to admit that all these things are happening, and you're spending tons of energy on all these things, and you're exhausted, and you're tired, and you're ticked off, and you're frustrated, because what you want to have happen isn't happening. So into all that, let me ask a different question, and it's the question that I think the people that we read about in the book of Acts were just obsessed with. The question is this, what's it like to join with God and wait for something that God wants done? What's the process of even knowing what that is? What does that look like? To say really and truly, we surrender to your whisper. We surrender to your power. To not just sing it, but wake up in the morning thinking it. Lord, today I'm going to have lots of things that I want done and nothing wrong with that. But at the end of the day, I want to be able to say, God, I really was surrendered to your whisper today. I was listening for you. I had my antenna up for you. And all the normal, mundane, changing diapers, dealing with cranky bosses, dealing with traffic, dealing with construction that is still somehow happening in Maple Grove in late October? What's it like to join with God and wait for something that God wants done? Well, let's pick up the story again in Acts 1 verse 8. Jesus, this is the last thing that he says before he ascends to God. So, you know, pay attention to last things, right? He says this, But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, And you shall be my witnesses, my storytellers, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth. So he says this, I'm gonna do something in the center of you that's gonna radiate out from you. Here in Jerusalem, right here in your normal, actual, everyday life, it's gonna start. But then it's gonna go to Judea in the religious establishment and Samaria, the totally irreligious establishment. That would be like saying, You're going to be my storytellers in the Tea Party and the Taliban. And they would have been like, okay. Can I have a third option? Because I don't like either one of those, they may have said. And even to the remotest parts of the earth. And the process that we read right in the text for joining with what God is doing is three words. Wait, receive, and witness. And that is the story of the people that we read about in the book of Acts. They waited for the power of God to come, not just once, but over and over and over again. And then they received it. And then they just told people about it. That's the whole strategy of the spreading of the church in three words. There it is. And it's still the strategy. it's still the strategy so the story goes like this after jesus had said these things acts 1 verse 9 he was lifted up while they were looking on and a cloud received him out of their sight now some of you have read that time and time again you heard it in sunny school so you're like yeah totally but others of you are pretty new to church and you're pretty new to this whole deal and so you read a sentence like that and you're like what but you got to remember this is the same guy that raised a dead guy to life. This is the same guy that touched people's eyes that have been blind their whole lives, and suddenly they could see. This is the same guy that transformed lives like people like Mary Magdalene, who lived a life far from God, and who now is in the inner circle of Jesus. Jesus himself died and rose again. And so when the disciples saw him ascending into heaven, You know, they were like, well, we haven't seen that before. But, you know, he does do kind of crazy things, so. And then, as they were gazing intently into the sky while he was going, which, again, I just, give me a DVD of that. That is amazing. Behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them. And at that point, Peter's going, okay, I've had enough. I mean, this is crazy. And then they said, men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? to which I guarantee you Peter had an answer for. But we don't read that he shared the answer, so there is hope. Even Peter was growing in his Christ-likeness. He actually didn't say something for once in his life. This Jesus, the men in white, said, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you've watched him go into heaven. The story is not over yet. These two men in white are saying. So they returned, the disciples, to Jerusalem. Why did they do that? Because Jesus told them to. Thanks, Paul. Because Jesus said, hey, remember, it's not for you to know the time or the epoch, but I have told you what to do, and that's go and wait. So they go back to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away. And when they had entered the city, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying. That is Peter and John and James and Andrew and Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. So they're all up there waiting in the upper room. And we're going to read later that there were some women there and Jesus' brothers there and Jesus' mother Mary there. And a question for you. What's it like to wait in a room with people? when you don't know what's going to happen and you don't know what to do and you have varying levels of liking the people that are in that room, it's awkward, is it not? Simon the Zealot. You know what zealots? Zealots like to get things done. How does a zealot wait? I guarantee you, they sent him out for milk a lot of times during that wait. Hey, you know what? I think I just went out for milk. Yeah, well, I think we need more. What's it like to engage with people in real time when you're waiting for something to happen? It's difficult. It's awkward. The word wait, which is all we're going to get to today, by the way, wait, remain, and witness. I tried very hard to fit them all into one talk. I failed miserably. And so we're just going to get to wait. And you're going to have to wait until next week to get to the remain and witness part. But the word wait is a Greek word perimeno. It's two words put together. Peri means around and meno means to wait. It means to stay in a given state, place, or expectancy. To abide. It literally means to remain around. To remain present. To stay where you are. to root yourself down and wait with expectancy for something that you cannot force to happen to happen. Perimenno is used 14 times in the book of Acts. It's all over the place. So what do you experience while waiting in the upper room? Well, remember, you're with other people, So you experience reaching the limits of your ability to be able to stand a certain person. So you send them out for milk. You get frustrated. But I think these particular followers of Jesus, in between playing cards and eating hummus and whatever else they did when they were waiting, they remembered some things. And they remembered another time that Jesus used this word to wait. In John 15, 5, Jesus said, I am the vine, you are the branches. If you remain, that's the same word, perimenno. If you wait around in me, what does it mean to wait around in Jesus? I mean, that's kind of a bizarre thought, right? Wait around in Jesus, not in an anxiety, not in worry, not in what you want to do, but wait around in Jesus and what he wants to do. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit. But apart from me, you can do nothing, Simon the Zealot. Oh yeah, they remembered that. They remembered that Jesus said, I am the source for all that you need. And what you need to do is remain. Think about that spinning top. Stop spinning it. and remain. Another thing that Jesus said that I think they probably remember during this time comes from Matthew 28, 20. When they remembered, he said, surely I am with you always to the very end of the age. You guys, Jesus said he would be with us in every moment and in every way. And maybe when he was ascending up into the sky, they wondered how this particular reality could be true. how is it that he's going to be with us even to the end of the age and then maybe they remembered another thing when he said you guys it is for your benefit in the in luke's gospel it is for your benefit that i leave because if i did not leave you would not receive the comforter the counselor the spirit who will lead you into all truth i have jesus was saying a limited amount of ability to be at one place in one time because I'm a human being, but when I leave, I will send my spirit, and that spirit will reside in every single one of you on a very intimate way. When they were waiting in the upper room, most scholars agree that they would be looking out the window and seeing the majestic temple gleaming in all its glory, and that would be the picture of where God dwelt. And so they were waiting in this upper room for God to leave that building and enter into a different building. Amen? That's what they were waiting for. And the picture that I have, imperfect as it is, for this waiting to receive God's power is what it must be like, I think, for a woman to be carrying a child. Now, I of course do not know what that's like from personal experience, but my wife's been pregnant twice. And these are her, again, more of her journal entries about what it's like to be in this waiting. She wrote, you know, I learned to loosen my grip on what I want done. Some of you are sitting there with your hands clenched in fists right now, and you didn't even know it. You're like, whoa, okay. What is it like to loosen your grip on what you want done? my wife wrote I learned not to force it I learned what it's like to not be in control I start to embrace not knowing I feel what it's like to be changed I feel what it's like to expand to receive what God has for me it's a beautiful picture isn't it I began to know my real place not in a pejorative way you guys but in a real sweet unique individual way What is my place in God's kingdom? I learned to desire and I also learned to lose certain desire. That's what it's like to be in the upper room waiting to join with God in what God wants done in the world. In Acts 1 verse 14, we read this crazy phrase, These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer along with the women and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. They were all in the upper room, these all with one mind. Have you ever been in a group of people where that could be said of you? That we're different and we're diverse and we're unique, but that's not what marks us is our diversity. What marks us is our commonality of what we really want. What would it be like if a community of followers of Jesus in 2012 said, we really will surrender what we want done so that what the God of the universe wants done in this world can be done? What if a community of people was so obsessed with the question, what does God want done in my life? What does God want done in my church? What does God want done in my city and in my community and in my world? That you begin to arrange your life so that maybe, just maybe, you could hear that? We all believe, I think, that God has a will for what God wants done in this world, right? Well, wouldn't it make sense that God would make a way for us to know that? For us to receive the power? If we're going to be about bringing dead and dying things to life, wouldn't it make sense that God would make a way for us to receive power to do that? But wouldn't it also make sense that God would wait for a community of people to desire that? That God would say, well, you know what? I'm okay waiting. But I want people to gather together of one mind who really want to know and do the will of God. see I think when we're in solitude we hear from God I mean we we hear God's whisper we hear God's voice and I know for some of us that sounds like oh this ethereal thing that how could that possibly be but you you know what this most of you know what this feels like to get a little whisper a little nudge and then you maybe ignore it or you maybe do it or you maybe wait and you do it a week later but you know what it's like to receive just a little thought a little whisper a little oh, go write that person a note or linger around here for a little while so you can talk to that person. Or, oh, you know, maybe it's time to say sorry. Or, oh, maybe you said that thing, it was a little too harsh, you gotta go back. I mean, that's the voice of the Spirit talking to you and we all know what that's like. So you have much more experience with this than you think. But then discernment happens in the upper room. Discernment happens in community where we learn what God wants happens with a group of people. And then this, my friend Becky sent me this wonderful quote from Desmond Tutu. He says this, and Desmond Tutu is this really, he's in his 70s or 80s, but he's got this joy that is just amazing. And he says, we're caught up in a delicate network of interconnectedness. I have gifts that you don't, and you have gifts that I don't, and voila, we are made different so that we may know our need for one another. And that's what the body of Christ is all about. That could have been written by Paul. That's what Paul writes when he says that some of you are an elbow and some of you are a finger and some of you are a head and some of you, but we're all connected. We all are of one mind because we're led by Jesus through the Spirit. So question, what would it be like for us as a community of people, Church of the Open Door, to wait all with one mind and join with God in doing what God wants done? If you were at our annual meeting, you heard Kristen Evenson, our board chair, say that what time it is for Open Door right now is, you know, two years ago we got rock solid on our mission to invite people to pursue the struggle of becoming fully alive in God. The point would be fully alive, not just the struggle. The struggle is the means to an end. The struggle is not the end. You got to hear that, right? Like the struggle is not the point. It is a struggle. Becoming fully alive is the end, is the point. But she said, but now it's time for us to wait on God so that God begins to tell us what our vision is, how we need to be in the world, what specifically we're called to change in the world. So we as a community of leaders are getting very serious about gathering in the upper room together and waiting on God to hear from God what God wants done in this church. And the invitation for you is, do you want to be a part of that kind of community? And before you answer too quickly, here's what that kind of community feels like sometimes. It can be very frustrating, can't it? Because it means that you sometimes have to lay down what you want. Ah! I am the guy in our upper room that gets sent out for milk a lot. And I promise you that's true. I am, I like to see things get done. Sometimes to the point where people just need to say, Steve, one time one of the people on my team said, Steve, you are like, it's like we're all in traffic and we all know no one's moving and you're leaning on your horn and hitting the bumper. So I had to say, thank you very much. And sometimes they need that energy, and other times I need to wait. What would it be like to be a community of people that was willing to get past the awkwardness of men and women working together with different gifts and different desires, with all with one mind saying, God, I'm going to lay down what I want done because we want what you want done. And I believe with all my heart, and we believe with all our heart, When a community of people get together and say with one accord, we want what you want done, God, God comes with power and says, okay, now we're ready to move. A community of people that's moving that way together, these are the things that they start to think is the last thing that my wife journaled, but I think it's so appropriate for us. It feels like to be cleansed, to stand still, to keep the door open, to be in expectation, to hope, to be whittled down, and yes, to become quiet. Picture a pond that is totally still and glassy. Some of you are water skiers. You know what I'm talking about. When it's just, you can see your face on it. when a pond becomes still and you drop a rock in the middle what you see is ripples going all the way out to the end and we believe that as we become quiet and still as a community then we can hear God's voice and then God can drop the rock in us and see the ripples go out but we have to become still and quiet first we have to lay down our agenda in order to pick up the agenda that God wants done right here in our hearts, in our church, and in the world. And that's a different kind of a place that requires people who are learning to wait. Evelyn Underhill, this wonderful British writer, wrote this about the spiritual life that is what we're talking about. Our spiritual life is God's affair. It's not my affair. Did you know that? Like, you're not the author of your own spiritual life. that's kind of amazing and kind of beautiful. Our spiritual life is God's affair because whatever we may think to the contrary, it really is produced by God's steady attraction and our humble and self-forgetful response to God's attraction. That's the spiritual life, us responding to God's invitations. And then she concludes this way, it consists in being drawn at God's pace and in God's way to the place where God wants us to be, not the place we fancied for ourselves, to which we cry, mercy. God, let us become that kind of people, amen, that really say our spiritual life is God's and we respond to it and we want to do what God wants done in this world. I told you that the process of joining God and what God wants to do right out of the text of Acts is three words, wait, receive, and witness. So next week, what we're gonna talk about is the process of receiving. And there's one word in the Greek that's receiving that's almost very passive. It's just like someone just throws something to you and you catch it. The word for receive that is written about in Acts is a very different word. It's lambano. It means it has almost a violent connotation to it. It means to take hold of, to grasp, to grab and not let go of. It means to actively put yourself in the position to receive. So here's the question for you to wrestle with this week. What would it look like for you in your life to arrange your life so that you could receive what God wants for you and what God wants done in this world? What would it mean? What would you need to pursue and give up and grab a hold of and not let go so that you could receive God's power, so that God can work in you and through you to bless this wonderful, beautiful world. The hope of our future in this election season is that the kingdom of Jesus would be established on earth as it is in heaven through normal people like you or like me, no matter who gets elected. And so that's what we put our hope in. Waiting, receiving, and witnessing. And witnessing just means telling the great story of what God is doing in our lives. I once was blind, now I see. We once were totally fighting, now we're reconciled. Praise the God in heaven who cares so much more about this world than we ever will. Amen? So come next week. Please stand as we do the benediction. Okay, if you would like to put your hands out like this in a way of saying, okay, Lord, I do surrender to you and receive this benediction. may you go forth from this place knowing that the spiritual life is God's affair and God is inviting you into it. That God is initiating transformation in your life so that you can be the person in your real actual life that brings God's glory to this world. may you go from here telling the beautiful story of how once you were blind but now you see and that's the hope of the world Amen Amen Thank you.
