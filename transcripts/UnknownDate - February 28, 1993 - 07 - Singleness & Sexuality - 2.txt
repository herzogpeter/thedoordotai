I'd like to begin this morning by reading 1 Thessalonians 4.3. For this is the will of God concerning you, your sanctification. That is, that you abstain from sexual immorality, that each of you would know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who don't know God. I'm going to read it again just a little differently. For this is the will of God concerning us, all of us, our sanctification. That is, that we would abstain from sexual immorality and that each of us would know how to possess our own vessels in sanctification and in honor. I care very much that the spirit of that verse hover over and strongly leaven our spirit as we deal this morning with the issue at hand, singleness and sexuality. Two quick notes as we begin. First of all, the material we're going to be dealing with this morning is not for singles only. And that is going to become apparent as we get into it. The second thing is, as I have been indicating for most of these sermons, parental guidance is suggested. Recently, someone came to me and asked how they would be able to discern whether their child should be in this or not. And what I would say to that now is, if your child is old enough to have been lied to and affected by lies, whether they were old enough to hear the lies or not, they might need then to hear some truth, whether they're ready for it or not. Let's pray as we begin. Lord, this issue we're dealing with is one of great importance. It's an area that we believe have come to really sense. The enemy has great strongholds, and even among the people of God. The enemy never does anything among us for our good. It is to destroy and to disease us, to weaken us as people, and to keep us from experiencing the fullness of what you have for us. I pray in Jesus' name that far beyond any word or concept we could hear or understand, There would be the mighty work of God among us to set us free, to bring your healing. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. For those of you who may be new among us, visiting possibly today, we are in the middle of a series stimulated by a word found in Acts chapter 15 in the normal course of our study through Acts, where the Apostle James, addressing the new believers, Gentiles they were, in Antioch, Syria, Relative to several things, the most significant instruction for our purposes was this, abstain from fornication, pornea. He elaborated on that word only with this in verse 29, if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Implied in that is this, if you don't keep yourself free from, or if you can't for whatever reason keep yourself free from such things, You won't do well. In fact, you will feel pain. We have come to call it over these weeks the pain of porneia. And we have also come to see that that pain among us is great. Right now, in the larger context of our study, we have been dealing with what I've come to call three whatabouts. What about, first of all, in the light of the pain of porneia, healthy sexuality? Dealt with that several weeks ago. What about, in the light of the pain of pornea, singleness and sexuality? We began that last week, coming soon. What about homosexuality? As most of you know, we broke this singleness issue into two parts. Last week, we dealt with singleness and being single. This week, we are dealing with singleness and being sexual. Last week, I indicated that we would spend at least one week on this. This week I will indicate we will spend at least one more week on this. Some of the things I said last week I would speak of this week I will not get to. I had a number of people come up to me between the services saying, you know everybody's here because you were going to talk about the M word. Well, you'll have to come to church again next time. I began last week with a question. The question was this. What does it feel like in our culture? What does it feel like in our church to be a single person? What kind of messages do you hear? What kind of pressures do you feel relating to what kind of work it takes for the single adult male and females among us of a variety of ages? What kind of work it takes for them to really be settled about, to really be okay with their singleness. Today I want to ask you a different question. In light of the messages you hear and pressures you feel as it relates to singleness, what kind of messages do you hear and what kind of pressures do you feel as it relates to your sexuality? What does it feel like in our culture, what does it feel like in our church to be a 19 year old adult, male or female who is a virgin? Another question. Is it okay in our culture to be a 19 year old male or female who is a virgin? Is that okay in our church? What about a 29 year old in our culture, in our church who is a virgin? What about a 39 year old? What about a 49 year old? As I give you snapshots of those different people, you certainly get a snapshot in your own mind of a 29-year-old, a 39-year-old. When I start with the 19-year-old, what do you think of? What is your attitude toward a 19-year-old among us, male or female, virgin? Noble? What about a 29-year-old? Still noble? What about a 39-year-old? In our culture, in our church, are we getting kind of odd? Are we wondering yet what's what? wrong with them? What kind of messages do you hear? What kind of pressures do you feel? Let's pick a vibrant, alive, independent age of 25. Male or female, assume this person is a virgin. You be the person for a moment. And let's ask of you, 25-year-old single person virgin, if you're standing around the coffee pot at work, hanging around your friends in the lunchroom, hanging out with the buddies at the ball field, and all of a sudden somehow this whole issue of sexuality comes up and it becomes revealed that you are a virgin, how do you feel about that? Would that information made public in front of these people embarrass you? would it be something that would make you feel proud would there be any energy in you needing to be expended to somehow defend that position even maybe get a little angry to defend that position or that status would you feel anything in you that would want to hide the fact that you're a virgin maybe even lie about it saying you had when you hadn't? Would you feel any need at all to, in some other way, prove to the people you were with that even though you were a virgin, you still were a whole woman, that you still were a complete man? What kind of messages do you hear? What kind of pressures do you feel? the boy became a man that day I heard those words come through the headset of my Walkman one day when I was working out and I began to wonder what is it that has the power to turn the boy into a man well I didn't have to wait for the rest of the song because I've heard this message all my life what it takes to turn a boy into a man. I knew what it took. It takes sex, some sort of conquering experience. That's what turns a boy into a man. According to the song, and this is hard to admit because now I'm going to come out of the closet. Yes, I listen to country music. I'm sorry. Everybody knows. That was hard. I feel better, though. It was the night I fell in love with the Queen of Memphis. That'll do it. I don't know if you're thinking this, but as I'm thinking this, as I'm bringing this song up, I'm thinking, Dave, lighten up. It's just a song. That's a song that has a message that I have heard as a 40-year-old male since I was five years old. What has the power to turn a boy into a man is sex, preferably with someone I'll never see again, I've never seen before, will never have a conversation with, certainly not a relationship. The queen of Memphis would be nice. let me ask a question of the boys among us do you believe that is that part even unconsciously of a core belief that what turns a boy into a man is sex let me ask a question of the men do you believe that Maybe you wouldn't say it out loud. Is that part of what pulses through your veins, that core belief? Is having sex, is doing it what initiates, what generates, what in some sense consummates our manhood? Is that what it is and is that what it takes to affirm our virility? If that is in fact what it takes, men, then we better have a lot of sex. You've seen the movie. Not just one movie, but many movies kind of run together for me. Many over time. Here's the scene. The older, wiser, seasoned John Wayne type, got him in your mind? Takes the young, naive, inexperienced boy under his wing. Stop right there, get a freeze frame. Picture, if you will, for a moment, the wise, older, strong-armed man with his arm on the shoulder of a young boy, 15. I'm looking at that picture before I know what goes on in the rest of this film that I've seen many times, heard over and over again all my life. I'm stopping it right there, though, and I'm thinking, you know what? The strong arm of a man on the shoulder of a woman, on the shoulder of a little boy, a young boy, is a gift to that boy. The strong arm of a man or a woman on the shoulder coming around a young girl is a wonderful gift to that little girl. And what a picture it is when mature men and women can come around young boys and young girls as they are beginning to emerge into some pretty frightening areas of their life and come alongside them. And with a strong arm, love them and lead them and speak to them truth about life. And as a father would to a son or to a daughter, begin to look for those opportune moments when in ways that the kids open up for a moment, you can begin to talk about God and His Son Jesus and the wonder and the power of His grace and the glory of His forgiveness and the power of His Spirit. And we can put our strong arms on our children and talk to them and model for them things like humility, integrity, character, respect, honesty, intimacy, love, for a strong arm to come around a son and to say things like this, Son, here's what it looks like for a man to love a woman. Watch me with your mother, son. Watch how I talk to her. You listen to the respect in my voice. You listen to how I listen to her. You watch how I get under her and lift her and serve. You watch how I serve her, son. And the boy becomes a man. But that's not how it goes in the movie. See, in the movie, the boy is taken as part of his emerging manhood to the handy-dandy whorehouse, where with a smile and a wink of understanding, the almost matronly madam promises, we'll take care of him. and the boy becomes a man. You see, she's not taking him into the room to fornicate. He's going into that room to graduate. He's not going into that room to do something from which he may never recover. What do you mean never recover? I mean, is this the worst thing on earth he can do? No. What I mean by never recover is this. When he walks into that room, he is going to have incredibly powerful messages about how it is you relate to a woman. Incredibly powerful messages about what love looks like, about what sex feels like, about what intimacy is. And you know what? Maybe that young boy who turned into a man that day will one day meet a girl who gives her heart to him and has this expectation that he will be able to open up himself and give his heart to her. But he's had messages so cemented into him as to what it is that intimacy looks like, what sex is for, Lots of work to undo what has been done. He didn't go in there to fornicate. He went in to graduate. The boy became a man. What kind of messages do we hear? What kind of pressures do we feel? That little scenario I just painted for you. What does that communicate? What do those messages cement in our minds about what men want? About what men need? About what they deserve? What kind of messages are communicated and cemented in our minds in scenarios like that about what women want? About what women need? About what they deserve more than that? About what they are for? The boy became a man that day. What did the woman become that day? When I was a boy, my teen years, high school, the sexual rules very clearly were different for the girls than they were for the boys. When I grew up in Chicago, high school years, The 16-year-old boy, the day after his first sexual experience, would walk into the proverbial locker room and brag about his exploits. There would be pats on the back, high fives all around. He would, among the guys, be a hero. He would, among the guys, be called a stud. Rules were different for the girls than for the boys. 16-year-old girl, day after her first sexual experience, walks into the proverbial locker room. No bragging there. Not a word about it there. No pats on the back. No high fives all around. She is not among her friends a hero. In fact, if anybody finds out about this, She won't be called a stud. She'll be called a what? A slut. Rules are different for the boys than for the girls. That was a long time ago. I'd like to know if things have changed. How in the world would I know? I'm 40 years old. I don't have a clue. That's why God's given us children. Keep figuring out what's going on. I talked to my 16-year-old daughter, Andrea, this week. After I talked and got the information I got, I said, Andrea, how would you feel if I shared any of this? And she gave her permission. I would never bring my kids into this without permission. I told her what I thought of what I saw when I was a kid and how the rules were different for boys and girls. And she says, well, in some respects, things have changed, maybe more than in your day, Dad, there's pressure to sleep with guys. In fact, if you don't sleep with a guy, you're weird. Her direct quote was, way weird. But the thing that hasn't changed, Dad, is this. While on one hand, if you sleep with them, you're way weird. If you do sleep with, if you, yes, if you don't sleep with them, there you go. If you don't sleep with them, you're way weird. But if you do sleep with them, Dad, and people find out, you're still a slut. And I looked at my 16-year-old daughter and I said, Drea, it sounds to me like you can't win. You're either way weird or you're a slut. And then she said, the real sad thing, Dad, is that most, not most, many of the friends I have would rather be called a slut than be way weird because over here, you don't have as many friends over here. Dad kids come up to me all the time and say things like this. Drea, promise me you'll sleep with someone before you graduate. Whatever you do, don't go out of high school, a virgin. What a disaster that would be. What kind of messages are they hearing? What kind of pressures are they feeling? Before the conversation was over, I said, Jay, I have one more question. You're like way weird, aren't you? Her response to that was, and I quote, Dad! Dad! Among many things she said, among the most grievous was this. Dad, I know a group of senior guys. They have a list of girls they're sleeping with. In fact, it's a contest among them. They're trying to find out who can win the game. How many girls we can sleep with. We're keeping a list. And when we're done with this one, we go to that one. and I hear Barclay's definition of pornea ringing in my head after I hear that I gave it to you last week pornea is this people being used as things are used discarded as things are discarded but we've been liberated since I was in high school haven't we now we're free and sexual freedom for us now has come to mean the rules are the same for the boys and the girls. When I was a kid, it was only the boys who were using people. Now the girls have learned how, too. Our progress since I was a kid, wouldn't it have been something if the progress we made sexually as a culture would have been from my day when the boy in the locker room high fives and the girl over here was sad about what happened, the progress would have been nice if both the girl and the boy were pretty sad about what happened. Our progress is hearty approval to all who do. Everybody's using everybody else. And I hear the poets of the day pound out the message. Comes through voices like George Michael on MTV. Sex is natural. Sex is good. Not everybody does it, but everybody should. Thanks, George. That's our culture. Surely, in the church, it's different, isn't it? In the church, men, knowing who they are in Christ, don't feel this compulsion to find their identity in their sexual exploitation anymore. So men redeemed are safe. And women, knowing who they are in Christ, wouldn't use their sexual power to manipulate or control anyone, would they? And in the church, nobody's going to have to walk around being guarded and protect themselves and fight anything off, will they? A letter from a single woman in our church, read with permission, says this. I'm a never married 37-year-old woman who has been celibate for the last seven years. Before that time, I had a few short-term, quote, romantic, unquote, relationships. They were short because sex seemed inevitably to become required by the man despite my resistance. And once sex occurred, it signaled the beginning of the end of the relationship. My most recent dating relationship, which incidentally was the only one that has developed in the last seven years, involved a Christian man for the first time in my life. Yet even this was disheartening because although he did not pursue intercourse sex, he persisted physically in everything but. Despite our many conversations and verbal agreements that it was inappropriate in our relationship. My question is this, where are the single men whom a single woman can trust? This kind of behavior required me to take leadership early in the relationship. I was the one who was responsible to be the keeper of the boundaries. You asked in your sermon today what it is like to be single. As a woman who's been single and of dating age for 22 years, let me tell you of one message that I've heard consistently throughout that time. A man's sexual drive is different than a woman's, meaning uncontrollable, harder to take responsibility for. Men say it's not their fault that they don't mean to hurt us when they put their hand up our shirt or down our pants on the third date if we happen to be vulnerable. enough for a hug. After all, the physical need is just so strong. Men do hurt women over and over with these lines. Men undermine our trust and give women the message that romantic must mean sexual and then men and women can't just be friends. I am fortunate. I've never been raped or abused, pregnant, or caught any sexually transmitted disease. I did not grow up in an alcoholic or seriously dysfunctional family, but what I experience in the world of dating is far too typical of both secular and Christian populations. True? Way off? Blip on the screen? More common than we would like to admit. Which? This week I heard a song. Another song. I'm in the songs. Won a Grammy. The whiskey ain't working no more. That was the name of the song. One of the lines went like this. I want a woman who's warm and willing. That's what I'm looking for. Because the whiskey, it ain't working no more. Did you hear the message in that song? The message is this. if you didn't get it. First of all, I want you to know my first choice is whiskey. And I was going to the whiskey to get my life, and I was going there to medicate my pain, and I was going there to get my buzz, but the whiskey ain't working no more, and even though that was my first choice, I'm not out of hope. I still have hope. Now I'll use you to medicate my pain and give me my buzz. And the whole place at the Grammy Awards, when it came, I want a woman warm and willing, the whole place went, yeah, women and men. The category it won a Grammy in was lyrics most demeaning to a woman. But you know what? Those lyrics and messages like that that are everywhere are not only demeaning to women, they are demeaning to men as well. Let me tell you why. Because we don't all believe that. Because we don't all think like that. And even those among us who struggle with some of the messages that we've heard since we were five years old, The truth is, out of a redeemed heart, we don't want to be like that. So what do we do? Where do we start? I'm not exactly sure where to start. To me, as I've gone through this series, the whole thing, every week it's gotten for me bigger and bigger and bigger. So I'm starting here. I'm just going to start here. With this. I believe that at the core of our sexual sin, our sexual pain, and our sexual shame, our core beliefs. And these core beliefs are built on lies. Women believe them. Men believe them. And it is these lies that fuel and drive much of our sexual behavior. And the only way I know how to deal with that is, number one, expose the lie as best I can and tell some truth as best I can. Lie number one today is this. Sex is a biological urge over which you have no control. Many of you have been told that all your life. Many of you believe that. I believe that is a lie. I don't have any control. Therefore, I'm not responsible. It's not my fault. I couldn't help myself. It's just biological. Jeff Van Vanden told me something this week that I don't know much about because I don't deer hunt. Deer hunters among us would know about something called the rut. Very delicate thing to bring up. What the rut is, is this. The does go into heat, and the bucks get stupid. It's biological. Just happens. Jeff told me that one of the joys of hunting is that bucks are really smart. Their sense of smell is acute. They know how to avoid you, and you've really got to be good to get one, but not during the rut. They lose all sense of smell of humans. All they smell is the dough. They don't discern or notice movement anymore, and they are perfectly willing to put their entire existence at risk to follow this one thing biologically that's gotten into them. I mean, they'll walk right up to a hunter smoking a cigarette, the hunters, not the deer. Ah, boy. They won't even notice. It's biological. Now, some people hear me say this and say, well, that proves it. It really is biological. That sounds a lot like some people I know. I have a girlfriend. I have a boyfriend. She's an MBA, a PhD. He's the same. She gets around men. She turns stupid. Every one of her survival instincts, everything about her that speaks of dignity and boundaries is obliterated. It's biological. I know guys like that. They get around a woman. every ounce of sanity that allows them to behave in a respectable manner is obliterated. It's biological. So we're kind of like the deer. But there's a major difference, and you need to know it. We need to embrace it. Here's the difference. We are not animals. That's the difference. and let me be gentle about this when i say it but here's the weight of the words when we act like animals let's not call that the standard well i guess that's just the way i am you see the fact is part of what separates us from the animals is that we as human beings have a choice. And for what we choose, we are responsible. And embracing that is part of what is called the boy becoming a man. Let me say this whole thing a different way. It is true that sex is biological. Never ignore that. Wouldn't want to deny that. or even minimize that. Hormones are at work. And there are different mixes of those things in all of us. Among us, there is variance as it relates to drive and desire. Among men, you will find a continuum, a variance of drive and desire. Among women, you will find exactly the same. They're not all the same. There is a variance among women and men of drive and desire sexually. There is a piece of this that clearly is biological. What is not true, however, what is the big lie about this is the belief that because it is biological, I don't have a choice. Therefore, I'm not responsible. It's not my fault. How many of you heard this one? It's not my fault. In fact, if you didn't look so pretty, it's your fault. God made me like this I have no control I think that's a lie now some of you I know for a fact men and women both among us right now are hearing this and everything I'm saying is landing like a ton of bricks on all your shame. It's just hooking all your shame. And if you could speak right now, what you would say would be this. Dave, the fact is, I don't have any control in this arena. And you're kind of up there yelling and screaming about it. If you say you don't have control, that's a lie. Well, I don't have control. The fact is, Dave, I hate what I do. I desperately want to stop what I do. When I do what I do either with a man or a woman or by myself habitually going to those porno shops or whatever it is. When I do it I get dumped with incredible amounts of despair and shame. I promise never to do it again. I want you to know Dave my heart says inwardly yes to the law of God. When the shame overwhelms me, I'm able to kind of, energized even by the guilt of it, to stay away from it for a day and a week and a month. And then I'm back. And you're yelling and screaming about if you have no control. It's a lie. I have no control. I feel like I've lost my choices. to that I want to respond this way and it's going to sound like double talk to you given what I've already said what I want to say to you is this I believe you I believe that for some of you it is out of control I believe that for some of you you have at least as far as you can see lost your ability to choose what you even want to choose but hear me about this whole thing just consider this that what it is that's making your sexual behavior out of control is not biology it is not raging hormones as hard as they are to handle from time to time what is kicking you over the edge into out of control is not biology something else is going on that kicks it into that uncontrollable insatiable, if you will, arena. Like what? Well, how about core beliefs that are built on lies? Well, like what would be a core belief that would drive me to act out sexually in inappropriate ways? Well, there are many. I'm not going to get into all of them today. I'll give you the one I already gave you today. How about this core belief? That sex has the power to turn a boy into a man. If you've heard that message since you were five, and if you are now 19, 29, 39, whatever, you have mixed into the pot of your already hard to deal with biology a message. What turns a boy into a man is sex. When you throw that lie into your biology, you've got something potentially way out of control. Because no longer am I responding simply to my biological impulses to move toward a woman or a woman toward a man. Now I'm being driven to find my identity. And I will find that even if I have to use you. Now it's out of control. See, all of a sudden this has become how I establish and affirm my value, my virility, my womanhood. And if I am looking to sex to fill some other deep need of mine, suddenly sex kicking out of the realm of biological, suddenly sex will be something I, you, have to have. Because more is at stake than a simple biological herb. and by the way one of the frightening scenarios in all of this is if i really am on an identity quest if this really is about having other deep needs met that really aren't connected with sex but i've chosen sex to meet my need and you as a woman or a man have decided to have some boundaries and this isn't biological anymore. I'm on a quest for my life. I will smash your boundaries. Out of control. It's not biological. Something else is going on. The daughter of Marlena Dietrich recently wrote a book about her mother's life. For those of you who don't know, Marlena Dietrich is what I would call the Madonna of the 30s and 40s. and with all of Marlena Dietrich's sexual exploits with both men and with women she was thought to be insatiable sexually she was the sex goddess if you will of that age took great delight in shocking people when her daughter just a few weeks ago was kind of making the rounds on all these talk shows to promote her book one of the things she said about her mother very interestingly was this in spite of the fact that my mother visually was insatiable both with men and women the fact is my mother hated sex excuse me well then why did she do it over and over and over again with anybody who came around to which Marlena Dietrich, Marlena Dietrich's daughter said, because if she didn't, they would all go away. And Marlena Dietrich didn't want to be alone. And all of a sudden, Marlena Dietrich doesn't sound a whole lot different than you and you and me. See, Marlene Dietrich had some core, legitimate needs to be loved, to be accepted, to be validated, to know she was not alone. But the place she chose to find all of those messages and get all of those needs met was in a place that never was going to meet those needs. She died very much alone. all the things she feared the most she got what drove her insatiable sexuality well it wasn't biological it was not a biological urge i would suspect that marlena dietrich's biological urge for sex was pretty much like yours and like mine. And you know what? It was probably pretty manageable. She probably had the capacity to her biology say when appropriate. No, not now. It's not appropriate now. It's not appropriate yet. But she had other things in the pot. Her identity was at stake, her value, her lovableness, her sense of being special. She was using it to break her isolation, to alter her mood, to medicate her pain, and that's what's uncontrollable. And there's no way in the world I could take the cover off of this kind of reality among us. Both men and women struggle with this, using sex to provide things that it cannot give, thereby looking insatiable, but it's not biological at all. I can't bring that stuff up without somewhere stopping as we wrap this up and bring to it the gospel. How dare we bring this kind of pain up without giving hope and without telling people where to go with this. Hear the word of the Lord, beloved. The first word is a kind of a hard one. Be appalled, Jeremiah 2, verse 12. O heavens, at this, and shudder and be very desolate, declares the Lord. For my people have committed two evils. They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water. There is your source of life. There is the place you can find your identity as a man and as a woman, whole and complete in Christ from God. They have forsaken me as the source of life, and they have begun to cut out for themselves cisterns. But they are broken cisterns, and one of the cisterns that people cut out for themselves is thinking that in sexuality they can from that find some life and have the intimacy needs met by drinking from that. Walter Trobisch said this as it relates to using sex to meet other needs. Trying to use sex, he said, to meet needs of intimacy in your life is like trying to drink salt water to quench your thirst. Number one, it will not quench your thirst. Number two, it will make you... Digging wells provide their own water. Jesus met a woman at the well. John chapter 4. He looked at her and as soon as he saw her, he knew something about her. He knew something about her. I'm presuming by a word of knowledge that he got by the Spirit that this was a woman who had had five relationships with men. She was on her sixth. And what he knew about her was this. This woman really isn't any different than anybody else on the planet. She has core needs, legitimate needs. What she has chosen, however, is to try to find the core needs of her life by going from man to man to man to man. And what she has found in that, proved by the fact that she's on her sixth, is that men don't work. If they did, one would do it. And he looked at her, and rather than condemning her and saying, stop that, he said to her, in a paraphrase, this. If you drink from this water, and he pointed to the physical well, you will thirst again. Speaking in a metaphor, he was saying to her, if you continue to get life from the places you're getting it from now, you will thirst again. but I am here to give you water and whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst again but the water that I shall give him will become a well of water springing up into eternal life. I've got life for you and the power of my grace can get down into your deepest needs and I am the source of life and I am the source of value and I am the one who can reveal to you your identity and value as a woman, as a man. And I hear Matthew 11, the words of Jesus, say this, Come unto me, all you who are very tired of digging your own cistern. Come unto me, all you who are so very weary of trying to affirm your manhood through this. Embrace your womanhood through this. Come unto me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I'll give you rest. I will give you rest. Matthew 5, blessed are the broken. Blessed are those who finally realize, I can't control this. Blessed are those who say, I can't do this by myself. Blessed are those who mourn. Remember what that meant? Didn't mean walk around being sad. Blessed are those who get out here, what's going on in here. Blessed are those who quit denying. Blessed are those who quit pretending. Blessed are those who just quit saying it's just a biological urge. Blessed are those who start dealing with what's really going on. They will get comfort. They will get the kingdom. It could very well break some of our hearts. Because many of us have been users. Using people to fill us up. I said at the beginning, this is not for singles only. In marriages, people have been using each other to fill each other up. But it's okay to have your heart broken. It is okay. You know why? Because of amazing grace. that's why you know what else amazing grace does amazing grace interjected into a word like this can keep us from doing what every one of us want to do if we feel any kind of conviction and you know what you want to do you want to run away you want to run away you want to hide I have landed on some of your shame so hard today that some of you I'm sure if we could hear your heart it would be a scream we'd be hearing a scream don't run away don't deny it anymore blessed are the broken that's the gospel blessed are those who mourn there is for you amazing grace you don't have to hide anymore you don't have to call it something else anymore we reveal things that are ugly. But you know what? It's His kindness that leads us to repentance. Amazing grace. I want you to stand with me. I'm going to close with a song. I want the altar ministry to come, but I just want to pray. Lord Jesus, I don't know how it is that this word has landed on all of us. I know that it affected me powerfully even in the week, just even reflecting on the way these lies have affected and leavened me. I pray in Jesus' name that repentance would flow where that's appropriate. I pray that the enemy would be bound that would cause us to run and hide in our shame and that we would come and receive from you gifts of healing and gifts of grace. In Jesus' name, amen. Thank you.
