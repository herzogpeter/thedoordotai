Let's pray as we enter into our time in the Word. Father, as you have given life to our time of worship by the power of your Spirit, breathe now life into the Word by the power of the same. I pray it in Jesus' precious name. Amen. In the broader context of our study over the last several months on the kingdom of God, rooted in our study of Matthew 6, we have in recent weeks been focusing on what it means for us, specifically as a church, to become the kind of church that is moving beyond belief. Because among the things we've discovered, even in a series on the kingdom of God, is this, that it's one thing to pray, Thy kingdom come, as we have been praying out of Matthew 6, but quite another to move beyond belief, to move beyond what we say we believe and desire into actually doing those things, for it is in the actual doing of the kingdom of God, acting on what we say we believe, that we begin as individuals and as a corporate body of people, church to see and experience in breakings of God's kingdom, manifestations of God's kingdom that are in fact beyond belief. Wherever else that kingdom principle manifests itself as being true, it manifests itself as being true in the arena of our finances. That's why a couple of weeks ago we began to talk about the kingdom of God and our stuff, Or what happens when the kingdom of God comes to our stuff? Because we've been learning to pray that way. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done right here, right now, in every arena of our lives, including this one. But part of what adds some practical energy, even dramatic tension to that question of what do our finances look like when the kingdom comes to them? Part of what adds dramatic tension to that right now is this, that we are asking that question in the context right now of three bold kingdom moves. Three moves that we believe God is calling us to, all of which require, among other things, money. It occurs to me, it's one thing to talk about money and finances and God's principles around that philosophically, kind of talk about them theoretically. it's another thing to talk about that stuff when it's connected to a need, when it's connected directly to an ask, which is what we're involved in right now as we kind of lay out our vision and what we need to do and what we think it's going to cost. And then in that context to be talking about money, it's a whole different thing. It brings kind of an edginess to it that wouldn't be there. If it was just kind of hypothetical, it reminds me of a joke. I'm not going to tell it to you. Unless you're back. No. It's an old, this is a real old joke. This is an old pastor joke. I heard this from John MacArthur, who's not the funniest guy I ever heard. You'd have to know John MacArthur. There's this pastor, and he's meeting with a friend of his who happens to be a farmer. We'll call him Farmer Jones, and he goes to Farmer Jones. They were talking about giving, and he says, Farmer Jones, if you had two farms, would you give one farm to God? And he says, oh, pastor, you know I absolutely would. That's really good. If you had two tractors, Farmer Jones, would you give one to God? And he goes, oh, absolutely not. In a blink of an eye, I would give one of my tractors to God. That's really great, said the pastor. If you had two pigs, would you give one pig to God? He says, well, that's not fair. You know I have two pigs. You know? Isn't that true? I mean, there's one thing when it's hypothetical, it's philosophical, oh, yes, I really would. When it gets down to need and reality, it's a whole different thing. brings a whole different edge to it. I think you're aware of the fact that the three moves that we feel God's calling us to as a church, really important relative to the advancing of the kingdom and where we are right now. First is this, a corporate response to an involvement in the AIDS epidemic in Africa where 8,000 people a day are dying of that disease. And no, we don't think we're going to cure AIDS in Africa. But it is part of the package of what we think God is telling us to do at this time in our life, and so we're going to do it. Steve Hansen, our pastor of missions, is actually in Africa right now meeting with some people we're already in relationship with there who can help us determine, we think, the most effective way to be involved in this issue there, especially as we're just beginning to get our feet wet in. This is a brand new movement for us, a new direction for us to go, and so how we even start that matters a lot. In fact, next week you're going to hear a report from Steve, who will be home by that time, telling us what it is what we're deciding and what specifically we're going to do. The second move involves the establishment of a multi-ethnic outreach base in North Minneapolis embodied in a church called The Sanctuary, pastored by Ephraim Smith, who we met a few weeks ago, who was in this pulpit for two weeks in a row. It will be, as most of you know, a church that is committed to and defined by community and economic development, health care and housing, the feeding of the poor. In other words, it's a church that is committed to becoming a people of the basin and the towel in the inner city, which is precisely who we want to be as well here in Maple Grove, which is at least part of why we have a sense of rightness about this collaboration. Third move may be the least exciting on the surface of it, but it is without a doubt the most important, and it has to do simply with taking care of the home base financially, particularly in this first year of financial adjustment to the realities of moving from renters to owners. And the financial reality of owning is this, a projected $5.5 million budget for the general fund, which represents about a 22% increase over what it costs for us to rent the Robbinsdale Gymnasium for all of those years. And that is why we are these weeks and will continue until we have the week where these cards are collected. We are asking all of you who believe in this ministry, all of you who consider Open Door your home, to take very seriously these pledge cards in the bulletin for all of you to pray, for all of you to participate. Because based on your response, we are going to make decisions relative to what we can and cannot do relative to ministry in this coming year. Now, all of that brings me back to the question. Because for us to adequately address those things, to make those kingdom moves, for us to do those things is going to require some things. Not the least of which is money that I believe will be there in abundance as more and more you and I together, as we, find our finances coming under the rule and reign of God. Thus the question of the day. As we are learning how to pray, thy kingdom come to every arena of our life. What happens when the kingdom comes to my stuff? What happens when my stuff comes under the rule and reign of God? Actually, there are many things, but the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the most obvious. When the rule and reign of God comes to my stuff, I begin to give. It's one of the first things that happens. not necessarily to this church or to the vision I just articulated. Lots of people don't go to this church. There are some people who don't believe in the ministry of this church, don't embrace the vision of this church. I don't think you should give to this church if you don't believe in the ministry of this church or embrace the vision of this church. I have no idea why you would. But unless you're a visitor or someone who is still trying to determine whether this is their church, if you don't believe in the ministry of this church or the direction or the vision, and I have no idea why you're here either. The principle, however, is irrefutable, beloved. It's this, that when the kingdom of God comes to men and women, one of the primary indicators that the kingdom has in fact come to them is that they begin to give. Many examples of that in Scripture. One of the most obvious is found in Luke chapter 19. It's the story of Zacchaeus, who, when he was invited by Jesus into the circle of his friendship. And I love that. We've talked about that a couple of weeks ago, that Jesus' method of evangelism wasn't just preaching doctrine to people. He invited this guy into the circle of his friendship, brought him to the table of his acceptance. Zacchaeus was by that invitation apprehended by the amazing grace of God. He was by that seized by the power of a great affection, to borrow a phrase from Brennan Manning. And out of that grace kingdom encounter, this stingy, stubborn, graspy person began to give away the thing that he had previously clung on to for his very life. He began to release his finances. Verse 8, Luke 19, he says this, half of my possessions I will give to the poor. If I have defrauded any, I will give back four times what I stole. Jesus never told him to do that. Never told him half. Never told him to give anything. The point of the story is this. When the kingdom came to him, the first thing that happened to him was that his relationship with his resources changed. He changed. being transformed miraculously from a grasper and a hoarder to a giver and a releaser, prompting Jesus to declare in Luke 19, 9, a most amazing thing. Today, salvation has come unto this house. But if you note something about that statement in Luke 19, 9, Theologically, it's very important to discern this, to kind of be clear about this. Jesus was not by that when he said salvation has today come to this house. He was not by that saying that the way you come into the kingdom is to give, as if you could buy your way in. What he was, however, saying is this, that when you do come into the kingdom, when you haven't been affected by amazing grace, you do give. Indeed, it's one of the primary indicators that you have been affected by amazing grace, that you have entered into life in the kingdom of God. It's how you can tell. In fact, I would say there are primarily two. The first one comes out of our study in 1 John. There are two primary indicators that someone has stepped into life in the kingdom of God. One is this, you become a lover. The other is you become a giver. It's two of the primary ways you can tell that what you're talking about is authentic. Growing up in church culture, as I did, while this was the norm, what I'm about to tell you, I assume this was the way Jesus did it. I found out later that it's really a rather recent phenomenon, beginning with people like D.L. Moody some 100 years ago. large evangelistic campaigns. I just thought that was always the way you did it. Large evangelistic campaigns where people were encouraged to walk the aisle, to raise their hand, to pray a prayer, to sign a card, to in all of that be making a decision to accept Christ, thereby going to heaven when you die, avoiding hell when you die. So successful were those evangelistic campaigns that even today we get pretty excited about the big event where hundreds of people walk the aisle, I'll raise their hand, pray the prayer, sign the card, make the decision. And actually, we should get excited about that. Because I think the fact is that for many people, that decision, that event where they walked in, I'll raise their hand, pray the prayer, was for many people a catalytic event. Introducing them to authentic faith and a new kind of life in the kingdom of God. But the problem for many around those events has been this. that we sometimes come to believe that that's how you can tell. What do you mean? We sometimes come to believe that the way you can tell someone's come into the kingdom is that they walk the aisle, that they raise their hand, that they pray the prayer, that they sign the card. In fact, we would tell someone maybe even who is doubting their faith that, well, did you sign the card? Well, then you're fine. Don't worry about it. Well, as it turns out, that's not how Jesus could tell. And according to Jesus, it's not that hard to tell. It's not some big weird mystery. It's actually quite clear. So let's just do what Jesus did. Stand back and watch. And in Luke 19, 9, it's as if Jesus stops and says, well, look here, look here. Today, salvation has come to that house. How did he know? How could he tell? Well, he was God, he had x-ray vision, and he could see the guy's heart. no there was something that he did that everybody could see that revealed his heart what Jesus saw him do was give did Zacchaeus raise his hand walk an aisle sign a card we don't know maybe he did maybe he didn't here's the point I'm trying to make is this what we do know is this that even if he did walk an aisle raise his hand sign a card that was not what Jesus saw that convinced him that salvation had come, what convinced Jesus that salvation had come to Zacchaeus was that he saw with his eyes that a lifelong grasper and hoarder had been transformed into a tender-hearted and open-handed giver, and that's how you can tell the kingdom has come. And so we pray, thy kingdom come right here, right now, all of which by the way means among other things this that this issue beloved of how we handle the resources of our life particularly our money is not peripheral but absolutely central to life in the kingdom of God to what we call our holy faith now with this Zacharias or Zacchaeus paradigm I was calling Zacchaeus Judas last night. So if I go into the wrong name, whatever name I use, I'm talking about Zacchaeus. He'll be Moses by the end of the sermon. With a Zacchaeus paradigm in our mind, this guy who gave a half of all he had, I want to interject right into that a word about the tithe or giving of 10% in your income. Two weeks ago I told you that what we teach here at Open Door about the tithe is what we refer to here is the spirit of the tithe, and you're going to hear that teaching in membership and in a variety of places here at Open Door as you kind of enter into who we are and how we think. The spirit of the tithe embodied in Abraham who modeled that spirit this way when he said in Genesis 14, 22, these words, I have lifted up my hands to Lord God most high who I acknowledge right now as being the possessor of heaven and earth. Everything I have belongs to you. And from that perspective of life, from that posture of life, Abraham gave a tenth of all he had. A tenth being a symbol of the whole. And what I told you a couple weeks ago about that was this. That we here at Open Door strongly recommend that to you. As a kind of spiritual discipline around your finances, we're on a consistent basis. Like Abraham, we say, Lord God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth, We need to acknowledge that everything we have belongs to you, and we need to acknowledge that on a consistent, regular basis because we live in a culture, and we are the kind of people who tend to forget that. So to help us remind us that everything belongs to you and to help us align ourselves in a disciplined kind of way around that fact, we will give a tenth of all we have, and we will do it every week, every month, every year, thereby bringing our finances in a very practical and systematic way under the reign and rule of God. Now, I see that as a very effective spiritual discipline that, like all other spiritual disciplines, when entered into, not legalistically, but entered into as a way that can bring formation to my soul and a breaking away from other things that would grasp me, that this particular discipline, like the others, is of tremendous formational value. For as you and I enter into it and do it, there's the key word again, do it, it will begin to change us and free us. And as I said a couple weeks ago, I know of nothing that has more power on earth than the spirit of the tithe to begin to break the grip of mammon on us. But as important, foundational, and helpful as developing that spiritual discipline is, the principle of the tithe is not the end of the story relative to giving in the kingdom of God. Let me say that again. The principle of the tithe, as important as it is, is not the whole picture of what it looks like when the kingdom comes to our finances. And that's at least in part why we don't just, here at Open Door, just teach the tithe and leave it at that. Here's why we don't just leave it at that, Because that's not all there is. That's not the end of the story. That's not the whole picture of what it looks like when our finances come under the rule and reign of God. Where are you getting at, Dave? Well, let's get back to the story of Zacchaeus. When the heart of Zacchaeus was seized by the power of a great affection, when he was overwhelmed by the amazing grace of God, having been invited into the circle of friendship by Jesus, he gave not a tenth, he gave a half. and all God's people go a half you know some of you I don't know what it feels like to sit out there and listen to this but I've sat out there long enough and heard people and this is the place either you just started going you started getting nervous Dave I was just warming up to the tenth and now you're giving me a half you're scaring me or this is the other thing you just shut down you go it's over I'm not hearing another word he says because this is like over the edge for me. Hang with me here for a bit. It's going to get worse. No, no. Here's my point around this. He didn't give a tenth, he gave a half. Seems to me that if giving a tenth was the end of the story, if that was the big picture of what it looks like when the kingdom comes to your finances, that Jesus here had the perfect opportunity to make that clear to Zacchaeus. Hey, Zac, you know, really appreciate your heart. It's just amazing. Just nice gesture, but you're going a little overboard here. You don't have to give a half. Tenth is fine. But he doesn't do that. Neither did he do that when a prostitute, who herself was overwhelmed by amazing grace and whose heart was seized by the power of great affection, came into the presence of Jesus at a place she wasn't welcomed by others. A real fancy dinner was going on. And she poured, she broke the vial of alabaster, this costly perfume, and poured it on Jesus' feet. Some scholars believe that the cost of that would possibly be for a woman like this, the equivalent of her retirement. She just poured it out. In fact, an argument, if you read the rest of that story, An argument ensued after she did that from some pretty indignant people about how wasteful that was. I don't know about you, but I think if I actually saw someone do that, someone whose station in life was what it was, and they just poured out the return, there'd be something in me that I'd want to stop them. I'd go, appreciate your heart. God bless you for doing it. But, you know, a tent is fine. Jesus didn't do that. Didn't correct her, didn't stop her, neither did he do it when the widow gave everything she had. Remember that story? He was sitting there watching people put money into the treasury and even noticing what they put in and having the gall to comment on it. And Jesus said, this woman put in more than all the others because she gave everything she had. Can you imagine watching some widow who barely has money to eat put in everything she had? Wouldn't there be something in you that would say, God bless you, but you don't have to do that. Jesus didn't do that. didn't stop them didn't correct them didn't say a tenth is fine it's not the whole picture let me give you a little bit of history here to kind of round this picture out because it's a much much bigger picture Jesus lived in what I think we could accurately call a tithing culture I think as a faithful follower of Jesus it is very arguable I am quite convinced myself that Jesus himself was a tither. We know for certain that he taught others to tithe. We saw that, we hear him say that specifically in Matthew 23, but a lot of people tithed, and it wasn't necessarily part of a spiritual discipline that was breaking the power of mammon so that they could walk in freedom, and it wasn't an expression of love. A lot of people tithed because it was the keeping of a rule. Who would that be? Well, Jesus talked about these people all the time. In Matthew 23, he specifically speaks of the Pharisees who tithed so scrupulously that they tithed right down to their dill and mint and cumin. Dill and mint and cumin would have been seeds. So of all the things in their life, they would tithe and tithe. But they got down to the, if they had ten seeds, they'd give one to God. But for the Pharisees, if you read how Jesus dialogues with them, it becomes pretty clear that for them, their giving was not an expression of, an outflow of their life with God, their having entered into the kingdom of God, having been seized by the power of a great affection. It wasn't even the exercise of a spiritual discipline that would help them, again, break the grip of mammon and bring right order to their relationship with their finances under God. For them, it was not a love thing. How do you know that? How do you know it wasn't a love thing? Well, the text says, and Jesus himself says, because though they did tithe, they neglected weightier matters of the law, like mercy and justice and faithfulness. So then why did they give? I mean, what other motive would you have? One of the reasons you give is so you can extend mercy and justice and faithfulness. Well, it turns out, if you live in a tithing culture like Jesus did, the Pharisees did, if you tithe, it can look good. Jesus said that's exactly how the Pharisees lived their entire life. They polished the outside of the cup and of the bull, verse 25 of Matthew 23. But inwardly, they're full of robbery and self-indulgence, so it's possible to be a tither and not a kingdom giver. You give your 10% and it still has nothing to do with the kingdom having come to you. Which means that why you give matters at least as much as what you give. Now I'm back to Zacchaeus. Why did he give? well we remember the story because his heart had been seized by the power of great affection because the kingdom of god had come to him and he was overwhelmed by amazing grace and you know what that's what jesus noticed that's what jesus noticed when he declared today salvation has come into this house let me help you connect some dots here here's the deal you see it's not about a tenth it's not even about a half it's about something much bigger the picture, the story is much bigger than a half, than a tenth sometimes people gave everything it wasn't about that it's about becoming a different kind of people it's about becoming kingdom people who having been seized by the power of a great affection like Zacchaeus like a prostitute who poured out a vial of alabama alabaster, like a widow at a treasury who gave everything she had, are becoming the kind of people who are consistently marked by an extravagantly generous spirit. No longer graspers and hoarders, more and more and more, and I say more and more and more to lock you into this issue of transformation, who more and more and more are becoming givers and releasers. And here's the deal. Here's the bottom line. When you see people who have been graspers and hoarders becoming givers and releasers, you can know today salvation has come to that house. You can know the kingdom has come. And so we pray, the kingdom come. By the way, this spirit of extravagant generosity, I love that little phrase, extravagant generosity, finds its roots in the kingdom of God, for it is central to the heart and character of God, finding its ultimate expression in the very Son of God, who though He was rich, 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 says, yet for our sakes He became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich. And that's what's called extravagant generosity, which once again affirms this, That this issue of how we handle the resources of our lives is not peripheral, but absolutely central to the message and the mission of Christ and to life in the kingdom of God. For how we handle our resources has power to reveal, like few things can, who we really are, what we really love, who we really love, and who we really serve. So, first thing that happens when the kingdom comes to our finances is that we begin to give. The second thing is this. God begins to use what we give to fulfill kingdom purposes, and he gives us more to give. Now, this principle is incredibly important because wherever you are in your journey around this issue, and this issue, just like every other issue in your spiritual life, you are, like me, on a journey. And you're progressing, and you're being transformed. You haven't arrived. But wherever you are on your journey, when God calls you to a deeper place, maybe I'm just speaking for me, attached to that deeper place, that freer place, is an element of fear on the front end. There really is. I mean, the fear is simply this. If I give away, what will I have left? Especially when you start moving in on that half thing or that every I have, nothing will left. You need to understand what happens. You know, we talk about the things that happen beyond belief when we begin to do the things of the kingdom. This is where the supernatural stuff really begins to kick in. Because as you begin to move in this, God will give you more to give as he uses what you give. This principle, by the way, just like the first, also finds its roots in the gospel itself, in the life of Christ himself, who according to Philippians chapter 2, emptied himself, humbled himself, emptying himself of all the resources that belonged to him as God, and gave how much? Everything he had. But in this emptying of himself, he was not left empty. For as he emptied himself, humbled himself, became a man, God then filled him up again, highly exalting him, giving to him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow and tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. In other words, when Jesus emptied himself, taking on the form of a slave, God filled him up again. That's the cycle. God filled him up again, giving him the name of a king. Luke 6, 38 says it this way. Here's the kingdom principle. You give and it will be given to you. Press down, shaken together, running over, for by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you in return. You try me now in this, says God in Malachi, and see if when you bring the whole tithe, and by the way, the whole tithe, I don't have time to go into this deeply, is not 10%. The whole tithe in the Old Testament was closer to 30% because there were several tithes. You bring to God what you have been called by him to bring to God, and you just see, if I do not open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing on you until it overflows. You don't need to be afraid to step in this kingdom thing because there's a party waiting for you when you do. But the best news of all in this is this. That when you invest the resources of your life, and that would include your money, but also your time and the giftings God has given you to put them into play in the kingdom of God, here's the best news. When you do that, you cannot lose. you cannot lose my favorite parable illustrating this is found in Matthew chapter 23 it's the parable of the coins most of you are familiar with it we've referenced it in the past in it the landlord or God gives three servants three measures of coin to one he gives five to another he gives two to another he gives one coin with these instructions take these coins and put them into play do not hoard them don't bury them you need to act on this and release those things scary thing to do but release those things with some pretty incredible promises see there was a pretty slick thing that these servants knew about because it was part of the the story and and it was this that the context within which this landlord was asking them to invest their resources was like a very fertile field. It would be as if the coins were seed. He was saying that the field that I'm asking you to throw these coins into or this seed into is an incredibly fertile field. In fact, so fertile is it, Matthew 25 verse 26, it says, that this is the kind of field. I mean, you've never been in a field like this because you're going to be able to reap where you didn't even sow. That's a pretty fertile field. You're going to be able to gather where you didn't even scatter seed. That's how lead pipe cinched this one is. In other words, you can't possibly lose when you invest the resources of your life in this kind of field. Think about it. If in this field you can reap where you didn't sow, imagine what would happen if you sow. If in this field you can gather where you scattered no seed, just think what could happen if you begin to scatter some seeds. I mean, this is a field where even a cup of cold water, given in Jesus' name, which costs you pretty much nothing to do can reap an eternal yield. So the servant with five coins puts them into play, invests them in the field, gives them away. The servant's given two coins does the same and both of them double what they gave. That's Luke chapter 6, 38. Given it'll be given to you, pressed down, shaken together, running over, not so you can get rich. This is not a get rich formula. Given more, as you give, God will give you more to give. God will give you more to give. In fact, as you are trusted with that which is little, he will trust you with more to use the resources God's given you to put them into play. But the third servant, given the one coin, for whatever reason, but I think we can discern what the reasons were because he was afraid, because he did not believe, buries the coin, doesn't put it into play. the reaction of the landowner seems extreme. First of all, he takes the coin away. So what was given to you? And by the way, another little picture that's interesting. The coins that they were investing weren't theirs in. God, the landowner gave them to him. And so God, the landowner, takes the coin back from the... You lose it all. And then he says, this is a scary phrase. Casts him into outer darkness and says, you worthless slave. It's not very graceful. He calls him a worthless slave. What's that about? Cast him in outer darkness. What does that mean? Does that mean if you bury your coin, you go to hell? it sounds kind of hellish. You know, I don't know. I don't know about it. But here's what I do know as I look at this parable and connect the dots as best I can. I think for sure what it means is this, that the guy who buried his coin didn't get it. He didn't get it. I think the other thing that's absolutely, he didn't get how it works. He didn't believe the master. The other thing that's very clear, whether this is about hell or not, is this, that the guy who buried his coin was not part of what the master was doing in that field. Hopefully you can connect the dots there. The grasper doesn't get it. I don't even have time to talk you out of it. You just don't get it. And the other thing is, grasping, absolutely not part of what God's doing in the world. Not part of what God's doing in the world. I think the point of the parable from a positive perspective is this, that if you are a person who is putting into play the resources of your life, not only will you, from what you are giving, enjoy an eternal yield, yield that you will see in this life and yield that you will see in the next as well, but an even more basic level, this posture of giving away what God has given you, reveals that you not only understand, but it reveals that you have in fact entered in to life in the kingdom of God for having received the life and love and grace and mercy and gifts of God, you now instinctively give the same. Indeed, it's one of the primary indicators that salvation has come unto this house, that you become a lover and that you become a giver. And all of that is why I believe, we believe, that this issue of how we spend the resources of our lives is not peripheral, but absolutely central to the gospel that we preach, to the message and ministry of Christ, and to life in the kingdom of God. And it's part of why we pray, Thy kingdom come, Thy kingdom come to this arena of our life as well. And Lord, help us move beyond belief. Because it's one thing to pray, thy kingdom come. And quite another to move beyond belief. To move beyond what we say we believe and desire into actually doing those things. For it is in the actual doing of the kingdom of God, acting on what we say we believe, that we begin as individuals and as a church, that we will begin to see and experience manifestations of God's kingdom that really are beyond belief. Now, next time we are going to move on in our talks of the kingdom of God and talk about when the kingdom comes to my mind and how I think. When how I think comes under the rule and reign of God and so we will pray in that arena as well. Thy kingdom come. Let's pray now as we close. And so we pray, thy kingdom come. To this arena as well. And Father, I pray that as a church, as we have been on journey around this issue and many other issues of kingdom life in our individual lives and in our corporate life, that Father, this time in history, connected to this call from your spirit to be involved at deeper levels of kingdom work around the world, that we would be a people who really are, not in word but in deed, moving beyond belief. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. The altar team is here for anyone.
