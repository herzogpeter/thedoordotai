born of Moses' request in Exodus 33, to know the ways of God and to see the glory of God, we, several months ago, came up with a question that has been kind of driving our series. The question was this, what are the ways of God that reveal the glory of God to and through the people of God so that we can experience the manifested presence of God? Well, over the weeks, I identified 10 of those ways of God. The 11th and final one today is this, that one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God is when the people of God move authentically in the power of God. The word authentic is important because I'm not talking about trickery. I'm not talking about showmanship, manipulation, or pretend. I'm not talking about chaos and confusion and calling that God. I'm not talking about declaring people healed who haven't been healed and maybe never even sick. I'm not talking about physically knocking people down and declaring them to be slain in the Spirit. Slain in the Spirit is a legitimate thing when it really is something the Spirit does. But I'm not talking about the manipulative stuff. I want to talk about instead the authentic power of God that can in fact and does in fact come upon and manifest through ordinary people, empowering them to say and do extraordinary things. Now, there are many places in Scripture where we could go to set a foundation for our thinking. I have chosen the book of Acts, the first chapter, beginning in the fourth verse. Open your Bibles to that text with me, Acts chapter 1, beginning in the fourth verse. As you're looking for that, let me set the scene. The resurrected Christ has presented Himself alive for a period of 40 days to many people with many convincing signs and speaking of things to come concerning the kingdom of God. It says in verse 4 this, and gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, which He said, you heard from me, for John baptized you with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. Just so you know what I just said to you, verse 4, Jesus said, wait for what the Father promised, the promise of the Father. Verse 5 reveals what the promise of the Father is. It's this, that you will be baptized with the Spirit. For some of you, that is a very foreign concept, a word that you've never heard. Let's just kind of stick with what it technically means, the word baptized, get the picture, simply means to immerse or to be immersed in something, to be placed into something, or in some sense to be overwhelmed by something. In this case, Acts chapter 1, that which we are being immersed in when it comes to the baptism of the Spirit is the Spirit. You're being baptized into that, immersed into that. Now, this is probably not theologically correct, but the picture I couldn't get out of my mind all week was it's like taking an ST plunge. to be baptized, you're taking a nest tea plunge, clablui, and you're in this, it's all around you. You float to the bottom of the pool, and if I float to the bottom of the pool of the nest tea plunge, whatever, it could be dangerous, but when you're kind of immersed in the Spirit, it's a pretty safe place to be. Verse 8, chapter 1, then reveals what this overwhelming of the Spirit, this immersion into the Spirit, will accomplish. It says this, and when this happens, you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. and it even gets specific as to what the power will be for. And you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the remotest parts of the earth. Just so you know what we're talking about, the baptism of the Spirit that is spoken of in Acts chapter 1 has to do with an empowerment from God specifically to give witness to the truth about Christ and his gospel that goes far beyond any human capacity or talent you might have. Put this in perspective, I think it helps to understand that this whole thing began back in Matthew chapter 28, when the resurrected Christ stood before a not very impressive ragtag group of about 500 believers, a lot like you and a lot like me. And to them, he gave the most extraordinary charge. a charge that I believe had to feel like an overwhelming responsibility. He said this, go and make disciples of all nations. Again, some of you have heard that so many times, it has no impact anymore. Of all nations. These guys had no cars. They had no internet. Of all nations. I want you to do this. Baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Teaching them to observe all that I commanded you. Now, in my opinion, the only way to not be overwhelmed by that charge would be to believe on one hand that he was kidding, or on the other, to be incredibly arrogant. Hear the command to go into the world and reach lost people with the gospel thinking, yeah, I could handle that. You picked the right guy. Well, here's the deal. You can't handle that, not on your best day, and he wasn't kidding. And that is why in Acts chapter 1 verse 4, he gathered them together. And he told them that they didn't have to do it on their own, that the promise of the Father was a baptism of the Spirit. And the baptism of the Spirit was a receiving of power that went far beyond their capacity to minister in this particular case, to baptize. Come back to the raw definition. Literally means to be immersed in, to be placed into, to be overwhelmed by something. Broaden your thinking. Sometimes this baptism of the Spirit in Scripture is referred to as a filling. In Acts 2, verse 4, when the baptism of the Spirit that is spoken of in Acts 1, when it actually happens, it says that they were filled with the Holy Spirit. It doesn't say they were baptized. Well, they were baptized, but the word they use in Acts 2 to describe it is this, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. What I found interesting about that is this, that filling kind of brings with it a slightly different imagery. Baptism, again, I think of the nesty plunge. Baptism is me being placed into something. In this case, it's to be placed in the Spirit. The Spirit's kind of surrounding me. Filling brings me a different place. It speaks of something being placed into me, literally, not just placed into me, but literally filling me. And I kind of, you know, with my little analytical mind, I'm going, well, which is true? Can't both be true. Which is true? Both are true. Other times, this same baptism is referred to as a clothing, a clothing. Luke chapter 24, verse 49. Jesus is here speaking to his disciples. He is in the resurrected place, and he is also, he has just given to them the commission that was overwhelming. But then he says to them this, when the promise of my Father comes upon you, there's that phrase again, the promise of my Father. The promise of my Father is the baptism of the Spirit. You will be by it clothed with power. And I picture literally putting on a coat, putting on a coat, putting on a jacket. And that's kind of odd, but that's the imagery. You're putting and a robe. It would speak maybe to authority and some sort of power. Now, these three different images of the baptism of the Spirit are not designed to confuse you, though they might. That's not what their design is. I believe their design is to complete your understanding of and appreciation for what this baptism of the Spirit is. The baptism of the Spirit, just kind of pull it all together. It's an immersion into, it's a filling of, it's a clothing for power. So however it is you see it, however it is you say it, and there is quite a bit of controversy and debate around what the baptism of the Spirit is, however it is you say it or see it, the purpose of the baptism of the Spirit in the lives of men and women of faith is that we'd be immersed in the Spirit of God in such a way that we would receive power for something. Now, to that, you know, kind of introductory understanding of the baptism of the Spirit, I want you to add this. And this might confuse you further. There are different kinds of baptism when it comes even to the baptism of the Spirit. All of them are overwhelmings of the Spirit or immersions into the Spirit or fillings of the Spirit for power. But the variation of these baptisms bring with them power to do different things. Some of you are going, what is he talking about? Hang with me. For instance, there is a baptism of the Spirit involved in your salvation. Some of you maybe knew that. Some of you didn't know that. Galatians 3.26 says this, For you are all sons and daughters of God through faith in Christ, For all of you have been baptized, same word, have been baptized or immersed into Christ. And by virtue of that baptism into Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor female nor female, all are one in Christ. When you got saved, you were baptized. You had a baptism of the Spirit into Christ. Romans 6.3 says the same thing a different way. Or did you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ, He's speaking there of people who have become redeemed, and their redemption is described here as being baptized into Christ, immersed into Christ, have been baptized into His death and resurrection. We've been redeemed. 1 Corinthians 12, 13. Giving you a lot of scripture here. Hang with me. I hope it will pay off. For by one Spirit, we were all baptized or immersed or placed into one body. We were all made to drink of one Spirit at salvation. There was a baptism of the Spirit for salvation. John 1.12 kind of clinches my understanding of this when it says this, but as many as received Him or as many as believed on Him, to them He gave the power to become a child of God. How does that solidify it for you, Dave? Here, listen to this. The purpose of the Spirit's baptism is always for power. Sometimes it is the power to become a child of God. It's the power for salvation. And if you've received him as your Savior, God gives you the power, a necessary power to become what you cannot become by yourself, child of God. And for that you need a baptism into Christ. So there's a baptism of the Spirit for salvation. There's also a baptism of the Spirit for sanctification or holy living. Let me say it this way. I'm going to pull it all together for you. One of the fundamental tenets of the Christian faith is this, that I cannot, by my own effort alone, save myself. I need a power beyond that. There are things that I'm involved in doing. My faith energizes my salvation, but I cannot save myself. That is the power of God to make a child of God. I also can't sanctify myself, and I can't serve with kingdom authority by myself. For every single dimension of kingdom life, and this has been a constant theme, message, from this pulpit for years, for every dimension of kingdom life, I need something beyond myself. I need power from God to become a child of God. I need power to live an authentically holy life beyond my ability to do, to white knuckle or even try really hard. If I'm going to be authentically transformed into the very image of his son, there does need to be things, there do need to be things that I am actively doing. But I'm telling you what, for authentic transformation, I need power that goes way beyond me. And I need power not only to be a kingdom person, but I need power, and so do you, to do kingdom work. Every single one of those dimensions of Christian life require baptisms, if you will, immersions, if you will, clothings with power, fillings from the Holy Spirit of God to be and do what I cannot be and cannot do by myself. I said something there that some of you might have caught and been puzzled by. I said baptisms, fillings, clothings, plural, of the Spirit. One of the things that worries me a little bit about this word is that some of the things I'm going to say require maybe a little bit of a background, and I may be going into an area where I'm going to lose some of you because I'm going to go into something that's going to presuppose some understanding of this. I'm going to go into it nonetheless. People come and ask, maybe you often, me, from time to time, this question. Have you received the baptism of the Holy Spirit? The emphasis there, when I hear it, is it's the baptism, as there's one baptism, and you get it. By it, what they generally mean, if I were to kind of parrot back or reflect back what it is I hear when people ask this, this is what I hear. Have you ever had an overwhelming experience, tracking with you so far, with the Holy Spirit of God, subsequent to salvation, this is how they read this always, it's subsequent that released you to new freedoms and greater power, evidenced by the gift of tongues. Let me just say that again. Have you ever had an overwhelming experience with the Holy Spirit of God, subsequent to salvation, that released you to new freedoms and greater power, evidenced by the gift of tongues? That's a mouthful. And I just opened a whole new can of worms with that little phrase. Let me take my best shot at untangling that phrase or that question. The baptism of the Spirit is about being released to new freedoms and greater power. But I believe that it is not just the baptism. I believe there are more than one baptisms, and in the course of your faith journey. And in the course of my faith journey, I believe you will, and I know that I have already experienced baptisms, immersions, clothings with power. Each one of them released me, as I reflect back on my life, each one of them released me to new freedoms and greater power. Just tell a little bit of my story. And it's not that my theology is being drawn from this, because that'd be a dangerous thing to draw your theology just from your experience. But as I understand theology and try to deal with the text, I kind of bounce it up against the things that I've experienced in my walk with God, in my journey of faith. When I was eight years old, I bent my knee to Jesus as my sovereign king. And as much as an eight-year-old knows what he's doing, I knew what I was doing. I asked Jesus into my heart. That day, I believe I was baptized by the Spirit into the body of Christ. I got a baptism for salvation. When I was 17 years old, there came a surrender of my will to God that I had never known before. And I was, quite frank, I mean, I wouldn't, when I was 17, I didn't know this kind of immersion or baptism language. We didn't run no circles, and you know, this sounds very charismatic. And so we were, whoa, no way. So I didn't use this thing, but when I reflect on it, I know for a fact. I was immersed. I took the nasty plunge. And with it came new freedoms and greater power. Now, as people are trying to do their theology and fit their theology into some nice little box, some would say, who think the only time you ever get the Spirit is, the only time you're baptized in the Spirit is when you get saved. They would maybe say, well, you know what? When you were eight, you probably weren't saved at all. You probably weren't saved until you were 17. That's when you were really saved because the baptism of the Spirit happens when you're saved, and that's just what it is. And if you got any kind of real life or new power and new awakening, that was because you probably weren't saved before that. Okay, maybe. I don't know. But here's the problem with that. When I was 23, I had a similar kind of surrender in my spirit, this time in connection to ministry. Believe it or not, I didn't go into ministry going, hey, hey. there was an overwhelming by the Spirit of God thing that happened in my heart, convincing me that He maybe just could give me power to do what I didn't think I had power to do, and that was preach. There was a significant turning point in my life, and it was marked by new freedoms and greater power. Now I'm in the ministry. Now I'm in the ministry. And by the way, somebody's going to look at my life and go, well, you got saved when you were. You didn't get saved at all when you were eight, because I got to fit this into my box. That was baloney. You didn't mean you're a liar. When you were 17, you got saved. When you were 23, you got baptized by the Holy Spirit. Problem with that. 14 years into ministry, I went to a John Wimber conference. Guess what happened to me there? I got totally weird. Whatever happened to me at that Wimber conference, here's what I know. Here's what I know. I got a clothing with power from on high. I got an immersion of the Holy Spirit. And it brought new freedoms and greater power that I had not known before. But guess what? I've had significant immersions in the Spirit of God since then that were attended by deep surrender and sometimes humiliating brokenness. Quite frankly, as I stand before you right now on this day, this Saturday evening, and as I face the responsibilities and opportunities of coming back in the fall, and as church calendars and programs begin to gear up and anticipate even whatever the new millennium stuff is going to bring, guess what I have a tremendous sense of need for? A clothing with power from on high. Another one. an immersion into the Holy Spirit of God, an overwhelming by the Holy Spirit of God, empowering me, empowering us to be who God called us to be and to do what God called us to do. The point I'm trying to make is this. You can't just stick this baptism of the Spirit thing, I don't think, into a nice, neat theological box where one size fits all. It is not, I believe, the baptism of the Holy Spirit. It's the baptisms and the immersions of the Holy Spirit, and we ever need them. You know, if I were to do a poll of our staff, I think our staff are filled with the Spirit, men and women. And I have, by the way. Can I ask some of them this week? If I were to ask our staff as we look at the fall, because fall is when we kick it up a notch, big time. Are any of you feeling overwhelmed? Are any of you feeling, quite frankly, a little bit scared about the responsibilities you're going to have? I think most of them would say, you bet I do. Sometimes I just want to go hide in a corner. It feels so big, I don't think I'm up to it. Do you ever have a sense that you need a clothing with power, just a fresh immersion by the Spirit for power? It's good to know that the promise of the Father is that it's available. And when it comes, you experience new freedoms and greater power. Sometimes these baptisms of the Spirit are accompanied with the gift of tongues. If you remember, I made the statement about have you received the baptism as evidenced by the gift of tongues. And people who ask that question, the tongues thing is really prominent in there. Well, I'm here to say sometimes a baptism of the Spirit, taking an ST plunge into the Spirit, along with that comes a gift of tongues, the prayer language. I'm not going to teach on that tonight, but we're comfortable with that around here. God has given to me that prayer language and I enjoy it. But sometimes it's not attended, the gift of tongues. Let me tell you the reason. Teaching here, because the sign of the baptism or the indicator that you have received the baptism. Hear me now, this might sound like heresy to some of you. It's not. It is not the gift of tongues. The sign, the indicator that you have received the Spirit's baptism is power. To do what? To become a child of God. To live as if that's true. And to serve and minister the truth of God with authority and power. Let me illustrate this tongues thing by bringing you back to Acts chapter 1 and 2. Clearly, the baptism of the Spirit in Acts 1 and 2 is not a baptism for salvation or a baptism for sanctification. Clearly, in Acts chapter 1 and 2, it's a baptism for power. Verse 8, when the Spirit comes on you, you will receive power to witness. chapter 2 beginning in verse 1 what was promised happens and this is the account of it the day of Pentecost had come they were all gathered together in one place suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind and it filled the whole house where they were sitting and there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves and they rested on each one of them and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues again not time to teach this completely here, but the tongues that are being used here is not the prayer language. This is tongues of a discernible language that people could understand. And what they were speaking in different languages is revealed in verse 11. They were speaking of the mighty deeds of God. They were giving witness, if you will. Now, the result of this baptism of the Spirit on these pretty ordinary people is revealed in chapter 2, verse 41, where it says this, that 3,000 people were saved. It's very important to get this. While some amazing things attended the baptism of the Holy Spirit in Acts chapter 2, wind, tongues, and fire, and ability to speak a different language that you didn't know, the mark of the baptism or the indicator that it had indeed come was not necessarily wind, fire, and tongues, though those things happened. The mark of the baptism, The indicator that it has come is in fact an empowerment by God through His Spirit to minister the truth about God beyond any human capacity, resulting in harvest, fruit, effects. In this case, 3,000 were saved. If 3,000 aren't saved and 3,000 aren't always saved, in any case, there's power. Sometimes there's wind, fire, and tongues. don't ever eliminate that possibility that that is real but sometimes not Acts chapter 4 verse 31 no wind no fire no tongues but as they prayed a group of people had gathered together they were afraid Peter was in prison what do we do our leader is gone it says this as they prayed the people were filled with the Holy Spirit same thing as being baptized immersed and they began because of this filling to speak the word of God the word about Christ with boldness, a boldness that they didn't have before. Guess what they got? They got clothed with power from on high to do something that 10 minutes previous, they were scared to death to do. Acts 4.8, no wind, no fire, no tongues, no shaking of the building, but Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, spoke with boldness and people listened. Acts chapter 6 speaks of Stephen, describing him this way, a man full of the Holy Spirit, meaning he was immersed in, he had been overwhelmed by, he took the nasty plunge, if you will, but there were no tongues, no fire, no wind, but his words were irresistible. What does that mean? I'll tell you what it means. That is the indicator that he was immersed, overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit. The sign of that baptism is power to minister the truth about Christ irresistibly. The result for Stephen wasn't 3,000 saved. The result for Stephen moving in that power was that they picked up stones and killed him. But he had power to serve even unto death. People talk about the baptism of the Spirit for Pentecostal power. What is Pentecostal power? And how do you know it's come? Some people, I've already made this clear, I think, I believe, short-sightedly limit it by saying the way you know Pentecostal power has come is that people speak in tongues. I believe that the evidence of Pentecostal power may from time to time include tongues, but to make that the focus misses the point entirely, the indicator that Pentecostal power, Acts chapter 2 power has come, is this, when ordinary men and women like you and me, overwhelmed by and immersed into the Holy Spirit of God are by that immersion, by that overwhelming, empowered to do extraordinary things like live and love and serve and give witness to the very life of God. That's what the baptism looks like. That's how you can tell it's come. So I close with a question. The question is this. as you consider sitting in this chair on this Saturday night, the responsibilities and opportunities that your life today holds, and maybe you're like many of us. As a church, we're gearing up. Well, you're coming back from your vacations, and your kids are getting back into school, and all the gears are starting to move. Vacation's over, folks. You consider those responsibilities, and keep in mind the realities of your human frailty to handle any of those responsibilities. my question is is there anybody here who's beginning to feel a profound awareness of your need for a clothing with power from on high for a baptism for an immersion into the Holy Spirit of God that would empower you an ordinary man, an ordinary woman, boy or girl to live in an extraordinary way maybe the baptism you need this evening is an empowerment from the Spirit to become a son of God or a daughter of God for the very first time. The word to you is this, but as many as receive Him, believe in Him, to them He gives the power to become a child of God. And you can right now, before you leave, be baptized by the Spirit into the body of Christ, becoming a brand new creature. Someone else is here, and I don't know your name and I don't know your deal, but somebody is here struggling, with sin, besetting sin, can't get rid of this thing. It could be the power of some addiction that holds you firmly in its grip, maybe something nobody knows about. And all your resources to fight it have been spent. And I mean literally resources, financial resources. You've done the counseling thing. We're not against God. We encourage people to do that, but you've done that. You've spent your emotional resources, your physical resources. and you're even wondering if you should let this in. You're even wondering if you should dare to hope that there is a power that could come upon you and clothe you with power to break. Do we dare believe that there can be a clothing with power from on high to set you free not only from sin in general, it's condemnation so you go to heaven, but from its literal grip on our lives. Some of you are going through things in your marriage, in your career, some difficulty with your kids. It just makes you wonder if I can take one more step. I need a clothing with power. I don't have any more resources left. Others among us tonight already redeemed, not struggling with any besetting sin, and you would not despise anyone who is, but it's just not your issue tonight. but the responsibilities of your life and ministry just feel so heavy, overwhelming. You're so tired, maybe even scared. I don't know if I can do it. I don't know what category you're in, but hear the promise of the Father. It is this, a clothing with power from on high, maybe for salvation, Maybe for sanctification and the breaking of some addictive power. Maybe for service. Maybe it's simply to face the rigors of tomorrow morning. The promise of the Father is a fresh immersion into the Spirit of God for power. So take the nesty plunge. All of that to say this. That one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God is when the people of God, recognizing their begging dependence on God for any aspect of kingdom life, tap into and are overwhelmed by the authentic power of God, thus manifesting the presence of God among His people. So Holy Spirit, come. Holy Spirit, come. Would you stand as we're dismissed? I didn't have anything planned as far as closing. The altar team will be here. In fact, I would ask the altar team to come now and be ready to receive people who need prayer. I believe that God has some gifts for some among us, the clothing with power. I just believe that this has connected for many people. This is what you need. And you can get it where you are. You can come for prayer and people would be delighted to be the mediator of this gift. But I'm also hoping that some of you would just get hungry for this. Just get hungry for this and wonder a little bit more about what is this thing he's talking about. I need something beyond me. Let me just pray. Do you know what I'm going to do? Just thought of this now. Those of you, nobody's looking around. Who cares if they are? Who feel a need for this? Just hold out your hands like you're receiving a gift from your father, as a child from your father. Father, you know the hearts of every man and woman in this place, boy and girl. You know their life situation, whether they're redeemed, whether they're struggling with some life situation of besetting sin, something they think there's no hope to have power over. It could be simply the rigors of life. You know their heart. I pray you keep your promise the promise of the Father spoken to us from your Son was that you would provide a clothing with power to be redeemed to be sanctified, truly sanctified and to be empowered to serve and face life for those who need it for the first time Holy Spirit come for those who need a fresh baptism a new immersion, Holy Spirit, come. Bring your gifts. Bring your freedoms and greater powers to set your people free. Pray all these things in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen.
