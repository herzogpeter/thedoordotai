Acts chapter 2, picking our study up in the 42nd verse through the 47th this morning. I want you to open your Bibles to that passage. As you do that and as we return to our study, I want to remind you that as we come to this, Peter, on the heels of the amazing Pentecost event, has been preaching Jesus. In fact, he has been using Jesus as the explanation for the amazing events of Pentecost. Verse 33, it is he, Jesus, who has poured forth all of these things which you have both seen and heard. The final word of Peter concerning Jesus to these people was in verse 36 when he said, Therefore, let all of the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ. He has made him the king, this Jesus whom you crucified. The result of that word to these people in verse 37 was that they were pierced to the heart. Somewhere along the line by a supernatural anointing of the Spirit of God upon the mouth of Peter, a mere man, those words that came from his mouth were translated into the words and into the word of God. And the word of God, not the word of a man, but the word of God is living. And it is active and it is sharper than any two-edged sword. And it pierces, even to the dividing asunder of bone and marrow. And it happened indeed to these people. They were arrested by the word of Jesus. They were brought up, intercepted, pierced. And the result of that was they were left with a question, again in verse 37, What shall we do in light of the word we have just heard and the piercing of our heart? Peter's answer, verse 38, repent. And two weeks ago we talked about what it means to repent. It simply means to change your mind. You need to change your mind. Specifically, what the people in this text needed to change their mind about was Jesus. You need to change your mind about who Jesus is. Jesus the Nazarene. The people to whom Peter originally spoke these words knew Jesus the Nazarene. They had known of his ministry. He had been with them for three years. They had seen him. They had heard his words. They had seen his work and all of his miracles. They had understood something of his claims of being Messiah. And even in light of his words and his work, though compelling they were at times, they found ways to ignore him. He was, after all, just the Nazarene. And more than ignoring him, sometimes they reviled him, they rejected him, and ultimately they killed him. And the essence of Peter's sermon to these people 50 days after that crucifixion was this. Folks, those of you who even see yourselves as knowing who God is, you need to understand that God, who you claim to know, had an altogether different opinion of this Nazarene that you have rejected. And you need to change your mind about the king, because God made him both Lord and Christ. You need to change your mind. But so do many of us as it relates to who Jesus is. Theologically, I don't think so. Most of us, I believe in this room, theologically, would probably strongly affirm, indeed fight for the reality of Jesus being the king. We would get very upset if anyone would dare to doubt his deity. So it is not a theological recognition of Jesus as the king that many of us have to do, but rather, in very practical terms, we need to be confronted with the fact that if Jesus is indeed Lord and Christ, if he is the king, then he has got a right to rule here. And many of us need to change our minds about who the king of our lives is. Who decides for you? Who decides for me? In matters of morality and purity and the priorities of my life, who decides? Who is your king? Who is your source of life? On this day, in this particular text, 3,000 people changed their mind about who the Nazarene was, about who their king would be, and they agreed with God that Jesus was both Lord and Christ. They repented. They changed their mind. In verse 42 to 47, what we see, which is our study today, is the fruit of that repentance. We are going to see the fleshing out, what it looks like out here when God changes a heart in here. And what it looks like is this, verse 42, they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship and to the breaking of bread and to prayer. And everyone kept feeling this sense of awe. And many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles. And all those who had been believing or who had believed were together and had all things in common. And they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all as anyone might have a need. And day by day, continuing with one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house. They were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the result of all of that, it wasn't the aim of their behavior, but the result of all of that was this. The Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved, just like they were in verse 41. Let's pray as we begin. father once again we stand at the threshold of your word expecting to hear more than the words of a man of any individual we really want to hear your word we want to hear your voice but father as i am the one from whom these words are coming i am made mindful and need to be mindful even now that that there needs to be an empowering of your spirit for anything of value to come for your voice to be heard, my voice needs in some way to be muzzled and lost in the reality of yours. And I pray that your spirit would come. Energize your precious word. Make it truly your word. Pierce our hearts. Change our minds in areas that we may not even right now know we need to have a change of mind in. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. There are four things that come out at me in this text as being significant Kent's visible expressions of the repentance that we spoke of two weeks ago and that we found in verse 37 to verse 41. The first visible expression of this repentance was a hunger for the truth of God. The second visible expression was a heart for the people of God. The third was an instinctive communing with God. They prayed and they were praising God. And the fourth thing, wonderfully, verse 43, they were feeling a sense of awe. They were experiencing the presence and the power of God. Let's look first of all at the hungering for the truth of God. Verse 42, they were devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching. The apostles' teaching. All that would have been simply would have been the teaching of Matthew, the teaching of Mark, the teaching of Luke, the teaching of John, the teaching of Peter, as they were in the flesh, their teachers. And we now, by the way, just so you have some perspective on this, if you're wondering how it would be that we would be devoted to the apostles' teaching, We have the apostles' teaching. It is the New Testament. And devoting themselves to that teaching is one of the things that stems from or flows out of a changing of the mind. And I think the sequence of that is relatively easy to see. You see, if I have indeed changed my mind about who Jesus is, suddenly, along with that change of mind of who my king is, I suddenly have a brand new desire to find out what he thinks. I didn't care about that when he was the Nazarene, when he was of no account, I really couldn't care less what the word of God has to say about me, because the God of the Bible is not my God. But when he becomes my God, I care. And out of that change of mind about who God is, about who Jesus is, comes a hunger to understand who he is, what he has said, what he offers me, what he calls me to, becomes literally a divine preoccupation. Jesus has suddenly become my king, and I want to know what he says. I want to know what he wants. I want to know what he gives. I want to know what he desires because as I have decided and discerned that he is indeed my king, bowed my knee to him, I desire what he desires. It's one of the birthing realities of changing our mind. I want to know now things I didn't care about before. I want to know how Jesus saves. I want to know how he saved me. I want to know how he forgives and how he accepts and how he fills us with his spirit and how he equips us by his spirit. I want to know Him. You know, as I was going through the sequence of what happens when we change our mind about who the King is and how that births a hunger for His truth, I saw myself as a little six or seven year old kid in Sunday school singing this little song. And the song was this, tell me the story of Jesus. Write on my heart every word. I see these people really, genuinely and right out of the chute redeemed. Having the heart of a little child to the apostles saying, tell us the story. Tell us the story of Jesus right on our heart, every word. Because we've changed our mind about who the king is, and now we want to know the king. We really want to know the king. Like newborn babes long for the pure milk of the word, that by it they might grow. These people were hungry for the truth of God, for the word of God. Boy, it's important that we contrast this kind of hunger with the activity of the Pharisees and the scribes in their relationship with the Word of God. We spend long periods of time in this church as we went through the book of Matthew seeing the Pharisees and the scribes devoted to the teachings of God. Oh my, were they devoted. They spent all of their time studying the Bible. They knew the Bible better than anybody. But their devotion was not born of God being their king. It was not born of genuine heart repentance. it was born of a legalistic performance it was born of an intellectual dissection of the word that affirmed them and justified them and what made them feel good about themselves was how much they knew how much they could tell other people they knew it was a contest and it was arrogant and it was self-righteous in verse 42 we are finding all together different kinds of people with a different kind of heart a group of people who've changed their mind about the king. That is what repentance is. And born of that repentance, there came a hunger for the voice of that king. There's another element in here that I want to put my finger on. I think it's very important. Not only from this repentance was there born a group of people who were hungry to hear his voice, But the apostles who had been called by God and uniquely equipped by God to accommodate the hunger that was being born in people's hearts did what God called them to do and did what God equipped them to do. They gave them the truth of God. Imagine it for a minute, would you? I mean, they were getting the apostles' teaching from the apostles. You know, we spent three or so, three years plus some months in the book of Matthew. And that was a wonderful experience for us in church. Think about hearing the book of Matthew taught by Matthew. Hearing the gospel of Mark from Mark. And Luke from Luke. And John from John. And the teachings of Peter. I can tell you what they taught. Read Matthew. And maybe not in exactly the same form as they were sitting on the hillside, meeting in houses from place to place. they were simply telling the people who had changed their mind about Jesus now hungry to hear more about Jesus let me tell you the story of Jesus sit down let's talk about Jesus I want to tell you the story about Jesus when he was here and he spoke you didn't listen to him so now I want to tell you his words again that you missed the first time I want to tell you about his work and I want to tell you about his grace and I want to tell you about his kingdom I want to tell you about his life and his death and his resurrection he has rolled the stone away he is alive they spoke I believe of brokenness read Matthew Read Mark, Luke, and John. They spoke of dependence and how from dependence comes power. They spoke of grace. They spoke of obedience. They spoke of a clothing with power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, empowering you to become a son of God, empowering you to live a sanctified life, empowering you to serve him in the authority and power of the Spirit, not in your flesh. And these people who had changed their mind about the king could not get enough. Why? Because they were supposed to. It had nothing to do with what they were supposed to do. It had to do with the fact that they had changed their mind about who their king was. And like Jeremiah, their heart was this. Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and they were to me the joy and the rejoicing of my heart. Two elements I want you to catch here in this dynamic of continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching. Was this the hunger for truth born of repentance? but also that the leaders, in this case the apostles, who were called to and equipped for accommodating that hunger, did it. They did it. You might wonder why I'm making a big deal out of they did it. It's because I have a deep concern in the church of Jesus Christ today. My concern is that in some very significant ways in our attempt as churches to be relevant, we have become irrelevant. we have in many ways lost our edge in terms of confronting the world and calling them to grace which is their only hope to Jesus which is their only hope and we have lost I think even in the pulpits a commitment to and a passion for the apostles teaching in Acts chapter 2 the people who were called to and equipped for accommodating the hunger of repentant people were the apostles Later on, that equipping and calling was spread out to other people. Ephesians chapter 4 says that one of the gifts of the Spirit to the church is people. Apostles, prophets, Ephesians 4, evangelists, and pastors and teachers have all been given as gifts to the church to build up the church so they can walk in the full stature of the knowledge of God. And their function, their focus, is to teach the teachings of the apostles. This week, as you know, we have the privilege to be doing a church growth seminar. And I'm doing four basic sessions. And among the things I want to share with these pastors, and it's an incredible delight and privilege to speak to pastors, is to say simply this, and hopefully it will encourage them and not confront them, encourage them that if they're doing this, they're encouraged to keep on doing it. Encouragement would be this. If you have been called to and equipped for the presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, do that. Preach the word. Hosea said this, My people perish for lack of knowledge. Paul was speaking to Timothy. Timothy, young in his ministry, said this. Timothy, you need to understand something. You're not smart enough to give direction to this church, so preach the word. Just stick to the word. Be ready in season and out of season when people respond and when they don't, when they like it and when they don't. Reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and all instruction. Give attention, Timothy, to the public reading and teaching of Scripture. Take great pains with these things. Be absorbed in them. Timothy had a Paul telling him that. I had a father telling me that. Never forget this. Early in my ministry, there was this tension in terms of, you know, what is the function of a pastor? What do I do? I had this little church. I was going to seminary in Chicago, and I had this little church, and I'd sit in my office and go, what do I do? And I had this early sense that God had equipped me for and called me to preach. It felt like a glove. When I did that, I'd go, this is why I was put on this earth here. but there are many other demands and one of the things I got in touch with real early in my ministry was that I do not have an administrative bone in my body and that's a very frightening thing you should share that with my dad he would encourage me with words like this David boy boy there are pastors who administrate and our gifted administrators we need gifts of administration there are pastors who are gifted to bring the word of God what I want you to know is this it takes an awful lot of administrating to make up for lousy preaching preach the word it's an incredible thing beloved when people who've changed their mind about the king and then they automatically they come up hungry if you've changed your mind about the king there's something I know about you you're hungry to hear more about the king and when those people get connected with the men and women who have been equipped for and called to accommodating that hunger there is an there is a wonderful growth that takes place in everybody's life but it doesn't always happen see sometimes people do change their mind about the king they come up hungry and they are among leaders who do not feel a commitment to the apostles teaching the word of god does not does not chart the course for their life or their church and people under that kind of stuff wither. Some of you have experienced that withering in your spirit. Other times, the situation is exactly opposite. There are men and women who have indeed been called to, equipped for, disseminating the word of God, and they are among a stiff-necked people who do not care about the word. They want to hear little stories that make them feel yummy in their tummy and they don't want to get to the word. Jeremiah had that problem. Isaiah had that problem. The call of God on both of those guys was this. You guys are going to be called and equipped, empowered beyond your wildest dreams to speak my truth to my people. And by the way, they're never going to listen to you. Paul to Timothy had to give the same warning. Timothy, I'm telling you to preach the word, but I got to give you a warning. The day's coming when men and women are going to come and not want to hear sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled and make them feel yummy in their tummy, they're going to call to themselves people who do that. You preach the word. In season and out, whether they like it or not, whether they come or not, preach the word. I was sitting in worship today, and God just began to bless me with something. It sounds kind of odd to say, but I think I'm supposed to say it. How blessed I feel here. I feel really blessed here. I hope it doesn't sound grandiose, but I feel in my spirit that I have been called to and equipped for taking this word and giving it out. And I feel like I'm among people who are hungry for it. You can't imagine how that makes me feel. I love to give it. It wears me out, but I love to give it. Because I feel like, for the most part, people are coming here because they want to be here. They want to hear. Not me. I hope it isn't a little yuck on that. I hate that. But if somehow the words turn into gods, hungry people respond. The first sign, beloved, of repentance. If you want to spot what repentance looks like, what revival looks like, it's just a bunch of people who have to change their mind about the king. He is not just some religious figure. He's not some Sunday school story. He is Lord and Christ. And he is my king. And from that change of mind comes a hunger to know more about him, to hear of his truth. There's a second thing that happens when people change their mind about the king, and that is this. There is, from that repentance, a heart for the people of God. Not only a hunger for the truth of God, but now a heart for the people of God. And by the way, this dynamic's all through this text. Verse 42, they were devoted also to fellowship, to the breaking of bread. Verse 44, they were together, had all things in common. 45, selling their property and possessions, sharing them with all as anyone might have need. 46, they were of one mind in the temple, breaking bread, house to house, taking their meals together with gladness. An incredible dynamic of love and communion. The primary word in all of this from which everything else flows in terms of the meals and house to house stuff is the word fellowship. The Greek word for fellowship is koinonia, one that many of you have heard many times. Literally what that word means is partnership. partnership or having in common something the question that needs to come out of that word fellowship is this what is it that was the basis of their fellowship or the basis of their partnership what was it that they had in common specifically stick with the text specifically after they changed their mind this is all coming after they changed their mind about the king they had a partnership. They had something in common. Well, as I connected with this repentance, which is change of mind about the king, it's obvious what their commonality was about, what their partnership was about. What it is was simply this. All of them had the same king, having changed their mind about him. All of them suddenly had the same source. They were all drinking from the same well, that is Jesus. And also they all saw themselves as standing in need of the same grace, the same mercy, the same forgiveness, and they all knew they needed it. There was no longer any, what a scumbag over there. There was none of this haughtiness, this looking down our nose at anybody else because there was a sense when they changed their mind about the king that all of us stand in need of the same grace. And we all stand at the foot of the cross, and standing at the foot of the cross is the divine leveler of humanity. Peasants and kings stand at the foot of the cross the same way. And that is this. They don't stand at all. They bow before their king. Leveled. Jew and Greek. Men and women. Rich and poor. Black and white. No distinctions. At the cross, before our king, there is a leveling partnership. We're in this together. We stand in need of the same grace, the same measure of grace. None is better than another. what's wonderful is from that theological reality as it were comes the first physical expression of that theological reality in the breaking of bread now the breaking of bread in verse 42 to some of us might stir up images of that's where they they knew they were partners so they were having meals together breaking bread well that is coming down later in verse 46 they broke bread had meals together. But what we need to understand about Luke is that for Luke, this concept of breaking bread was a term he used to speak specifically of the Lord's table. When you break bread at the table, communion. And now let me catch you up here a little bit. Most of us, when we celebrate communion, we do it here once a month. I think it's a powerful, important service, a worship time and healing time that we celebrate together. But most of us rightly discern that as being a time when we remember the body and the blood of the Lord. And we remember the amazing grace that has been poured out on us. And as we take the bread and we take the cup, that is what we recall. Because the Word of God tells us, remember me when you do this. But there is another dimension to the table that we need to let in, that we need to understand and see when we take it. And that is this, that not only does the table speak to the fact that Jesus is my redeemer and he broke his body and shed his blood for me but because I am a partaker of Jesus and you are a partaker of Jesus I am not only bound to him but I am bound to you we are all partakers of the same blood the same life we all have the same king and that is a bonding dynamic let me give you a verse for this so you understand this is not just a theology that someone's making up. 1 Corinthians 10. 1 Corinthians 10 says this about this issue. I speak as the wise men. You judge what I say. Verse 16. Isn't that the cup of blessing which we bless, a sharing in the blood of Christ, the cup of blessing which we bless when we celebrate the table, Isn't that a sharing of all of us with the blood of Christ? The answer is implied yes. Is not the bread which we break at the table a sharing of the body of Christ? The answer is yes. Since then, there is one bread. That one bread is Jesus. And we who are many are one body. Then we who are many are one body. Since we are all partaking of the same bread. Since we are all partaking of the same cup. The table, beloved, that they were participating in on a regular basis was a reminder to them of something that we often forget. That is this, because of my union with him, I am an inextricable union with you. And that is the basis of our partnership. That is the basis of our commonality. And I'll tell you something, it's important that we let that in. Because I need to see you differently than sometimes I see you. And you need to see me differently than sometimes you see me. let me explain it this way last Sunday was our communion service and in the first service on Sunday I have the opportunity to partake in communion with my family I sit right down here and after I kind of give all the elements to everybody I just go sit down with my family and a lot of times we have the whole group there on this particular Sunday for some reason Christopher my youngest son eight years old, and I were paired off alone. And we were going to pray together, and I wasn't thinking about this at all, but it just came to my mind, and I had my arm around him, and he seemed really open to what was going on. And I just said, you know, Christopher, something that strikes me a little weird about this. And we began to talk about the fact that I said, Chris, I'm the dad here, and you're the kid. And I'm big, and you're a little. And I'm 38, and you're eight. and I didn't say this part but there's a way in which Christopher as I got my arm, I'm the teacher here and you're the pupil and I'm the wise one and you're the little kid who's supposed to learn everything from me and that's a true thing. But I did go on to say this. I said the odd thing Christopher about this cup and this bread that we're taking here is that while I'm a dad and you're a son when we do this we're both sons. Not only that, you and I, this is going to be weird for you you and me are brothers because we got the same father, and that's what this is about. And all of a sudden, my son and I, my 8-year-old son and I were leveled. You understand that? You know, I'm the pastor. I'm not only his father, I'm his pastor. But right there at the table, we are leveled. And Christopher, I got news for you. The same forgiveness you need, I desperately need too. That's what this cup is about. It leveled us. Let that in. To let that in is going to have to be a spirit work. I can't paint a verbal picture clear enough to let, that's just a God thing. I spoke in the other services that, you know, it really would be a good idea, I think, if in some of our kinship groups, our small groups as we meet and do whatever it is that we do. I'd like you to consider that from time to time, make part of your routine, coming together to celebrate the Lord's table. And in that celebration of the table, let it speak this message to you, That when we take the cup and when we take the bread, one of the things it does, among other things, as we honor Jesus, one of the things it does is it levels all of us. Because he is our king, we all stand in need of the same grace, we all stand in need of the same mercy, the same forgiveness. We're all leveled. Peasant and king, Jew and Greek, men and women, old and young, rich and poor. From an awareness of that commonality flowed all of these other behaviors of selling and sharing and one mind and meals together flowed out of that reality. You know, it's an interesting thing that God even must have arranged it. He did arrange it, I believe, that they could express all this love in this particular time. You see, you gotta remember, as they're selling everything and sharing and breaking bread house to house, you gotta remember why these people are even in Jerusalem at this time. These people don't all live in Jerusalem. You know, we got this, the church was 3,000. I don't know how big the church in Jerusalem was. Many of these people went home in a week or two. And they were pilgrims coming for the Feast of Pentecost. They weren't coming to meet the Spirit. That was a gift that they got arrested with. And from these hearts that changed their mind about who the king was and who the source was, they also changed their mind about who each other was, and they saw themselves in partnership and commonality, and they opened their homes and shared their food, and it wasn't compulsion. There was no demand. They did it because it was a work of the Spirit, born of a changed mind and a changed heart. The truth is that when we talk about things like this, selling your possessions, giving it away, breaking bread, opening our homes, it's, for many of us, very threatening. We get real defensive. We have a Western culture, and that's not bad necessarily, but our Western culture is marked profoundly by an individualistic spirit. We are all individuals. and that's not bad either necessarily except sometimes that individualism turns into isolation and separation and we live in houses and there's nothing wrong with houses and our houses have little houses in the houses, little rooms where we all live separate and there's nothing wrong with that except we cross lines there needs to be such a fight for balance I believe some of these things here come down and confront us. See, I think we really do struggle with an idolatry of possessions. I think we all do. I am in that too. A bondage to things and a bondage to money and the attitude in all of it is, it's mine. It's mine. I earned it and it's not yours. It's mine. Kind of like a little kid, isn't it? You ever see behaviors like that in a little kid and you go, isn't that disgusting? they're so selfish you know so kids are great it's a gift from God to get kids who act like kids and they just irritate you and then get a picture of how God sees us it's the same you know get a that's so much grace there's so much grace isn't that good you know it's interesting though it's so what am I supposed yell at you about oh it'll go to your possessions no no no no I'm not going to yell at you about anything. What I'm going to do is talk to you about repentance. You see, when repentance really happens, when we change our mind about not only who our king is, but who our source is, we're able to let go of things. If things, possessions, have become my source of life, hear me, there is nothing wrong with possessions. But if they are what confirms that I am an okay person, if they are what I use to feed the hunger of my soul, I promise you, if they are my source, I will hang on to them for dear life. Because they are life to me. The concept of giving is something I'll always know I'm supposed to do. And maybe I'll dole it out here and there, especially if people notice. But to freely give, I cannot do. These things are my life. It's mine. And if these things are my life, I will build bigger barns and bigger barns, and they will be for me because they're mine. It's such bondage. And I believe God has much work to do on us, on me, with this. But with repentance, a changing of the mind about who the king is and who the source is and who you are in relation to me, and changing our mind about possessions comes a freedom. and comes all the things we see in verse 44 to 46. There's a third thing that comes out of this repentance in this text, and that is an instinctive communion with God. Verse 42, they were devoted also to prayer. Verse 47, they were praising God. Prayer and praise. What strikes me right away, however, about this devotion to prayer and praise is that the Pharisees were devoted to prayer. I mean, it's wonderful to just kind of throw that up and recognize that's not the kind of prayer I'm talking about. Matthew chapter 6, Jesus confronted the Pharisees who prayed all the time. He said of them this, you stand, you love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners. Why? Because people see you there. And you don't pray, you make speeches. And you're not concerned about the people you're even making speeches to. You're making speeches to make you look good. And you look spiritual and you're certainly not talking to God. It is meaningless repetition, he said in verse 7. And these guys had services of praise too. Not only were they devoted to prayer, but they had services of praise all the time. Worship services. And it was all very appropriate and very right. And God said in the Old Testament of many of their services of praise this. I hate your solemn assemblies. You guys think your worship services are the end of all things. They are the end of all things. You think they're the epitome of spirituality. I hate them. Isaiah 29, 13. The reason is because you honor me with your lips, but your hearts are far from me. In vain do you worship me, and I'm tired of your words. Your reverence consists of traditions learned by rote. But, but, when there is a piercing of the heart, and people begin to change their mind about who the king is and who their source is and people begin to repent. Out of that repentance and out of that brokenness and out of that receiving of enormous grace and mercy comes an instinctive prayer and praise. And the prayer isn't, you're supposed to pray more. Go pray. No, no, no, no. There's from the recognition that Jesus is my source, this constant flow of Jesus. If my only hope is you, If I'm going to make it through this day, if I'm going to face the issues of my life, if I'm going to love my wife the way I want to, if I'm going to love my kids and be a dad, I just need you. I need you. You need to speak to me. I want to talk to you. I want to listen to your voice. There's a communion. They were devoted to prayer. It was the result of really knowing he was their source. They had no other hope. It was real worship. The key to worship is not singing the right songs. You ever come here and Dan will maybe pick a song you don't like and just go, I hate that song, I hate that song. Why don't you pick the songs I like? Well, talk to Dan. No, don't do that. He's going, don't do that. The key to worship is not picking the right songs. It's having the right heart. It's a heart issue. These people worship God because they change their mind about God. They change their mind about God. This isn't a performance. We're not doing religious stuff. We're here to meet with God because he's our king. and people who have him as their king want to do that. There was prayer, there was praise, fellowship, sharing, teaching, there was gladness of heart. It was all born of the fact that they changed their mind about Jesus and after all of that is said and done, the overarching thing of it all was this, there was a sense of awe. I love that. Verse 42, verse 43 rather, everyone kept feeling this sense of awe. Many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles. as they were experiencing the presence and the power of God. The word awe there is the key word. It is not a terror, but it is a kind of fear. I would define it this way. This sense of awe is the overwhelming sense that something beyond any physical explanation is happening among us. I like that. A sense of awe is an overwhelming sense that something beyond any physical explanation is happening among us. You'll try to put your finger on it. You'll try to define it. And after it's all said and done, all you'll be able to say is, it was God. It was supernatural. It was awesome. It was awesome. Now, it's ironic. Sometimes when the spirit moves, this sense of awe is something you can identify because you saw it. Someone gets healed. You get healed. You walk away. You walk out those doors. You have something healed that was with you when you came in. You'd notice that. It would produce a sense of awe, miracles, signs, and wonders. someone gets delivered from oppression from the enemy a stronghold in the of the enemy in your life you've had for years it's gone I'd notice that produce a sense of awe someone hearing the story of Jesus has their heart pierced they change their mind about the king they go from death to life in a moment they're redeemed the life of God enters their life they get saved that produces a sense of awe. Nobody can talk anybody into the kingdom. God did that. But I saw that. Sometimes, however, what God is doing, I don't see it. And it's hard to say it, but I sense it. It's a sense of awe. We try to describe it. This is the best way I could get to. We try to describe the sense of awe to someone who maybe wasn't there. Let's say God did something powerful in a particular service, in your heart or among us all. And you went home, your wife, maybe you're, sometimes my wife, for instance, our kids get sick and she can't come and I try to explain to her, you've got a friend or something like that and you go and you just say, God, God, it was just an incredible thing and you try to explain to them what happened and you start it kind of this way, well, the sermon, the sermon, it was a sermon, it was really good and you try to say the things that were said and he said this and he said that and as you're starting to say what whoever was preaching was saying, you start going, no, no, I'm trying to tell you what it was, but that wasn't it, I guess. The sermon was good, but it was the sermon, but it wasn't a sermon. It was more. It was the worship. It was the worship. This time, Dan did pick the right songs, and it was great. It was all my favorites, and it was all your favorites, and you start to list the songs, and you're three down in the list, and all of a sudden, it kind of starts turning to dust, and you go, well it wasn't a sermon but it was and it wasn t the worship songs we picked but it was it was more it was the fellowship the donuts were unbelievable the coffee was fresh they got new kinship groups no it wasn't that either it was more wait a minute it was the sermon but it wasn't it was the worship but it wasn't And it was the fellowship. It was the fellowship, but it wasn't. It was God. It was God. It was Jesus, the Nazarene, just like Peter said. Jesus, the Nazarene, the one that we've ignored, the one that we want to make just this religious figure. It was Jesus. He came and he presented himself alive somehow. And when I heard and when we heard that Jesus was made by God, both Lord and Christ, this incredible thing happened. People were being pierced to the heart. And we started changing our mind. I changed my mind about who the king was. And we started changing our mind about who the source of life was. And people repented. And there was an openness to the word. No, it wasn't an openness. It was a hunger. There was a hunger among people. And we all look kind of like children. We all look like children. In a good way, we look like children who just wanted to hear the pure milk of the word, that by it we might grow, a hunger for the truth of God. And there was a partnership. I don't know how to describe this to you. It wasn't about a song. It's not about a sermon. It's not about donuts. There was a sense of fellowship and partnership, a love for the people. I know it's goofy. There's 4,500 people. There were 2,000 people in this gym. But as we worshiped and we saw our commonality and we all needed the same grace, I felt my heart and knit it to everybody there. People I'll never, I don't even know. I could walk by some of you in the street and not know you. But when God came and moved among us, there was a sense of awe. There was this partnership that knitted our hearts together, and it gave us a desire to know each other more. Forming groups doesn't create fellowship. A heart for God's people make having groups make sense. Now you've just got a place to go. And there was this spirit of prayer and praise and worship and gladness and sincerity of heart. It was awesome. It was awe. It was God. Where's all that come from? Where's all that come from? How do we get it? Well, I can tell you what I don'T think we get. I don't think we get it by getting the word more. You know, if you change your mind about the king, you will. I don't have the energy to get in the word more. I don't have the energy to have fellowship with. I don't have the energy to get you to care about things you don't care about. What I can call for is a change of mind about who the king is. And when people begin to change their mind, the hunger for the truth comes. It's there. A heart for the people of God is there. It comes. A communion with the Spirit of God comes. It's there. And a sense of awe is something that the Spirit of God just kind of hovers over the whole thing with. It doesn't come from just forming groups and deciding to have fellowship. In the immediate context, it comes from repentance, but the answer to that isn't even repent. So repent. See, I've got to ask myself this question. Where does repentance come from? Where do people get the energy to even change their mind? According to the text, the repentance came, verse 37, when they were pierced to the heart. So get pierced to the heart. Ready? Go. Where does being pierced from the heart come from? A good message? I don't think so. Pierced to the heart is something only God can do with his word, not the word of a man, but with his word penetrating the heart. The wonder of all of these things is that it always comes back to God. It all comes back to God. It all comes back to the work of God, the word of God, that pierces the heart, that gets our attention, that causes us to ask questions like, what should we do? We hear a word. You need to change your mind about who your king is, about who your source is. When we see him as the king, these things begin to flow. And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. Suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, filled the whole house where they were sitting, and there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. They were all clothed with the Holy Spirit. It all began with the work of the Spirit. So what do we do? What do we do? Here's what we do. We ask the Spirit to move among us. We ask the Spirit to drop the scales from our eyes. We ask the Spirit to drive away the deadness of our hearing so that we can hear the word, his word, so that we can see his glory, so that we can be pierced to the heart, so that we can change our mind about who our king is and who our source is. I want you to stand with me as we close. we're not going to sing a song this morning I do want you to be quiet for just a moment I do believe there are people here who need to do some business with God I want the altar ministry people to come up and take their place in the front and if you need prayer from some of them I want you to come I want to invite those of you who need to to stay and get prayer to stay where you are and just listen to God. Your family will wait for you. If you need to just listen to what God's saying, just let some of the things maybe you've heard have time to sink in. You need to have permission to stay. I'm going to pray, and then we're going to be silent. I'm going to ask you to be silent. And when you're done just listening, when you're done doing whatever you need to do, after a period of silence, just begin to leave. You will be dismissed. You are dismissed. But take some moments of quiet to listen to the voice of God. Those who need to come, come. Those who need to stay, stay. Those who want to go, go. Let's pray. Jesus, we're not here to stir anybody up to form fellowship groups or do something to make these things a reality. We're here to ask your spirit to move upon people who maybe need to change their mind and have their hearts pierced. I pray that you would do that. I pray that you gently and quietly, yet very powerfully, would move among us right now and pierce our hearts where it needs to be pierced. Even hearts of those who deeply love you, we have places in our heart that are hidden even to ourselves that we don't even know about. Father, I pray by your gracious life in us that you would shine the light of your love and grace upon those hidden places and pierce them and show us ways in which we need to change our mind about you and about other people and about our possessions and about our whole perspective on life. This issue of you being the king changes everything. It changes everything. We do indeed bow our knee to you. Do your ministry among us. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
