Let's pray. Lord, among our deepest desires is this, to be and become a people who are authentically following you as our rabbi. Because we believe that if we really would follow you, follow your way of being and living that it will lead us into life and freedom and the fullness of who you've called us to be as your people but our greatest need in that regard is the actual capacity to do it to to to keep following you and so we declare even at the beginning of this word, our hearts made tender by the worship that to follow you, we need you. So I pray for the work of your spirit to be available to us today, empowering us to hear and to see and to listen and understand, but also to take these things and have them translated into capacity to walk your way. I pray that in Jesus' name, amen Having lived as slaves in the land of Egypt for some 400 years God called them out, Deuteronomy chapter 5, 15 With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm He delivered them, His people, from the only life they had ever known for 400 years, slavery. They knew how to live as slaves, as do we, but not as free men and women. So when in Exodus chapter 20, which is the text we've been studying these days, God gives to them the Decalogue. Deca meaning ten, or logos meaning word, the ten great words for life, also known as the Ten Commandments. They were designed by God to show His newly redeemed, delivered people a different kind of life, a different way to live as free people, no longer slaves, being driven by a slave master who didn't care about them, only what they could produce. They were being invited by the law of all things, the Torah, the Ten Commandments, into a different kind of life, that if they chose to live it, to follow in its way, and not all did, would enable them not only to stay free and not be subject again to a yoke of slavery like they were in Egypt, but it would enable them to step into the fullness of their destiny as the people of God in the world. And it starts with some pretty basic stuff we've been discovering. Indeed, I call it kindergarten, the Ten Commandments, where God in effect is saying to His newly redeemed people, let's just start here. At the very beginning of your new life, learn what it means to put me first. Accept no substitutes. Revere my name. Observe my day. Honor your father and your mother that your days in the land may be prolonged. We spent two weeks on that honoring your father and mother thing, figuring out what it means to ascribe the appropriate weight to our fathers and our mothers. I called it the hardest work some of us will ever do, the longest journey some of us will ever take. Today, the sixth commandment in the law, four words, you shall not murder. Pretty basic stuff. Again, kind of like kindergarten, you shall not murder. I'd like you to stop the killing. Literally, actually, this commandment means not just killing of any kind, because it does need to be narrowed down to this. It means you shall not take without just cause the life of an innocent. You shall not take without just cause the life of an innocent. You shall not murder. Commandments that had to actually make Moses, the one who was receiving the law, if you remember, a little bit nervous because Moses was himself a murderer. Remember that? Exodus chapter 2 verse 12 says this, that Moses looked this way and that way. And when he saw that no one was around, because you usually don't do things like this, when people are watching, he struck down the Egyptian, killing him and hid him in the sand. And so he fled. You probably know the story. Maybe you don't. To the backside of a Midian desert where he spent 40 years in the desert. A prison of sorts. till God called him out. This is always the story, you guys, till God called Moses out with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and a burning bush was involved as well, saying in effect, Moses, it's time for you to quit living like a slave in this prison desert place. A slave not only to Egypt and to this desert, but it's time for you, Moses, to stop living as a slave to your own passions and to your own anger and rage. For I am calling you, Moses, into a different kind of life, into a different way of living, wherein which you shall not murder. In other words, you shall not deal with your anger that way. Now, I've got to tell you, early in the week, as I was considering this particular commandment, before I had much thought or reflection, My response internally to it, thou shalt not murder, quite frankly, was a bit of relief. Finally, a commandment that I haven't already entirely obliterated in some way. Finally, a commandment, thou shalt not murder, that will not require painful introspection and deep repentance. Now, honoring our parents did. Indeed, if you were here, you know that just figuring out what it meant to honor our parents was a lot of work. But this murder thing, it's going to be a breeze. Indeed, I just want to tell you, in the beginning here, you can all relax. Just get comfortable if you want. Because the absolute truth before God is this. I'm not a murderer. And neither are you, as far as I know. Never have been. I doubt I ever will be. And to tell you the truth, I don't think it's in me. You know, maybe in self-defense, protecting my family, if I was in the context of a war, or maybe some horrible accident. I think maybe in those contexts I could take a life, but to take without just cause. The life of an innocent, I don't think so. I think I'm safe on this. I just don't see me going there. I don't struggle with wanting to go there. I don't walk around going, I'm not killing anybody. I don't know. So here's the deal. And this is a good new opener. I think we get the week off. All of us. No conviction, no heavy stuff today. Indeed, we don't have this opportunity very often, so we should make the best of it to be corporately, I mean, as an entire group, a little self-righteous and sanctimonious. It's going to feel good, actually. But I think today we can indulge at least a little bit a morally superior, sanctimonious, self-righteous attitude because we're not murderers. Never have been. Probably never will be. Lots of amens today as we indict the bad guys. No, no, no, no. The primary reason I just went into that little song and dance right there and gave you that load of hay was to set us up for the fact, and I know you knew I was up to something with that silliness, to set us up for the fact that it was to a group of people much like that I just described who felt themselves safe from indictment with regard to this commandment that our rabbi Jesus in Matthew chapter 5 said these words, effectively wiping the sanctimonious smiles off their morally superior faces. Matthew 5 verse 21, Jesus says, You've heard it said that the ancients were told in the law, in the Ten Commandments and other places as well, that you shall not commit murder, and whoever does shall be liable to the court. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court, and whoever shall say to his brother, Raka, shall be guilty before the supreme courts, and whoever shall say to you, you fool, shall be guilty enough to go into a fiery hell. All of which makes me wonder, is he kidding? I'm serious. Is he exaggerating in some way to make some bizarre, obscure theological point because this really feels like a stretch. To compare being angry with your brother to murder, both of them built guilty before the court. And then he says, if you say the word raka to a brother or to someone, it's the Supreme Court. And then if you call somebody an idiot, a fool, you're guilty enough to go to a fiery hell. It's worse than murder. He's got to be kidding. But apparently, uncomfortably, murder, according to Jesus, is much closer to home than what most of us thought. For while murder may not be in our hand, boom, for many of us it is living quite comfortably in our hearts, proceeding quite regularly from our mouths. Indeed, the three primary ingredients of murder that are identified by Jesus in this text, Matthew 5, are these, rage, malice, and contempt. Please note something. It's very important to really get into what Jesus is meaning by what he's saying in Matthew 5. It's not about the actual saying of these words, raka, or fool, that is the problem. The fact is, we don't even use the word raka. We don't know what it means, though I have a theory. I've shared it with you before. Raka is actually a word from the Hebrew, and it's an expletive. It's a swear word, evidently, but the actual meaning is kind of obscure. Nobody really knows what it means, but if you say it to someone, then you kind of know you've had somebody express contempt for you, malice toward you, and that's why I think it's like flipping somebody off. It's like giving somebody the birth. So raka is, that's what that is, and I'm not going to do it. I'm trying to be careful what I do with my hands. And most of us have called people far worse things than a fool. Indeed, if it's all just about saying these words or making sure you don't say these particular words, we have a problem with Jesus, who in Luke chapter 12, remember this? A few months ago, we talked about Jesus, who was confronting this guy who was building bigger and bigger barns, accumulating more and more for himself, thus all his wealth, making him blind to the plight of the poor around him. Jesus said of that guy, he's a fool, called him a fool. Jesus is going to hell. No, no, no, it's not about the words themselves. As if to say, if you avoid these words, raka and fool, then you're clear. How about idiot or jerk? Can I do that one? No, the issue is what's driving these words, what's fueling these words, and what's fueling them, you know what's fueling them. It's rage, which is the word in the text Jesus uses that gets translated as anger. And malice, which is embodied in the word raka, a desire to inflict pain, to do damage. We speak of malicious intent and contempt, which in some ways is the breeding ground for malice. Contempt is a judgment that I'm making in my spirit toward the person I'm speaking to or about that they're worthless. You idiot. Mix those three together. You have murder. But not always a murder you can see resulting in a body bag. Because just like there's more than one way to skin a cat, there's more than one way to kill a human being. You can do it with a club. You can do it with a gun or a knife or a brick. Or you can do it with a word. A gesture. Even a look. Perfectly timed, dripping with sarcasm, full of malice, driven by contempt, drawn from a deep reservoir of stored up anger, always at the ready, the spontaneity and force of which surprises even you when it comes flying out of you. How many of you have heard yourself kind of saying this or wondering about this? Where did that come from? And you're speaking of yourself and this explosion. either in physical violence or with a violence that came out of your mouth. Where did that come from? We call it road rage. So common it has a name. Road rage. Explosions of anger over some real or imagined vehicular disrespect resulting in some verbal exchange complete with sign language for the hearing impaired, actually. but sometimes it does turn to violence you know it's true and and and when it turns to violence that's what makes the news none of us make the news almost every day something like that makes the news it was a sunday afternoon some years ago it's a true story my son caleb and his buddy exploded into our house it was right after church we were gathering for lunch and they were just talking a mile a minute, all excited about how on the way to church, dad, this guy wanted to kill us. He wanted to kill you. Why? He says, and Caleb went on to say, I don't know what we did. I don't know what we did. And I'm thinking, probably something. But dad, he was honking and yelling and riding on our bumper and swearing and signing and all of the things. And then it got really weird because we tried to lose him, but he kept following us. And we started to get scared. We finally did lose him, and then we went to church and calmed down. And this is why they were busting through the door for lunch. He said, Dad, here's the crazy part. After church, we see him. He's in our church. He was going to church. Oh, busted. Following the rabbi. Oh, you guys. could it be you could it be me not long ago i was pulling out from a stop sign onto a four-lane road and i'm telling you a four-lane road because it tells you the guy who was had plenty of room anyway um the car i pulled out the car did have been about a half a block away as soon as i pulled out sped up got right on my rear bumper and stayed there now before i could think about what i was supposed to feel, I felt some things. The first thing I felt was love. Oh, no, seriously, seriously, I just had the strongest herbs. It started from my toes, and it just worked out. I just wanted to pull my car over, get out, and you need a hug. No. The first thing I felt was the first thing you would feel. I think I felt agitated. I felt indignant. I looked in my rear view mirror and I noticed it was a kid. It's a kid. And then I noticed it's a skinny kid. And then I thought, I could take this kid. No, no, no, no, no. Here's the deal. The truth is, you know, I felt pretty good about this whole thing because actually my anger didn't last very long. It really didn't. I didn't yell. I didn't scream. I didn't sign him or anything. But I did notice something. And it was this, how strongly I felt what I felt, how quickly I felt it. Like, boom, before I could think about the right response, I had a response. Because something inside of me had been tapped. Something that was already there was found. See, here's the deal. Explosions of anger over relatively minor offenses are almost never about the offense itself. The offense has simply triggered, accessed, found what is for many of us a vast supply of anger that most people carry around every day, all day. It doesn't get ignited every day, but it's there every day, all day. And people like that, like us, who have that kind of reservoir of anger will probably never commit murder. But there's more than one way to murder a human being, to kill a human spirit. You can do it with a club or a gun or a knife, or you can do it with a word, even a look if you're really good at this. Perfectly timed, dripping with sarcasm, full of malice driven by contempt. Let's talk about contempt. Dallas Willard in his book Divine Conspiracy says that contempt is a greater evil than anger. Wow. For unlike anger, contempt involves a kind of studied degradation of another. We can be angry at someone without denying their worth, but contempt degrades. Contemptuous attitudes and actions are like a knife to the heart that can permanently mutilate the soul. The intent of contempt is always to exclude, to push away, to leave out. You can find it often in some very common places. In a schoolyard, you can find contempt. Or at a party, in a home, you can find contempt in the church sanctuary. That contempt is so common, however, he says, does not ease its destructiveness. In many professional circles in high society where one might hope for the highest of moral sensitivities, contempt has become a fine art. Indeed, practicing contempt well is part of being in good standing. To not know whom and how to despise is one of the surest signs that you are simply not quite with it and that you yourself are worthy of contempt. Contempt has the power to stab the soul to its core and deflate its power of life. It can hurt so badly and cut so deeply that physical murder would almost be a mercy. How many of you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, yeah, you do. So as long as we're talking about murder this morning, let's just make sure we're talking about two kinds of murder. The first we'll call murder Minneapolis style. With sincere apologies to all the fine people who live in Minneapolis, murder Minneapolis style will stand as an analogy this morning of blatant, obvious, physical murder, the kind we read about in the paper and see in the news every day, the kind that appalls us and frightens us, the kind that most of us will never do. That's why we need to talk about a second kind of murder. We'll call it murder suburban style. Let's sincere apologies to all the fine people who live in the suburbs. Let this kind of murder stand as an analogy of subtle, well-manicured, nice-looking malice and contempt that can kill the human spirit. The psalmist in Psalm 55, 21 describes it this way. Speaks of people this way. Whose speech is smoother than butter. You ever experience this? This hurts. Whose speech is smoother than butter, but their heart is at war. Their words are softer than oil. But actually, they are sharper than drawn swords. That is murder, suburban style. It's interesting. In the Jewish tradition, we're studying Jesus as a rabbi. Many rabbis taught that embarrassing someone in public was a serious sin. Say, when people get embarrassed, they turn red, and the blood goes up into their face. You know, the feeling, we've all been embarrassed at one time or another. And if there is no malice or contempt behind the thing that embarrassed you, the joke that got told on you, the thing that exposed you, you can recover. But even when it's kind of a funny thing, and everybody's laughing, and there was no malice or contempt, a real good friend is going to kind of want to look in your eyes and make, Did that go too far? Did that expose something that shouldn't have been exposed? And you might even come later. You okay with that? I mean, without laughing, are you okay with that? And you were. It was okay. You can recover. But when it's driven by malice, when the embarrassment, the public humiliation, is driven by malice and contempt, the rabbis used to note that the face didn't become red. It would go ashen. In other words, it would be drained of blood. you were horrified, the blood would leave the face, and the rabbis compared that to the shedding of blood. Embarrassment, you go red. Humiliation, you go white. Some would argue, I suppose, says Rabbi Stuart Vogel in his book on the Ten Commandments, that unlike gossip, which is done behind one's back, publicly embarrassing someone, is acceptable because it's done with the person present, and at least he can defend himself or herself. But if gossip, says Vogel, can be compared to a burglary when no one's home, then public embarrassment is more like armed robbery. The words used are like bullets aimed at the heart. Having the earth swallow us whole would seem a more welcome experience than the shame and humiliation felt at the hands of another through public embarrassment. Again, you know what I'm talking about. But let's talk now about gossip. Another way to murder suburban style is gossip, to assassinate a person's character with words. One of my favorite quotes on this, I've used it many times before, Morgan Blake, writer for the Atlantic Journal, said it this way, I am more deadly than a screaming shell of a howitzer. I win without killing. I tear down homes, break hearts, and wreck lives. I travel on the wings of the wind. No innocence is strong enough to stop me. No purity can daunt me. I have no regard for the truth, but I love half-truth. In fact, I find half-truth quite necessary to get done what I need to get done. I have no respect for justice, no mercy for the defenseless. My victims are as numerous as the sands of the sea, and often as innocent. I never forget. I seldom forgive. My name is gossip, slander, rumor, and I can take without just cause the life of an innocent because there's more than one way to kill a human being, to murder the human spirit. You can do it with a gun or you can do it with a word. Proverbs 18, 21. Life and death. Unbelievable. Life and death are in the power of the tongue. Words. James 3.6, the tongue, the words you say is a fire. And fires have the potential to burn things down, to damage things badly. The very world of iniquity. It is a restless evil full of deadly, murderous poison that can set on fire the course of a life, that can burn a life down, as it were. Indeed, it's set on fire by hell. It's set on fire by hell. How does that work? How is hell involved in the burning down of someone's life through the work of a tongue? Well, whatever involvement it has, it doesn't mean this, that if you murdered Minneapolis style or suburban style, it doesn't mean that the devil made you do it. As if hell had somehow the power to move your tongue without your involvement, to throw your fist, to pull that trigger. The involvement of hell, I have kind of a weird picture in mind. I don't think this is theologically correct, but I'm going to borrow from C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters where he talks about the demons who had this imaginary dialogue and kind of revealed the agenda. Because what I picture in my mind, relative to hell's involvement to burning things down, is that in this room right now, there's a little demon. He is a little demon in my mind. He's not too bright, and that's just because I don't want him to be very bright. Makes the picture better. But he's a hyperactive, lower level, little demon, not too bright, and all he's doing is lighting matches. doing it. He's been doing it all morning, by the way. He was doing it when you came in, when you were parking your car, when you were trying to find your seat, and you found out someone who's already in your seat to seat you. Oh, we didn't. Where are they anyway? Lit a match. Just lit a match during worship. When we sang the song you didn't like, a little match was lit. And you know, by the way, this goofy demon I'm imagining in my mind, we'll keep lighting matches while we leave. After church, when we get in our car and navigate to traffic and gather with our friends for lunch, and in fact, if you could actually see him, use your imagination, it would really crack you up because he's kind of a funny character. Again, he's all hyperactive in my mind's eye, and he's bouncing all over the places, lighting matches to no avail, meaning there's no fire. I mean, nobody's blowing up here, I can tell. Maybe a few slow burns that no one can see, but no big blow-ups here during church. Indeed, during worship, he gave up on some of you, trying to light anything. Because his worship was moving, hearts grew tender, and eyes got moist, and the wind of the Spirit began to blow. He couldn't even get the match lit. And most of the time, it's just that way. Until the lit match that this imaginary demon throws on this day in this room, given this circumstance, finds your flammable fuel. Then, boom. And if the tongue gets engaged, the fire is started. Fists fly. Triggers are pulled. And it doesn't take much once the match finds the fuel. Indeed, it doesn't take a demon. I have this imaginary picture, but I don't think there are demons around here. I don't think demons have to do it. All it takes is life. All it takes is, you know, the lit match of me not getting what I want when I want it. That's all it takes. No demons need to be involved in this at all. And when the lit match of me not getting what I want when I want it finds the stored up flammable fuel of my self-absorption, of my narcissism, arrogance, bitterness, pride, insecurity, unresolved conflict, unhealed hurt, undealt with sin, boom. And again, it's not always a boom, because many of us are far too sophisticated. It's more of a whoosh, and you've got to slow burn. And this one will come out with words that are smooth as butter, but your heart is at war. James chapter 4, verse 2. I love James. I remember 15 years ago I taught the book of James, And one of the things that delighted me about James was all the way through that series, if you were here a long time ago, you remember, I kind of, I pictured James as a no-nonsense chemical dependency practitioner. If any of you have ever gone to a good counselor, especially if you're working through an addiction, all along the way, they might be very sympathetic with your wound and all this kind of stuff, but all the way along, a really good chemical dependency counselor says things like this, don't give me that, it's you. And as soon as you know it's you, then you're going to get better. And I saw James doing that all over the place. In fact, in James chapter 4, verse 2, it's what he says. You want to know the problem? You lust. And since you see the word lust, you think sex. The less there isn't about sex. What that simply means is it speaks to a strong desire. You lust. You have a strong desire for what? Your own way. But, he goes on to say, you do not have. What? You do not have what you lust for. You're not getting what you want. In other words, you can't get what you want when you want it. You can't get the person that you wanted to do what you wanted. You can't get the possession, the position, the answer. You didn't get the raise. Someone, this is unbelievable, that people have the gall to do this. Someone actually said these words to you or this one word to you. No. you can't get the flight you can't get the color you can't get the size you can't get the hamburger the hamburger i can't believe they put a pickle on it i told him not to put a pickle on it how incompetent can so you commit murder it says in the text you lust you do not have so you commit murder. And everybody goes, myself included, give me a friend. I do not. Just keep in mind, there's more than one way to kill someone. You can do it Minneapolis style with a gun or a knife or a brick, or you can do it suburban style with a word, with a look. In fact, you can do it with a smile. It's fascinating, really, to me. Because there's lots of people, I'm probably in this room right now who think that because they don't blow up and they remain externally calm, that they're not angry and that people don't know they're angry because they're just calm on the outside and that none of this applies to them. Psalm 55 again is speaking of people just like that, whose speech is smoother than butter but their heart is at war, whose words are softer than oil, yet they're actually drawn swords. Psychologists call it passive-aggressive. I like what the Bible calls it better, sin. And it's power. And if you've ever been around it, some of you grew up in it. But if you've ever been around it, it's power, this buttery word with war in the heart. The power of it is in its stealth. In other words, you can't pin it down. You don't know for sure. I mean, did I just get ripped? It's hard to tell because his or her face was so calm, and their words were so soft. But I think I'm bleeding. This is crazy making. Again, some of you grew up with that And it killed something There's more than one way to kill a human being To murder a human spirit You can do it Minneapolis style You can do it suburban style With a word, with a look You can do it with a smile Which brings me to a question And I wrap it up with this question I just want to draw it all in now The question is this Are you willing to wonder About your flammable fuel? Are you willing to wonder where you leak flammable fuel? Because whatever it is and wherever it's coming from, as soon as it meets the right match, it'll ignite. Are you willing to wonder about that almost uncontrollable reflex you sometimes have to undermine her, to diminish him, to expose them, to embellish facts, to jump to conclusions, to pass on a juicy morsel, to talk to her about him without ever talking to him. Are you willing to wonder about what's fuel in your fire? Where does you leak flammable fuel? are you willing, and basically this is really the question, are you willing to begin to do the necessary work, this really hard work, to turn the gas off at its source? Last couple of weeks, you know, we have been dealing with this issue of honoring our parents and ascribing to them the appropriate weight, which kind of brought us into this place of needing to talk about forgiveness and the fact that if we're ever going to get free and no longer be a slave to what our parents think or what our parents did, be it good or bad, we're going to have to enter into this journey of forgiveness that will bring us to forgiveness. I called it, remember, the hardest work that some of us will ever do, the longest journey that some of us will ever take. Well, all of that stuff clearly applies here as well. because sometimes the source of our flammable fuel is an unhealed wound. And I'm telling you, unhealed wounds, I'm not telling you anything you don't know, unhealed wounds leak flammable fuel. And there are many things that are necessary for unhealed wounds to be healed. The grace of God is necessary. Recognizing that you have a wound is necessary. But I'll tell you what else is necessary somewhere along the line. This journey of forgiveness is necessary to release the person who inflicted the wound and then to discover that the person who gets that free is you. It's the hardest work some of you will ever do. It's the longest journey some of you will ever take. But the fact is, if we're really going to get down to where it is we leak flammable fuel, it's not always a wound. Even if a wound is involved, after you deal with the wound, you still have more work to do. Because far more often, the source of our flammable fuel is this. James 4, verse 2, we lust. The bottom line for most of us is simply this. We have a strong desire to have what we want when we want it, but we do not have what we want when we want it. We cannot get it, and so we murder. sometimes Minneapolis style far more often suburban style for most of us the real source of the leak is our relentless obsessive unyielding commitment to ourselves to our way and our plan and our agenda and our idea our wants and our whims which raises another question beyond wondering where you lead the bigger question is this, are you willing to repent? Are you willing to begin a journey of repentance, a journey, a lifelong journey of turning? Are you willing to begin following this one we call rabbi into places like this? See, for 400 years, the people of God had lived like slaves. If we could fast forward it, it would be like saying for 400 years, they called themselves Christians. They were all Christians. They were all the people of God. But they lived like slaves. They knew no other way to live but as slaves to a slave master. And the slave master was in Egypt. The slave master was their passions, their anger. that controlled them. But with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, God delivered them. And then God begins to invite them. God begins to invite us into a different kind of life, into a different way of living. What's the phrase we've been hearing all through this rabbi series where Jesus says to those who would follow him, Come, follow me. Into a different kind of life. Into a different way of living. And if you follow me, I will bring you into freedom. No longer a slave. Would you bow your heads? Just get quiet here for a minute. I prayed something at the very beginning of the sermon relative to our deepest desire being to follow Jesus as our rabbi. Because we believe that if we follow him, he'll bring us into life in a variety of ways. But our deepest need, if we're going to follow the rabbi, is the capacity to do it. And so to follow the rabbi, we need the rabbi. I just have, I don't always, we don't always do this, but I just have a real strong prompting this morning to invite some of you who've never even begun the journey of identifying Jesus as the one you want to follow, to invite you to begin that today. And I'm going to promise you something. If you begin to follow the rabbi, this one we call Jesus, and begin to learn his way, he will bring you into life. And it doesn't take much more than this. In the quietness of your heart, say, that's what I want. I want to follow this Jesus into life, out of my slavery, into life. just in this quiet place that very transaction can be happening I'm thinking of others of you however as well who have been delivered with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and you've been following the rabbi for a very long time but it could be that in the context of the journey for you you're real tired or discouraged because it just doesn't feel like you're getting very far. And every once in a while, it's just good, in quiet times like this, to have our wanter renewed. So some of you could, just in this quiet time, this quiet space, talk to your rabbi and say, Lord, I've grown tired. the fact is I'm not following you your way but I want my wanter renewed restored fill me anew with your spirit and the capacity to do what I cannot do unless you help me follow you Holy Spirit come Would you stand with me as we close I'm going to I'm going to ask the prayer team to to come and just make yourself available up front here things like this really do stir things up and you may need to pray just talk to somebody about whatever and they'll pray for you so just know about that Father we just I just thank you for the work of your spirit among us things that we could see and things we couldn't see. And we do come to you as those who acknowledge that sometimes we don't follow you very well, but it's really what we want. It really is what we want. So come with your spirit and your power to help us walk these new ways out of our slavery into freedom and the fullness of our destiny as the people of God in the world. And all God's people said, amen.
