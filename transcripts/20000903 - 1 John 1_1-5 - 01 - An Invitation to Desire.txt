I've entitled my talk this morning to prepare us for the table, An Invitation to Desire. To specifically desire, actually, the truths and the realities that we are going to weekly and monthly hear and discover in our study of the first epistle of John that we are beginning today. In fact, I'd like you to open your Bibles to 1 John 1, verse 1. What we're going to do today is just an introduction. It's not even going to be a complete introduction. I'm going to have to complete the introduction next week. But an introduction today and an invitation as well to simply desire the things that you're going to hear. This invitation, this introduction begins with these words, 1 John 1.1. If you don't have your Bibles, the words are on the screen. You can follow with me. John says this, what was from the beginning? What we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld and our hands handled concerning the word of life. And the life was manifested, you guys, and we saw it. We have seen and bear witness now and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us. What we have seen and heard, we proclaim to you also, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. These things we write to you so that our joy may be made complete. And this is the message we have heard from him and announced to you that God is light. And in him, there is no darkness at all. I just want to do two things today. Introduce you to this and invite you to this. Introduction. While there are many themes that we are going to discover these next weeks and months in this epistle of John, there were three that in a rather casual reading of 1 John struck me as being quite significant. The first was this. Theme number one is this. God is life. God is life. Very simple, actually. John opens this letter with an obvious personal eagerness to share with us and with his readers what he has, key word here, what he has experienced himself concerning the word of life. Verse 1, and the life was manifested, he said. The word there, manifested, is kind of a Bible word. It simply means the life was made visible so we could see this life, hear this life, touch it, and know it. And I'm writing this letter, he says in verse 2, to bear witness and proclaim that this eternal life was with the Father. In the first two verses of 1 John, the word life shows up three times. I am not the brightest bulb on the tree, but even I know that when one word shows up three times in two verses, you're dealing with something that is primary. One of the primary things John wants to talk about, obviously from the very beginning, is life. He wants to talk about life. He wants to talk about the word of life. He's going to talk about manifested life, visible life, eternal life. The epistle begins with life. I love that word. I want you to let that word in. He begins with life. He's going to end this epistle talking about life. Chapter 5, verse 11, and the witness is this, that God has given to us an eternal kind of life. And this eternal kind of life is found in his son. He who has the son has this eternal kind of life. who does not have, the Son does not have life. These things I've written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God in order that you may know that you have an eternal kind of life. Second to last verse in the entire epistle says this, verse 20, chapter five, and we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding in order that we might know him who is true. And we are in him who is true, in his Son, Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. This is the true God. It's like eternal life is God. God is life. This may sound weird, but this eternal life that John is talking about is not just a what. It's not a commodity. Do you have eternal life? This commodity, at the very beginning of our understanding of what this life is, and I'm going to talk more about it next week, I want you to know that this eternal life is a who. It's a who before it's a what. That's why in verse 2 of chapter 1, John says that this eternal life was with the Father. The gospel of John says all of this this way. John 1.1, in the beginning was the word. Who is he talking about there? He's talking about Christ. And the word was with God and the word was God. He that is Jesus was in the beginning with God. All things came into being by him and apart from him nothing came into being. In him was what? Life. And the life was the lights of men. But here's the really good news. Verse 14, John 1, and the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory. Get this. That God is life. Now, that's just kind of theological talk. God is life. And we go, yes, I hope I get the right answer on the test. That God is life is good. It's a good thing. That we can see the life, that we can experience the life, that we can know that life is much, much better. need to understand from the beginning of this epistle that John is not writing this letter to simply inform us of this theological truth that God is life so you get the answer right on the test. He is writing these things and is personally excited about sharing them with you so that the things he had seen and heard and handled concerning this eternal kind of life we might see as well. Verse 3 says this, What we have seen and heard proclaim we to you in order that, the reason I'm proclaiming this to you is so that you may have fellowship with us. That word fellowship is key to understanding what I'm trying to say right here. And I'll tell you first what it doesn't mean. The word fellowship doesn't mean get along. In other words, he's not saying here I've written these things, I proclaim these things to you that I have experienced in order that we might get along. That's kind of my understanding of fellowship, but that's not what he means. When I think of fellowship, I think of coffee and donuts in the fellowship hall after the evening service. I grew up in church. Some of you think of the same thing. I grew up in church, and we were always having three things. If you were ever invited to anything, and we wanted people to come, and it would be not really a frisky time, we'd tell them you're going to have fun, food, and what? Fellowship. Now, I'm kind of making fun of that, but that kind of fellowship is good. That kind of fellowship is good. It's sweet. It's the kind of fellowship we have in the gathering place. I mean, we go there and there's smiles and it's easy and we talk and we shake hands and we give each other's pats on the back. And I wouldn't call it intimacy, but it feels good. It's better than getting yelled at. I like it better than that. It's just not what John is speaking of when he uses the word fellowship here. It does not capture the word, the meaning of the word koinonia. Literally what the word fellowship here means is to partner or participate. Big deal. Well, here's the big deal. Let me give you this third verse with that concept inserted. John says, The reason I am proclaiming to you the things that I have personally seen and heard and handled with my hands concerning the eternal life of God that is revealed to us in Christ is so that you can see it, hear it, and handle it as well. I'm telling you this so that we can participate together in experiencing this life of God in Christ. Just want you to know, as we begin this epistle, that one of the major themes of 1 John is that God is life. God is life. He is full of life. He is life. And that through his son, Jesus Christ, the life that he is can be touched by us. It can be experienced. It can be known, heard, entered into. It can be participated in. And now I want to invite you to desire that. To go past knowing that God may be all those things, but to desire being able to touch that life, experience that life, walk in that life, be affected by that life. And even if you've been disappointed before or you're feeling like God wouldn't want you anymore, to just let down your guard and desire that kind of life that you can touch. Not just know about and get the answer right in Sunday school, but know. Second thing we're going to see in 1 John is this, that God is light. Verse 5. God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. All through this epistle, over and over again, John is going to talk about a God who is life and a God who is light. One of the problems, actually, of this study is going to be that John is not a linear thinker. Well, he may be a linear thinker, but he's not a linear writer. What I mean by that, he doesn't build thoughts, and they just, you know, it's gonna be hard to do, actually, verse by verse stuff, because he doesn't do light and then life. He does life, and he's gonna be talking about life all through the epistle, and he's gonna be talking about light all through the epistle. He's loopy. He's not linear. The really good news about this God being light thing is this, that just like the life that God is, is not just some abstract faraway thing. The light that God is, is not some abstract faraway thing either. Just like the life that God is, the light that God is, is something we can see. It's something we can know. In fact, the light that God is, is so down to earth, where I live practical, that John says we can literally walk in it. That's how practical it is. I can walk in the light that God is. That's pretty practical. let me try to illustrate this in a way that brings it closer to home than these words I'm using you ever get up in the middle of the night when it's dark and partly maybe because you're sleeping with somebody you don't want to turn on the light but really when I get up in the middle of the night to do what I do in the middle of the night the reason I don't turn any light on is because I don't want to wake up you know what I'm saying it's like I'm like okay Lord help me just stay a zombie here and, you know, do anything and then go back to bed. And in the middle of the night, I can't see anything. The lights are out. My eyes are closed. And I jam my foot against the chair. My wife moved. Anyway, I hate that. Or my kids. I love my kids. They leave a toy right there, right in the middle. And I didn't see it. The fact is this. You can really get hurt if you don't have light. You could run into a wall if you don't have light. You didn't even know it was there. You weren't trying to run into a wall. You weren't trying to ruin your life. You didn't see the wall. You could fall off a cliff if you didn't have light. You could step in a hole. You could drive into a lake if you don't have light. Interesting thing, last night, 11-ish o'clock, right around there, Bonnie and I were winding down big time. I'm 1030. I'm usually done. For some reason, you know, I just had this enormous amount of energy, and I was still awake at 11. I'm an old guy. about 11 15 the phone rings and all right if the phone rings at 11 30 we have rules so it's like don't call after 10 30 have to tell your friends so if the phone rings after 11 in our house you have a jolt something's going on it's a collect call from our son a collect call from our son now i'm now i'm awake there was a horrible storm last night remember that no you don't remember that do you most of you were up with this storm and and he was out and he was trying to make his way home, and over the phone, we hear the message that he ran into a puddle. He was calling in a puddle. I ran into a puddle, and the car is stalled. The car is stalled. I'm exhausted. I got to preach tomorrow. The car is stalled. Where are you? Not far away. What do you want me to do? Let me think, and so I'm trying to figure out what to do, and it finally becomes apparent I got to come and get you. I wasn't feeling a lot of sympathy yet at this point. I'm thinking, you know, I love my kid, but I'm just thinking, you hit a puddle. He's calling it a puddle. You hit a puddle. Did you think, I didn't, I'm on my way. Did you think it was fun? Did you see the puddle and go for it? Did you like the splash? And what? What's going on? I'm not feeling a lot of sympathy. Well, I get to where he is, and quite frankly, the rain had stopped by the time we got there, and there was some incredible flooding last night. You probably know that. Some of you ran into it. But I didn't run into any of it as I come, but I turn around this. It's on a residential street, and I see a car. It wasn't ours, but a car right in the middle of this puddle. It was absolutely flooded. It was up to the windows, and our car was just on the other side of it. And I started feeling sympathy now. I started feeling sympathy for him, feeling a little bad for kind of wondering if he was being irresponsible. But he had driven into this thing, and it was just totally flooded and pushed it out, so I was kind of proud of him for doing that. And I started a little more sympathetic. I asked him, were you freaking out on this thing? Were you really scared? He goes, no, it was cool. My sympathy went away. you think it was cool this was cool yeah man i hit the puddle and a and it's splashing all over and then and then started to float it started to float did that scare you no no that was cool too didn't it scare you at all it was dark and black and well yeah he said he said yeah it scared me when i opened the door and the water all rushed in on me then it freaked me out and then i was i I was back to sympathy. And after I heard the whole story, it became very apparent that he could not see where he was going. He did not have enough light. Light's a very good thing. Boy, if God really is light, maybe I don't have to stub my toe. Maybe I don't have to run into puddles. Maybe I could see him first. Sometimes there's light all around us, and it's not that there's no light, it's that our eyes are closed. Our eyes are closed, but we might even be blind. And you can imagine, I'm going to unpack this far more in weeks to come, but where that kind of analogy brings us, some of us are hearing truth all the time, and our eyes are closed, and so you might as well be in the dark. And you keep running into walls and falling off cliffs and stepping into holes and running into puddles even though there's light, but you've got your eyes closed, and you can't figure out why your life is in such a disarray. Your eyes are closed. You know, when I was a little kid, I used to sleepwalk. My mom told me that, and these stories become kind of legendary in your home, but she used to find me on a fairly regular basis sleepwalking, and I'd go to the top of the stairs and just stand there. And she said this a little more bluntly than I'm going to tell it to you, but what she said to me was this. She goes, Dave, when you would sleepwalk and you'd end up at the top of the stairs, I would find you there, and what would be obvious is that by what you were doing at the top of the stairs, it was clear that you thought you were in the bathroom. Right on off the top of the stairs. You know, my poor mom. I mean, can you imagine my mom with me? If you knew my two brothers, you'd even feel more pity for her. But part of the deal, somebody back there knows my brothers. Part of the deal with my mom and the horror of getting me was that she grew up with sisters and then the first two children she had were daughters and they just acted like normal human beings. And then she had me. I was the first one. My dad wasn't much help with things like sleepwalking and the thing off the top of the stairs. He would tell her, she would say, Dad, honey, it was dad to me, not to her. Bill, is this normal? Dave, is this normal? And he goes, normal? It's primal. I mean, honey, Marion, this is wolf pack stuff. He's part of the wolf pack. He's marking off, he's marking off his territory. Those stairs, they're his, they're his stairs. That scared him because it made her wonder what else he wanted. What else is he going to want here? Goofy story. The truth is this. Even though I am pretty goofy and was at that age, believe me, I would have never done that in the light. I would have never done that if my eyes were open. See, the good news about this verse that God is light is this, that if God really is light, then I don't have to stub my toe. If God really is light, then I don't have to run into walls or fall off cliffs. I can avoid enormous amounts of pain because God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all, and he, by his amazing grace and partnership with me in doing my life, he will shine a light on the dangerous places. He will show me where the snakes are, where the rocks are, and the holes and the turns in the road are. And if you and I walk in the light, he will bring you and I to places and lead us in directions where we can really, really live. I am writing you these things, chapter 1, verse 4, in order that our joy may be full. Are you getting excited about 1 John? I'm really excited about this epistle. The good news that God is light is that you don't stub your toe, fall off cliffs. You don't have to learn everything the hard way. You can if you want, but you don't have to because God is light. And he can shed some light on where to put your feet and where not to put your feet. Let me ask you a question. Does walking in the light the way I'm describing it sound appealing at all to you? you know the thought of maybe avoiding some incredible amounts of pain does that sound at all appealing to you here's my invitation in the middle of this introduction to invite you to desire I'm not sure I know what this light is you don't need to understand this we're going to unpack this for weeks I invite you to desire this kind of light this kind of life third theme we're going to see is this theme that God is love chapter 4 verse 8 God is love and just like the life and light that God is the love that God is is touchable it's knowable it's one of the themes of 1 John it's accessible you can see it feel it touch it experience it chapter 1 verse 2 John is speaking of the life of God that he is and he says that the life that God is was manifested again made visible. Well, 1 John 4, 9 says, not only was the life made visible, but the love of God was made visible as well. 1 John 4, 9, by this the love of God was manifested. That God has sent his only son into the world that we might through him live. In this is love. Not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his son. And he sent his son so we could come to life. so we could walk in light, so we could experience authentically love. Chapter 3, verse 1, See how great a love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we might be called the children of God. And such we are. Back to chapter 1. John is saying in this introduction, this, and it's really kind of an audacious thing. I know about this life. I know about this light, and I know about this love. And the reason I know about it is not just because I know the facts and can get them right on a test, but I have seen this life. I have handled it with my hands. I have experienced it in my everyday existence, and I have seen this light, and I know what it feels like to walk in it. I know what it feels like to not walk in it. And I know this love. It's touched my insides. and the reason I am proclaiming what I have seen and heard and experienced about this life and light and love is so you can see it too experience it and walk in it too well all of that's the introduction here's the invitation simply to desire I can't think of a better place to start our studying 1 John than to even ask God for desire. If you're struggling with even whether you want to ask God for the kind of desire that would come to God and I want that kind of life. To desire this kind of light and love. To be able to touch it. Not just know about it but to taste it and even if you already know at this level to know more. To touch it more significantly. To be able to see it and hear it and walk in it. And the protest might rise again but I don't understand it. You don't have to understand it. Not yet. All I want you to wonder about today and all I want to invite you to today is to desire it and to bring that desire to the table as we come to the table. The table which eternally speaks to us this truth that he is life, that he is the light, that he is love, that he is bread and he is wine and even as we take, handle with our hands the bread and the cup. The message of the bread and of the cup, among other things, is this, that you can taste this life and you can touch this life. And it can touch you. It is accessible. It is knowable. You can hear it. You can know it. You can walk in it. What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld in our hands handled concerning the word about this eternal kind of life and the eternal kind of life was manifested. And we have seen and bear witness and proclaim to you the eternal kind of life which was with the Father and was manifested to us. What we have seen, what we have heard, we proclaim now to you that you also may partner with us in experiencing, in tasting this life. I invite you to desire that and to bring your desire to the table. Let's pray as we go to the table. Father, I pray that as we lift up your name in worship, as we come to the table and handle with our hands the bread that speaks to living bread and handle with our hands the cup that speaks of living life and your death and your provision for us for life. And as we worship and go to prayer, that your life would be released, your light would be seen, your love would be experienced. Do this among us in Jesus' name, amen.
