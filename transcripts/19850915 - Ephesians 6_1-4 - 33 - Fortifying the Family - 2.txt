And I've got to share something before I start. What were those words, I don't care if your head's on your pews, parking lot, programs always new. I don't care about those things either. The only thing I care about. And I've got to share something before I start. what were those words I don't care if your head's on your pews, parking lot, programs always new I don't care about those things either the only thing I care about is that what happens here God does it and not me and not you and there are times when I feel spiritually like a zombie and you know what I do when I feel like that? I try real hard not to and I'm trying real hard not to this morning and this is so important about the family these next few weeks that we cannot afford to go through emotions this morning. And I don't know where you're at. It doesn't matter. I know where I'm at. And I want you to pray for me. That the Spirit would touch me even as I begin. Because I'm going to do it. But I so want us to hear Him. And I so feel like I'm going to be married to this stupid text. Because when I don't feel real good, I try real hard and then God can't say what he wants to. As I pray, would you pray for me? Just, I'm so glad we're a family here. Because I can tell you where I'm at. I can't do this ever by myself. Yeah, you need the Lord. No, I need you too. be with me as we start okay let's pray Lord I'm not always there and Father in my weakness this morning speak to our families real loud amen the text is Ephesians 6 verses 1 through 4 children obey your parents and the Lord for it's right honor your father and mother which is the first commandment with a promise that it may be well with you and that you may live long in the earth and fathers don't provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord Deuteronomy 6 verses 6 through 8 says this and these words which I have commanded you today what were those words that you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. These words which I have commanded you this day shall be on your heart, people of Israel, people of God. And what do I want you to do with them? I want you to take those words and stand in the pulpits and preach them. Well, that was one thing he wanted them to do, but that wasn't the priority instruction. The priority instruction was this. Take those words that I have commanded you and teach them diligently to your sons and your daughters. and talk of them when you sit down in your house and when you stand up and when you walk in the way and when you lie down and when you rise up and bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead and you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on the gates. In other words, get it all over everything. The point is this, that we've been discussing the last couple of weeks and on into the next couple of weeks, is that God's priority plan in passing on his truth from one generation to the next is not through the school, is not through the church only, it is not through the prophets and the pastors only. The priority plan is through the parents, from the parents to the children. From the very beginning, God has ordained the family as the agency through which he would pass on that legacy of love, that righteous seed. And we talked just a couple of weeks ago. We were interrupted by two things, two Sundays. But a couple of weeks ago, we talked about the fact that if, in fact, that is God's ordained plan to pass on the righteous seed, then there is one thing we can be absolutely sure of, and that is this, that Satan's going to do everything in his power to disrupt it. to keep that seed from being passed on, to stop it, to break up the family, to maybe keep us together physically, but to keep us strangers in the same house. And he is doing that. He is doing it well. And ladies and gentlemen, he is doing it here among us. The biggest thing I wanted to impress upon us last week was the fact that we as believers are not immune. I believe, honestly, that one of the greatest challenges that we face as a church is that we commit ourselves to the paramount task in God's economy of the home. I do not believe that the church, no matter what we do, can be a substitute for the home. But you know what else? I don't believe that the church is detached either. I don't believe that we can kind of, in a reversal sort of way, abdicate our responsibility as the body of Christ to be providing examples to our families as how they ought to be. In fact, as I'm going through this study, and I think you're going to wake up to this yourself and become alive to it yourself, that I can't hardly separate the two. Where is the responsibility of the body of Christ to make the home strong and the home having the responsibility to make the body of Christ strong, where does all that end? I can't see them being separated. The church's function is to equip the parents to do the job, but more than that, the body of Christ needs to be doing a lot more than what I'm doing right now. We need to be doing a lot more than standing in our pulpits and telling principles, giving instructions. this church needs to be a place where one we do hear the truth of God's word we do hear the good news proclaimed we do receive principles and instructions but we need to be more and more a place where people can come and experience and see living illustrations of healthy families and healthy relationships people who know how to love people who know how to speak the truth in love people who know how to forgive and accept without any strings have you ever asked yourself what will I be remembered for have you ever asked yourself that question sometimes it's a pretty scary question to ask because you wonder if anybody's going to remember anything but you know what you will be remembered for something maybe you'll be remembered for the lady who wore the silly hat maybe you'll be remembered for the fact that you were a grouch maybe you'll be remembered for the fact that you played the piano Or maybe you'll be remembered for the fact that you were the guy who stood in front of everybody and yelled real loud. And maybe you'll be remembered for the fact that you just loved and people wanted to be around you. Didn't know why, just liked being around you. And maybe you'll be remembered because people didn't want to be around you. But you will be remembered for something. You will have an impact on someone somehow. And one of the things I want to impress on us as I begin to move into this text and this whole series is I've been concerned. What about the people in our church who don't have families? And you're all part of a family, obviously, but you don't have kids. And maybe you can't have kids. And maybe you're single. And maybe those things really hurt you. And I'm talking about the family and you're going, oh, my goodness, this is for someone else. No, it isn't. You know why? Because we're a family. And that cannot be rhetoric. I just go nuts when I get little pictures in my mind of our kids just bouncing around in a foyer out there after church. We are blessed with children here. And they are our children. And every one of us have the opportunity to leave a thumbprint on those kids. This is important. Going back to the text, it all starts in verse 21. It starts in verse 18, being filled with the Spirit. Remember the result of the Spirit-filled life? It said, all my relationships are healed. All my relationships are put back together. I'm right with God. I'm right with myself. I'm right with other people. The result of being right with other people is I start serving other people. I am subject to other people in the fear of Christ. And then Paul, in verse 21, after saying that, be subject to one another in the fear of Christ, begins to give illustrations. Be subject one to another in the fear of Christ. That's body. That's church. That's what we do when we're here. We subject ourselves to one another here. And that's where we learn how to have relationships. This is one place right here. And then it begins to talk about the family. And it gives illustrations. Wives, do it to your husbands. Husbands, do it to your wives. Children, do it to your parents. Parents, do it to your children. Employees, do it to your employers. Employers, do it to your employees. Submit one to another. Body is the umbrella. That verse 21 is the umbrella under which everything else is flowing. He's talking about the church. Subject one to another. Under that comes the family. I want you to be functioning in the family the same way you need to be functioning in the body. Again, I'm seeing parallels all the time between the family and the body. The body being a family and not being able to separate the two at all. seeing them put together. I thank God that we are beginning to awaken to this dynamic in the church and in our families. You know, one of the things that's very interesting to me, and I think as leadership we need to have a very attentive ear to this kind of thing, that when we put electives out on the board, and there's all these classes that are very, very good, and there's one class that's on the family, you know how long it took that one to fill up? It was filled up before I even announced it. Why? Because I think we have a thirsting in our hearts to find out what it means to talk to my kids, to relate to my wife. Why? Because some of us don't know how to do it. Satan is assaulting. The core of what God came here to heal, and he came here to heal relationships with him, with me, with you. and Satan's assaulting that. And at the core of the most important relationships I'm ever going to have in my whole life is the relationships I have with my mom and dad and with my children and with my children's children. Let's look at the text. Children, obey your parents in the Lord. Why? Because it's right. So there. So there, yeah. So do it. So, honor your father and mother. And that statement right there is so important that it was the first commandment that was ever given with a promise. Obey your parents. Why? Because it's the righteous thing. Honor your parents. And when we're dealing with honoring of the parents, the father and the mother, we are dealing more now, we are dealing with more than just an action. We're dealing with an activity, an attitude. I'm sorry. We're dealing with an attitude. Honor your father and mother. It's the story of the little kid who was sitting in the car. You remember that? And he was standing up, and Dad says, Johnny, I'd like you to sit down in the car. It's dangerous. And he goes, no. Johnny, I'm not asking you anymore. I want you to sit down in the car. It's dangerous. He goes, no, I don't want to. I want to stand up. Johnny, Johnny. I heard Pastor's talk last week, so I'm not going to be violent. Johnny, if you don't sit down real fast, I'm going to knock you from here to next week. Okay? Johnny sits down. Daddy sits down, and then he says, I want you to know, Daddy, that I'm sitting down on the outside, but I'm standing up on the inside. It has to do with an attitude, honoring your father and mother. But that silly illustration made you laugh, but it really isn't very deep. Because honoring our father and mother is more than liking what they make me do. You know what? My father and mother asked me to do a lot of things I didn't like, and it didn't even matter. And they even, you know, the joy of our family was they even gave us the freedom not to like it. Take out the garbage. I don't want it. I know you don't want it. I don't want it either. That's why I'm asking you. You don't have to like it, Dave. There's some things we all have to do. And in honoring my mother and father, I don't like to take out the garbage. But I did what they said. But honoring my mother and father is even bigger than that. you know how I honor my father and mother this began to dawn on me when I began to grow a little bit and my dad took me aside after I was graduating from college and he pulled out his bible and he opened it to first john and he says I want you to know something boy a father has no greater joy than this than to know his children are walking in truth and as I stand here before you as one who loves Jesus and is attempting to give over more and more control of my life to him you know what that does? that honors my mother and father my life honors them I don't know how many churches have this kind of situation in their churches anymore and because of our society being so immobile you don't see this very much but we have generation after generation in our church right now. I look over and I see Hennessy's and I see their kids growing here with their kids. I see Sutton's and I see their kids here growing with their kids. I see Jacob's. They're not here, but I see their kids here. They're in Florida. And I want you to know that their kids being here, loving the Lord, growing in Him, just them sitting there honors their parents. No, it doesn't. Not just sitting there, being who they are, loving the Lord, growing in Him, It honors their parents' honor, your father and your mother. Steph Stone and Paul Stone, George Santowski and Debbie Santowski related to the Suttons. That honors their lives' honor, Howie and Margaret. Now, we know that Howie didn't have very much to do with it, but every chance I get, I'm going to burn them. But I want you to know something, young people, and this is very important before we move on to the parents, That just like the wife has a responsibility to be submitting to the husband, and the husband has a responsibility to be submitting and serving that wife. And it didn't matter whether the wife, husbands, love your wives. How has Christ loved the church? What did that mean? He laid down his life, and it wasn't because we deserved it. And you don't serve your wife because it's easy. The responsibility is laid at your feet, and children, the same thing goes for you. honor your parents obey your parents if they're cool if they let you do what you want it doesn't say that kids and another thing i want you to know and when that word their children is not just speaking of little toddlers it's speaking of adolescents it's speaking of people who are 18 19 years old there is a responsibility laid at the feet of every individual in that family unit, to be the person God wants them to be, to make that family strong. Proverbs 30, verse 11, talks about what happens when that gets upset. And I need to read it because it's important. It says this, Proverbs 30, verse 11, there is a generation, there is a kind of man, there is a generation who curses his father and does not bless his mother. There is a kind, there is a generation who is pure in his own eye. yet not washed from his own sin. There is a generation, oh, how lofty are his eyes and his eyelids are raised in arrogance. Oh, they roll their eyes. Oh, brother, the old man, the old lady. Oh, man, they're so stupid, I can't believe it. There is a generation whose teeth are like swords and his jaw teeth like knives to devour the afflicted from the earth and the needy. from among men, a smart mouth. A mouth in the family that just tears at the fiber and the love. And parents do it too. Verse 15, real graphic. The leech has two daughters. And you know what they're named? Give, give. That's also what they say. Give, give, give. You know what a leech is? You know what a leech is. You get them on your feet when you go swimming. There's a horse leech and it has two teeth and it goes into the horse and all it does is say, give, give, give. And one thing that a horse leech never says is enough. It's never satisfied. It's never satisfied. Verse 17 says this, the eye that mocks a father and scorns a mother, the ravens of the valley will pick it out and young eagles will eat it. Why do I say that? Why does that say that? Because this is serious. That's why. Because God has ordained the family to be the structure within in which healthy people will be growing. But I have a theory on this, and that is this. That that cycle of developing horse leeches who are saying nothing but give, give, give started somewhere. And I believe it starts with the parents. And I believe that before we can even talk about ministering to our children, we need to minister to the parents and begin to build into us the kinds of values and the kinds of forgiveness and acceptance of myself before God so that I have something at all to give to my children. Two weeks ago we introduced this, and we talked about one of the greatest sources of frustration. It says, provoke not your children to frustration or hostility. And one of the greatest sources of frustration or hostility for children is when parents make themselves inaccessible to their children by either not being there physically, by being there physically possibly, and not listening to what they're saying, by being so wrapped up in my own concerns, and my own career, and my own little things at church even, that I'm never there to see what they're doing, to see what they need, to see what they're saying to me, to understand it. Psalm 127, how vain it is for you to rise up early and go to bed late and never be with your family. That's vain. It's all vanity. Useless. The number one cause of hostility was that sense of being abandoned. And all it had to do was be a perception that the kids, both parents, could be there, but if those children have a sense that they have been abandoned, it produces hostility. Today, what I want to do for us as we begin this again is give you a bit of a skeleton, an outline on which we can kind of throw the meat. I'm going to be giving you for the next couple of weeks. The first instrument, the first, I'm sorry, the first instruction that we get in verse 4, dealing with parents, is a negative instruction. Dealt with it a little bit last week. Don't frustrate your kids. Parents, don't provoke your children. In this case, parents, the source of their hostility very clearly is you. Okay? Don't provoke your children to anger. The second dimension we're going to talk about, and this is what we're going to get into just a little bit today, is a positive. There's a negative and a positive. The positive is this. Don't frustrate, negative, positive. Bring them up. How do I bring them up? One, in the discipline, my translation renders, in the discipline, literally meaning the nurture or the instruction, point two, which means discipline, the nurture and admonition of the Lord. the problem i have in preaching this is very simple it's that every one of these things are going to overlap every one of these things are going to flow into the next there's no way in which i can say okay i'm going to talk about how we frustrate our kids then i'm going to talk about the positive sense and we're going to go on to to how we bring them up and we're not going to be talking about the negative anymore i'm going to be talking about all of them at the same time because they're all interrelated and we need to understand that as we go let's look at the positive bring them up it doesn't say beat them down it says bring them up what does that mean well i've been i went to study this week and i was a little bit frustrated i go to the greek and the greek wasn't very helpful literally all it means is this to rear them up to train them up to nourish them what do you do when you're not getting a whole lot out of the greek and usually it paints these wonderful pictures for you. Nothing's happening. Next step we do if we were going into a Bible study is I would look for cross-references, and I would try to find out how that same word might be used in a different context, and it would broaden my understanding. Right in the margin of my New American Standard Bible is several texts, and one of them that helped me considerably was Proverbs 22.6. Same word. It's the synonym of the Greek word in the Hebrew. It means to train up, and you know the verse very, very well. Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it. We alluded to this just a little bit a couple of weeks ago. What does it mean, then, to train up a child in the way he should go? That's very easy. You see, when I think of training up a child, what I think of is what I do with my dog or with a horse. I train them up. I teach them what is good, I teach them what is bad. I beat out of them what is bad, and I encourage what is good. I train them up, like a horse. You know, you take a horse, what I want to do is train them to go right, train them to go left, train them to go straight, train them to stop, train them to go. Wonderful. Train them. Behaviors. It's great. It works with horses, and it works with dogs, and it works with kids. I can get my kids to behave in a certain way. I can control their behavior and so what I do is I train them to act in certain ways. And I even want them to be spiritual and I want them to love the Lord. So I train them to go to Sunday school and I train them to learn their Bible verses and I tell them, you will go and you will enjoy. and I say mommy but it's boring it's boring to me too that doesn't matter we go and we train them when to talk and we train them when to not and we train them when to laugh and we train them when to not and we beat out of them all the behaviors that we don't like and we encourage all the ones we do and after we've done that training of behaviors and get them to turn right when I say right and left when I say left and straight and stop and all those things and they're obedient. We actually believe that I have trained that child up in the way he should go because I've got his behavior just as true. It's real practical and this is not canon so I'm just I'm just giving you this out of my experiences. One, I've seen too many kids who were raised in families like that. It was right, left. It was all training that once they got away from the trainer they never had the resources to make deep legitimate healthy kinds of decisions on their own and they were easy prey for anybody else who came along and says no don't turn right turn left and they did the most graphic example of this I have in my life are two guys who grew up in the church I grew up in when I was a little kid who were about five years older than me and they did it all right yes sir turn right turn left It was like that. It was unbelievable. And they were the guys I was supposed to be like. And I was always, you know. Super athletes, just on TV. One of the guys won the Triple Crown in the state of Illinois for gymnastics, and he sung a song about Jesus. Oh, how could you have better Christians? You couldn't have. They were great, super, trained, perfect. One of them went to West Point. The other one to Penn State. Both of them were trying out for the Olympics and had injuries and didn't make it. Otherwise, they were supposed to be shoe-ins. one year at the university they didn't want to go to church anymore another year at the university both of them were into eastern mysticism didn't give a rip about the Lord to this day can't keep a job something's missing something's missing the other reason I have problems with that kind of mentality is that it just isn't what the verse means it isn't training them up turn right, turn left, go right the Hebrew word there is derik it's from a verb which means palate or it means the roof of the mouth and what it does that word was used to describe the action of a midwife who would who would be there when a baby was born and they would take that little baby in their arms and they would stick their finger in a in a juice of grapes or dates or something like that and take the baby and rub the palate of the mouth and you know what that did that got the baby to start sucking they needed to do that they needed to be disciplined trained, if you will, to do that, to live. But you know what that finger going into the juice and into the mouth did for that child? Get this, it's crucial. It created a taste in that child for the thing he needed to do. It created in that child a taste. It created in that child a desire. Parents, train up your children. Bring up your children. What does that mean? It means this, parents create in them a thirst for what? Create in them a thirst for what? The godly thing, the right thing. You know what, now we're ready to talk about discipline. You know, I can hear your head spinning. He doesn't think discipline's important. I think discipline's essential. But now I'm ready to talk about discipline. We're talking about parents not provoking their children to wrath. Got it? Other than a sense of abandonment, I believe that one of the greatest sources of frustration for a child is thinking about outlawing parents from spanking their children. And it's designed very nobly to try to curtail problems of abuse. That'll never do it. People are still going to abuse their children. We need to get something deeper with that problem. The greatest frustration that children have in receiving discipline from their parents is that too often parents are demanding of their children things that they are not seeing consistently in their parents' lives. Demanding of my children to act in a certain way that I'm not consistently acting in. That's frustrating. You ever talk to your kid this way? They come and sass you, you go, don't you talk to me that way. I want them to act in a way that I'm not willing to act. That's frustrating. That produces anger. Let me talk to you Sunday school teachers who are teaching my children and some of our other people's children. You'll have an opportunity to leave a thumbprint on my kid's life, and I thank God for it. But we don't simply leave, we don't train our children, train them up, produce a taste in them by pouring information into our kids. So they know the verse, and they know the right answer, and they say, you know, love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. Good kid. What? Creating them a taste. Teacher comes out of a class and says, yeah, now they know the first and great commandment. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. I'll tell you what. Billy was fooling around. I drilled him. He knows it now. Now, that's kind of excess, isn't it? I'm really overdoing it. The problem is this. The kids don't learn what they hear. they learn what they see. They can recite back to you what they hear, but that doesn't mean they learn it. That doesn't mean they have been trained in it. Think on this. If I am dealing with a child, if I am dealing even with a teenager, if I am dealing with my wife, or dealing with a friend, and there is something that I want them to be cultivating in their lives, and I am not living it, Let's say in our relationship, pastor to congregation, and I think this is the right thing to do. This is the righteous thing to do. And I talk about love, and I don't love. You know the only method I'm ever going to have in terms of a tool to use on you to get you to love is guilt. That's the only one I'll have. And I'll just dump on you. You better love each other. But if I'm there, if I'm really there, if I'm living that and if my dad is living that instruction you know what it is? It isn't guilt anymore then it is instruction. Then the words that come out son I want you to love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul and mind and you know what that means? Watch me. Can you say that? Hostility frustration comes in demanding of our kids things that we're not willing to do ourselves. let me make this real graphic and it's one that I can speak of from experience because there was something healthy in our family about this one of the greatest fears I think parents have and I have, I got little kids, five years old my oldest one, you know what I already think about and so I know you do, is I worry about who they're going to marry, I think is she going to find a man of God, you know, is she going to is she going to have a happy home it's important to me premarital sex, we hear it on radio and TV all the time that young girls are getting pregnant 12, 11, 9 years old. How can I protect my child from that? How can I instruct her and our little Caleb in a way that will protect him from that so that in a marriage he will see the value and fulfillment that God promised? I can tell him. Marriage is fulfilling. Marriage is good. Marriage is wonderful. Okay? But I want to tell you something. If my marriage isn't fulfilling and wonderful and good and rich and I don't love my wife and they don't see that. It's going to be a hard product to sell. And all I'll have in dealing with that kid to try to curb his impulses is a guilt. I just dump as much as I can on him to keep him in line until he gets married. I go, whew! Problem is I haven't given him any resources to have a happy relationship in that marriage even. one of the greatest heritages I think I was given was a mom and a dad who loved each other and we knew it and I don't want to be crude or anything but even the sexual relationship they had was something we knew about you know what it did for me it gave me a thirst for that in my marriage and it gave me a thirst to wait because I believed it create a thirst do you? do you create a thirst in your kids? you know what, all this goes back to the spiritual life, doesn't it? it all goes back to that it's about me as a parent, not trying real hard to be a good parent, it's about me as a parent being filled with the spirit controlled by the spirit, and then passing on that heritage, yes instruct, yes we give instruction, but the words again the words I give don't connect with my children if they don't see it in my life. And if they do connect and they do understand my words and they see the discrepancy, they're going to hate it. Parents, teachers, pastors, don't expect their children to keep a civil tongue to me when I don't to them. To handle their anger when I don't. To love God when I don't. To be growing when I'm not. to be loving when I'm not. Creating them a thirst. Train them up and then channel them. Be being continually filled with the Spirit so they can see and then instruct and then channel. When I channel my kids, what direction should I send them in? That's easy. Train them up in the way that they should go. What is the way that they should go? Well, I know that. I know the way they should go. I know the way my children should go. They should go in the way I want them to go. I know just exactly what my son's going to be. I know just exactly what my daughter's going to be. I know just exactly what they like and what they don't like more than they do. Parents, provoke not your children to hostility. So with that mentality, we drive our kids, believing that when he is old, and I've driven into him what I want him to be, believing that when he is old, will not depart from it. And we have a whole bunch of disillusioned parents wondering why our kids aren't being what we wanted them to be. And they had all the potential and all the ability. See, I got a problem with that too. Again, the problem is it doesn't work. And again, the text doesn't say that. It isn't about training the child in the way I think it should go. Literally, and again, you can just use your New American Standard Version. Proverbs 22.6, right in the margin, it says, according to his own way. Lit means literally. According to his own way. It means this. Train up a child, give him a thirst for what? For his own way. In keeping with his own way. Train up a child in cooperation with his own way. His own bent. His own characteristic. I want you to think about, look at this word way for a minute. According to his own way. In order to kind of broaden our view of that a little bit, Proverbs 30, 19 says this. The word way is used four times. It says this. Four things are too wonderful for me to comprehend. Consider first the way of an eagle in the sky. Consider second the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship upon a sea, and the way of a man with his maiden. You know what I did? I did that this week in my office, and I considered the way of an eagle. I thought, they go straight, they go left, they go right, they go up, they go down, that's the way of an eagle. You know what, I didn't consider at all the way of an eagle because when I'm sitting in my office, the awe of what that song of Solomon felt when he wrote those words wasn't being captured by me at all. Why? I wasn't taking any time to consider the way of an eagle at all. I need to put myself, and I want you to do it for a minute. Would you consider that? Pick one. The way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship on a sea, the way of a man with his maid. Consider it. Think on it. I got to put myself out in a canoe somewhere in the boundary waters looking at an eagle considering the way of an eagle. I never do that. Why? I never take the time. Do you? You know what happens when I do? Have you ever been just isolated all by yourself and all of a sudden you just you find yourself staring at something? a chipmunk, a bird, a gopher, another person. You just go, wow. Wow. Next question. Do you ever do that with your kids? Have you ever considered the way of your kids? Do you know his way? Do you know his bent? Do you know his characteristic? Train up a child according to his own way. This is so practical, it just jumps out at us, doesn't it? Every child comes into this world and comes into our families with unique and special sets of bents and characteristics. And every single child we have ever had is different. and you know that in your families, and I know that in mine. We had Drea. I like what Gaither says. He had this little joke in his thing where he talked about two little kids, and they were ready to write a book about having kids. And then they had Benjamin, you know. Oh, forget it. We had Erica. And I want to tell you something. I spent two years of her life trying to change her bent. And one day I had to look at her bent, and I had to look at her characteristics and say, that's who she is. That's how God made her. And my job as a parent is to discover who that kid is and train them up and encourage them in the way they are. One of our kids is creative. Again, think of this as a body. If you don't have kids of your own, the little kids running around our Sunday school area, one of them is creative, one of them isn't, one of them is pragmatic, one of them says it's the thought that counts, one of them is loud and the other one is soft, one of them is outgoing, the other one's real inward. and you know what we do we have and I bet you I could even go through those características and in Your mind you're checking off that's a good one that'S a bad one that'S a good one that'S a bad one it'S good to be soft it'S not good to be loud it'S Not Good to be aggressive but It Isn'T Good to be passive and so You Know what We Do even In Our Minds Right Now We're Changing Them God Made One Of Them Creative and God Made One Of Them Pragmatic and He Made One Of Them Loud and God made one of them soft and God made one of them aggressive and God made one of them passive. And it's okay. Kids are different. You know, one of the things that I just get a kick out of and makes this whole series so timely is all the ladies in our church who are having babies. right now. You can put your hands right there right now and just feel that life. Psalm 139. You know what Psalm 139 says to you parents? Of little ones who are being born, it says, in the womb, God was forming them. And that proverb, that Psalm, I got to turn to it. I don't want to lose it. I'll lose the punch if I don't. He says this, For thou didst form my inward parts and didst weave me in my mother's womb. I will give thanks to thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are thy works and my soul knows it well. Here's somebody who's free. They know who they are. I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Somebody said to me when I was a kid, it's okay to be who you are. And I'm discovering it. But right now, in those little wombs of yours, God is forming a child. and I dare say every one of you moms and you dads are thinking in your mind and you have little dreams and you have ideas and pictures of what you want them to be and what you want them to look like and what you want them to act like and the kind of career and the husband and the wife and all that stuff that's great but when they're born blow it up our task is not to get my kids to fit into my dream. Our task as parents is to learn from them their way, their bent, their characteristic, and train them up in it. And I believe that when we don't do that, and we don't take the time to find out who they are and what their bent is and what their characteristic is, we kill their uniqueness. We stifle. They're not going to be able to say, I am fearfully and wonderfully made because they were never taught to discover who they were. Their sense of well-being is always dependent on their ability to be like the masses, to fit in and be like Susie. And when they just aren't bent like Susie, they get a lot of messages about themselves that it just isn't okay to not be bent like Susie. And then we wonder why when we're adults we have churches full of people who don't know what their gifts are and I talk to them and they say I just don't know my gift I don't know my gift, you know why? I think one of the reasons, many but one of the reasons I believe is that when we're kids we're not taught that we're special and that we're unique and that you don't have to be like Susie, you'd be like you point number one in training up a child I end with this be about the business be about the task of knowing who they are. Be about the task of knowing who they are. You dads, you have your little boy, Johnny's going to be a football player. By the time they're too much, they've got a football on their stomach, you know. Tape it to them if they drop it. Caleb does have good hands. He's going to be a football player. You know, there's a problem, though, in him wanting to be a football player. He doesn't want to be a football player. he hates it and so i say to him yeah i hated it do it first it's good for you teach your discipline dad what's his bent what's his bent what's his characteristic he may not be a football player he may be mechanical he may be artsy he may be into the arts he may be a reader you know what you need to do is tell him it's okay encourage him in that way train him up in that way and give him freedom to be who he is and discover what god wants him to do not you to do i think we do it to people going into the ministry we were talking about that in our sunday school class just a while ago we have this idea in the evangelical community that if you reach a certain level of commitment automatically you go into you automatically you go to seminary i mean it's the committed people who go the uncommitted people or the marginally committed people are good and nice, but they stay home. And everybody's got to be the same, and everybody's got to do it the same, and everybody's got to say it the same, and some of you just aren't bent that way. And the result is you don't feel good, and you never feel joy, and you never serve, because you don't have anything to give. But you do. You just need to discover it. let me ask you a question in your family when did you start feeling the seeds of rebellion in you can you think on that for a minute when did you start first feeling the seeds of rebellion in you you know when it was for me i'm glad it didn't last a long time but it started in me when i really began to feel like my parents didn't know me. And basically the reason I was there to fulfill their needs, to fulfill their desires, to be who they wanted me to be, and I was getting real frustrated somewhere around 16 or 17 because I just couldn't be that. Train up a child in his own way. My job, my wife's job with our little Erica and our little Drea and our little Caleb and now our little Methuselah. You didn't know we were going to name her that, did you? No. You know what our job is? It's to watch the signs. It's to see the ways. It's to know that child. Again, I think of my little Erica. To discover who that kid is. I think of my Caleb. He can't even talk. Discover who that kid is and then give it back to him and encourage him and move him in that direction. Thank you.
