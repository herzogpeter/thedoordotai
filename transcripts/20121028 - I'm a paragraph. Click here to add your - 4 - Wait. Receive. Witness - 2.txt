Hey everybody, my name is Steve. I'm the Associate Senior Pastor here at Open Door. And as we come to God's Word, here's a picture that could be helpful. My five-and-a-half-year-old, Isaac, in the mornings especially, he'll come downstairs, and I'm already awake, and he'll just kind of look up at me and just say, Daddy, up. He's a big guy. I mean, he's five-and-a-half. But he'll just say, Daddy, up. And what he means is, Dad, I just want to be as close to you as I can be. And that's what he's saying. Dad, I just want to be as close to you as I can be. And so as we dive into the talk tonight, can we pray together? Can we ask, if nothing else happens tonight, that we would feel God's presence in a communal way and in an individual way, that God would really be here in a very intimate and personal way with each one of us and in a very personal and intimate way with us as a community. Can we pray for that together? All right, let's pray. So God, up. We just want to be as close to you as we can be. Amen. Well, we are in our fourth week in our study in the book of Acts, and we're going to pick it up in verse 4. So we're moving at lightning speed. But last week I sort of started this section, and there's really two verses, Acts 1 verse 4 and Acts 1 verse 8, which put together a sort of three-word outline for me and for us about what this little community of followers was experiencing and what Jesus was calling them into. Remember this little community of followers, about 100, 120 of them had seen Jesus die on a cross, and then they'd seen Jesus raise again, and they were waiting in Jerusalem, and Jesus had been spending time with them over a period of about 40 days. But then as he's meeting with them and talking with them. In verse 4, he's about to leave again. And so for this little community of followers of Jesus, they're wondering, okay, now what's next? And so in Acts 1 verse 4, we read this. You can read it on your Bible, on your Droid, iPhone, whatever you have. Gathering them together, Jesus says he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, which he said, You've heard it from me. I've talked about what you're waiting for. For John, baptized with water, but you're going to be baptized with something very different. You're going to be immersed into, you're going to be overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit. Not many days from now. And I love that Jesus just kind of, you know, he doesn't say three days from now or four days from now or at two o'clock on Thursday. He just says not many days from now. I just think that's his little rabbinic twist to kind of keep them, you know, a little wondering. But then in Acts 1 verse 8, he says, this, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. And then you're going to be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest parts of the earth. And so we saw these three words, Wait, receive, and witness. And it was my submission to you last week that that's the process. That was the process back in the first century, and that's the process in 2012 when God wants to get God's work done. He invites a group of people to wait, to receive power, to do things that otherwise they couldn't do. and then to witness, to tell God's story of what we have seen God do, ways in which we've seen God work in ways that we never, ever could have done on our own. And so this pattern of waiting for the Spirit to come and then receiving God's Spirit and then testifying to a broken world the amazing things that God has done in our lives and in the lives of the people around us. But all we got to last week was that first word, right? Wait, and I told you I tried my hardest to cram these three words into one talk, but I failed miserably. I only could make it to one word. And so I really look at last week's talk and this week's talk as one talk. So if you haven't heard last week's talk, I almost never do this, but please listen to it. Go online, watch it, get it as a CD in the bookstore. But I want to do a review for you just to get us all up to speed. Wait, the word wait is a Greek word perimenno. It's two words put together. Peri means around and meno means to stay in a given state, place, or expectancy. It means to abide. And so we ask this question, what is it like to join with God and to wait for something that God wants done? What is it like to wait in a state of expectancy for something that God wants done in your life or in the world? What is that like? And so we came up with words. And these words come actually from my wife. She journaled these out several years ago about her process of waiting. She said, Steve, I'd like to share it with you, and this is what it looks like for me. And we even said that to wait like this is a lot like the process of carrying life within you. As a woman carries life within her, she has to expand to receive that life as that life grows. And as that life is nourished, that life inside of this woman grows. And beyond all the technological advances that we have done, we've never come up with a way to help a baby grow to the point at which that baby's ready to enter the world any faster than 40 weeks, right? We just haven't done it. And so you have to wait. And if you're a woman who's ever been pregnant, that waiting is excruciating sometimes. It's very painful in physical ways. But it's also painful in emotional ways. And so in this place of waiting, We learn to loosen our grip. Have you ever noticed a time in your life where you're just gripping so hard onto something and someone kind of comes up to you and says, you know, you might want to consider loosening your grip on that. And then like you even realize, wow, I've been kind of holding myself even in a fist. It means to learn not to force it, to not be in control. It means to learn how to live life when you don't know. It's learning to be changed, learning to know my place in this world, to desire and even to lose desire. These are all the things you do when you submit yourself to the process of waiting. Now, in one of the songs we sang, there was a lyric that was up on the screen and we sang it together and it was something like, you know, Lord, when the flames come, I will look to you in the flames. And did anyone else go, whoa, flames? Waiting is a kind of furnace where the things that need to get burned away, the impurities that need to get burned away, have the opportunity to get burned away if you have the courage to loosen your grip and to live in the not knowing. Is anyone tracking with that? That's a crucible. That's what, if you read in the scriptures, the word crucible, that's exactly what a crucible is. It's a place of fire where you would put a metal so that all the impurities would get burned off and what you would get at the end of the day is a more pure thing. So I emailed our members. We have about 1,000 members here at Open Door and I sent them all an email as I do from time to time and I said, I would love it. I just love hearing stories about how people are receiving God's power and about how sometimes it's hard to wait. And so some of them sent me, actually many of you sent me stories and I'm gonna just read a couple of them because I mean, we would be here until 9.30 or 10, which might be a sweet idea, but some of you have plans to go see a movie later on and I wouldn't wanna mess up with those plans too much, though I might, anyway. So one of the people said this while I was at my adult, one of my adult kids, I was at their house helping him do home repair, and I was kind of being treated more like a hired hand and less like a dad. And I didn't really like that. And, but then I heard the spirit sort of whisper, hey, what would it look like for you to ask for from me, the spirit of a servant, so you could just be here and serve your kids no matter how you're treated? What would that look like? So this guy just kind of put down his tool and prayed for the Holy Spirit to come in that normal, mundane moment. Another one, this woman said that she got a call from a political person, you know, trying to get her to vote for their candidate. And the person got a little rude, believe it or not. And then she got a little rude back to him. And then they hung up, and later on that night, she felt a little prompt and just, you know, said, you know, you were a little rude to that person. And then she, okay, so she sat with that and waited. Oh, what should I do? And then she felt like she should call that person back because, you know, call her ID. And so the next night, she called the person back. And of course, they weren't working, but she got to explain to the person that was working, well, there was a guy that I talked to last night and I just, I was rude to him. So I wonder if you could tell him somehow that I'm sorry. Now, can you imagine being the person on the other end of the line? How that might have altered your night? I don't imagine that happens all too often to people that are making these kinds of phone calls, right? Got another email from a woman who says she's an introvert. And so joining groups is a little hard for her, but she said, I joined Common Ground, our women's group that meets on Thursday night, a couple hundred women that gather here over food and conversation and teaching, and she said, it has been such an amazing environment for me. It was challenging at first, but man, it's been so great for me to experience God's people in friendship in new ways. Another grandfather says he feels called to write his memoirs for his children and grandchildren, and even though there's all kinds of distractions, he's just like, man, I gotta do it. So that's the deal. Another person, and I love this, I'm gonna read exactly what she wrote. And she was talking about a certain thing that she's waiting for. And she said, I sense that God is at work here. I believe this is an important time of transition for me. And I'm alternately terrified and hopeful. I'm extremely uncomfortable. I'm not enjoying the waiting. I hate it. I want it to end, or at least I want to know how it will end and when. And yet as much as I can, I'm holding steady, believing that somehow in one form or another it'll be worth the wait. I believe God loves that kind of honest prayer. I hate this waiting. It's horrible. Another person, I'm going to save that one. I'm going to save that one. so i got dozens of emails from open door people struggling with normal problems waiting for god's power to come and it was so encouraging to me to know that as i struggle through my things you struggle through your things as well and we have a god that is so patient with us amen that so just desires us to come to God with all of our pain and all of our confusion. So we also ask this question. What's it like when you try to force something to happen? You know, because there's waiting and we can even wait impatiently. But then there's also this thing where we just say, you know what, forget waiting. I'm going to force this one. I mean, I'm going to take this one into my own hands. And because it's time for someone to take it into someone's hands, right? No one else is looking at it. No one else is going to do it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it now. Forget about it. And so we looked at what it felt like. And I said it felt like to me, like when I do that, it's like a spinning top. Lots of energy, but kind of chaotic movement, and it doesn't ever end up getting anywhere. That's what I feel like when I try to force something. I'm anxious. I'm wishing time away. I'm irritated. I'm unable to change things. I'm tempted to manipulate, and I'm really, I hate not having the power. That's what it feels like when I try to force something. And that's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? So we were invited last week to wait instead, to adopt the courageous posture of waiting in the crucible. And before I move on to receiving, I just want to highlight one more thing. And this came through on one of the emails. And this was it. She said, there's a longing of my heart that may never be fulfilled, and it keeps getting stronger. And I think there's a way in there. So I want to speak to you, person who wrote this, just to you. Because there's a little part of, I think, the church's teaching over the years where it's like, if I want something and it feels pure, you know, maybe that's wrong and bad. So maybe I just need to say, forget that, and then, God, I'm just going to say goodbye to that, and so, God, whatever you want to have happen, have happen. And I want to submit to you that it is really good to desire, to have these desires, to have them in your heart, to hold them in your heart, and there's a way in which you can bring those desires to God and say, God, can we just hold this together? I mean, can we hold it together? a desire for a relationship to be mended, a desire for a baby, a desire for a spouse, a desire for a job. Well, I better not even hope that because maybe that's not what God wants. I don't think that's how God works. God's going to say, you know what? The fire of waiting is going to burn off the impurities that need to be burned off. All you need to do is submit to my waiting. Can you do that? I'm not asking you to lose your desire. I'm just, can you trust me in this? God is saying, can you trust me that as you desire and even as that desire gets bigger, I'm going to be with you in it. Now, I don't know what's going to happen with that. You know, there's no guarantees, but there's a way to hold that desire with God. Right? Let's do that as a community together. Okay, the next word, receive, or else, you know, we're going to be done. I'm not even going to have gotten to the next word. Receive. This is this next word, and we get it right out of Acts 1 verse 8. I already read it to you, but we read this. But you will, you will, Jesus says, receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. And then you shall be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth. Now, this word desire is really interesting because there is one word in the Greek about desire that's very passive. It's like, yep, someone's just going to receive something from someone else. But this word is a different word. And the picture that I get when I think about this word is, have you ever seen two dogs fighting over a piece of rope? Right? And this is what it looks like. Lombano is the Greek word it means to receive, but what it means to is it means to take hold of, to grasp, or to grab. It means that when something's coming at you, you hold onto it for dear life. It's almost violent and aggressive the way in which you would grab onto it. And like two dogs fighting over this little piece of rope, you would say when the Spirit comes with power, I am going to put myself in a place to receive that power. Because I believe that is the only way that I will get God's work done in the world that God is calling me to do. There is a long history at Open Door. and of churches all around the world for all of time that believe that Jesus calls us to be people in the world, to do things in the world that are courageous and kind of crazy and way out there. But Jesus says that I will give you the Holy Spirit and power to do those things that otherwise you could never do. So understanding what it means to receive is really, really important, to receive this kind of power. So I looked, see, every once in a while, see, we're sort of nerds about the Greek words and Hebrew words and all that stuff. And I don't think you have to look up the Greek words and Hebrew words all the time to understand the Bible. I really don't. But what it is, when you understand what one word means, and when you look it up, you can look at it, and oh, it's used here and here and here and here. So we kind of geek out and stuff, but that's why we all have gifts, and one of my gifts is teaching, and so I'm going to geek out and hopefully help you with that. And so I looked where this word is also used. And there's a couple places I think that are really helpful. So in Matthew 7, 8, and 9, Jesus talks about it, and he says, for everyone who asks, lambano, receives. But there's this relationship between what? Asking and receiving. so for anyone who asks receives those who seek find and to those who knock the door will be open so there's this there's this huge participation this huge cooperation that is required if you want to receive which of you if your son asks for bread will give him a stone and i love that last sentence it's like i'm your father and when you ask for power to do what i'm calling you to do i'm not going to trick you that's what the bread for a stone you know the bread there was loaves of bread back then were a little more rugged and rough looking, and they looked a lot like certain stones that were in Jerusalem. And so, you know, every once in a while, you would see a stone. It kind of looked like a piece of bread, and you can imagine people even joking around about it. Some people even saying, hey, have a piece of bread. It was really a stone. And God is saying, I'm not going to trick you. When it comes to these deep things of your heart that you're desiring, I'm not going to manipulate you. I'm not going to place shifting shadows on you. I'm going to give you a gift. Receiving power is a gift. But then this other one, I think, is even more poignant in John 10, 17 and 18. And Jesus says this, this just breathtaking thing in just a couple of sentences here. He says, the reason why my Father loves me is that I lay down my life, only to take it up again. And take it up again, take it up, is the word lambano. It's the same word as we read in Acts 1 verse 8. And no one takes my life from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. And I have authority to lay it down. You need to know that. And I have authority to take it up. Lambano. This command I lambanoed from my father. So this word is used three times in two verses. I think Jesus is trying to say something. And I believe very strongly what he's trying to say is this. Just read that for a second. I believe Jesus is demonstrating the sacred relationship between letting go and receiving. And the fact that you have to exercise your personal authority to do both. In the furnace of waiting, in the crucible of waiting, there are some things that you need to let go of. And it may not be that deep longing that we were talking about a few minutes ago, but it will be certain things. That the invitation will be, it's like God kind of coming to you as a father or mother and saying to your clenched fist on this thing that you feel like is giving you so much life. And God just gently saying, I'd like you to give that to me. But here's what God will never do. God will never pry open your hand and take it. Because God knows that fundamental to receiving this kind of gift from God in power is the fact that you have to, with your own personal authority, lay it down and let it go. You have to do that with your own power. in order to receive with your own power what God has for you. I think this is an absolutely essential point to understand. A few nights ago, man, my wife and I got into this fight, and I didn't even see it coming, but I started it. I mean, it was amazing. I just said this thing. I was like, oh, hey, by the way. And then it was like, I mean, and then we were fighting. And then we tried to talk it out a little bit, and so we couldn't. And we kind of, we took a timeout. And that's fair every once in a while, people. It's like, hey, do we need a little timeout? Do we need a little moment to kind of regroup? And yep, so we went to our different corners. And me and I went to the basement. And corners, that metaphor was intentional. Boxing ring. Anyway, I went to the basement. And so, you know, and I started to do what I do. Well, I can't believe it. I said that, and she said, she always does that. I never do that. I mean, all that stuff. And then in this really kind of sweet moment, it was like I got this gift, and it was like God was saying, you know, Steve, here's the thing. All she wants is to not be alone. and I wonder if you could kind of give up, you know, your need to put up a boundary or be right or, you know, I just wonder if you could, I just wonder if you could consider that. And in a moment, I was like, and it just dissipated. I mean, all this stuff just dissipated because I realized, God, you're totally right. And then I said, but you know what? If I'm going to love my wife the way I need to love my wife, I'm going to need some power from you, God. Not because she's hard to love, just because I'm sort of, you know, who I am. And so in a moment, God said, well, yeah, of course. I mean, I'll give you that. Now, for some of us, that's going to take four years. I mean, that little conversation will take four years, and that's okay. But I had to let go in order to receive. But here's what I really know about this process of letting go and receiving. The process of letting go and receiving can be a time of profound weakness and vulnerability, can't it? Where you're waiting for something to happen and a relationship to mend, you're waiting for God's power to come, God's guidance to come, to give you the power to do something that you could never do on your own and you really need to do it and you really even want to do it but you just can't do it yet because you're filled with fear, insecurity or whatever. And so this process, this crucible, the flames that are burning away the impurities that are on you, is not a very pleasant experience. And it requires a kind of courage to stay in the fire. It requires a kind of courage that I don't think comes real naturally to any of us. I mean, it's like we're like, ouch, you know, get me out of here right now. You might be mad at God in that moment. I'm mad at you, God. And God's like, I know. That's okay. And you could get out. I mean, you really can get out. But if you want the impurities to burn off, if you want to have the authority to let go so that you can really grab onto God's power, you're going to have to stay in there. You're going to have to stay in there, in the crucible. Now, some of us are in the crucible right now. So that's why the room is so quiet. Based on the volume in the room, it's about 85% of us, I would say. So here's a wonderful set of verses for you. It comes from the message translation, Romans 8, 26-28. And it starts this way. Meanwhile, the moment we get tired in the waiting. Anyone there? That's like, oh man, I mean, really. I've done everything I've known how to do to breach the gap between myself and my adult child. I just don't know how else to reach her, to reach him. I don't know when he'll ever come back, she'll ever come. I don't. I'm waiting, and it's brutal, and it's vulnerable, and I feel like the pregnant lady who's being expanded, but I feel like I've been pregnant for about four years, so it's time to have this baby. So the moment you get tired in the waiting, and we get tired in the waiting, and that's even great comfort, isn't it? We get tired in the waiting. It's tiring to wait. The moment we get tired in the waiting, God's Spirit is right alongside, helping us along. If we don't know how or what to pray, it doesn't matter. God does our praying in and for us, making prayer out of our wordless sighs and our aching groans. Did you ever know that? That crying that you did in the middle of the night, that anguishing sobbing, that angry yelling that, you know, you do when you're privately alone and it's toward God? did you know that God translates that into prayers for you? I mean, that is spectacularly amazing. God knows us far better than we know ourselves. God knows our pregnant condition. I mean, this is actually in the scriptures. I didn't write this. I didn't make it up. God keeps us present. The Holy Spirit keeps us present before God. And that's why we can be so sure that every detail in our lives of love for God is worked into something good. I know that God makes everything work together for my good. The only kind of person that can sing that with authority is a person that has submitted themselves to waiting in the crucible of life and letting go of that which she needed to let go of, that which he needed to let go of, so that finally you've received God's power in you to do something you had no idea how to do. and when you've talked to someone like that when you've met someone like that the spirit that is on them is very gentle and very patient and very empathetic and not in a hurry because they've been there and the way that a church community becomes more and more filled with those kind of people is that we submit to our own crucibles, right? and then when God comes with God's power, we say, okay, Lord, I receive all that you have for me. And then we are capable of witnessing God's power in us in the world. Amen? Then we have authority to share our story with the world because we've gone through the fire and we'll go through it again. It's not a one-time thing. It's not a one-time thing. It's not a one-time thing. So this third word to witness. Acts 1 verse 8, But you will receive power. We've read it three times now. When the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest parts of the earth. And, you know, these disciples would have heard that, They're just teenagers, maybe 19-year-olds, 20-year-olds. They're uneducated. They're sitting up in an upper room right now. This little deal is their little deal. I mean, they didn't know it was going to spread. And then when Jesus says it's going to spread out to all around the world, I mean, this is a crazy thing. So the next question would have been, how? And then Jesus would have said, well, let's rewind. It's because you're going to receive the Holy Spirit on you so that you can have authority in the world. So that you cannot be just some talking head that's annoying. You're actually going to have a story of what you've seen God do in your actual life and in the actual lives of those people around you. The word witness is a Greek word martus, and it means one who testifies. It also means to be a martyr, but I didn't even want to put it up there. But it's where the word martyr comes from. Because so many people that witnessed God's power in the first century almost all of the disciples of Jesus ended up dying for their witness. And they didn't die because they got up and argued forcefully. They died because they kept walking in God's power and it was messing with the economy of the day. And so they were killed. I want to share with you an example in Acts 3 which we'll get to in 2015. We always joke about that. Why do we always joke about that? It's kind of, joke's getting old. Okay, Acts 3, verse 6. So Peter, I think it's, and John are heading into the temple at 3 o'clock. It's the normal time of prayer. They're just heading in there. It's the time to pray. That's what they've been doing their whole lives. So they head into the temple. And this guy that's sitting at this beggar, he asks him. He looks up and asks him for something. And then Peter, who's been walking in the power of the Spirit lately, He's been doing a lot of preaching, actually, and seeing people come to belief and faith in Jesus. So he says to this beggar, he says, listen, silver and gold I do not have. And I think he actually meant it because they kept all their money in the same, in the common purse, and I guarantee you they didn't give it to Peter. So silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have, I give you. What I do have, I give you. Listen, I don't have money. I don't have a lot of theological arguments to give you, but what I do have, I'm going to give to you. Are you ready? Because I have it. It's been given to me, and I've received it. What I have, I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk. It's really interesting. So he's praying for healing for this guy. And when we pray for healing, man, we make it like 10 minutes long, and we say all these things, and God, if it's not your will, if it's not your will, who knows? And Peter just did him as one sentence. He's walking, maybe. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. I mean, I don't know, maybe he stopped. I wasn't there. And then taking this guy by the right hand, Peter helped him up and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong and he jumped to his feet and began to walk. And then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping and praising God, someone who had been on the outside, never ever going into the temple because he couldn't physically walk in there, is healed and goes right into the center of the life of God. I mean, this is a spectacular moment. And for Peter and John, I mean, they're just like, all right, well, here's another one, let's go. And when all the people saw him walking and praising God, they recognized that's the guy that sat at the entrance every day at the temple gate begging. The temple gate, ironically called beautiful. Little side note to any of you who are disabled in any way, to any of you, I think this is just a beautiful little picture. Any of you who feel like you are not normal, any of you who feel like you've been dealt a deck in your own body that is maybe unfair, just hear this little beautiful whisper from God. In my economy, you're seated at the gate called beautiful. Beautiful. You're just breathtaking to me. You will not, they will. So when all the people saw him, they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. Question, what had happened to him? he brushed up against a couple of people who were so filled with this reality of letting go and receiving God's power that a brush with these people connected this man to the very person of Jesus Christ who healed him and invited him into a relationship with him, right into the center of life in God and everyone around could have testified or witnessed to what God had done. I mean, this is amazing. Here's the deal. When we receive power and begin to walk in it, we're living the story as true. We're not arguing that the story is true. And this is witnessing. There's a time and a place to debate. There really is. I mean, I really think there's a time and a place to argue and debate. You're right, I'm right, you're wrong, I'm wrong. But the thing that the followers of Jesus are called to be much more in the world is people who walk in the power of the Spirit to do things they will never have done on their own power. And then simply to witness to this majestic and powerful and beautiful and amazing God that is all about restoring people to wholeness. See, this little story exhibits the power of God is available and present to do what in the world? To repair and restore the world. Not to show off. See, you know, I speak in tongues. Great, you speak in tongues. Awesome. I'm glad you speak in tongues. I'm glad. The sign of someone that's moving in the power of the Spirit is that people around you, because of the Spirit, are moving toward wholeness. Because God's desire in the world is tikkun alam, this Hebrew phrase, the restoration of all things. And it started the moment Jesus was resurrected. I mean the moment Jesus was resurrected. The restoration of all things. That era, that epoch began. And you and I are in that era. and we can partner with God in getting the work that God wants done done and that is the restoration of all things, all relationships, all bodies, all people. That's the work that God wants done and we can be a part of it, amen? Amen. If we submit ourselves to receiving the power of the Spirit in our lives, And if we recognize that is the only way that I will ever, ever walk with the kind of kindness and gentleness and authority that helps people become whole. So three words. Wait, receive, and witness. Where are you right now? you know so like restoration of all things where are you right now are you waiting for something are you in that crucible are you in the process where maybe you're waiting you want to receive God's power and you need more and more of it it's not a one time event either receiving God's power It's not a one-time event. Or are you in a position where you can start testifying to what God has done and you might be in all three? Where are you right now and what do you need? Can we go to God in prayer right now as we close? In a raw and kind of rugged and ragged way, come to God with what really is? Can we do that together? Let's pray together. God we're asking you to pour your spirit down on us right now so that we can receive what we need to receive from you so that we can begin to walk in the story of power not just argue about it and some of us are in the crucible of waiting and it's so difficult so God pour your spirit down on those of us who are in the waiting and it's so difficult we've gotten so tired in the waiting so we're asking for your spirit to come alongside of us and help us and use our groans and our anguished sighs, turn them into prayers because we don't know what to pray for God and some of us are right at that intersection of waiting and receiving and it's time to receive and so God we even need the power to have the authority with our own authority to let something go to say enough of this, enough of this thing in my life that I really need to let go of and no one's gonna pry it out of my hands. I need to put it down. And some of you, God's gonna whisper in your spirit right now what that thing is and you just kind of have to start a process of letting it go and it might be a process but you're gonna have to start the process of saying I am going to, with my authority, let it go. God's gonna whisper perhaps what that is to you right now. Holy Spirit, come. and then others of you are you've seen God move and you've seen God work and you need to hear the spirit of God say you just need to walk in that authority walk in the authority of what you know you don't need to argue it out you don't need to defend your faith you don't need to you know you just need to walk in the authority that you have and it'll bring wholeness to people you don't need worry about all the details. No, you just need to walk in the authority of the spirit that you already have because of what you've seen God do and God will invite you into the right arenas where you can share that. God, as a community of people, we are on our knees right now saying we want to be a community of people that is desperate for your power and your power alone to do that which you're calling us to do in the world. this is our heart's cry this is what we want give us the courage to wait give us the courage to receive and give us the courage to just testify to the good things that you've done in our lives even in the hard times amen amen Thank you.
