Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray. Let's go to the Word. Lord, I thank you for water that comes to us in dry places and joy that comes to us in suffering places. And how odd that those two things, suffering and joy, can be together as we follow you. I pray that you would help us understand that even a little more today. by the power of your spirit through your word in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, early in the week as I struggled with whether to move on in the text, having already dealt for two weeks with this eighth and final beatitude in Matthew 5, where Jesus makes it clear to his young disciples, his talmudim gathered around him on the side of the hill that day, that among the things they should actually expect, if they were serious about following in his way of living and loving and being with suffering and pain, expect persecution as, well, I found myself kind of interested and intrigued by one more facet of what Jesus is saying here, that quite frankly might be easy to miss, maybe easy to ignore, although I'm pretty sure that one of the big reasons I did notice it and then became intrigued by it was because it sounds so odd. And not just to me. I think to us, actually, it's an entirely foreign concept, if we're honest, that requires, I think, an inordinate amount of work just to get our head around this concept, to understand it. And what I'm speaking of is this apparent connection in Scripture, in this beatitude, but also in other places of Scripture between suffering and joy. Matthew 5, verse 12, rejoice and be glad. Matthew 5, verse 11, rejoice and be glad. Here's when you should rejoice and be glad, when you're persecuted for righteousness' sake. Matthew 5, verse 11, when people cast insults at you and lie about you, saying all sorts of evil things about you falsely, rejoice and be glad. My first reaction is, no, no, you can't make me do that. I know it's in the Bible and you're supposed to, but this isn't normal. It isn't real. It isn't possible. I mean, when persecution is happening to me, I'm bumping up to the second beatitude. I will mourn. Anyway. Fact is, I think I could have ignored this little thing about joy and suffering together as maybe being an anomaly of some sort, except for the fact that it keeps showing up. And that's another thing I noticed, as if it were a theme in other parts of Scripture, which means, among other things, that it wasn't just Jesus who said this kind of thing or saw this kind of connection between suffering and joy because his followers had picked up on this as well, Actually, not thinking it, at least it doesn't seem to be odd to them. Not thinking it odd at all to have suffering and joy connected in some way. Quite normal, I think, to them. Even good and clearly in the realm of what you should expect. Hebrews chapter 12, verse 2, just an example. The writer of the Hebrews, to the Hebrews, speaking of Jesus, says that it was for joy. Literally, it was for the joy set before him. That is Jesus, that he endured the cross. The cross is the embodiment of human suffering, despising the shame. He endured the suffering for joy. Just the fact that those two words are in the same sentence is odd to me. It means in some way that maybe I don't understand. We struggle with this as well. Suffering and joy connected in some way. then there's Paul who in the book of Philippians says that among the many benefits of being a follower of Jesus is that we get to not only believe in him but also to suffer for his sake. Remember that? We talked about that a couple of weeks ago. Philippians 1 29. For to you it has been granted. You know as if you won the lottery. You know it has been granted. You know we had to get special permission for this. Not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake. Maybe the clearest and the best is actually James, who in the epistle that bears his name is writing to some people who like those people we met a couple of weeks ago in Matthew 8. Remember Matthew 8, or Acts 8 rather. They were under a great persecution, scattered from their homes, driven from their homes, but they went everywhere they went good-newsing and rejoicing. And we scratched our heads about that two weeks ago. In James, he is writing to some people just like that. Indeed, he identifies them in James 1, verse 1, as being the dispersed ones. They were scattered from their homes, having been driven from their homes, just like those in Acts 8. They lost it all. And to people who had lost it all, the first thing James says to them is something I would never say. He says this, consider it all joy. All of that stuff you're going through, all of it, consider it joy, my brethren, when, not if, but when you encounter various trials, which broadens it out beyond persecution, which is what we're talking about in Matthew 5, to suffering in general, to the kind of suffering that's simply part of life. James calls them various trials. Consider them joy. Mark them up for joy. Put them in a category of things that you consider joy. It just sounds weird. and raises for me a question that I think is obvious. One word, how? How do you do that? Well, James' answer to that, talked about this before, verses 3 and 4 in James chapter 1, is this, you do it by knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance and you do it by letting endurance have its perfect result in order that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing, lacking nothing, including joy. but that's not the whole story. I mean, James is very helpful, and we're going to come back to that in a second. But I want to break it down this way, that if we're ever going to hope to understand and much less experience this biblical connection between suffering and joy, we're going to need at least five things. Five things. It scares you, doesn't it? You're all looking at your watch. He can't do two things. Okay, we're not going to get them all today. But if we're going to make this connection, If we're going to understand it, much less experience it. First of all, we're going to need to see some things. Chief among them is Jesus. We're going to need to see Jesus. If you don't have fixing your eyes on him, that's Hebrews 12, just before the enduring, the suffering for joy, fixing your eyes on Christ, you're going to have to see Jesus, which is why we talked about what we talked about last week. If you're here, you remember we got a glimpse of the vision of Jesus that John got in the Revelation. But now to that vision, add Stephen's vision in Acts chapter 7, who in the context, again, of suffering, of incredible pain, in fact, it was suffering and death, Stephen was about to be stoned to death in Acts chapter 7, he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father, Acts 7, 56, which doesn't mean that Jesus delivered him from the suffering. It doesn't mean that he rescued him from the suffering any more than Jesus delivered John on the island of Patmos when John saw the vision of Jesus. But it does mean that John on the island of Patmos and Stephen about to be stoned, that they weren't alone. And it does mean that even though you're about to die, Stephen, you're never going to die. So rejoice and be glad. Consider it joy. But even there, it sounds a little weird. And not only a little weird, but a little inaccessible, partly because these visions where the veil gets pulled back and you really get to see the glory of the Lord don't happen every day. They don't happen very often, hardly at all. In fact, quite frankly, the kind of vision Stephen got, Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father, I've never gotten. The only way I've ever been able to even picture it or think of it is thinking of and reading of the fact that Stephen got a vision like that, and John's vision once in a lifetime, maybe for him, never for me, and part, in fact, of the reality of suffering, wouldn't you say? And part of why suffering is hard to connect with joy is that part of the suffering is that we can't see him at all, that his glory is real distant, and his face is hard to see, which is why we do need some help from John. Because in those times when you can't see Jesus, and if you could, it would be tremendous consolation. Even though maybe sometimes, some of you last week, as we kind of got into John's vision, there was this hope and this encouragement that stirred in you. Most of the time, you don't get that. So we need some help from James, who says, that's why you need to know some things as well. You need to see some things, but you need to know some things as well. Verse 3, James says, knowing this. And then you're going to need to allow some things. If you're going to ever make this connection between suffering and joy, verse 4, he says, let endurance, passive tense, let endurance have its perfect result. You're going to have to allow some things. And fourth, you're going to need to value some things. If you're ever going to connect suffering and joy, you're going to have to highly value things like character and substance, integrity and depth. And finally, we're going to need to choose some things. And that's what I'm going to talk about a little bit next week and use it to bring us to the table, like a willingness to actually choose suffering for someone else's joy. What? Next week. Let's start with some things we need to know. Some things we need to know if we're ever going to make this connection between suffering and joy. The first is rather basic, having to do with the inevitability of various trials. I probably don't have to tell this to most of you. You've accepted this reality. you've grown up at all. But if you haven't, you need to accept the inevitability of various trials, that life is hard, and that various trials, even suffering and pain, are part of the deal. And that accepting Jesus as your Savior and even following him as your rabbi doesn't give you a free pass from suffering and pain from these realities of life. We used to sing a song in Sunday school. At least I did. I think maybe you did too. It's just like Jesus to roll the clouds away. Remember that song? How many of you sang that song? It's just like Jesus to roll the clouds away. I see myself as 10 years old believing that. It's just like him. I pictured he would blow clouds away. Lord, make my birthday party sunny. He'd blow because it's just like you to blow. People are starving in Darfur, but he's going to blow the clouds away from my picnic. It's just like that. And you get this expectation in your mind. that's just what he does that's his job in my life to make it all go better to make it all go easier but what if it isn't and what if it doesn't indeed a couple of weeks ago we went through great lengths to great lengths trying to make it clear that if you actually do follow the rabbi's way of living and loving and being it might actually be tougher, not easier. Bumpier, not smoother. But if you don't know that, it has to do with expectations, and your expectations have a lot to do with how you react to what happens if you don't know on the front end that various trials are part of life. They inevitably come then when the various trials that are part of life inevitably do come, when the clouds, in other words, do roll in and don't just go away, you'd be confused. This isn't the deal. You'll feel abandoned, even angry as well, like God ripped you off. And if you stay there, you will never, ever be able to understand, much less experience, this biblical connection between suffering and joy. Rejoice and be glad. You know, it's just this line in the text, but it has no... What? Consider it all joy continues to be, huh? For you, which is why I call this the first thing you need to know. The life is hard. Inevitably involving various trials. Peter said it this way, 1 Peter 4, 12. Don't be surprised at the fiery ordeal as if some strange thing is happening to you. Now, I want to comfort you in this, but please don't act like you're being picked on. Life is hard. That's just the way it is. Jesus said it this way, John 16, 33, that in this world you will have trouble. And not because the devil's attacking you. I mean, sometimes you will have trouble if the devil's attacking you, but it's not always that. And it's not always because you're suffering for your faith, which is what Matthew 5 is about. Because sometimes trouble falls, says Jesus in John 16. Sometimes trouble falls like the rain on the just and the unjust. Everybody gets wet. Everybody has pain. Job said it this way, Job 4, verse 1, that just as sparks fly upward, so is man born to trouble. Because life is hard. It's just the way it is for everybody, which is why James says when, not if. You encounter various trials. Several years ago, there was a book that became a national bestseller. I'm sure you remember it. I think I've mentioned it even before, entitled When Bad Things Happen to Good People. Remember that book? Where the author tapped into our assumption that if you're good, bad things won't happen. So if you're experiencing pain, the assumption continues, it must be some sort of punishment. You must have done something wrong. No, that's not it, says James. It's life, says James. Indeed, it may frustrate some that James doesn't try to explain why there are various trials. There's pain and stuff like that. He just says it is. Life is hard. Various trials are inevitable, all of which changes the question. If you're paying attention, it changes the question from why is there pain, which is a good question, but James doesn't answer it. Two, what will you do with the pain? Because you're going to have it. Just kind of settle that you're going to have it. The question becomes then, what do I do with it? Richard Rohr in his book, one of my favorites of his, Adam's Return, says that all great spirituality is about what we do with our pain. So the first great lesson of life, he says, is to teach people not to run from it. In fact, to not get rid of the pain too quickly until we have learned its lessons, which leads to the second thing I think we need to know. If we ever hope to understand or enter into experience, this biblical connection between suffering and joy, it's this. We need to know. Verse 3 in James chapter 1, that the testing of our faith produces something. And if it produces something, hope maybe begins to rise, and maybe that's why there's some possibility of joy. In this case, what it produces, says James, is endurance. The testing of your faith. The word testing is significant. We've talked about this before. You're familiar with this on a number of levels. The word testing doesn't mean what we often think of when we think of a test, like a test in school, you take a test, you get a grade, you pass or fail. A better rendering actually of the word in the text test would be actually to render it purified, to purify. And it's usually a process used often, as many of you know, with the process of purifying metal to make the metal strong. And what the process is to make the metal strong, to purify the metal, is the application of intense heat. And when the heat is applied to the metal, the metal actually melts, which can't be a good thing. If you just kind of stick with the analogy, it gets so hot, the metal melts. You're ruining the metal. No. In the process of the melting, impurities are revealed. They rise to the top, becoming visible so you can skim them off the top, thus making the metal stronger so that now this metal will endure. And it's the testing that produces the endurance. Please note in this analogy that when the meltdown happens of the metal, or you, when you melt down, the whole batch of iron isn't condemned. It isn't, okay, you're out. When the meltdown happens, you don't throw the whole thing out. But neither do you ignore the impurity that the meltdown revealed, as if to pretend you didn't really see it, that it's not really there. Yes, it is really there. And here's the process that brings something else and affirms this endurance thing. You skim it off. Now, the obvious picture here, I think, is this. That in this hunk of iron, which is you and me, there's some really good stuff. In you, in me, there's some really good stuff. Things in you, in me that are worth keeping pure metal, solid gold. but there's other stuff as well in you and me mixed into the pot that needs to be skimmed off. But the problem is this, and this is the part none of us like, in most cases, whether we like it or not, the most effective tool for removing what needs to be skimmed off. First of all, for revealing what needs to be skimmed off and then removing it is heat, the kind that's produced by life, by various trials. and you know what I wish? I wish it wasn't that way. I wish that that wasn't true. See, I wish that endurance and strength could be produced some other way, but I wish a lot of things, actually. I wish that I could stay, and you could too, lean and strong by laying on the couch eating potato chips all day long. That'd be great. I wish I wish I could stay in shape without exercise, without sweat. I wish I could be knowledgeable without study and wise without experience, seasoned without winter. I wish I could rise to the top without ever paying my dues. That would be great. I wish a lot of things. I wish I could experience intimacy without vulnerability. I wish I could experience the peaceful fruit of righteousness without any discipline, holiness, without any repentance, reconciliation, without any forgiveness, only problem. It's just a little minor problem. It doesn't work that way. Life doesn't work that way. Life in the kingdom of God doesn't work that way, which leads to the third thing I think we need to know. If we hope to ever understand or experience this biblical connection between suffering and joy, it's this. You need to know that if this testing is submitted to, if it's received and allowed to finish its course in you, it can produce in you a kind of strength that translates into character. Middle of verse 4, it says this, James 1 verse 4, In order that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. The word perfect there doesn't mean perfect the way we often think of perfect, as in sinless perfection. The Greek word there is teleon, which means fully grown, fully formed. In order that you may grow up, become mature, fully formed in Christ. Complete, that is whole, well-rounded, lacking nothing. That is having all the necessary parts. And guess what? I've got good news for you. particularly if you're in Christ, you have right now all the necessary parts already. 2 Peter 1, 3, right now you have everything you need pertaining to life and godliness. So you have already, with Christ alive in you, all the necessary parts to be fully formed, to be well-rounded and whole. But guess what else you have in you, as well as Christ in you? You got some junk in you, and so do I. It needs to be revealed in order to be skimmed off and whether we like it or not, the most effective tool to reveal the junk so we can then skim it off is heat. A little side bar here. The problem we have with each other sometimes is when the heat gets on in our marriage or in our relationships and some impurity is revealed, we have a tendency to condemn the whole hunk of metal. You're a jerk. You know, are you with me on that one? That's where an environment of grace needs to be so that when the heat in our relationships or whatever gets turned on, the impurities get revealed, we skim it off and have grace. But when that heat is on, it isn't any fun and it doesn't look very good. By the way, this necessity of heat to produce some of these things ought to inform actually a number of things. Among them would be even our parenting, how we deal sometimes with each other in the context of ministry because the fact is, and this is really tough, we're not doing people any favors by just always making everybody feel good. When what we call in our ministry to people is actually helping them avoid the heat, often by consistently rescuing them from heat and that's sometimes what we do with our parenting and just, oh, I can't have Johnny feel any pain and you just bail him out every time he acts like an idiot. Or maybe never confronting them at all just because you want to be nice or never disagreeing with them at all even though you do just to have it all smooth but nobody grows up at all. Remember Peter? Maybe the best example of this. We've spoken of him so often in Bad Lights. He was a great guy, got to remember. A really good guy. In fact, remember Peter, dial into Peter before his denial of Jesus, that pivotal point of his life. Before the denial, Peter was a good guy, full of really good stuff. Peter, before his denial, loved Jesus from his toes and was passionate about his desire to follow Jesus wherever he went. But then one day, Jesus said to him the most disturbing thing, the kind of thing you'd think someone who loved you wouldn't say to you, wouldn't allow to happen that someone like Jesus would rescue you from. Because what Jesus said to Peter was this, Peter, you're going to be sifted like wheat and I'm not going to do a thing about it. I'm going to let you go through it. You're going to go, there's nothing I can do about it. And it will be no fun when you're sifted like wheat, when the heat gets turned on and your impurities are revealed. But I have prayed for you, thanks, That in the process of this sifting, this tremendous heat that's going to reveal your impurities, Peter, my prayer is that your faith would not fail because the ultimate end of this is this, that when you've turned again and come back to your senses, press through this thing, you can then strengthen your brother. There's operative word there being strength. Why? Because he now has a strength in himself that he didn't have before he went through the fire that revealed the impurity that needed to be skimmed off. And I love it that when the impurity was revealed in Peter, he wasn't condemned. Hunk of metal, worthless! No, you're incredibly valuable. But this impurity, gotta go. And we're not going to pretend it's not there. So that later in his life, Peter could write words like this. It's incredible. He couldn't have written these words earlier in his life, but now he can. 1 Peter 5.10, he says to his friends, I just need you to know that after you've suffered for a little while, here's what I know, that the God of all grace who called you into his eternal glory in Christ will himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. How do you know that? Because he'd been through that. And do you know what people like that understand and experience? They understand and experience the connection between suffering and joy. A joy that at times, especially after you've gone through the heat, is a joy inexpressible and full of glory. There's an intriguing story by way of contrast to what I'm saying here in the book of Jeremiah. I love this one. About a city named Moab that was about to come under judgment from God. The reason for the judgment, according to Jeremiah 48, 11, was because Moab had been at ease since its youth. Undisturbed on his leaves like wine on its dregs. That's an interesting analogy. Dregs or leaves refers to the sediment, you probably know about this, that settles to the bottom of a wine vat or a wine bottle, but mostly in the purifying process. It's the wine vat. And in the process of making the wine, what they would do is they would take the wine, let the sediment settle to the bottom, and then pour it out into another container. And then they'd let the sediment settle and then pour it out again. And each time they would pour it out, there'd be a little less of the sediment, a little less of the dregs. That's how they'd get rid of the dregs. Let it settle, pour it out. Let it settle, pour it out. Let it settle, pour it out. Till all the sediments, all the bitterness, the dregs were gone. But Moab, and this is the comparison, Moab, like a spoiled child, never got poured out. Maybe somebody was protecting Moab. Oh, no, don't let them have any. Never got poured out, never felt the heat, never had to go through. So that now, Moab, actually as a city, it's a city, I mean, could be a person, is useless. Certainly to the purposes of God, but pretty much useless in general. Indeed, the text says, Moab smells like himself. Weird way to say it. Verse 11, end of verse 11, it says, neither has he been emptied from vessel to vessel, that's that purification of wine, nor has he gone into exile, never had any pain. Therefore, he retains his flavor. His aroma hasn't changed. He still stinks. Actually, he smells like himself. Totally self-absorbed. still bitter, undrinkable, full of sediment no suffering, which is so good but no character as well and quite frankly, no understanding of the kind of joy that I'm talking about that can actually come in the context of suffering, indeed people like this never ever understand, much less experience, this weird connection between suffering and joy because in order to make that connection, they need to know some things that they don't know. A second thing, they also need to allow some things. We need to know some things if we're going to make this connection. We need to allow some things as well. Verse 4, let endurance have. Or the implication there is to let this thing run its course. Don't abort it. Don't run from it. Because the fact is this, not everyone who goes through suffering comes out with character. You know that's true. There's a lot of people who suffer who are, they didn't get sweeter in the suffering. And the reason for that, at least in part, is that they and we have grown quite skillful at avoiding the heat, getting out of the heat, not feeling the heat in a variety of ways. The result being that while we've gone through a trial, like James says we will, and suffering as well, we're still just as bitter, angry, blaming, shallow, and empty as we ever were before. In fact, sometimes even more bitter. Which is precisely why the text says, if you don't allow some things to happen here, you'll never get this. Let endurance have. Because it speaks to allowing yourself to feel this thing. to press into this thing, to go through this thing so that maybe you could be changed by this thing, learn from this thing, which is why Richard Rohr says what I quoted a bit ago, we dare not get rid of the pain too soon. That's why the poor, he says, I love this, that's why the poor have a head start on many of us because the poor can't resort to the instant fix. They can't make it go away with an aspirin or a trip or some entertainment. Fact is, he says, most aboriginal people put us to shame with their simple happiness. By the way, anybody who's ever gone on a missions trip with Steve Hansen to some fourth world country, one of the things they come back saying is, I can't believe these people have nothing, but they have joy. What is that? We all scratch our heads. With their simple happiness, patience, and endurance in the presence of difficulties. By trying to handle all suffering through willpower, denial, medication, or even therapy, we've forgotten something that should be obvious. We do not handle suffering. Suffering handles us in deep and mysterious ways that become the very matrix of life, and especially new life. Only suffering and certain kinds of awe, like when the veil gets pulled back on the island of Patmos and you get a vision, so the vision will help you, but guess what else will help you? Suffering. Only suffering and certain kinds of awe lead us into genuinely new experiences. All the rest is merely the confirmation of the old. So let endurance formed by this trial have its perfect result that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. Final thing. If you ever hope to make this connection between suffering and joy, you'd need to value some things. You'd need to deeply desire some things, particularly things like character, substance, integrity, and depth. Because if you don't value those things, you'll never go through. You'll abort it every time. Hebrews 12, 2 again. It's the verse I told you about in the beginning, speaking of Jesus, who for the joy set before him endured the cross. Just kind of dial into this. The joy he had was not, oh, good, I get to suffer. It wasn't what he was doing. That's idiotic. No. But for something he highly valued, deeply desired, like the fullness of our redemption, he endured. And when his enduring of suffering was complete, he put the whole thing in the category he calls joy. John 16, 20. He kind of looks, Jesus is speaking again, and he's looking at this whole thing from a different angle. But again, this verse just confirms, this concept is everywhere. He's speaking of his own suffering and death, and he's trying to prepare his disciples for it, and how they're going to go through it. And he says this to them, truly I say to you, that you will weep and lament, John 16, 20. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow and suffering will be turned to joy. It's like the woman who has a child, verse 21, when she's in travail, she has sorrow because her hour has come, and it's just not fun at all when she's in travail. A lot of suffering there. But when she gives birth to the child, she remembers the anguish no more for joy that the child has been born, but for that suffering that the woman experiences in the childbearing process. To ever be put in the category of joy, she'd have to want that baby. She'd have to deeply desire that baby. She'd have to love it. And this is weird and unfortunate, but not every mother does. And in that case, the pain of childbirth cannot be redeemed. It will never turn to joy because you don't want the baby. Indeed, it will just become another reason, among many reasons, to be bitter, angry, and feel ripped off so in like manner. If you don't care about desire, if you don't highly value the baby, if you don't highly value things like character, integrity, endurance, and death, you'll never be able to understand or experience, much less experience, this biblical connection between suffering and joy and deeds. You'll ever be the victim, the whiner, the weak, all of which raises the question with which I close this morning, what do you want? What is it that you desire in this? A couple of weeks ago, in our first week of dealing with this eighth beatitude, I closed the talk with a poem by Amy Carmichael, and I'm not going to read the whole poem, but she asked this question. Have you no scar? Remember that? Have you no wound? Confused, was she, in the poem, that someone could have followed Jesus for any length of time at all and not had some wound for that some scar. James says you have a scar and wounds, as, well, here's my advice. Mark it up for joy. Put it in the category that you call joy because these kind of things produce endurance. And if you let endurance run its course, if you don't abort it, run from it, blame other people for it, press through it, you will come out fully grown, actually. Fully formed, well-rounded, whole, with all the necessary parts, perfect, complete, lacking nothing, which if what you wanted was character, will be for you joy. So here's the question. In fact, I'd like you to get quiet as you ask yourself this question. In fact, I'd like you to close your eyes and be with God around this question. What do you want? What do you want? What do you desire? Holy Spirit come as we continue to be a people who like your disciples on the hillside are saying yes to you even though we don't understand all of what it means to follow you as we consider these things that just feel so odd to us and foreign to us hang on to us I pray as we say yes to you. What we want is character, integrity, substance, and depth, born of your Spirit. May these things be true and growing among us. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. I'm going to ask the prayer team to make themselves available this morning. For anyone who needs prayer for anything at all, the rest of you are dismissed. God bless you. as you leave.
