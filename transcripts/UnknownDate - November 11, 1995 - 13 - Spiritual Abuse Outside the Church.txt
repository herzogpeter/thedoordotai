. Thank you. Thank you. So, open your Bibles. Thank you. He's a great person. You're over the pinch of the sea, the birds of the air, over every living creature that lives on the ground. There are four blessings involved in that thing. And this is the first, the way the violence is. Those four blessings are blessings, relationships, sexuality, sexuality, sexuality, sexuality, sexuality, sexuality, sexuality. We have a relationship in the church. That's fine. We were in the church. And we have a relationship. And so you go from Genesis 1 to Genesis 2. The context is that God created the church. And therefore, so it's like. And we have a two context. Adam taking the movement, using the Word, creating God in the genes of God's creator, and the Word, like Jesus. And then he, so I'm telling Adam, the creation of a health-based force, the relationship between Adam and Adam, setting up the purpose of the creation of Jesus. and especially on the job that you're going to say what is the best? Now, what happens to what we told about how we're doing? I have some ideas about how the relationship is, but what happens when we see God's sake? When we die out of time, we die. Or when we die out of time, or when we die out of time, this is too much. I think it's because of the two months. But what we're having in the evening is we're looking forward to seeing the world and we're looking forward to seeing the world and we're looking forward to seeing the world in relation to making and with great Thank you. So you go from Genesis 2 to Genesis 3, and you're kind of me, and I'm just a man of humanity. In effect, you separate from Genesis 2. No longer do they want to own God's salvation. No longer do they have the spirit of life, and the spirit of life. No longer do they have the relationship with Jesus. and no longer are they unassamed, unaffrayed, and naked. Why do you live here? What do you live here? Where are you? I'm hiding. Where are you? Adam, where are you? Adam, I'm hiding. I'm hiding. I'm hiding. I'm hiding. I'm hiding. Something really important happens after that, and I think this is so important that I want to spend a little time on it. I quote Genesis 2, and I quote Genesis 3, and they do love to come. The most miserable feature at the beginning of the day was the faith. And you are in our community. You are in your family.. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What happens to the question? Confuse in the whole sexuality of the society because of the great thing of the child is in the way the rest of the family is in the way of life. The company that is also a question that seems to me to be a really important question Thank you. How about fast-forward? Remember whether God says, my lives are going to be right. First of all, you can't be right. You can't be right. You can't be right. It is to be strong and successful that you can't be right. You can't be right. What do you have been given because what you are as a father, what happened to him? What happened to God? What happened to you, God? What happened to you? So the conditions of life are changed, and from poor soul's blessing, you have life that's been destroyed. And really, imagine all of these blessings of God and His family. Where they're hurting you. Where they're suffering, where they're suffering. I don't know. I don't know. What is their relationship? Can you imagine the sorrow that they don't have? They walk into their servants and their wives and their wives and their wives. And what does that actually do? The connection may be a problem. The whole time is actually resulting in the whole history of the world. destruction of human beings. By the way, we are not a bunch of human beings. We are not a great person in the United States. We are not one of them. We are not a good person. Most of them are a good person. What happened here after the destruction of human beings? The first thing to reflect on is there has to be some code I don't know. Thank you. So why is the law given? Was it given to judgment? Was it given to God's life? Was it given more conviction? What's the purpose of the law? Paul's relatively clear about the conviction, or conviction may be a better word than the law. The law is the purpose of the law. But I think that throughout the history of the church, and this was certainly true in the church, in the church of the leaders, the law was to be more as an instrument of judgment than that. So the law has, to me, the purpose of benevolent life as well as generous conviction. That is, the conviction is not to convict me to send me to hell. The conviction is to let me understand what's going on well enough to send me to people. How is the law treated by the church? And how is the image of the law? I don't know the image of the law. I'm afraid of the society. So what's our image of God? If I like the little agent, I don't know. In this little outline, the fact that it's good. How do you see God? If you think of God, do you think of him, God the Father, as warning you to be led to God the Son, to God the Holy Spirit, or do you sometimes think he would rather prepare you, prepare you, to not be seen? Do you ever thought that God made you so much? Thank you. and to help to furnish those things for the person who's in the world. And what's our image there for? And why did we see that? Do you see yourself as that person who is primarily sinful as really as the creative work that God gave you? is you usually see yourself in a form of primarily criteria to work with a fall into a pattern of social behavior that you aid in the best by your own and you're going to be able to do it. One of the ways I'm ready to find this is you can see yourself in a form of a human being. Thank you. Thank you. It got lost. It got lost even by the church. It got lost in thousands. The church turned to Jesus. Why don't you do that? Why do people need a church? Not Jesus. And to what you clearly can do to you. Very interesting. How many of you really, really are? Absolutely. In your heart. When you're told to know. It is your care. Know that grace is absolutely right. Never ever shadowed a doubt. Is it true? Is it true? Thank you. Have you ever seen a full set of Calumas? Not Calumas? It's kind of Jewish common law. Remember, you're talking of Old Testament style Jewish society, secular and secular powers are joined together. And this was the musings of the rabbis over now some 4,000 years as to how you interpret the law. Well, how thick is the law in the Christian?. 21 and a half years. And there are all the people who are living in it. All the God's living in it. My point is that the paracetamines, the Old Testament, the church of Jesus, was so upset at him. It's a lot of sin. It didn't take it from there to there. It's wrong. And a lot of it, not all the Talmudic stuff, it's mean and restricted. And you know, they didn't change it. You know, they didn't change it. A lot of it says, but it's an extension, by man, of the standards that God provides. And that's what made the sense of the day. Thank you. I ended up in a city where we walked about. Saturday morning, everybody was doing the same time as a school, and I'm running through the three-quarters naked. And I think that all the stones were in the asphalt. So I could down that I would have been with a city of a local city. Because I was a teacher. And I watched, personally, the whole city of a community. Thank you. Could it be that he's been so amazing? It has been a great week. It's a great year. of the wichiosity, the passive political behaviorist, and the antithetical to the purpose of God. And that that diffuses the application of society to the extent that we can't ever see. I'm going to give you an example of that. How many sexuals are there about you? 30, 30. Two. You're a little bit beyond two. Well, basically, child. No premarital sex. No adultery, and if you figure out the logic, no one has premaritital sex. I mean, many of you have an extremist. You're having sex. You're not even in context. No demaritual adultery. No marriage. That's true? No marriage, chicken, person, skin, etc. That's true. No homosexuality. That's true. No sex with any situation. Probably part of the law that we've done is to put in the notion that is a job. What? Oh, you can't have premarital sex. You can't have extramarital sex. If you have any sex with anything else, No adultery statement. Any other possible sexual violation. So there are five. I got homosexuality. Each of those laws, by the way, is designed to be designed to be designed to be designed to be designed to be designed. These have been designed to be. For wearing that mask are all the rules that our husband and wife had a relationship with him. What chapter is not true? And what did he do? I had, when I was over at Hope Church, I got this really sad thing for me. And this lady, playing an anonymous group, saying, I really need to talk to somebody, but I'm crazy because I can't face this subject because my husband and wife are doing things that are against God and are perverted. Thank you.... Thank you. God doesn't mean to happen. Anything that shows the purpose of making me and making me show the trust and approach the need to be a spiritual leader, that has to be a person. And I'm not going to say that I can do. I can do that. I also believe that the truth seems like that. The society is, in fact, the real of this place, and I think, in fact, the church is in this whole conference. Another great occasion is the whole Vatican Center of the United States, which is called John the 20th, and it's great to be a representative of the church in the Catholic Church, which is both highly against the community, highly against the community. Thank you. It just couldn't be Jesus on the cross, not as a Christian. You better do something to get us in the church box so we can look at the church. And what's kept people away from the church, by the way, as many visitors of the English, is we got to hang yourself up before you come in. John Wimber, who is the guy who is the church, who is the church of the vineyard, who is the great student of anger. Thank you. I see three periods of history here in one. Thank you. Thank you. between the fall and the reality of the persecution, the Christian and the Christian, the person that God gives you to the people. And there's an age to judgment, and judgment has come in the world of the people. But now I think we live, if you're going to exhibit a name in the distance of the person. is superior in the time, the end time, between the end and the beginning of the end, between the beginning of the earth, where there is the peace, the outcome, the truth, that there is a purposeful, this temptation of the earth, that is our role, role of the truth, which is the point to the cross, and the most unhungerable cross, So the only thing that I think anybody can do is the only thing that has destroyed my relationship with me, and the only source of love that I know of, that I can do, is Jesus. And there should be nothing in this relationship with me. And I think that's it. So, what that means is, sorry, repeat, my history. This is what I mean. Now, the beauty of it is to rest in the relatively consistent, but complete, law of the court. To the very political church, the three-four centuries. Our church has been different from the very early church, which is the church of grace, to the church of grace. We're rolling back. I have to explain my view of the church, including the church of God, but we're going to turn it to the Lord, and we're going to be one of the things we do, making people clear. That's the place that you're doing. But what will the danger of the church now? In our world. When I go to heaven, when I need to be the faith in the church, why would you be the church in the church? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
