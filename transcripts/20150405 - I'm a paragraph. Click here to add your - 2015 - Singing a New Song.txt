After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, "Come, up here, and I will show you what must take place after this." At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. Surrounding the throne were 24 other thrones, And seated on them were 24 elders. And in the center, around the throne, were four living creatures. And they were covered with eyes in the front and in back. And then I saw a lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne. And the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the lamb, and they sang a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book and break its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation. Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders. In a loud voice they were saying, worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise. Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and all that is in them saying, to him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb, Be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever. And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshiped. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Wow. Thank you, Nina. And they sang a new song, said John in the Revelation that Nina just read from. And Revelation is kind of a weird place to find ourselves on an Easter Sunday because it raises this question, what could anything in the book of Revelation have to do with Easter? Well, it turns out it has a lot to do with a song. And there were actually two songs. In fact, the text that Nina just read, most of what she read was a song. In fact, both of the songs that are in the beginning of Revelation are things that she just said. But both of the songs, the words of which you just heard, were in stark contrast to the songs that we heard last week. And if you were here last week, you will remember. Because the songs we heard last week came from a fickle crowd that greeted Jesus as he rode into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey. And the crowd was saying on that particular day, Hosanna to the son of David. We are sure that he is the king, blessed is he, who comes in the name of the Lord. But five days later, that same crowd on Friday was singing a different song because they were singing and shouting, not Hosanna, but crucify him. And they did crucify him because on Friday he's dead between two thieves, nailed to a cross. But now it's Sunday. And on Sunday, we begin to hear a very different song, sung by a very different choir for very different reasons, because they saw very different things, these two choirs, these two crowds, not a man riding on the colt of a donkey, but the choir we're hearing from today saw a lamb standing, as if it had been slain, and the song that they were singing was not Hosanna to the Son of David, but worthy is the Lamb, to take the book and break its seals. And the song that was being sung was being sung not by the fickle crowd that greeted Jesus as he came into Jerusalem in Matthew 21, but the choir this time is made up of the 24 elders and the four living creatures and the voice of many angels and the number of them was thousands of thousands and ten thousands of ten thousands and the song they were singing was apparently a new song because they'd already been singing a song. I told you a second ago there were two songs at the beginning of the Revelation. And the first song they sang, you heard Nina say it. I'm going to give it to you again. Chapter 4, verse 8. Around the throne, picture that. It is around the throne. The day and night they did not cease to say, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come. And whenever the living creatures would give glory and honor and thanks to him, to him who sits upon the throne and who lives forever and ever, the 24 elders would fall down before him who sits upon the throne and they'd worship him who lives forever. And they'd lay their crowns before the throne saying, you are worthy, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and praise. Why? Answer here. For you have created all things. That is why you are worthy of glory, honor, and praise. and by your will they were created and have their being, and that's the first song. In the book of Revelation, it's a marvelous song, and so they worshiped and they sang what's come to be known. Actually, technically, that is known as what I just read, the song of creation, and the angels have been singing that song since the beginning of creation. For you have created all things, and by your will they were created. And so they sang and they said, you are worthy, but that's just the first song. We're just getting started here because in verse 9 of Revelation 5, they began to sing another song. Indeed, it was a brand new song. They called it a new song that no one had ever heard before because no one had ever sung it before, not even conceived of it. It's a song, quite frankly, that stunned the angels. They'd never conceived of this themselves. This was not just the song of creation. This was now the song of recreation. It's the song of redemption, of redeeming, of reclaiming and restoring and renewing. Indeed, it is the song of resurrection. It is the Easter song, and that's what Revelation has to do with Easter. And John, through this vision, got to see it. He got to hear it, and what it looks like, he got to see and hear what it sounds like in heaven that is the worship around the throne and then through this language in Revelation that's kind of bizarre but what it is is just filled with metaphor and symbol, a kind of poetry. John describes it or tries to describe it to us so that we can see it too, so that we can hear it too. But the ultimate intent of his sharing this picture is not just so we can see it or hear it, it's so that we can join it. This is very important because this is precisely what we do. What I'm talking about here is precisely what we do. We don't always know what we do when we worship. That when we do worship, what we were doing just a few moments ago as we were lifting our hands and our hearts to God, what we're doing when we're doing that is joining something. We're not starting something. We are joining something that is already moving. It is already happening. We're simply adding our voices to a choir. Get this. So a choir that is already singing, it's been singing since the beginning of time, quite frankly. We're joining our voices to angels who are already bowing. So stop weeping, John. Said one of the elders to John in chapter 5, verse 5, stop weeping. He had reason to weep. He was alone in exile on the island of Patmos. All of his friends, his disciples had already died. He was the only one who didn't die a martyr's death. And now he's in this lonely place. That was his hardship. And some of the reality of God's glory had begun to dim to him. So God gives him this vision. And finally, the elders come to him and say, Stop weeping, John. We have something to show you. So look, or behold, all is not lost, as you suppose. For the lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has overcome. And he did it the craziest way, John. The lion overcame by becoming a lamb. And then says John in verse 6, I saw a lamb looking as if it had been slain, but it was standing, which is weird because it looked like it was slain, but it was, so that means it's dead, but it's standing, which means it's not dead, I'm confused, but to make it even weirder, says John, it was standing at the center of the throne encircled by the four living creatures and 24 elders, which means this lamb that looks like it's dead is very much alive. And the 24 elders all fell down before the lamb, it says in verse 8. And that's when I started hearing the song, says John. And it was a new song that they started singing different than the first. Because in the first song, they sang, they sang, and they said, You are worthy, our Lord and our God, for you have created all things. And by your will, they were created. But in the second song, they sang it a little different. They sang and they said, you are worthy, our Lord and our God, just like the first. But this time, they were saying that not because you created all things, but because you were slain. This is strange. And so, they sang a new song in verse 9. Saying, worthy is the Lamb, you are worthy. to take the book and break its seals because you were slain. But that's not the end of the story. You were slain, and with your blood, you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation. And then, says John, it got crazy in this scene I was seeing, certainly louder, when in verse 11, to this chorus of praise, the voice of many angels was added to the mix. And all of them were saying, The 24 elders, the four living creatures, and the voice of many angels were saying and singing with a very loud voice, Worthy are you, our Lord, and our God, and worthy is the Lamb. This is the praise that is continually going on in heaven, which means that now with that phrase I just gave you, the angels and the 24 elders and the four living creatures are singing both of the songs at the same time. Good verse 13. Because now every created thing, see it on the screen. Now every created thing, not just angels and elders and all that. Every created thing in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in the sea. All of them are singing and saying, first of all, to him who sits upon the throne. Stop right there. They're singing to him who sits upon the throne. Who's that? That is God, the father who sits upon the throne. And to the lamb, who's that? That is God, the son. So to him who sits upon the throne, God the Father, and to the Lamb, God the Son, be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever and ever and ever. And the four living creatures kept saying amen and the elders kept falling down. We'll talk about that later. And they worshiped the one who sits upon the throne and they worshiped the Lamb. Let me tell you a little bit about the choir. This is fun. Let me set the scene for you so that maybe we can see it and maybe we can hear it and maybe we can join it. Four images I'm going to give you. And they're all in the text. The first image is this, chapter 4, verse 1. John says, the first thing I saw was this. I saw a door and it was open, which is good. And it was standing, interesting language. I saw a door and it was standing and it was standing open in heaven. Huge message, particularly to John. It's one for us as well. But John, I told you a minute ago on the island of Patmos in exile, very discouraged. I got something to show you, John. There's a door standing open in heaven and it's open for you. Second image is a throne. I saw a throne standing in heaven as well under verse 2. But here's the big part of the throne. I saw a throne standing in heaven and I also saw one sitting on the throne. So the door is open and the throne is occupied. Third image, I saw a lion, and the lion had conquered. And fourth image is a lamb who is standing as if slain, and then we meet the choir. I've been talking about 24 elders and four living creatures, and it's all very weird. Let me break this down for you so you can enter into the list a little more. The 24 elders is fascinating. Lots of study has been done on this. And most believe that, well, actually it is. The number 24 is a symbolic number. So it's not actually 24 people or something around the throne. Literally, it's symbolic of two sets of 12. And most of the scholars that I read, and I think this is true, what it's speaking to are the 12 patriarchs of the Old Testament and the 12 apostles of the New Testament. You put them together, you have 24. So what you have, the Old Testament, you have the New Testament, and it's not just 24 people from that group and 24 or 12 people from that group. You have all of the Old Testament saints is what you have. Symbolically, they're embodied in this number 12. And you have all of the New Testament saints symbolically referenced or embodied in this number 12. And you add them all up, you have 24. But it's not actually 24. Actually, what's before the throne. When I say 24 elders from now on, it's all of us. We are among the 12. New Testament, redeemed ones. and the twelve from the Old Testament are there as well singing and saying the Old Testament and the New Testament to patriarch the apostles all of the saints of old all of us as well you are worthy our Lord and our God to receive glory and honor and power for you have created and you have been slain worthy is the lamb and the one who sits on the throne and then the four living living creatures. I want to introduce you to them. Four living creatures are actually angels, but their description is not what they look like. I'm going to give you their description in a second. It's not what they look like. It's more what they do. It's what they're like in function. So in verse 6, for instance, it says that these four living creatures were covered with eyes. That's not what they look like because that would be weird. The whole book of Revelation is weird, so just get used to that. They're covered with eyes, in the front and the back, but what that means, it's a symbolic thing. What that means is they see. What that means is they know. What that means is they're attentive. First creature of the four, verse 7, is like a lion. It doesn't look like a lion, it's like a lion, and what it speaks symbolically to is power. Second creature is like an ox, which speaks to service of a domesticated animal and that's among the things the angels do. They give service to God. They don't look like an ox. It's like an ox. It's all symbolic language. The third creature had the face of a man which speaks to reason. The fourth creature was like a flying eagle which speaks to speed in the four living creatures. It says in verse 8, each one of them having six wings and covered with eyes all around, even under its wings, which is weird. It's kind of spooky. It's symbolic language. It's not what they look like, it's what they were like. They could see and they knew, they were aware, they were attentive mostly to God. And day and night, these angels who see and know and have power like a lion and serve like a domesticated animal did not ever cease to say, at the end of verse 8, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty for he was and is and is to come. He is holy. He is mighty. He is eternal. Then the choir begins to grow. To the 24 elders, which we are a part of, see yourselves as part of the 24 elders and the four living creatures, come the voice of many angels who number thousands of thousands and thousands of ten thousands. And then in verse 13, the choir is finally complete because now every created thing, in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and everything in the sea, joins the chorus and all of them begin to sing and to say, to him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be glory and honor and dominion and praise forever and ever and ever. To which the four living creatures kept saying, amen, amen. And the 24 elders fell down and worshiped. They fell down and worshiped. Worship, they did that a lot, this falling down thing. Apparently a clumsy group, are we? Actually, it's a fabulous, fascinating picture. Listen to this in chapter 4, verse 10. It says this, That the 24 elders will fall down before him who sits upon the throne, and they will worship him who lives forever, casting their crowns before the throne. Why would they cast their crowns before the throne? Why will we cast our crowns before the throne? Because when you get into the throne room, first thing you're going to realize is the only one should be wearing a crown is the one who sits upon the throne. Chapter 5, verse 8, it says that the 24 elders fell down. There they go again. They fell down before the lamb, and as they did, it's us falling down. They sang a new song saying, worthy are you, worthy are you to take the scroll and break its seals. Chapter 5, verse 14, they go down again and then again in chapter 11, verse 16. And they go down again in chapter 19, verse 4. They fell on their faces and worshiped God, saying, We give you thanks. For you are the one who is worthy. And because you are worthy, you are the one who can make it right. A little side note here about angels. A little angel trivia for you here. You probably didn't, but maybe you did. I don't know. notice that in the readings of this text that the angels never sing. They always speak. For example, chapter 4, verse 8 of the Revelation, day and night they did not cease to say. Chapter 5, verse 12, this is speaking of the angels, the four living creatures. I heard a voice, the voice of many angels saying, saying, not singing, saying with a loud voice. Indeed, in Luke chapter 2, that Christmas scene where the angels show up and scare everybody, It says that suddenly there appeared a host of angels praising God and saying, glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, goodwill to men. And some of you are thinking, what about that song, Hark the Herald Angels Sing? It's a song. It's not the Bible. Anyway, but it really is fascinating. There's people who think about stuff like this because the explanation for this angels speaking and others singing is that singing is reserved for the redeemed. And it causes the angels to wonder and marvel when they hear the singing. It's reserved for human beings who've been touched by the redemption of God because singing, and I think this is important to see, singing allows us, we human beings, we're part of that group, the 24 elders. That's who we are. It allows us to express praise and glory to God in ways that transcends our speech. So I've got to shut up really soon so we can get back to something that transcends a talk. It allows us to express praise and glory to God in ways that even angels don't understand, but they approve. That's why they say, amen, and amen, and amen, said the four living creatures. But now for some bad news. Just got to temper all this hyper party atmosphere in here today. Actually, I need to give you this to prepare you a little bit because the worship that's gathered around the throne of God from the 24 elders and the four living creatures and the thousands of angels, you need to know that the worship will be loud. It will be loud. Which is really bad news for some of you because... The reason I know it will be loud is because all of them, It says in verse 12, we'll be singing and saying with a loud voice, worthy is the Lamb. But you need to get this. No one in heaven, when it's really that loud, will be gathered around the throne and going kind of like this. In all sorts of pain. Because everyone there, including all of us, will be going like this. With hands held high. And they will be held high to Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb. and it will be loud. And so the song continues and we get to join it and so the choir grows and so Joel and the band comes back up on the stage wherever there you are. You are so obedient. I love this. I have so much power. And I'm wondering if you can hear it. Maybe without knowing it you heard it when we were worshiping before. I wonder if you can see it, that there really is a door in heaven, and it is open. And there is a throne in heaven, and it is occupied by him who sits upon it. And then I saw a lion from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, and he is overcome, and he did it by becoming a lamb. And then I saw a lamb looking as if it had been slain, but it was standing. And it was standing in the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the 24 elders and a myriad of angels, which means this lamb that looks as if it's slain is very much alive. Indeed, I am the living one. He says in Revelation 117, the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end. And yes, I was in fact dead, but behold, I am alive forevermore. And that's when the 24 elders and the four living creatures, we are among them. And the voice of many angels began to say and sing with a very loud voice, worthy are you, our Lord and our God, for you have created all things. And worthy is the Lamb, for you have recreated all things. And that is the song being sung. This very moment, in the throne room of God, and while I hope you can see it and I wish we could hear it, what I know we can do is to join it. And when we do, we simply add our voices to the choir that is already singing, and to angels who are already bowing, and the 24 elders who are probably already falling down, and the four living creatures who are saying, Amen, Amen. So let's try to catch up with all that that's all happening right now.
