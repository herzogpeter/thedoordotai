I think if you can read us last year for this, you're really proud of me, besides the spirit of life, it's sort of the spirit of preparation for the coming of the game. Why God does it just this? Last week, God, in order to do that, he was in the right corner, Mary, Mary, Mary, and Mary, chapter one. Mary, Mary, Mary, is simply this. The life of God is conceived physically in Mary. The life of God is conceived in her, Mary, and her, stretching her and changing her. And finally coming from her, changing the world around the life that she was making up because the one that was born in her was great and he was the king of kings. The power of that Mary miracle, it's not just that it happened inside of Mary, but that is wonderful and unique, the way it happened to her. The real wonder of it we discovered is that that same miracle in Mary, so the work of redemption is something that happens in all of us. The same life that was born in earth is born in us and born in us and comes from us. The change is the world around us. Our life is the life of Christ. Today, I'd like to turn it to Matthew's Gospel in the 2nd chapter, the 1st, 2nd verse 12. Let's be examined. Let's look at the three responses to the hundred people. Indeed, we should probably call them three common responses to the hundred people. Thank you. The fact that Mark presented Jesus primarily as the Son of Man, presented Jesus to the man of God, and the other man presented Jesus as the Son of God, presented Jesus as his deity, and the Lord who gave flesh to the Lord among us, and we have his glory as every holy God, the Son of God, full of grace and truth. Contrary to the man of God, he presented Jesus as the king, and the king presented by virtue of that kingliness, has a right to rule your life, of your family, to business, and our world. That's the first and the second thing that goes on with the Matthew, is an examination of the various responses of people to that kingly claim. The author of Matthew, the beginning of the night, we would see people sometimes stopping, sometimes cheering, sometimes following, sometimes cheering who it is Jesus was and what it is himself. All those two things go from beginning to end. It may begin, and it may manifest itself after being really, very, very good. So, chapter 1, through Matthew's exposure of the genealogy of Christ, and by its announcement of his birth, Matthew, chapter 1, presents Jesus as the king. Chapter 2, the first human response to the coming of that king, This is one for children. We'll see three responses from all invited in three people, or two groups of people. First of all, the wise men were familiar with family members, the magi. The second response was from the king, and he was one of the times when he was married. The third response was from the religious establishments, and we will see you and give your body by a group called the chief Jesus Christ. I'd like to read all of them by reading the stories starting in verse 1 and 1, chapter 2. Now, after Jesus is born, welcome to him to the east. He's going to be king, the old Magi from the east. So why Jesus is in the east and the south? Where is he just been born to the Jews? For we saw this story in the east and the corner of the east. And there he is, the king of the east, and the east and the east. And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes, and the people began with fire of them where Christ was to be born. And they said to him, and that is they knew, it's interesting that they knew, that will I have them to be. So so it has been written by the prophets. And then they quote Melodized chapter 5. And he left when I landed here, I've got no means peace among the leaders of Jesus. So out of yourself come forth and you, and you will shepherd my people his name. Then he was sick of the congregation, and I was entertained from them. The time is started here. They said, Don't make air for such a child. You need to find him to put to me. But I too am going to wish you. You haven't heard the camera running away. No, the star is standing here. Went out before you. He said, He was standing there. Other than what the child was. When he saw the star, they rejoiced the seemingly great joy. At the beginning, the star they had seen and went toward the star and just went in to the end. And then it says, And then it says, responses, common responses by people. We're playing to Christ's words. And let's make first of all the magic. I particularly enjoy kind of talking about who the magic I really are because most of the time we know about the magic I've arrived here comes to us from Christmas cards and Christmas cards from Christian heart. When you think about it, I don't know if it's a message, you know, but it's going to show someone first with someone. I only have some guys that are in common, because we're very hard. Most of us, especially three guys, and some of you sometimes are in common, and most of the time, you're like, you're famous. And it's a star, and it's a star. I got my understanding of, and as I really moved, from the song, you can be like, we're drinking, somebody's trying to speak about this guy. And that's basically what I got. My whole theology, I don't know if I'm just a question, Yeah, we're not on the way to cover that. And then those tracks getting to face on anger, it was one that they exploded, but we never started. Fitzgrey, that was quite good. Now, the funny thing, the reason I'm sharing that is because I would probably like, and I think it's funny, but the other reason is, yeah, it's a story, it's a story about who these guys are. It's kind of gotten mixed up a little bit. It's Ben Fitzgrey, the story of who writes this about that. Many of certain Christians, especially, have had this Christmas Christ's dream fondly of a popular belief, often by Christian hearts. In the Middle Ages, there was a big thing. It wasn't until the Middle Ages that it was five, but they were three in number. Representatives of three families, Dr. D. Sham, Pam, and J. F. They were three sons of God. It was then in the Middle East also that another piece of the traditional religion was added that one of them is black. You know, thought to be for each other. You often see two people like one of them is black. It's not just about people like three of them. It's about the one of them is maybe other. But then that level is through the Middle Ages. They were even given names. They thought to be passed by. But to be used with a friendly, wise man. Now, where do I go again? Where do I go? Thank you.. Thank you. But he wants to be a peace to Israel. Well, the part of the empire east of Israel had the same dynamic. And one of their tribes was the Magi tribe. A little more perspective. History. As time of Christ, there are two great empires in the world. The first great empires wanted to move on while you were the highest level of $2 to a woman empire. But they were strong from Israel with every predominantly Israel and everything west of Israel into most of Europe. The second place of the world power is the time of the Parthian Empire. You might even have a bit more perspective on the Parthian Empire than I think in Galilee. It was previously the Babylonian Empire. The Babylonian Empire, the Parthian Empire, some of us know it's the land of the Medes and Persians. But the Parthian Empire is a powerful empire. It was never strong enough to really be a threat to overthrow God, but it was left to be a useless term. The things that the party empire didn't realize had an impact. The empire found that these directions were broken, knock off certain things here and there. The man died, just to get the status quo, you will find this party empire, power for the party to be used to be used. Now, in their world, it's preached to the party empire. They're listening to the party party for the party. So they're listening to the party empire. Why do you want to switch to the party empire? Thank you. They ended up wrestling with magic. Some of them pushed the envelope beyond magic, into sorcery, and that would be the ultimate. So therefore, in the Magi, there were a bit of a more demonic empowerment for their wisdom. A demonic empowerment for their ability to even interpret truth. And they had some more power. Too much of an impression out of it, that all of the Magi were of that. So some of them were not evil, some of them were God-fearing. In fact, there were really more interesting revelations about who the Magi were. It was a confusing mystery. You get back into the book of Daniel, and you discover some pretty bizarre thought, actually, where it says in Daniel chapter 5, verse 11, that Daniel himself had risen to a place in Babylon and was becoming the chief of the Magi. And you read that right in Daniel chapter 5, verse 11. And where that happened was in the Babylonian captivity, and the women of the saints of people, And every one of them had just because of his wisdom, that his connection, not being taught, but with the right and power of God, a demonstrated wisdom that's from the Bible. And a listen to this person would shoot the Magi. A strong man, some influence, a godly kind of influence, years and years before Christ, upon the Magi. And he had just taken a mind that they had become advisors to the Magi. Interesting thing about the Magi, many of us, you know, cards and things, I was impressed with that they were kings. The Magi became one of those kings. They were, however, known as king-makers. Indeed. There was no king that ever sent to the Babylonian Empire that wasn't by the Magi chosen. When they traveled, they would have traveled in full of the other. One one is called Carnival Hats. They were hats that came from a lawn and salooned lawn. They came to fun with material coming out of particular slacks inside and knuckles under their chin. What might look like a beautiful house. It's really a sign of how they were wearing their gloves and brightly colored, elaborately detailed. And just to look at them would mark them out as being people of great authority. If you would know they would describe what they were. We have this impression that they were a camel, so we can have that sort of a park to be part of the sea. And in truth, it was far more likely that they were pushing more horses. It was far more likely that there were 12 of them being free. Most of these stories believe that that would have been the number that had traveled this kind of distance. And there's some questions for that kind of movement, and the number of 12 would have been more likely. And so we question more on whether they're going to be free. We never would have traveled alone. There were two fighters, the parking and the parking. The parking area, the parking area, the head fire. They would have never traveled alone. And most of the historians agree that at least 1,000 soldiers would have attended one's So we can picture a cell phone. Three non-districts rise on camels. It's not just that. It's not just that. Non-district rise on camels. In a truce of a sliding image of history, they were universally recognized king members. A great empire in Eastern Israel, over a thousand in number right in person world. So when it says in verse 3 that Aaron was troubled, Now you get a little picture of why he was trying. These guys were impressive, and they had some clients. A couple things to note. I'm going to back off this, so it would be more involved in what's going on. They were looking for a king, and at that particular time in history, their king, Srede IV, was incompetent, had been deposed, and literally the party empire was looking for his replacement. So there would be suspicion when they start writing in the town and thinking, I became here. I do not feel like they're killed. I think what I'm just going to show you in my opinion. I don't think that they believe that this Jesus they were seeking was the king that they were searching for politically. Even though they needed it. A couple of weeks, he said he's three, which is why I think that, number one, Jesus, this Jesus they were looking for in Jerusalem. The second reason I don't think they saw these going to be a political thing, is that they themselves, the fruits of the one they're looking for, is to become the right. It's true. And so that's already eliminated. The most important reason, to me, is yes. When they finally did see it in verse 11, it says they worshipped him, and by virtue of them, they worshipped alone. And in the case, that there was something in them that recognized the one that they discovered here as being more than a political war. More than a human king, he was the king of kings. And somehow, they knew that. They might not have known that's exactly who he was as they were seeking God. But when they saw him, I love the way it says that in the text, and when they saw him, verse 11, they fell down and worshipped him as the one they recognized as being this king. Not only the one who chose to be, but the king is. So you're giving the question, how do you think they knew that? Maybe there was just some revelation, some God just kind of showed them a place that heaven may be. But I think there are some things going on beforehand And that at least opened them up and disposed them to recognize the kind of things when he did. And he revealed himself. And some of his stuff has already been a bit more about me. In 586 BC Israel was taken in one spot, the Babylonian captivity. The Babylonian Empire, this is what I've already told you, what eventually became a part of the empire. And during the Babylonian Empire and God's people, many of the people during captivity advocated their faith. But there was always what the Bible calls a remnant of faithful men and women to die, even in their captivity. Daniel was one of those faithful people. And as he was in the position of promise, she would imagine, just read the book of Matthew and see his influence on the culture. They even tried to kill him at one point. God saved him from the lion's den, and from that, his wisdom and his power, his connection with God, was recognized that he had an important influence on that culture for God. And you can be sure that among the things that Daniel spoke of was his hope and the Messiah to come, and that hope had been born in others as well. Now, understand, many of the Magi were still involved in the world, And they had no pursuit of God, but there was even among the magic of women that two seekers were true. And specifically, of the God that this Daniel used to be spoke of. So that when they did see the star, they at least began to wonder, I wonder, I wonder if that has something to do with what Daniel spoke of in the sign of the congregation, to seek it out. The Magi, the Magi in my mind, are the embodiment of what we call a secret. A true secret. Who's seen enough of raising light, something that looks real to them. They don't tell them what it is, but they've set the course of their life to try and discover what that is. They're asking questions of anyone in need. Where is this? Where can I find this? I wonder what's the sky. What was the sky? Thank you. Thank you.. It's the gospel theme around the magic of the second stage. Side note. But what it says when the angel of the Lord appeared to peace and shepherds, it says, glory of the Lord, what? Shown round and above and made it so. It's right. Get the picture. All from the station, the glory of Jesus Christ, the Lord, manifest itself as light and bright and bright. It's true. The Israelites in the world, in response to Christ, this is a part of light by day, a part of fire by night. And God revealed himself to Moses in his glory. Moses asked, God, would you show me your glory? And God miraculously decided to reveal his glory to Moses. Hit him in a rock so he wouldn't be consumed by it. What Moses saw in the mother of Jesus was light and bright and shining. And so contempt was it that it literally got on Moses. So that when he came down from the mountain, there was a glory even above Moses. Transfiguration. The moon is going to fall from the sky. All the stars will be obliterated, but it will not be dark. The sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and the whole earth will be filled with the radians of His glory, and they will shine, and it will be bright and light. The glory of God always manifests itself as light. The sign of the Son of Man of the second coming of Christ is going to be bright. I suppose that the sign of the Son of Man of the first coming of Christ was light as well. It might have been a star. It might have manifested in the number of ways. Whatever it was, I think it was the glory of God. Verse 2, it says they saw his star. The Greek word for star means astare. It does mean star. It also means blazing forth. It also means simply to shine. I think what they saw is shepherds, and now these magi, what they saw was his blazing forth, his shining light. the first sign of the Son of Man coming down to evade the life of a little baby the first sign of the Son of Man the second sign of the Son of Man I think a good question about that by the way I didn't taste it when people would ask me because I had the answer they said why won't they give us a swear God to show him like a bright light why why didn't they give us why did they give us a light of the separate scene the magic of the bright of the earth I don't know. Satan has blinded the eyes of those who believe to the Latin gospel, which he said in Matthew. Let me give you another picture that I'm already kind of alluded to. I remember talking to you in the Old Testament. I'm wondering if the world was a presence of God, a cloud of light by day, and a full of fire by night. One of the stories that I'm all familiar with is when the people of Israel were set free from Egypt. They came, first of all, after one, they came to the Red Sea. And by this time, Pharaoh changed his mind. He said, I want to actually send Pharaoh's eyes. Pharaoh's eyes out together. And the people were saying, you know, now they're talking about God. Because they couldn't cross the sea, and Pharaoh's eyes was on the way. Before, we read St. Carver. We know that part of the story. Something else everyone we don't know a lot about. And that is this. This light of fog by day and pillar of fire by night. The light of the front of them, leading them forward. At this particular time, the Bible says it went behind the people of Israel. Indeed, what it did in going behind the people of Israel was get between the people of Israel and the army of Israel. And what the Bible says is interesting about the light, the Father's light, and the full fire was this. That those two things were to the Israelites' light by day and by giving them direction. But those same two things, the Egyptians, was done. We won't look at the same thing. The Israelites saw light and hope. The Egyptians saw darkness and that light. The Satan said it's a symbol. It's a picture of the fact that Satan has darkened the eyes of the world. He doesn't believe it. Okay, that's the mantra. Picture them as, among other things, Satan. They've seen a star, the blazing forth. Maybe they saw nothing more than the reality of the life of God in you. And now the race is in a sinking and they're asking a question, what did I find this one? What did I find this child? So it's like, don't worry. Okay, that's the full signal. That's me hearing that. Praise the Lord to God. The first thing you need to know about hearing is not a true truth. It's what's called an ingenuity. It was pointed by one to me to take the truth. And you may have to say, God was met in Israel by no small amount of percentage. He was not king by right. He was king by appointment. He had tremendous power. He could put the hurt on many, many people. But it was not his king. And that's why I believe that the part that says this to him is troubled. It wasn't just that the man died out of our policies, this is the presence. But it says in verse 2, yes, the question was, where is he who has been healed? Thank you. As do most parents. And that's why they have to be even more angry and more despotic in their future of other people. Because they know they're pretending. You tell me a little bit more about it. He was capable of a contest, and he really wouldn't erase the rights of the Christian power of God if he wanted to. He was a great woman in cities, and he saw she really got it. But he was also a religious fellow, driven by jealousy and turmoil. Thank you. Do the same thing in Israel, so we kill all of them. That's very good. He has 10 wives, 12 children, one is called "Funding Wives," and he's wondering if you don't know about them, the one in the New York Times, who was a high priest in Jerusalem, and Herod feared him simply because of his power. He made possible to use so he will cause Herod not to get rid of him. So he was back in the race for the murder. And he just said what he did. He's very hot, great. He's used to it. He decided to go to terrible thing. I guess what you're calling him. I'm thinking of something. I'm going to go to Jericho. Jericho threw up his hand in his sports suit. And they'd go there to swim. What he did was he raised his hand in the guise of the play. He's going to play it out in the water. He had four or five or six inches. He holds Mary on his brother and he's a one. And he's going to play it out. He's going to play it out. He's going to play it out. He's going to play it out. Thank you. See what it says, verse 3. He really was troubled in more ways than one. But it also says in verse 3, And all Jerusalem was troubled with him. When you get to know Herod, now you know why all of Jerusalem is troubled. Because when Herod's troubled, you're in trouble. When Herod's troubled, heads grow and heads get grow. Let me do this. Let me do this. Now when Herod saw him, he did the ship by the man, he became a rage.. And scribes and Christians, the last of us, in this world. As Christ has said, it's two Christmas scribes that are pulling together and buying the religious establishment. Scribes in particular, they're the Bible scholars, they're the experts in the law. Here are two kinds of scribes in this world. At the time, they were the scribes who were part of the Pharisee party and the scribes who were part of the Sanctuary party. And actually, first I'm ever studying this stuff. It was a real revelation to me. There were different theological facts, and that things hadn't changed that much. Pharisees were what we would call conservative conservatives. They were the middleists. They were also half the liberalists that never had belonged to them. They were what we might even call the fundamentalists. The Pharisees, on the other hand, were the liberalists. They were the ones who did not believe in fantasy. They did not believe in miracles, angels. or the resurrection. Any resurrection. They didn't believe in the resurrection of the dead. They were the liberals. Those two theological groups who always are here to be covered, they never got along except for one thing. As Jesus' ministry began to emerge and take the place of prominence, the one thing that Sadducees and Pharisees can agree on is both of them despise Jesus. I have a theory about why they do. It's this. When you have people who are religious but lack spiritual power, they have the knowledge, they have the words, but they do not have the power. And then they are exposed to, or they have someone come in their midst, just picture this in church. Everybody's got the Bible, but still have worship, but there's this spiritual death. And then someone comes to church who has viable, real spiritual life and power. They really know God and walked by the Spirit. This person's power makes their religious impotence look as weak as it really is. And generally, these people don't like that. And so they hated Jesus, and then they got together. But most of the time, the Sadducees and Pharisees were arguing points of doctrine. Now picture it seen historically when Jesus arrived, God had come. Now the Sadducees and Pharisees are arguing from the Bible points of doctrine. God came and did this. That's what religious do all the time. We got the Bible question right, verse 4. God in the chief, Jesus Christ, began on fire. Where is this Christ to be born? And they said to him, God's question right, in Bethlehem, all Judea. So it's been written by the prophet Micah. And then they recited the Bible verse. They knew the Bible. They just didn't know the God who wrote it. So when the word became flesh and blood among them, they were born. And we're going to do religious stuff. You never know what God's stuff is. Okay. We're going to do three people speak. Group six people. Pull up together. They embody and see common response. Let's go see those things. The first response, embodied in earth, is some response to the gospel. By some, it's hostility. The community is hostility. is simply from the acknowledgement, the fact that Jesus is a rival king, and make no mistake about that. Jesus is a rival king, and he alone has a right to rule. Your life, your family, your business, our church, this city, this world. The herods of the world, in fact, I would call it a herod spirit. The herods of the world say fundamentally this. It's my life. It's my way. I am the king. I run the show, I call the shots. Jesus, without saying a word, simply by his existence as the king of kings, seen in hunting in that chapter 2 as a baby. He has a baby, he didn't say a word, he has a place to serve you. I'm sorry. Aaron got hostile by the very existence of Jesus as the king of kings. Jesus says, by virtue of his kingly claim, No, you don't run the show. No, you don't call the shots. You are not the king. I am the King James Shepard for you. Verse 7 says this. Submit, therefore, to God. Step number one to getting your life aligned to God who made you is to submit to the kingly authority of the God of the universe. The word there, submit, we learned several months ago in James, It means to line your life up underneath him. Sign me up under him. Remember that? The spirit of Herod hears that and says, no way. I may kind of add some religious stuff to my life. I may go to church now and then I may tip my head to God. But sign up under him as the authority of him. Get it out. And it becomes possible to push. The common response to Jesus, If Jesus simply remains just impotent, well, if you're impotent, make him mild, no crime on your life until you can just hear it from himself. But when Jesus is presented as who he is, the God of the universe, to whom every day will one day bow and every tongue will confess that he is your glory father. You press that now on a hair of spirit, you will get us there in a second. It's a body in the real establishment. And that response to advocacy, they have a difference. You know the verse, but they don't know what to do. Now, this response that we saw from the scribes and chief priests, it's not as physically vile as he was. It was just as dangerous. The religious establishment spirit, the chief priest or scribe spirit, this person who is involved in the program, they know the Bible, They maybe get confirmed. To answer correctly, when the question is asked, where do you find this one who's called Christ? In Bethany, no the Bible goes. They are religious. They go to church. They might even go to this church. They might be Baptists. They might be Catholics, Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians. They might even be good Catholics. You might even call them good Catholics, Methodists. through his place to his promise. They just do not know the God of whom they speak. They do not know the God they say they serve. They're not that hard to spot. It's sometimes hard to admit. The difference is who they really are. They're not that hard to spot, however. For even today, when God begins to move in their family or in their church or in a city, when God begins to move or when God begins to speak, The religion is invariably missing, are unable to see it, and if they do see it and are unable any longer to avoid it or deny it, they resist it. And that's one of the things, by the way, you see I see Matthew as well. The religion is designed to ignore Jesus, and then all of a sudden when the power is true to begin to affect people's lives, that he made visible, they begin to tell him that he did what he did by the power. You can see the Spirit of God fall on a church. That has a religious spirit. Just for example, when the Spirit of God begins to move that place, and I promise you, you will begin to see a religious spirit rise up against the real work of God. And on one hand, they won't notice what God is doing. And after a while, they will be cheap opposition. Sometimes people are on the board. They can still have it. So history is a common history. The third response of most compelling, this response to somebody in the Magi, the least likely people have the response to the King of Kings, these Gentiles and the Jews, and their response was worship and adoration. Think about this with me. Of all three groups, Herod, J.P. Scribes, or the Magi, I think it could be argued that the Magi probably knew the least about who Christ was and where he could be found. By the way, they had some recollection of Daniel and his teaching, but it had been separated by years, and maybe that word from Daniel is what made them even notice him in the first place, but they didn't know where to go. They weren't sure where to find him. They were even sure what questions to ask. Indeed, when they write in the text, when they got into Jerusalem, they go to Herod, and they go to the chief priests, ask them, where can I find it? And they go, and to me, going to Jerusalem, would be the equivalent of someone today who saw the blaze in life, who saw that the glory of God didn't know what it meant, but just began to move on a trick. And I saw some life on a relationship, but looked like life and truth, and they began to move for it, and they went where you would go. If you were looking for an explanation where the light came from, you'd go to church. You'd go to Jerusalem. Then you'd go where the God came from. And so that's where they went, expecting to hear the answer. And it was interesting. They did, from the scribes, hear the right answer. It would be like these seekers, these pictures of seekers today, coming into our church or some other church. And maybe they saw the life of God in a friend. And that was the life they saw. And they began to just wonder about them. Start asking questions. So they'd go to church. on this Sunday, and they sit there and they inscribe the pastor or the king of the Jews, whoever he is, or she is, the king of the Jews, the pastor of the church, the big stuff, and they give them, they tell them, they do, you can find them in Bethlehem, you can find them in the Bible, you can get them in the guinea-wineers, and you know what's weird? The people who are telling people where to find the baby, where to find Christ, don't know the Christ, but the people who are listening tend to find the Christ to get that, that's an excellent, terrible thing to do. Because of the secret. Thank you. and the hostility of the gospel, can be reached by the life of God. Herod wasn't. They aren't all. Paul was. Was anybody more hostile to the gospel of grace than Paul, who one day was Saul, who God intervened on? Hostile people can be one to Christ. Sometimes the harder nut to crack is the religious, who has challenged himself over with his spiritual propriety, who has kind of covered himself and protected him or herself with all of the theology that they know, they don't even have a sense sometimes of their needs of God because they know so much about him, they think they know him. How do we reach him sometimes? But I think we know we're looking at this, and I think we know her. You know what? I think there's a lot more in that guy than me. I think more than you know, and if I could cook in anything, in your own spirit, it would be to become more and more aware of the people you work with, the people in your family, who are hostile, and they aren't indifferent. You know what? They see. They're a saint. They've seen the light. Maybe the light of God they've seen in you, and they've just begun to move on to truly life-seek magi of Satan. And now they're starting to ask some questions. I would like us to be all incepted with the spirit of the mad God. So even those of us who know them, to be accepted with the continual spirit of seeking him and knowing him more and more. And asking questions that we would feel more and more of his life and of his glory. They were seeking him, but when they saw him, verse 11, they worshiped him. The good words of worship there, you all know, I said this several times, but it's costly now, let me fall down to God, to see you to tremble, to adore, to demean, to me. And at your journey, your life revealed to you that this Jesus is the king of things Thank you. The Magi grieve of their substance. We have long made thanks to the other people between worship and giving. I remember early in my ministry, I used to thank you, and I'm embarrassed, but I used to actually think that when we would take the offering and say, we can get it out of their way. It's such an interruption to worship, but now it's so small in my thinking. Even robbing, I think, from God's people, the wonder of a full stretch of worship that we have come to know and realize that the giving of our substance is not an interruption of worship. It is absolutely worship. First, part of the gospel makes that very clear. For when they worshiped him, next thing they did, out of their worship, they gazed to the children. World's frankincense and beyond their value just intrusively was symbolic value and he's one of those gifts. Gold, we know this. God, we've been in that culture. Gold was a gift that we were just a king. Gold and being a king were connected. So there was a way in which in giving the gold to Jesus, they were recognizing that this gave him his spirit. And earth was a fragrance and a perfume. Use for many things, but cheap among the things it is useful when the preparing of bodies after people have died. In fact, in John chapter 19, it says that the women had taken Jesus' body from the cross and prepared them, and one of the things they did to the body was to douse them in this person's view of the high-encoming aroma of death. And that becomes a symbol of how it came and started dying. And so, you know, frankincense with incense made from the bark of the tree in Arabia. Frankincense used for many things, but one of the things this incense was used for was in sacrifices to God. Part of the sacrifice was to bring this incense to be symbolic of my offering being a sweet, smell, and fragrance to God. Frankincense primarily is offering to God, and so you get the picture of this thing they're offering. They're offering frankincense to acknowledge that this is a gift to God. And so they came to worship, an in-morship-be-dating role, that they say this is not just a political role. We see him as a king. And when they gave him words, as they said, we do not just see him as a king, we see this little child as a king who comes to God. And when they gave him frank consensus, as if they said, we do not just see him as a king who comes to God, we see this little baby as the king who comes to God, who we believe is God. Open what else, my brother. The cross be with me. I'm going to call us just a song. If you can stay with me, take just a few minutes at the end of our time, we're together. It's a spirit and mad child to come on the door to kindle and let the prayer in our city. Father, I pray for two things as we call us, first of all, I pray to those among us who are in that God and they're seeking it. And they have seen some voice of the glory of God. Maybe they saw it again. And some are leaving the life that God does not live. And they're drawn to it. They don't fully understand it. But they have the goodness children. They die praying in Jesus' name. In ways that I cannot create by will. Jesus, that your spirit would move among us. That you would reveal your glory to the magi spirit among us. who do not know you yet, but they're seeking, that they will be able this morning to see you and when they do become a worship of you. I pray that in Jesus' name, you're going to be born, even as we sing, as we pray and pray. I pray also for the Spirit to command God and respect us all. I'm redeemed and redeemed alive, that we would ever be seeking the truth and ever be seeking deeper understandings of your blazing life and your glory. That is ours to God. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Thank you.
