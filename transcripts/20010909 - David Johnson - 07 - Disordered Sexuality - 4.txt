Father, I pray in this service for the power of your Spirit to be released once again in two areas that are necessary all the time, but I think in particular this week, given this subject matter, that you would pour upon us grace and truth, that truth would be clear and grace would be abundant and amazing as the truth is revealed. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. As Tom made clear, and as all of you know, if you've been with us these last few weeks, we're dealing with money, sex, and power, particularly right now, disordered sexuality, and the aspect of disordered sexuality that we're focusing on is that of homosexuality. And among the questions that I want to answer this morning relative to that issue, by way of preparation, and that's actually the broader context of this whole series, because we got into this out of this idea that we needed to prepare ourselves and consecrate ourselves for where we're going as a church. The primary question I want to address is this. In a culture where over the last 30 years we have seen go through a radical shift in its view of homosexuality, where do we as a church stand in what some people are referring to these days as nothing short of a cultural war. In other words, the question this morning is this, is homosexuality a viable Christian option? Is it a lifestyle that in any context can know the blessing and endorsement of God? In other words, in the vernacular of the day, is gay okay? Now, but before I even answer that question, I want you to understand this, that as recently as 25 to 30 years ago, the answer to that question in both the secular culture and in the church would have been a pretty significant no, it's not okay. Which means, among other things, that we have gone through and are going through a significant shift in thinking. Let me give you some perspective on that historically, first of all, in the culture. In 1914, which to many of us who actually haven't lived very long, 1914 sounds like a long time ago. In the purview of all history, it's not that long ago. But in 1914, a guy by the name of E.M. Foster wrote a novel entitled Maurice, affirming the value of homosexual love as being ennobling. Any perversity, he said, lies not in homosexuality, but it's in a society that does not accept it as being normative and healthy. Now, in 1914, he couldn't get that book published. In 1975, he could, which among other things illustrates this. A shift has gone on. In 1967, soon after the Wolfenden Report was published, the law of the land was changed so that homosexual behavior between consenting adults was no longer a criminal offense. I think it's good that it's not a criminal offense. That law should have been changed. Whatever you think about that law, what that law changed in 1967 marks, however, is a shift in the culture. As recently as 1973, the American Psychiatric Association dropped homosexuality from its list of recognized psychological disorders. In 1973, they no longer regarded homosexuality as a pathological condition that needed treatment, but a natural normative alternative. Treatment now became helping people deal with, adjust to, and embrace their homosexuality in a hostile, homophobic culture. The 30 years since then has been marked, as all of you know, by a radical acceleration of acceptance, empowered by and embodied in what we've all come to know as the gay movement. We're all aware of that. But what about the church? What kind of shift is going on in the church, if any? Well, to give some perspective on that, the fact is this, that from the time of Christ until very recently, the vast majority of Christian theologians have viewed homosexuality as part of the disorder of a fallen world. The only variance of opinion most of the time you could find on this issue was in the degree of its seriousness. At one extreme, church fathers like Tertullian, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas regarded homosexuality regarded homosexuality as the worst of all possible sins. Unfortunately, that kind of thinking empowered people in all the wrong ways, giving rise to evil things being done in the name of God. Christians often finding themselves justified, if this is the worst possible sin, with incredible levels of hatred and venomous speech, what we speak of today as gay bashing. sin that if you're going to weigh out sin has got to be far worse than homosexuality. Some of the evil things that in the name of God have been done to people. Others on a different level of this whole thing like Calvin and Luther spoke strongly against homosexuality but saw it as no more or less serious than any other sin. But what was agreed upon historically was that homosexuality was disordered. that it was sin, and by sin I mean it misses the mark. That's the Greek word hamartia. That was pretty much agreed upon. But that is no longer true. For consistent with the culture, over the same period of time, there has been a shift in the church as well, where more and more there is a pressing to accept as normative, healthy, and holy homosexuality as a viable Christian lifestyle. Played out dramatically in the pressing for ordination of openly gay men and women in major denominations. I don't know if you know it or not, but right now in denominations like the Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist, and Presbyterian, there is a major war going on in terms of this particular issue, in terms of how much acceptance there is going to be in our own community this last summer. Many of you saw in the paper, it was kind of in there every day for a while it seemed, In the context of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, Anita Hill, one of their pastors, was being ordained in defiance of the church's stand on ordination of sexually active homosexual people. She had herself, and she was ordained in defiance of that rule in ELCA because she was a sexually active 2-1 in a monogamous relationship with another woman. And the reason she did it, among others, was to press this issue in their denomination. For 11 years, the ELCA has accepted homosexual men and women in the clergy for ordination if they were not sexually active. She was pressing the sexually active part of that. Let me give you some history on this as it relates to the shift in the church. In 1968, and that's a pretty recent date, a minister in San Diego, California named Troy Perry founded what is known now as the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, the MCC. Presently, there are hundreds of churches that are part of the MCC, tens of thousands of members. He wrote a book entitled, The Lord is My Shepherd and He Knows I'm Gay. His work combined with others, most notably D. Sherman Bailey, gave birth to what we know now as the gay theology. Now, among the interesting and, for me, troubling things about the gay theology is this, that much of it claims to be evangelical. Now, that word evangelical may mean something to you. It might not. Just to give you kind of a handle on it, evangelical is who we are, Bible-believing people. They embrace the Bible as true, but when it comes to homosexuality, their perspective is this, that the Bible has been horribly misinterpreted by people who say they believe the Bible when it comes to homosexuality. They believe that the Bible does speak against homosexual prostitution, against homosexual promiscuity and abuse, but the Bible, according to them, does not speak against, indeed it blesses, loving, monogamous relationships in same-sex arenas. They take the silence of Jesus on this issue as an endorsement of it. You need to also know they do their Greek word studies. They handle the Hebrew. They deal with the culture, which is all exegetical stuff that we do as well. These people who hold these views are not foolish. They've done their work. In 1981, the Open Church Group published an article entitled, Christian and Gay, an Evangelical Case. Their statement of conviction was this, that human sexuality and all of its richness is a gift from God, gladly to be accepted and enjoyed and honored as a way of expressing and growing in love in accordance with the life and teaching of Jesus. Therefore, it is our conviction that it is entirely compatible with Christian faith, not only to love a person of the same sex, but to express that love fully in a personal sexual relationship. Out of that came their statement of purpose. Here's their statement of purpose. To encourage fellowship, friendship, and support among individual gay Christians through prayer, study, and action, wherever possible in the local church. To help the whole church to re-examine its understanding of human sexuality and to work for a positive acceptance of gay relationships so that all homosexuals may live without fear of rejection and that homosexual Christians may contribute fully to the life and ministry of the church. Our purpose is to encourage members to witness to their Christian faith within the gay community and to witness to their conviction about human sexuality within the church. End quote. Well, more than you might know, in places and among people that would surprise and may be sadden you, it didn't me, they have been successful in their mission. And whatever it is that you think about that, know this for certain. The fact undeniable is this. There has been a shift in the church on this issue. All of which raises a new question that we need to address. How do we decide what is right and what is wrong? when even among people who call themselves Bible-believing Christians, there is a radical difference of perspective. When using the same text we might point to, to prove that something is wrong, they might point to those same texts and prove that they are right. How do you decide? How do you know? Well, it seems to me we have some work to do. It's biblical work. It's a scriptural study to see if from the Word of God We can decide what is right and what is wrong. But before we go to that, I want to tell you up front that we have decided. I am speaking now for me, but I am speaking for we. Our leadership, our staff, our elders, the direction of our church. And this is something you need to know. So I just want to give you some we believes on the front end of this. And then we'll get down into the scriptures. We believe that homosexuality misses the mark. Hamartia is the word for sin. It means to miss the mark. We believe that homosexuality is sin. We believe that the overwhelming weight of Scripture bears that out. We do not, however, believe that homosexuality is a greater sin than any other sin. Indeed, as we deal with these Scriptures in just a few moments, we are going to find homosexuality consistently in the context of other behaviors, no less vile. Behaviors like greed, envy, deceit, malice, gossip, slander, and arrogance. And if the church of Jesus Christ wants to get up on a high, morally superior place and become righteously indignant about homosexuality, Just be very sure that you also become just as indignant about greed, envy, deceit, malice, and gossip. My experience, and maybe yours as well, however, is that we feel very free to get real indignant about homosexuality, but greed, envy, deceit, malice, gossip, not so much. That's disorder too. Finally, I believe that men and women among us who struggle with homosexuality desperately need the same grace and same safe place that all of us need to deal with all of our sin, to face down all the ways we all miss the mark, and all of the ways we try to satisfy our hungers, and quench our thirsts, and heal our wounds with things that have no power to do it. You see, beloved, my view is this, that homosexuality is just one more thing in a very long list of things people try to use to satisfy their hungers and quench their thirsts and heal their wounds. One more, we believe. We believe, I believe, that in the gay theology, We have Ezekiel 22, 2 Timothy chapter 4, and 2 Peter chapter 2 revisited and realized. Let me read them for you. Ezekiel 22 verse 26 says this. Her priests, her scholars, her theologians have done violence to my law, says the Lord, and have profaned my holy things. How? Here's how. They have made no distinction between the holy and the profane. They have not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and I am profaned among them because of it. I believe gay theology is Ezekiel 22 revisited. 2 Timothy 4.3 says this, For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires. They will turn away their ears from truth and will turn aside to myths. I believe that the gay theology is 2 Peter chapter 4 realized. 2 Peter 2 verses 1 through 3 speaks of false teachers rising among people, introducing destructive heresies. Many will follow their own sensuality and because of them, the way of the truth is maligned. Now, you may or may not agree with me about that, but I don't want you to wonder what we think. These are things you need to know as you prepare for where we're going as a church and even decide if you want to come with us. Okay. Oh, that's my introduction. Let me tell you where we're going over the next couple of weeks. Two things I want to accomplish. Number one, that in this process, we hear a word of truth that through the fog is clear. Number two, that in this process, we have a graceful, loving response to those who struggle with this issue. Let's start by fighting to find some truth. And I think the best place to begin is in the beginning. The story of creation, the design of God, Genesis chapter 1, verse 27, reads this way. And all this does is lay the foundation. It's not everything there is, but it's a good place to start. It says this, And God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created him. Male and female, he created them. Chapter 2, verse 18. Then the Lord God said, It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper suitable for him. Verse 22. And the Lord God fashioned into a woman the rib which was taken from the man and brought her to the man. And the man said, This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of a man. For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. The pattern I want you to see there is this. One man, one woman, one flesh. And that pattern is not only, in my view, the design of God, it reveals the image of God. Now, I've taught about this before in different contexts for different purposes, making a different point, but the point was this, around this revealing the image of God. God is not male or female. When it says that people were born or created in the image of God, I bear the light of God and so do you. The life of God is in you and me, whether you're male or female. But the image of God and part of the wonder and the mystery of sexuality and why it has such powerful spiritual dimensions to it is that the image of God is fully seen when you bring together everything that is masculine and blend it together and form it together with everything that is feminine and that coming together of the full masculine and the full feminine, you have in that the image of God. A pretty significant picture, symbolically, of the image of God. David Simons, in a magazine article for Methodist clergy entitled Circuit Rider Magazine, says this, that the church's historic stand against the practice of homosexuality is not based on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah or on proof texting of selected scriptures. It is based on the consistent heterosexual track running through all of scripture, which is rooted in God's design expressed at the beginning in creation. It's interesting that one of the arguments, one of the core arguments of the gay theology appeals to the fact that Jesus never directly spoke to homosexuality, presuming from that silence that he either didn't know about it or was okay with it. The fact is this, the argument from silence may be the weakest one. In fact, I would imagine that even some of their own scholars would recognize that while it's one of their arguments, it's not their strongest one. Because while it is true that Jesus never spoke directly to the issue of homosexuality, you need to understand that neither did he directly speak to issues like incest, pedophilia, bestiality, or fornication. But he did speak to sexuality. And when he did speak about sexuality, guess what he said? In places like Matthew 19, in places like Mark chapter 10, you know what he did? Consistently, he would go back and quote Genesis chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2, saying things like this in Mark chapter 10 verse 6, From the beginning, this has been the design of God. One man, one woman, and in a mystery, there being an experience of one flesh. And in that coming together of all that is masculine, all that is feminine, you have a revealing not only of the design of God, but the very image of God. The Apostle Paul, in 1 Corinthians 6.16 and Ephesians 5.31, appeals to the same design in creation as the basis for his argument. And in both of those texts, Paul is pointing to the spiritual component of our sexuality. And this is a piece that we've been dealing with for several weeks around heterosexuality. That more is involved in the expression of our sexuality when it gets expressed physically than skin to skin. That something more profound and deeper than the physical is being touched when the physical is being touched. The spirit is involved. Our soul is involved. that is true of heterosexual expression and homosexual expression as well. Soul ties are just as real and just as strong in either one, which, by the way, I think helps at least in part to explain the strength of bondages that come on men and women in any kind of disordered sexuality. Because something more than skin to skin is involved in this thing. something profoundly spiritual at the level of your soul and spirit is involved indeed in Ephesians 5.32 Paul appeals to the design of God in creation one man, one woman, one flesh as being a symbol so fundamental and so powerful that it serves as a picture of and helps us understand what is hard to understand and that is this the union Christ has with his church Christ is the groom We are the bride from the beginning. The design of God that reveals the image of God in the context of sexuality is this. One man, one woman, one flesh. But what about the problem passages? The selected scriptures that the scholars of the gay theology have re-examined and re-defined. Well, one thing I just want you to know. Just because of time. I don't have time to go into all of the scriptures that deal with homosexuality. And there's kind of been a new definition given to all of them. But if you are interested in all of them, I did some work on this about nine years ago. And if you would like to get to that, it was longer. I think I took a couple of weeks just on this one issue. And if you'd like to get to all of the scriptures, I deal with all of them in those tapes. And you can get a hold of those through our tape ministry. This morning, I just want to give you two. And they're two big ones. They're kind of, I think, in some ways, enough. One out of the Old Testament and one out of the New. The Old Testament text I want to give you is Leviticus 18, verse 22. The same verse also shows up in Leviticus 20, verse 13. It says this, You shall not lie with a man as one lies with a woman, for that is an abomination. It sounds pretty clear. Apparently it's not. Proponents of gay theology have come up with two explanations for this one. The first one is very creative. And again, I don't think this is their strongest argument, and I have a feeling they don't think it is either. Regardless, here it is. That women in the culture to whom Leviticus was written were seen as not much more than property. They were seen as chattel to be owned. Very little, therefore, respect for women. With that in mind, you need to understand that Leviticus 18 is really saying this. Don't lie with a man the way you lie with a woman. And the way people would lie with a woman would be very disrespectfully. When you lie with a man, don't lie with a man that way. Have some respect. Anyway, okay. Be respectful, be loving. I think that one's thin too. The second is more compelling, and it really is compelling. It's this, that Leviticus 18 is not a timeless truth, but it is culturally bound. Now, the reason that one kind of catches me and makes me go, whoa, I've got to think about this one, is because I know that there are parts of Scripture that that is true about. There are places in Scripture where injunctions are given. I've taught of that before. That are for a certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose. But they are not timeless truths. And they're putting this prohibition into that category. That it's part of the Israel Holiness Code. The ceremonial law that doesn't apply any longer under the New Covenant. They further explain that Israel at the time that Leviticus was written lived in a pagan land. surrounded by the Canaanites and the Egyptians, that at the center of Canaanite and Egyptian worship was homosexual prostitution. Therefore, what Leviticus is actually prohibiting is homosexual prostitution, not loving, caring, monogamous homosexual relationships. A couple things about that. There is a distinction, as I said a moment ago, between ceremonial, culturally bound law for certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose and moral law, which is timeless. The reason we know there's a difference is because the Bible itself makes that clear. The book of Hebrews, for instance, is all about the ceremonial law being set aside and the reason it was set aside was because the ceremonial law was a picture or a shadow of something of substance that was to come. And the substance that was to come was fulfilled in Christ. And so ceremonial law is set aside. But never is moral law set aside. Sometimes, by the way, these things that are set aside, we even get a specific word in the word about something that is changing. And you might even be thinking of the vision that Peter had when he was being called to minister to Gentiles. Gentiles at the time, you couldn't go in a Gentile's house because it would make you ceremonially unclean to do that. And he got a vision of these different animals that up until that time had been ceremonially unclean. You can't touch them. You can't eat them. It came down, remember, on this big cloth, and the Spirit of God in this vision said to Peter, don't you call unclean what I'm calling clean. Go, rise and eat, and also go and minister to these Gentiles. Something was changing. What never changed, however, in the Word of God would be moral law. Never set aside. See, you don't have any places in Scripture where fornication is wrong over here, but then it's not that big a deal over here. You don't have adultery being wrong over here and lying and cheating being wrong over here. But then over here, it's not so big a deal. You make a clear distinction between what is timeless and what is for certain people at a certain time. I think my favorite example of an instruction from God that isn't timeless is found in Deuteronomy 23, verse 12. It says this, You shall have a place outside the camp and go out there. You shall have a spade among your tools, and it shall be when you sit down outside, you shall dig with it, and you shall turn to cover up your excrement. That's a word from God. Why should you do that? Verse 14, here's why. Because the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp, and he doesn't want to step in it, evidently. Okay, okay, okay. I did that just to try to bring some lightness to this pretty heavy talk. So is that a moral absolute? Is that a timeless truth? Or is it a temporary instruction for certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose? Obviously, at least to me, that's a temporary thing for a certain purpose. And there were certain purposes and important things. And if it is a timeless truth, and you go, well, I didn't think that is timeless, then we're all in sin for having toilets. We should be digging holes in our backyard. Here's the deal. The proponents of the gay theology are trying to put homosexuality in that category. It is not a timeless truth. now to answer that question I want to just give you a word about the holiness code that they indicate does no longer apply God's design in Leviticus is that the people of God his people living in a pagan culture would stand in stark contrast to that culture but more than just stand there looking different like a lot of us stand there looking dumb and just oddly different more than that that was not God's design His design was that the people of God in the culture would provide a powerful and healthy, compelling, sweet-smelling alternative to that culture and provide in their lifestyle and in their health, hope, healing, and health. The picture would be this. in a pile of smelly refuse and rotting garbage, right in the middle of that rotting garbage, you see something of infinite value, like a diamond. You see somewhere to go for health and healing and hope. So God says to the people of God in Leviticus, be different in every way. Leviticus 18, 6 to 18, he speaks of incest. In verse 20, he speaks of adultery. In verse 23, he speaks of bestiality. In verse 21, he says, don't kill your babies. And in verse 22, verse 22 is where we hear this word, don't lie with a man as you lie with a woman. When you put it in that context, it clearly is not a list of benign, culturally related prohibitions that no longer apply. It is clear that there are moral imperatives of timely import. New Testament scripture I want you to look at is Romans chapter 1. This is another big one, kind of famous. Anybody who is familiar with this debate would bring you here. On either side, by the way, of the debate. Says this, Romans chapter 1 verse 26 says this. For this reason, God gave them over to degrading passions. For the women exchanged the natural function. That's a key word there, natural. What is natural? Function for what is unnatural. And in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another. Men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. Now there's two arguments related to this from the gay theology perspective. Number one, that Paul is not speaking here, that Paul is only speaking here of promiscuous, idolatrous, or out of control homosexual behavior. Verse 27 is what they point to there where it says that the men burned in their desire. And the problem there was not the desire, it was that they were burning, it was out of control, sexuality. The second argument they have around this text is an interesting take on what is natural or unnatural. For if you are by orientation, according to their view, disposition or genetic makeup, homosexual, then acting out in a homosexual way is not for you unnatural. it's natural. You following me? So clearly this verse is not for someone who is constitutionally made up, genetically wired to be homosexual. This text according to their view applies to and confronts only those for whom homosexuality would be unnatural. And for whom would homosexuality be unnatural? A heterosexual. So the idea here is that if a heterosexual man or woman by virtue of some sort of pressure or getting caught up in the homosexual lifestyle, begins to act out homosexually when in fact they're heterosexual, it is for them unnatural. And that's who this verse applies to. That's the thinking here. Now this argument obviously appeals exclusively to the argument we hear in our culture just about all the time. But the strong one is the orientation view. Genetics, natural disposition. people who are constitutionally homosexual. And the obvious result of that position, if you accept it, is this. That if people are constitutionally homosexual, if it's part of their genetic makeup, then you can't make a moral judgment about that. It's just the way I am. God created me this way. It's not my fault. And I don't know if you hear the echo of something familiar, but last, a few weeks ago, we talked about the lie among heterosexual sex that says it's just a biological urge over which I have no control. I'm kind of wired that way. Remember the monogamy myth we talked about a few weeks ago? It's interesting where the kind of thinking brings us when applied to other arenas of life. January 18th, St. Paul Pioneer Press featured article, Section D had this headline, Cheating Genes. And this little article reminded me of what we said a few weeks ago about the book that came out recently called The Monogamy Myth. Here's what the article said. 50% of all married people are adulterers, the studies say. And anthropologist Helen E. Fisher says, it's not your fault, you're built to wander. It's in your genes. It's your orientation. It's just the way God made you. The offshoot of that, the application of that is this, How cruel it is to expect someone who genetically is made up to wander to express fidelity in marriage. That's a cruel expectation. How bizarre to expect chastity in singleness if we were built to wander, says the spirit of the age. A few years ago, the Star Tribune heralded the discovery of a genetic connection to crime, genetic connection to alcoholism. And I don't think any of us, including the culture that we live in, thinks we can't make a moral judgment about crime or alcoholism. Now, I will make one concession to this what is natural and unnatural argument. I think they're right about something. You see, in a fallen world that has exchanged the truth of God for a lie, What is natural begins to look unnatural. And what is unnatural begins to look, after a while, natural. In fact, the way I was thinking about it this week was this. If somebody began to tell me that green was blue, no, it's really blue, after a while that green would start to look blue, I'd go, well, I guess it is. Maybe it is. I see a little blue in there. Dallas Willard says it this way. We live in a culture that's flying upside down. Indeed, we have been living in a culture that's been flying upside down so long that it feels like we're flying right side up. It feels, here's the word, natural to fly upside down. Indeed, to turn right side up is what would feel unnatural, is what would feel wrong. By the way, when I begin to talk about things that are upside down and right side up, I am now not just talking about homosexuality. I'm talking about missing the mark in general. And so is Paul in Romans 1, by the way. I read those two verses in Romans 1. There's 32 verses in Romans 1. Two of them deal with this issue of same-sex attraction. but the rest of it speaks of other things. Verse 29 to 31, we hear about people who are filled with righteousness, unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, problems like evil, envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, gossip, slander, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful. You see, every one of us can find ourselves somewhere in those two or three verses. You see, all of us in those three verses have been leveled by the pen of the Apostle Paul, putting every one of us in exactly the same place. And that is this, in a desperate need for two things, repentance and grace. this leads to the second and final thing I wanted to accomplish today if I could and that is this to find a way to extend grace how do you do that? well actually it's quite easy you see beloved grace is extended to people who struggle with homosexuality the same way grace is extended to people who struggle with greed envy, gossip, strife, deceit or malice see the amazing grace of God comes to and is lavished upon all men and women who quit denying that their sin is really sin. It is lavished upon and it comes to people who quit redefining, rationalizing, and hiding their sin. It comes to and is lavished upon people who courageously begin to bring into the light where God can heal what they've been hiding in the dark. It comes to, it's lavished on those men and women who begin to agree with God about what's right side up and what's upside down. It comes to and is lavished upon men and women who begin to allow the law of God to do its work in them. And what is the work of the law designed by God to do in you and me? Well, the purpose of the law, as I have preached it from this pulpit many times, you could probably do this next part yourself, is threefold. The purpose of the law, by the way, which I have been preaching this morning, is number one, to reveal sin. The purpose of the preaching of the law is to call sin what it is. Regardless of the protests, an acrobatic exegesis attempts to redefine and deny. Homosexuality misses the mark. But so does adultery and pornography and gossip and envy and hatred and slander and malice and pride. The purpose of the law is to make that clear. but simply revealing that those things are sin is not the full purpose of the law the second purpose of the law is to produce in the hearts of men and women a brokenness about their sin whereby we begin to pray this way oh Lord I have broken your law I have missed the mark I have exchanged the truth of God for a lie without even knowing that I was doing it I did it I can't deny it I can't undo it I can't hide it anymore I can't redefine it or repay it which leads then to the third purpose of the law the third purpose of the law is to lead men and women who have no hope without Jesus to Christ who is their only hope Galatians 3.24 says it this way therefore the law has become our tutor whose job it was to drive us to Christ so we could be made new. See, beloved, when men and women come to Christ, he not only receives us, forgives us and cleanses us, he begins to change us and transform us. By the way, I mean, changing and transforming, I mean, if you go to Open Door, you know that. That's our vision. We're all about till Christ be formed in you. But you know, when you talk about the homosexual issue, that's right at the crux of the thing because the argument is it can't be changed. This is the way I am. That argument just gets applied to all sorts of things and now we've got some problems about where the gospel goes. See, 1 Corinthians 6.11 has this little phrase at the beginning of the verse. It says this, And such were some of you. Make you scratch. Well, who were they? The verse before that says who they were. Here's who they were. They were thieves. They were covetous. They were drunkards, revilers, swindlers. They were slanders. A lot of people just like you were. Sounds like open door. They were fornicators. They were idolaters, adulterers. They were homosexuals. But then something happened to these people. They saw their sin. Somewhere with this mysterious, wonderful working of the Spirit on one hand that moved them and convicted them, And just nothing short of incredible courage, on the other hand, came together and they quit denying their sin. And they quit redefining their sin and calling it something else. And they quit trying to hide their sin. And they began with incredible courage they didn't even know they had to bring into the light what they were hiding in the dark. And when they did this, Jesus, to whom they brought their sin, received them. But he didn't just give them a big hug. The next phrase says, and such were some of you, but you were, do you know the next word? Washed. He receives them, and then he washes them, and then it says, and you were sanctified. He begins to sanctify them, which means what? He began to change them and transform them, and isn't that your testimony? That's why we're here. It's about transformation, and you may not struggle with homosexuality. You may. The gospel is this, you can be changed. You can be transformed. If you can't, you know, it's over here, folks. Last week when Dan Pummel ended the story of his journey of faith, the struggle with homosexuality, his courage to bring into the light what he'd been hiding in the dark, redefining and coming up with all sorts of disordered kinds of thinking, and come in repentance to God and begin to experience healing, He ended his talk by saying this, you know, if God can change me, he can change anyone. If there is hope for someone like me, he said, there's hope for anyone. Well, I'd like to turn that around this morning just a bit by closing with this. If there isn't hope for someone like Dan, there isn't hope for anyone. Why? Because all of us have missed the mark badly. And all of us stand in desperate need of two things. Repentance, to quit calling our sins something other than it is, and grace. The kind of grace that when we quit denying and quit redefining and quit hiding our sin, the kind of grace that receives me and washes me and begins this difficult, wonderful process of changing and transforming me and you. The Spirit and the bride say, come. Let the one who hears, come. And let the one who is thirsty, come. And drink the water of life. Because any other thing that you happen to be drinking to quench your thirst, or eating to satisfy your hunger, or dealing to somehow heal your wound, has no power to do it. So come to the fountain of life, this Jesus that we preach. And you think you heard a talk on homosexuality today. You have heard the gospel today. So come and drink. And wonder, beloved, as you feel the urge to get all indignant about homosexuality, put that aside and wonder, what am I drinking and what am I eating and what am I using to heal my hurts other than the only one who can do it? And come and drink. Let's pray. Would you stand as we close in prayer? Father, our prayer at the beginning of this and for all three services was that grace and truth would kiss. That we would fight for truth. And much of this talk felt to me like a fight. It felt like that in preparing it, all three services, there was a fight for truth. But Father, that this truth be just laced with grace. The truth calls us out of our denial and our redefinitions and our desires and attempts to try to embrace our sin and find in that freedom we find in that death. We will declare that until our final breath. But when we acknowledge our sin as being sin, you give grace and you start to heal. Lord, as we anticipate where we're going as a people, as we attempt to prepare ourselves and consecrate ourselves for who you would call us to be, I pray that these things be real and rich and ever-growing among us, understood at the core of who we are and how we think. I pray all these things in Jesus' name. All God's people said, amen.
