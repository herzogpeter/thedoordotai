Amen. It all started some four years ago, before we were in this building, but the building was in view a meeting, actually, between Keith Meyer and Steve Hansen, a meeting that obviously then spilled out into other meetings involving other people. The thinking, the focus, the awareness was this. We need to have some intentionality as a church, as we anticipate this new building, to give as a church to something beyond ourselves. We have to do it now. We have to do it first. In many ways, just like we encourage people to give first and live on the rest, because if we move into the building and don't have this as an agenda, intentionally first, to give beyond ourselves, kind of built in, the fear was that all of that beyond ourselves would get lost. Our money would be consumed as a church by all the things that we need here, legitimate things that we need here. It would just be consumed by light bulbs and electric bills and staff needs and carpet and paint and stuff. And you may remember, if you were with us when we first moved to the building, there were things, significant things actually, that weren't finished yet. rooms that weren't painted, some even not even, didn't have drywall and carpets. But even then, it was, we need to take care of this, but we need to go beyond ourselves as well. You see, there was a concern that in moving here to Maple Grove, we'd just become a big suburban church with no vision beyond ourselves for ministry. So we took this verse to heart, and it's a verse we've been dealing with over the last couple of weeks. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Indeed, as we've been making clear for the last three weeks in the teaching here, few things have more power than money to reveal the human heart and to change the human heart. For where your treasure is, it reveals where your heart is, but where your treasure is will affect where your heart goes as well. And we kind of instinctively knew that that doesn't just apply to individuals, it applies to us as a church, as a community of faith. So the question out of that was this, where do we give? Where are the places we want our treasure to go, our investment to be made? Well, the way you answer that question is, at least in part by asking this, where is our heart? And also this question, where do we want our heart to go? Where is our heart? What do we care about? But what do we want to care about even more? It turns out that where our heart was and is and where we wanted our heart to go was beyond our door. Within our door, our needs here as a body matter a lot, but our heart, we needed to be sure that it was beyond our door to the least and the lost beyond our door. And so it is for the next few weeks. We're going to talk about that. And we're going to celebrate that, you guys. Because I'm here to tell you that after a few years, that meeting and that kind of focus began several years ago. So now after some years of that, we have some things to celebrate about things that we have given. About things that we have sown into the city, into the world, into our community. Are bearing some exciting fruit. We call it Beyond Our Doors Ministry. And the Beyond Our Doors Ministry includes things like Africa AIDS Project that you hear about from time to time. And we'll hear a little bit more about next week. With direct connections to Uganda and Kenya, this last week a group headed by Steve Hansen, people from our church were in Africa and spent a significant amount of time. Just came back Thursday evening. I was in an elder meeting and one of our elders, Todd Burleson, who was on the trip, began to share. It was near the end of our meeting, and Todd, we really want to hear from you, but time is short tonight. You have 10 minutes. 45 minutes later, he was done. As he began to share stories of our involvement in places we don't always get to see, of things that we've given away, both money and people, and how fruit is being born, and of all the stories that I remember the most, I can't tell the story, but the most compelling, was that, you know what? This thing we've been talking about even before Easter that love wins. Love wins. I gotta tell you, love. I heard Todd Burleson tell us that love wins in some of the darkest places in the world. Love wins even there. You need to hear this story. Another closer to home most of us are aware of is our partnership with Ephraim Smith right over here. In the founding of Sanctuary Church, yeah. They're waiting for me. Dave, would you please shut up and let Ephraim get up here? In the founding of Sanctuary Church, if you've been with us, you know the story. It's an amazing story in North Minneapolis. And it's been our great privilege to partner with Ephraim in that church in the forming of the CDC, the Community Development Corporation. And all of this stuff, as you know, it's been born out of relationship. It's been born out of shared vision, things that he has seen and we have seen. It's the same thing. And we go, yeah, we need to do this together. It's been born of a willingness to give. It keeps coming back to this, you guys. This partnership is born of a willingness to give, sometimes of time, that you feel like you don't have and you've given it. You have partnered with us in many of these beyond our doors endeavors. Sometimes it's the giving of people. I remember when Ephraim came and shared with you the vision for North Minneapolis, and we said to you, we don't own you, but our spirit towards you is, you know what, Some of you belong in this church. You don't belong here at Open Door. You belong there. And numbers of people went in. You see, you have to hold people open-handedly, just like you do every resource of your life. And some of what was given was money to date. So over the last two years, you have given by the promptings of the Spirit and the following of your heart and deciding your heart needed to follow some of your money as well, right around $700,000 in the last two years to these beyond our doors endeavors. Actually, I think it's about $670,000 in the last two years. Our goal for this year is another 300, 330,000 is what we would like to see to top a million. Doesn't a million sound good? That just sounds good. A million dollars out the door. Out the door, sowing seed in our community, in our city, and all the way around the world beyond our doors. Now, as I said just a moment ago, Most of these Beyond Our Doors initiatives are built on and flow from relationship. And again, among the most visible of these relationships is the one we have with Sanctuary Church, with CDC, through Ephraim Smith, which is why we asked Ephraim on this day to come and bring the word. Ephraim, would you come? Yeah. Yeah. You know, man, I just tell you, I just love this guy. and I know you do too. I told him last night, and it's just true. I look at him. He makes my heart smile. I just love this guy and the vision you have. And one of the things about just what you're going to share today is to tell you is that one of the ways to catch a vision is to hang around with someone who has one. One of the ways to see something that you don't see is to listen to someone who sees it. When Steve Hansen comes and shares about what's going on in Africa, one of the amazing things that happens to me as I get to see what I can't see unless he tells me. And this is what happens when you come among us as well. Love you, man. Give the word. You bet. Well, it is a privilege to be with you this morning. And just in a small report, because this is the first year that Sanctuary Covenant Church is a self-sustaining ministry, a community now of 800 people gathering every Sunday in North Minneapolis, seven staff. It's just a blessing. And I just want to say thank you because the seed that was sown from this ministry along with some other churches, Woodland Hills, Salem Covenant Church in New Brighton, we're just so, so thankful for your prayers, for your support, for your love. And I'm just amazed at that and just so thankful to be in friendship with Dave. I want you to turn with me, if you have your Bible, to the Gospel of Mark. The Gospel of Mark. And I'm going to read some verses towards the end of chapter four, and then I'm going to go into some verses in the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Mark. It reads as follows, starting with verse 35 of chapter 4 of Mark. It says, And on that day when evening had come, he, Jesus, said to them, Let us go over to the other side. And leaving the multitude, they took him along with them, just as he was in the boat, and other boats were with him. And there arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up. And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they awoke him and said to him, Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing? And being aroused, he rebuked the wind and said to the sea, Hush, be still. And the wind died down, and it became perfectly calm. And he said to them, Why are you so timid? How is it that you have no faith? And they became very much afraid and said to one another, Who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him? And they came to the other side of the sea into the country of the Gerasenes. And when he had come out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met him. And he had his dwelling among the tombs, and no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain, because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him. From this text, I want to preach to you on the title, Storms of the City. Storms of the City, pray with me. Father God, I pray that this would be your sermon, your message, you would preach, you would teach, and ultimately I'm just your vessel, your vehicle that you have chosen to say what you want to say to these, your children, my sisters and brothers. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. The last time I was here, it was right after the storm Katrina had hit and devastated parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. And I talked about storms, the ability to deal with storms, to get through storms, to recover and heal after the devastation of storms. And I want to kind of pick up on that and continue kind of in that theme with this message, storms of the city. You see, just as there are physical storms that come and go, and they bring about devastation, and they bring about loss, and they cause us to have to really look at how we live our lives in the midst of a storm and what it means to get on the other side, there are also social storms. There are storms of race. There are storms of politics. There are economic storms. There are mental, intellectual storms. There are emotional storms. There are storms of things that attack our very physical body. There are family storms, marriage storms. See, there are external and internal storms that impact our lives on a regular basis. Storms come and go, and after a storm goes, you can pretty much bet that there is another storm that is going to come at some point in time. It is the way things are. There are systemic storms, storms that take on institutions and systems, and they're broad and they must be dealt with. There are natural storms that come, and it's important to have a strong foundation and to know where to go when storms come. There are individual storms, storms that take place on the inside of our lives that at times it's hard to even put words to the storm and how it's impacting our life. The storm is so rooted in our soul, in our mind, in our heart, in our emotions that sometimes we have thoughts and we have feelings that are just stormy and we can't even put words around them. There are supernatural storms. There is a spiritual warfare that creates storms. See, it's the high pressure of God's will, God's heart from the heavenly realms clashing with the low winds of hell, of demonic forces, of evil, and the battle between what is heavenly and what is demonic and the clash that that creates creates storms. And it's important to know how to deal with natural, supernatural, individual, external, internal storms. Jesus deals with a storm here in the fourth chapter of the gospel of Mark. There is a storm that arises in verse 37, and the waves are breaking over the boat so much that the boat is filling up. So people are like standing in the impact of the storm on the boat. And a boat is not like a house that's grounded with a foundation. So the people on the boat are threatened. I mean, if you are on this boat, there's fear. There's insecurity. There's a danger around you, but yet Jesus is asleep. And the people are like, they wake him up and say, teacher, do you not care that we are in a storm? I mean, maybe you've been there before in your life that you were going through something so stormy or you saw something so stormy that even as one who believes in God, You say to God, God, where are you? Do you not care that we are in a storm? Do you not see the storm of racism? Do you not see the storm of division? Do you not see the storm of political polarization? Do you not see the storm of unemployment? Do you not see the storm of disease, cancer? Do you not see the storm of AIDS and HIV? Do you not see the storm of divorce and broken families? Do you not see the storm of the very fabric of what it means to be whole and complete and godly, being ripped apart and lifted off of the earth? Do you not care, teacher? Do you not see God? If you are God, why have you not done something about the fact that in my house, I am going through hell and high water? Jesus, being aroused, he looks at the storm. He looks at the danger. He looks at this force. And here it just says, he says, hush, be still. No exclamation point. Not shut up, storm. In the name of the one who can cause all storms from the beginning to the end. Alpha Omega, Rose of Sharon, Prince of Peace. saying a whole bunch of stuff in Hebrew and Greek and Aramaic that we would never be able to totally understand. He just says, shh, and then goes back to sleep. And before he probably went back and took a nap, he says to them, to the people following him, around him, connected to him, he says, why are you so timid? How is it that you have no faith. And then they became afraid and they asked the wrong question. Verse 41, they said, who is this that even the wind and the sea obey him? Wrong question. They should have said, what does he mean that we're timid? What does he mean by that? And why did he go back to sleep? There are storms, sisters and brothers. Storms that we see, storms that we live in, storms. Maybe you sit here to a certain degree still living the after effects of the impact of a storm that impacted you. A storm you went through when you were a boy or a girl. Storms that you observe every day. There are storms. And Jesus is one who is able to look at the storm and say, shh. That's the end of that. Peace to that. I mean, that's what some of us need to hear today. We need a God who will invade our life and just say, shh, hey, that storm in your marriage, you need some peace in that marriage now. Shh. That storm you're going through from what you went through with your parents, shh, hey, hey, that's enough of that. hey, that's the thing you're going through at your job, hey, hey, hey, I know you want to get mad, I know you want to fight, but hey, shh, peace to that. That's what some of us need to hear. We need to hear, shh, peace to that. Shh, hey, hush to that, hey. And that's what we need in our world. That's what we need is we need an army of people that are willing to look at a storm and say with all of their being, with all of who they are, in spiritual confidence, in spiritual grounding, in an intimate relationship with God, with an identity in Jesus Christ to look at the storms of life and be able to say, shh, that's enough of that. People that in Africa will say, shh. People that will walk in North Minneapolis, people that will go into rural areas and inner cities, people that will look at broken kids and just say, shh, hey, enough of that. No exclamation point. Shh. You know, the reason it's hard, though, to build an army like this is because we live in a culture that is somewhat addicted to storms. I mean, I know this sounds crazy and weird, but even people that like storms, they like being in the midst of storms, they like causing storms. Storms are entertaining. Storms make money today. You know, there are some people that are storm chasers. You know, in the fifth chapter of Mark, we meet a man who is dealing with a storm on the inside of his very being, a demonic force known as a legion, multiple demonic forces plaguing his own soul. He's living amongst the tombs, verse 3, and no one can bind him, not even with a chain. He day and night among the tombs is crying out and gashing himself with stones, cutting his own body. Some people are so, they're so overwhelmed by stormy forces on the inside that they do crazy things to themselves and other people. And what the community decided in the garrisons to do with people like this is lock them up. Get them away from us. Get them away. Lock them up. and this person sees Jesus. And the very demonic force within him cries out in verse 7 of chapter 5, What do I have to do with you, Jesus, son of the most high God? I implore you by God, do not torment me. For he had been saying to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit. And he was asking him, What is your name? And he said to him, My name is Legion, for we are many. and he began to entreat him earnestly not to send them out of the country. There are evil, demonic, messed up forces of evil that want to take up residence in our communities, in our cities, in our country, in our living room, in our family, in our minds, in our heart, and they want to have a dwelling place. But when these forces meet up with Jesus, they know they've met their match. They know that they have met the one who has victory over them. And so Jesus, as you read the text, throws them into pigs. This is why I have a hard time eating rib tips today. I mean, just reading this text. Because it could be demonic rib tips. I mean, I'm not telling you what to eat or not, but I'm just, you know. Now, this is where I want to get to my point about some people addicted to the storms. In verse 14, it says, And their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and out in the country. And the people came to see what it was that had happened. And they came to Jesus and observed the man who had been demon-possessed, this person with a storm, sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had the legion, and they became frightened. And those who had seen it described to them how it happened to the demon-possessed man and all about the swine. And they began to entreat him, Jesus, to depart from the region. Now, here's Jesus, a storm calmer. But these people around want Jesus, the storm calmer, to leave. That is ridiculous to me, but they want Jesus to leave. Get out. Now, before I just say, oh, that was ridiculous, I have to look at my own life. I mean, it is easy in the culture to be addicted to storms. So that we're not about calming storms, we're about living in them. We're about starting them. We're about causing them. We're about like, woo, look at that storm. Oh, my God. You know, we live in a culture where there are storm chasers. People that when they hear a storm is on the way, they go to the truck and they put equipment in it. and they get cameras and they get stuff and they drive in the truck to the storm and the storm is coming and it could kill them. And instead of being scared, they're like, woo-hoo, woo, I'm going to get this on Karen Levin. Woo, I'm going to get a picture and they're going to say my name. I could be a ghetto meteorologist or something. Man, woo, look at that. Oh, oh, I better get, oh, it's getting close. Oh, look at that. Oh, I could die, woo. People who love storms, They chase them. They instigate them like kids on a playground at recess hoping a fight breaks out. People that come home looking for a storm. We going to fight today? Ha! Want to start something? Storm chasers. There's also storm choosers. People that choose not to break out of a cycle of a storm. They stay in the abuse. They stay in the addiction. They stay in the pain. They stay in the hurt. I've talked to people that I've tried to pray with, and they've said, you know what? I just need to live in the hurt for a little while longer. I'm like, really? Yes, you know. Thanks, Pastor Ephraim. But, you know, right now, I just need to live in the pain right now. I think that'd be good for me. Well, here, let me give you something else. Hey, there you go. How was that? You want pain? Hey. I don't know. Some people, like, they come for prayer. They say the right religious kind of churchy stuff. But at the end of the day, the default button is to live in defeat, in pain, in hurt. Storm choosers. There's also storm corporations, storm conglomerates. What I mean by this is there are corporations, companies, even nonprofits, even so-called leaders that they profit off of storms. And so they need a storm to happen because when a storm happens, that's what I get in the newspaper. When a storm happens, that's what I get on the radio. When a storm happens, that's what fuels my talk show or my television show. And so there are some people that make money off of storms. There are record labels that take the worst of urban African-American culture and they dress it up in music videos and on CDs. And then you have gangsta this and gangsta that. And some people that don't even know anything about what's going on in the lives of what's being depicted go out and buy the CD and love the video and think it's cool. And so we've taken the pain and the hurt and the worst of the stereotypes of people groups. We take the worst stereotype of a female you could possibly find and we put that on a video and on a record. And there are people that profit off of the storms of the pain of people. So we have storm chasers, storm choosers, storm corporations, storm conglomerates, and this is why it's hard to find storm calmers. But Jesus is in the business of calming a storm. Sisters and brothers, if you be Christian, our job is to join Jesus, to have such an intimate relationship with God that we are calmers of the storm. Storms are going to come. Now, it's not that it's bad to pray against a storm. The problem is some people, all their attention is they want to pray, in the name of Jesus, let there be no storm. Oh, God, keep storms away. Oh, God, in Jesus' name, please let a storm never come. And the only problem with that prayer is when I look at Scripture, we are supposed to be more in the earth than just people that pray against storms. We are called to be people in Scripture that are able to stand in the midst of a storm and bring peace and bring healing and bring an answer and bring wisdom and bring revelation. We are supposed to be calmers to the storms. Jesus wants to be in you to the point that you can stand in the midst of a storm and you can endure it. You can get through it. You can get on the other side and you can impact by bringing peace other people's lives. Storm commerce. Now, in the book of James, the first chapter, it says this. James chapter 1, starting with the second verse. This is crazy. Consider it all joy when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. Consider it joy. That almost sounds like the storm chaser, right? Woo-hoo! No, no, no, no. A little different than that person. We're not chasing the storm. We're saying this storm is an opportunity for the church to be the church. we did not wish Katrina to happen we were not joyed in any way about Katrina but what is exciting though is how churches around the country came together and responded in the midst of Katrina you see what I'm saying storms are an opportunity for us to be salt and light storms are the opportunity not for us to be in denial but for us to be a part of God's divine plan in the earth to advance his kingdom. We are supposed to be ready at any time to face, to deal with a storm. And so it's one thing to pray and say, God, we pray that there would be no storms. But when the storms come, God, I am willing to be your hands, your feet, your voice, your love, your compassion, your justice, your fruit, your manifestation. This is what I'm willing to be and do in the earth. I am willing to be a storm calmer, a storm calmer. Now, it says here in verse 5, if you lack any wisdom on how to deal with storms, ask God who gives to all men generously and without reproach, and it will be given to you. You need gear, you need equipment, you need empowerment to be a storm calmer. But ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. What can happen, church, is if we're not willing to ask God to be in and through us a storm calmer, what can happen is we can, even without wanting to, become a part of the storm. If we don't have a strategic plan of peace and justice and compassion and love and kingdom building, what can happen is we can become a part of the storm. We can become a part of religious rhetoric, polarization, segregation, stuff that is not kingdom. We could give in to the world's way of doing things because we don't have a strategic, purposeful, prayed out agenda of being calmers of the storm. I'm concerned about the church right now. I'm concerned that we are not aware as much as we should be of the storms in our world and how we can calm them. I mean I'm not saying that it has no merit whatsoever but I'm concerned when the church is more concerned about dealing with a movie that's about to come out than we are AIDS and violence and families that are broken and kids that are abandoned and neglected I mean look, I hope this don't shock you but this is not the last movie that's going to come out to the movie theater and talk bad about God and about Jesus and rewrite scripture I mean, come on, if we're going to do all these Bible studies around Da Vinci Code, we might as well go back and do Bible studies about E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Harry Potter, Lords of the Ring, The Matrix, Star Wars. I mean, we are so concerned about pop culture movies and rethinking our apologetics that we have forgotten about the anointing that God wants to put on us to do something about disease and famine and division and demonic forces. Let us not flip the script on what the church is really supposed to be about. but before you can go out and be a storm calmer and I hope you agree to do this you must be willing to deal with the storms in your own life I hope that when this service is concluded you would be willing to go out to the beyond our doors wall right out here and sign up this summer at Sanctuary, we are going to proactively work to be used by God to calm storms in North Minneapolis. We have a support group for girls called Beautiful, where we want inner city girls to know that beauty is from the inside out, that they are wonderfully made by God. We have a program called the Hip Hop Academy, where we know that rap music can be used to degrade and divide and destroy, but we want to teach kids how to use dance and spoken word, poetry, music, beats to uplift their community and to make a positive contribution. We have a program called Momentum. It's a workforce development program where we have men and women that we work with helping them with their interview skills, with their development so that they can go out and get a livable wage job in their own community. But we also know that if you get a job, if you graduate from school, if you had good self-esteem, but you don't know Christ as Lord and Savior, what difference does that make? But at the same time, if you know Jesus as Lord and Savior, but you don't have a sense of purpose and destiny and career and empowerment, then what difference does that make? We are going to walk the streets of North Minneapolis. We're gonna go down blocks and we're going to pray and we're going to believe God's peace. Now, I know that sounds dangerous, but just last year, we had a group of men that walked the streets with Shiloh Temple Church, a group called Mad Dads, New Salem Missionary Baptist Church, and North Minneapolis Christian Fellowship. We were walking down the street, and all we had on was purple T-shirts that said God's patrol and Bibles. There were kids with guns in their backs like this. They came up to us crying, saying, I want to do something different. Now, I thought we should have been the ones that were scared. They got something with bullets. I'd got to... I mean, how do you... Stop right there. But this thing, I found out it really is a weapon. This is so powerful, so mighty, and when you put this with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, gangsters bow down. There is no need to be timid, Christian. There is no need to have fear. God will calm a storm. 14-year-old kids walking around North Minneapolis with Tech 11s, meeting men and women who love the Lord, and they're willing to put the gun down. They don't even do that with the police officers. Do you see what I'm saying? Now, you could be timid, or you could say, oh, my gosh, God is giving me a sense of courage, a sense of passion, a sense of victory. And if that's you, I'm just asking that you'd sign up in the hall. You could pray for us. You could give financially to the Community Development Corporation through giving to Beyond Our Doors. By giving to beyond our doors, you're impacting North Minneapolis, you're impacting Africa, you're advancing the kingdom. But as I close, it is important before you make that commitment that you know the God who will calm your storm. Maybe you're sitting here today and you are dealing with a storm in your life. You can't even think about North Minneapolis or Africa yet because there's a storm in your own life. Let me give you a tip as I close. I have two daughters, Jada and Maria, nine and seven, fine like they mama. Beautiful girls. I pray one day when they are teenagers that a boy does not step to them the way I step to their mother. But I didn't know Jesus then when I met their mom. But then I got saved and I treated her like such the wonderful queen she is. But my daughters have this strategy that they created on their own, I guess. I don't remember teaching them this. Whenever a storm comes to Robbinsdale, where we live, this is what they do. The first thing they do is they want to know where I am. Even if their mother's in the house, when a storm comes, they go, Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! I know you! Daddy! Daddy! They want to know where the father is when a storm comes. Then when they find me, they say, letís get to the basement. They want go to the foundation of the house. Oh, thatís a good word right there, if thereís a storm coming against your marriage, if thereís a storm coming against the mind, if thereís a storm coming against your emotions, if thereís a storm that youíre dealing with in Raising Kids, if youíre in a storm because youíre single, if youíre in a career storm, if youíre in a financial storm, you need to do two things, First of all, you need to say, Daddy, you need to find the Father and get close to the Father. In fasting, in prayer, in meditation, in reflection, you need to go on a retreat with Daddy. When you are in a storm, you need to go, Daddy. And then the second thing you need to do is you need to get to now the real foundation of what it means to be Christian. It means intimacy, identity in Christ, in the Word, in prayer, in accountability, in healthy relationships, having a purposed prayerful plan for living the godly life, you need to find the Father and you need to find the foundation. And when you do that, you are now hooked up to storm-calming medicine. And when you are able to deal with the private storms, you are empowered and released to go deal with public storms. The God who calms the storms is big enough to cause calm and peace to your storm and the storms of the streets, storms in Africa, storms in Asia, the storms in the Middle East. He's that kind of God. And I would ask, as we close this service, that you would consider coming to this altar. There will be prayer team members here willing to pray with you. Don't leave here with this storm. Why not leave the storm here? Find peace, find calm, find rest, that you might go out and be an ambassador of God's peace. Let us stand together. I don't know who this is for, but here it is. I pray the peace that passes all understanding. It would guard your heart and your mind. I pray a calm of the storm. and then it was all calm to your marriage then it was all calm to your kids to your bank account to you I want to let the peace of God be with you go with you and be rooted in your very life God bless you and thank you for allowing me to be here this morning.
