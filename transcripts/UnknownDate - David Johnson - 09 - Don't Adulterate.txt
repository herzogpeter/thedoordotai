I pray as we go to the Word. What occurs to me as Stephan sings that song, and I even reflect on what he said earlier about the temple of Baal, the people erected, it's because they're thirsty. And when people are thirsty, they'll drink just about anything. Even things that make them more thirsty. Even things that make them sick and even things that kill them. If they think there's some life there at all. It occurs to me that we're talking this morning about some things that reveal that sometimes people drink things that make them sick. So I acknowledge and we acknowledge together every one of us here are thirsty. Really, really thirsty people. Empower us by your Spirit to enable us to drink deeply, not only of truth, though I want us to drink deeply of that, but of you. And if we're going to do that, we just pray your river flow. Holy Spirit come. Spirit of God, fill this place. Our minds, our hearts, our ears, our eyes, river of God, flow. Do what no person can do. Open, open the hearts of men and women to the river of life. They can restore and redeem and bring life. I pray these things. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. We have been calling them the Ten Great Words for Life, Ten Commandments, been in them for a while, the Ten Commandments given by God to His already redeemed people in Exodus chapter 20 as the best possible information on how to live life and how to live life to the full. Having lived as slaves, you may remember this is the context for the coming of the law for 400 plus years we've been seeing them, that is the Ten Commandments, as an invitation by God into a different kind of life, into a different way of living, no longer as slaves, which is what they had been for 400 years. And it's as if God, with the Ten Commandments, is saying essentially this. So let's start here with some pretty basic stuff. I want you to learn what it means to put me first. Accept no substitutes. Revere my name. Observe my day. Honor your father and mother that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God has given you last week. You shall not murder that I suppose someone else's days might be prolonged in the land where they are living. Today, the seventh commandment in the law, you shall not commit adultery. adultery. You shall not adulterate what God designed from the beginning to be a one flesh union where a man shall leave his father and his mother, Ephesians, or Genesis rather, 2 verse 24, where a man shall leave his father and mother and learn what it means to cleave to his wife, thereby actually becoming one flesh. Paul calls this one flesh thing a mystery, Ephesians 5.32. He also calls it a picture of our union with Christ, Christ who is the groom, we are the bride. This mystery of Christ being the groom and we being the bride is great. He says in Ephesians 5.32, This marriage thing apparently matters for reasons beyond that which I think we're always able to even dial into and know rippling out in a variety of ways into issues that we don't always even connect to marriage, of community, of security, of spirituality. Therefore, says the Lord God, you shall not commit adultery. You shall not adulterate what God designed from the beginning to be a one flesh union. To adulterate. It's an interesting word, actually, and as is often the case, has a broader meaning than what we might think on the surface, because at its most basic level, to adulterate something, anything, and you can adulterate numbers of things, simply means to contaminate it, to make something impure. By adding to the mix a foreign element, something that doesn't belong in the mix gets added, which means to adulterate. So if you kind of just spread that out over a lot, I mean, you can adulterate a batch of brownies. By adding an ingredient to the mix that doesn't belong, adding a foreign element of some kind. Now, if you apply that concept to marriage, which is what we're doing here, there are any number of foreign elements that don't belong in a marriage that contaminates the mix. Most obvious is this, another person. Another person does not belong in the mix. Sometimes this other person involved in the mix involves also sexual activity with another person, but not necessarily because sometimes an emotional attachment to another person can be just as adulterous because you have allowed into your marriage a foreign element, an ingredient that doesn't belong. And the ingredient that doesn't belong in your marriage, in my marriage, is another person. Now, however it is you define adultery, Some say it's not adultery without sex. Okay. Others buy into this broader view I just gave you that emotional adultery is still adultery. I actually would broaden it further than that because I think there are any number of foreign elements that can come into a marriage and contaminate the marriage that don't involve another person. Think pornography. Man, that's a foreign element. If I ever heard of one. Foreign elements developing kind of a fantasy life. And we associate struggles with pornography often with men. It's a fantasy life, maybe a whole other life that your wife doesn't even know about. She's not even conscious of it, but it's in your marriage. It's contaminating. And it's a foreign element. It doesn't belong in your marriage. I'm all getting all upset about the men. There's other ways to have foreign elements. Think the fantasy that some of you, and I'm not picking on the women here, but some women do have this. The fantasy you have of the perfect husband. Meeting all your needs. It's what you wish your husband was, but isn't. It's a fantasy. The person you fantasize doesn't exist. But he's in your marriage. This phantom person. He's in the mix. He's a foreign element with which your husband can't compete, but it could be other things. For some of you, the foreign element in your marriage is your selfishness. It's all about you. Every day, it's about you. It's a foreign element, and you know what? It contaminates. It's adulterating your marriage. For some of you, it's your anger. For some of you, it's your lust. And I don't mean sex. I mean what we talked about last week, lust. strong desire to have what you want when you want it, and if you don't get it, kaboom. But however it is, beloved, that you define it, the seventh commandment in the law says of it, you shall not do it. So God, in effect, is saying simply this. I want you to build a boundary. I want you to build a boundary around your marriage, around your sexuality, around your family, and the boundary is a real old-fashioned word, fidelity. Adultery and fidelity. I just would like you to smell, even if you're not good at fidelity yet, your journey to adultery was a journey. Your journey to fidelity may be another journey. I would like you to at least like the smell of it. Fidelity rooted in the covenantal promises you made when you made your vows for the purpose of protecting your marriage, of course, but also for the purpose of protecting your family and protecting your children and protecting your children's children because I'm telling you, just like these other commandments, remember when we talked to God, I think it was honoring your parents, we talked about the generational effect of that. This has a generational effect. This has a generational effect rippling out for generations. The work, therefore, of every marriage. There are no exceptions to this. The work of every marriage at some level, therefore, is to identify and then to remove the foreign elements because all of us have in our marriages foreign elements. Calling us all adulterers at that level? Yes. It's work that some of us are willing to do and work that others aren't willing to do. It's work that some of you don't even know you need to do. The work of the marriage is to identify and remove the foreign elements. Because here's the deal. Here's why these boundaries, particularly of fidelity, are so important because every marriage, even those that we would characterize as being good marriages, and there are a number of very good marriages in this room right now, have what the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 calls trouble. Remember this, I've taught on this before, I love this teaching. Indeed, I think it's among the most important teachings you can give, particularly to young couples who are getting married with stars in their eyes and ridiculously unrealistic expectations relative to marriage. I mean, one of the greatest, I hate to do this, but I feel like I want to be a killjoy with some of these young couples getting married. Just kind of wipe the smile off your face just a little bit. 1 Corinthians 7, Paul is actually extolling the virtues of singleness. He's doing that in the context of a culture where people couldn't hardly have a sense of value unless they were married. It was all tied into that. And so Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 is saying, listen, you need to know that there is great value and virtue in being single. He says, I am single, and he was commending it to people. And it's almost as if he notices that he's doing a little too good a job at this and kind of catches himself in verse 28 of 1 Corinthians 7 saying, but if you're married, you haven't sinned. Well, good. But I need to tell you the truth. You will have trouble. The word trouble there is a fascinating word. It comes from the Greek word philipsis, which means not just trouble, but it means literally to press together. So marriage is, among other things, two people being pressed together. the thought of which quite frankly is not entirely unpleasant when when i was first married at 21 years of age i couldn't wait to to do that press together thing i why do we have to go to the reception i just wanted to do that other thing that press together thing but but here's the deal you know i'm going to a wedding this afternoon of a young man who grew up in our church and grew up in our family, and he's going to be thinking this the whole, I just know it. Good, it's good, but here's the deal. Pressing two people together doesn't always produce pleasure. More often, in fact, you press two people together, you get friction, because we rub each other sometimes the wrong way. Now, while this friction doesn't ever feel good, I believe with all my heart that in the context of a marriage, it's not only an unavoidable thing, it is a necessary thing. It is a God-designed thing. Indeed, I've told you this before, but that I believe marriage primarily is among God's most effective tools, not to just bring you bliss. I think it's God's most effective tool in bringing about authentic transformation because as two people are being pressed together over time all the issues of your life. You know it's true if you've been married for more than 10 minutes. All the issues of your life that you thought you could ignore, maybe because you were so much in love, or maybe because you believed that marriage would somehow, you know, just make it all go away and solve all the problems that you felt in your evil rotten family that you grew up in, but marriage will help, begin to be revealed. And when they are revealed, they have this weird tendency of bumping right into and beginning to rub up against all the issues in your spouse's life that they thought they could ignore for whatever reason, causing friction. And every time you feel that friction, you get to decide. And you know what? We're never conscious of the decision we're making. And these are decisions that translate out into a direction of life. But for the sake of just getting it, it's like every time you feel the friction, you get to decide, am I going to press through this thing and grow? Am I going to press through this thing and learn how to forgive, how to repent, how to love another human being beyond the romance? Or am I going to bail? And the first time you bail, it's not on the marriage. I'm not talking about bailing on the marriage, though it may end up there. I'm talking about bailing on the process. When you feel the friction, am I going to press through this thing, forgive, repent, learn to love, or am I going to bail on this process of transformation where you're actually becoming a different kind of person who is learning how to love another human being, a flawed human being who sometimes feels like an enemy. Or are you just going to love, I just love the world. Yeah, I love these little starlets. I mean, not being mean here, but I see these people on TV. I just love the environment. I'm on my sixth husband. You know, shut up. Oh, you love yourself. That's who you love. My dad, my dad, who I think knew a few things about this kind of thing. used to liken marriage. I mean, he used to tell me that. I remember we didn't have a lot of premarital counseling, but we had some, and this is what he told us. Dave, there's two marriages, like two hunks of grizzly meat being thrown into a steamer. He was a hopeless romantic, my dad. You know? And my wife, Bonnie, says, Oh, I just can't wait. I'm a grizzly piece of meat. Yeah, that's what you are. And you clamp down the lid, you turn up the heat, and as these two pieces of meat get thrown together, into this heat, these two pieces of tough, I want to do it my way meat. If they stay in submission to God, if they remain respectful and graceful and forgiving of each other, over time get tender, juices flow together, one flesh becomes real, you're learning how to love, but you have to stay in the pot. And recognize that this flips this thing, this friction that you feel, that you think means, oh, I married the wrong person. You're the wrong person. This flips, this thing, is part of the deal. It's part of the deal that God is using to call you out into a different kind of life, becoming a different kind of person. Imagine now, however, with everything I told you about the reality of flips, into the mix of that flips reality, Maybe at a time when the heat is particularly high or the friction is especially intense, imagine right then a foreign element being introduced into the marriage, like some guy at work who really understands me. He listens to me. It's not about sex, Dave. In fact, I'm offended that you think it's that, because this is pure. We just talk. We're friends. it's beautiful or there's this woman who actually seems to respect me who doesn't think I'm a loser and the first thing you notice when this foreign element gets introduced into your marriage is this no friction indeed it's almost all pleasure at least in part because you're not actually doing your life with this person there are no bills that you're having to pay no kids you're having to deal with, no in-laws, no hostility or no history of hurt. But suddenly, miraculously, this foreign element, this other person has provided for you a way out, an option. And you actually begin to believe that if you leave this pot and go to that pot, you'll have no friction, no pressure, no slips. I can't tell you how many times I've seen it. It makes me tired over the years of ministry and my whole life. A couple is in turmoil, but they're doing their work. And the work they're doing is normal. And sometimes they know it, and if they know it's normal, then it really helps them do it. Sometimes they don't know it's normal, and it makes it harder because they think leaving would be the answer. But they're doing their work. It's normal. It slips us. Everybody has it. But suddenly, you just notice that one of them quit. And by quit, I don't even mean they leave the marriage, but they quit dealing with their stuff. They quit doing the work. Almost every time I see that, one of them quits. I just smell something. I'm not always right, but I'm always wondering. I think there's a foreign element in here somewhere. Something just got added. And it may not be sexual, but nine times out of ten, someone else has been added to the mix, sabotaging the God-intended sanctifying process of calypsis, because you don't have to stay in it anymore, because you just met Mr. Wonderful or Miss America. Word of warning to those of you who may be in the middle of something like this right now, if you leave your marriage for the lie of the greener pasture, you will eventually have the same friction with Mr. Wonderful that you're having right now with Mr. Potato Head. He will become Mr. Potato Head. Indeed, the divorce rate among people who married the person that they had an affair with is around 80%. You know why? Here's why. And it's time to grow up about this, not just as a whole culture. I mean, it's so scary how lost we are in this. Here's why. Because all marriages have flipsis. Because you're in it. And I'm in it. All of them have trouble, friction, and until you're willing to press through that, you have no chance, not only of a healthy marriage, you have no chance of becoming a different kind of person under the rule and reign of God. So it is, God says in Exodus 20, verse 4, I want you to put a boundary around your marriage. I want you to put a boundary around your sexuality. The boundary is fidelity, faithfulness, no foreign element added to the mix that could adulterate or contaminate it. The purpose is protection and also transformation so that in the context of this fundamental human relationship that God put together in the beginning called marriage, ordinary people like you and me would learn to fulfill all the law and the prophets, which our rabbi Jesus reduced to two things. I just love it. We're doing the Ten Commandments, and we're taking several weeks on the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments is just a fraction of the law, of Torah, and Jesus comes and says, you know, it's really important that you do all that, but let me just bring it all down to something simple for you. I'll reduce all the law and the prophets to two things. Love God, love people, start here. In your marriage. forget about loving the whole world learn how to love one flawed human being and so they did in Jesus day they did not learn how to love their husbands and wives but to put up boundaries they learned how to do that and did all through scripture adultery is unequivocally condemned. Job likens it to a heinous crime. Proverbs 5 calls it the sin of fools. Proverbs 7 speaks of people reduced to a piece of bread, something common because of adultery. In Jesus' day, actually, adultery was punishable by death, which is a pretty significant boundary, wouldn't you say? Only problem. Even when death was the penalty for adultery, I know this is going to stun you but it didn't stop adultery indeed in most cases people who were really against adultery simply redefined adultery so they would be able to say things like this and get real indignant kill the infidel who commits adultery like the woman they caught in adultery in John chapter 8 kill her but what actually is adultery? which marks that question marks the beginning of what I call the legal loophole looking thing a process that bypasses entirely the authentic realities of the human heart that the apostle James says is driven by lust not sex, this is what we talked about last week but epithemia, that strong desire demand to have and do what I want when I wanted, and if you're really good at it, this legal loophole looking can help you come to believe that what you do isn't adultery. You haven't added the foreign element. He did, or she did, or they did, or it's people like that. Fact is, some of you in this room right now not only have a foreign element in your marriage, some of you in this room right now are the foreign element in someone else's marriage. And you think it's okay. It's even the Lord provided. I don't think so. beloved there is a pervasiveness to this and a permissiveness around this both in our culture and in the church including this one that is to say the least a bit overwhelming indeed in the middle of the week as i was anticipating this i remember sharing this with the message team and more than once with my wife i felt a kind of despair come over me um around talking about this accompanied by a mocking voice, as if adultery itself were speaking to me, saying this. So, you're going to speak against adultery, huh? What are you going to say? That it's bad? Are you going to tell people not to do it? Ooh, said adultery. I'm really shaken. Do you really believe it's going to do any good, that it's going to make any difference? because the fact is this. People are going to do what they want to do when they want to do it. James was right. They lost. Strong desire. Demand to do what they want when they want it. J. Allen Peterson in his book The Myth of the Greener Pastures echoes this sentiment when he says this. A call for fidelity in our day is like a solitary voice crying in the wilderness. what was once labeled adultery and carried a stigma of guilt and embarrassment is now an affair a nice sounding almost inviting word wrapped in mystery fascination and adventure it's a relationship not a sin what was once behind the scenes a secret closely guarded is now celebrated in the headlines it's a tv mini-series it's a best-selling novel it's as common as a cold and it's as recent for me There was a phone call two weeks ago from a broken-hearted friend, and the phone conversation began with these words, My sister's husband, fill in the blank. Her sister's husband was a pastor of a very large church in Orlando. Her sister and her husband had four children, and he went off somewhere else. It's a real old story. you know if you want to find creativity if you want to find somebody who's really doing a different thing look for somebody who's submissive to God and is doing their work sin is so predictable it just is so boring it is so predictable there they go again doing whatever they feel like doing whenever they feel like doing it everybody does that the picture I have is of a flood indeed the Bible says that when the enemy comes he comes that way like a flood we get floods in this part of the country almost every spring some years ago I mean last year most recent years we've thought of Katrina when we think of floods but the one I had in my mind when I think of this kind of flood was one that happened a few years ago in East Grand Forks remember that it was on the news here almost every day for several days even weeks we saw how this flood came and devastated the lives of our neighbors there. They fought and scratched, stayed up all night to build the wall of sand, but the water kept coming, the levels kept rising, and despite their noblest efforts, the water began to spill over, breaking down the walls, spreading everywhere, damaging and defiling everything it touched, not just businesses, but homes, and not just homes, but people, and not just big, strong adult people, but children as well. And as we see this flood analogy applied to adultery, it's not just married people that get affected by this, but single people are affected as well. Scared to death are some of our singles, some of you, to marry. And the fear is this, who on earth do I trust? And it's not just people who've committed adultery, beloved, for all of us have been by this affected and even as we lift our voices and hands in praise of our God today, the fact is this, we're knee deep in this stuff ourselves. So we fight and we scratch, we stay up all night trying to build the wall of what feels like sand. We preach our sermons, we have our seminars, we recommend counseling to our friends, confront them with truth, we offer them grace, we warn them of consequences, but the water keeps coming, the levels keep rising. So what do we do? Well, there's part of me that says, I don't know. But there's another part of me that says, yes, I do. Yes, I do. With a little help from the Apostle James, who in James chapter 4 is speaking of spiritual adultery. And this is a shift in this talk all of you need to make with me. Because when you begin to talk about spiritual adultery, what that does is it brings all of us into it. In fact, some of you are sitting here, you know, it's a talk on adultery. It's good we're talking about that, but none of this applies to me. That's why we're talking about this now. Look at verse 4, James 4, verse 4. You adulteresses. He's not talking to married people. Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God, which is a very bizarre kind of thing. It almost doesn't make any sense unless you remember, unless you remember something fundamental. And we talked about this at the beginning of the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments were, among other things, wedding vows. Remember that? Why? Because God wanted to be more than a potter with a hunk of clay. He wanted to be more than a master with a bunch of slaves. He wanted a lover. He wanted a lover. He wanted a marriage where he would be the groom and we would be the bride. And now verse 4 makes sense. Don't you know that when you are friendly, When you make friends with the enemy, I'm not okay with you having them as a friend, says the groom. This mystery is great, says Paul again in Ephesians 5, 32. But I'm speaking with reference to Christ and to the church, comparing it there to marriage. Each of them pointing to the other in symbolic language. The question that is raised in James chapter 4 and that James actually is answering is this. Can you recover from adultery? And that's the question I want to bring in right now. Be it spiritual adultery or marital adultery, can you rebuild the wall that adultery has torn down? The answer is yes. But I need to tell you the truth because James does. It's not easy. Indeed, James' answer isn't real gentle, just real straight. It starts in verse 7. I just want you to notice that when he talks about recovering from spiritual adultery, he doesn't say, here's what you need to do. You need to get in touch with your inner child. Work on it. Build up your self-esteem. Come to realize and accept that you're really a wonderful person after all, and then it'll all be better. No, he said, here's what you do. You need to submit, therefore, to God. Start there. You need to learn what it means to resist the devil, verse 7. When you learn what it really means to resist, to renounce, the one you've been dancing with, he will flee from you. Draw near to God, he'll draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Oh, this is not very nice talk. Purify your hearts, you double-minded. Be miserable, mourn, weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and he will what? Exalt. And he will restore you, and he will lift you up. Submit, therefore, to God. See, at some level, this issue of adultery is not about you and your spouse and making things right there. In fact, I'm going to say something weird because I've been talking about marriage the whole day. Submitting to God isn't even about your marriage. it's about you and God in fact if you want to recover from spiritual adultery or marital adultery forget about your marriage you need to fight for your soul submit therefore to God the word there submit is interesting it's hupotasso and it simply means to line yourself up underneath it's a military term and it speaks of enlistment it's like saying okay I've been over here and I've lost my way and I need to enlist I'm signing up under you there is a spirit of adultery and this is where it levels all of us there's a spirit of adultery and the spirit of adultery says this it's my life it's my money it's my time it's my business it's my way the spirit of fidelity says this I am not my own I have been bought with a price see if my marriage right now is safe for my wife and for my children and for me if your marriage is safe right now for your spouse and for your children it isn't because in my case, it isn't because my wife got all pretty and sexy. And it isn't because I'm meeting every single one of her needs. Here's what makes the marriage safe. When two people, hupotasso, submit themselves under the authority of God, and there's your security, there is your safety, you'll find it no other place. I hear this advice sometimes even from Christians. How to adultery proof your life. And the advice to women sometimes is, get all pretty. You buy a push-up bra. Sorry. Have plastic surgery. That's all the rage. How about heart surgery? Submit therefore to God and you'll have a safe husband. Submit therefore to God and you'll have a safe wife. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Boy, does that sound bizarre. Doesn't that sound bizarre? You learn weird incantations. You probably need a professional for this. Well, maybe you do, but actually, if you just stick with the metaphor here of marriage and adultery, spiritual adultery, it simply means quit dancing with the devil. Verse 4, don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity or is hostility toward the groom? It doesn't say God's hostile toward you. It's like you're in a marriage, you make friends out there, and that friendship with the world is a hostile act toward the groom or the bride. See, in this relationship, he's not willing to share you. You may still haven't gotten that, but he's not willing to share you with a mistress. Resist the devil. Renounce. You know what it means? Break up with your boyfriend, with your girlfriend. draw near to God he'll draw near to you this is I love this part because it answers a very important question because because if if there ever comes the awareness that you have been caught in adultery spiritual or marital if you have a conscience left you will be full of shame you will be full of shame and and one of the questions you'll have is this I want to come back can I come back to God. And James says, try him. I promise, you draw near to God, you resist, you break up with this thing you're doing over here, and you draw near to God, and you watch. He will draw near to you. The picture there, if you're looking for one to hang on to, is the prodigal. When the prodigal was off eating with pigs, the father didn't go get him, didn't, you know, bail him out. He let him, you know what? You're going to eat with pigs. I hope you come back. But the minute the father saw the son returning, drawing near, the father ran to him. You draw near to God, he will draw near to you today. But it's going to take work. Even the drawing near thing. What kind of work? Next thing, cleanse your hands. There's your work. Because while remorse is good and coming home is great. There's some behaviors that have to change and have to change right now. And you probably know what they are. You know, if you're in an alcoholic recovery group, one of the things about a group, a recovery group from alcoholism, I don't know any group that would go, oh, you know what? You just come to the group and you just talk about your feelings and your past and your pain and your hurt and your wound, but you can keep on drinking. It's no big deal. Well, you know, You'll stop drinking eventually. I don't know any group like that. Stop it now. Now come to the group. Cleanse your hands right now. And purify your hearts, you double-minded. Purifying your hearts, we often think of, I've got to get some sort of feeling. No, the double-minded thing is what this is really all about, which simply means you need to decide where you want to live. Because you can't be here and there. You cannot live in this house and live in that house. You can't be with me and be with him or her. So choose now this day whom you will serve, because you can't have a mistress, you can't have a boyfriend, you can't serve two masters. The word there is to decide, all of which means to recover from adultery, be it spiritual or marital. You've got some work to do. You have some inside work to do. Cleanse your hearts. You have some outside work to do. cleanse your hands, which simply means you've got some work to do, most of which people won't do. You know why? Partly because of what comes next. Weep and mourn. Weep and mourn. I mean, I did that one Sunday when I came forward. I thought I was done. Here's the deal. You want to recover from spiritual adultery, from any kind of adultery, And not just be allowed back in the house. See, some people are satisfied with that in the metaphor of our relationship with God or in a marriage. You say sorry enough to get back in the house. But I would like to give you a hunger for something more than that. Not to just be allowed back in the house, but to return to a place of intimacy and passion in the marriage with God and with another human being. If you want that, then you're going to have to take a deep look at your sin. And when you do, you know what you'll see? What you'll see is that there was actually more vile stuff in there than you thought at the beginning. And when you see that, you know what you'll do? You will weep and mourn. And you'll think you're going to die, but you won't. Do you know why? Because God will lift you up. And that's amazing grace right there. Because God will exalt you. The word is exalt you. This is God, Jesus, the groom, taking the bride who says, I want to cleanse my hands and purify my heart. Submit again to the authority of God in my life. And the groom says, I will exalt you. I will show you off to the world. This is my bride. But it all begins with one step. It isn't the only step. It's certainly not the final step, but it may just be the most important step. It's this, submit to God. Align yourself under the authority of God. See, the spirit of adultery again says this. It's my life, my time, my future, my money, my business, my way. In fact, the reason I married you, God, was because I figured I could use you to get my way. Spirit of fidelity says a different thing. Spirit of fidelity says, I am not my own. I've been bought with a price. And from that place of enlistment under the authority of God, we might actually begin to learn what it means to resist the devil, to cleanse our hands and purify our hearts, to weep and mourn in such a way that God can lift us up. The fact is this, the spirit of adultery is on all of us. It is. Maybe this is the place we have to start to say, and some of you are going, I hope our friend is here in this one. Forget about your friend. The spirit of adultery is on every one of us. Because the spirit of adultery says, it's my life and my way. And the spirit of fidelity says, no, it's not. So I had to get to the spirit of fidelity. Submit, defer to God. Resist the devil. Draw near to God. You know, earlier in the talk, I talked about a flood coming in. And I thought about it this morning as I was praying this morning before church. I even told my wife about it. I says, you know, there's kind of a boo-hoo. There's just a flood no matter what you do. The adultery is going to happen. And I'm thinking, what if the water started flowing a different direction? And Stephan spoke about water coming from a throne. What if the water, what if the flood, what if there was a flood of fidelity? How would that happen? Here's how. Submit, therefore, to God. That's how it starts. When God's people, when the message of the kingdom gets bigger than, am I going to heaven? Forget it. Submit, therefore, to God. Learn what it means to renounce, break up with the mistress. Draw near to God, and he will draw near. Cleanse your hands. Process the work of your life. Purify your hearts. Weep and mourn and God will lift you up. Let's pray as we close. Would you stand with me? I want to pray over you. I, um, a lot of different ways to do ministry times. I am going to ask the altar team to come in a few minutes to just receive people who need prayer specifically for this. But I just, I want to spend some time right now with everybody. Um, just, just, just be quiet right now. Holy Spirit come. Holy Spirit come on and Lord I don't know how to break all this down for who needs what here today but some need to take the first step of and they don't even know where it's going to lead them but it's that first step of lining their life up underneath the authority of God and for some it would be to do that again so I pray in your name that you would come and move in this place with a spirit of submission I pray that hearts would be open and hearts would grow tender and this isn't fighting for anybody's marriage right now we're fighting for your soul men and women just quietly in your spirit saying oh God I don't even know what it means but I need to get back underneath you Holy Spirit come for that and some of you need strength because you don't even know what it means to resist the devil but that word resist is the operative word because you're not Holy Spirit come for the power to resist to stand against to stand against Holy Spirit come and some of you are full of shame you know it was the hardest sermon you've had to listen to for many many weeks or months maybe because you're so aware of your spiritual adultery or maybe even marital adultery. And here's the word to you. You draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Think the prodigal. You want to come home? You want to come home? The answer is yes, you can. Cleanse your hands. Holy Spirit, there are some behaviors that need to change today. I pray Father that you would come with a cleansing spirit, a cleansing capacity and purifying hearts power to decide and God this is, I don't even know how to say this but I just think it's right some of us just need to weep Holy Spirit with a spirit of mourning and maybe that's something all of us need to carry maybe all of us need to carry a spirit that mourns over how all of us have been so absolutely absorbed with ourselves Holy Spirit come and lift your people up as we figure out what it means to follow our Rabbi Jesus who says come follow me and I will lead you to the water that will deeply satisfy. I pray all these things in Jesus' name. All God's people said, Amen.
