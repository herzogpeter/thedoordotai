And now, my beloved brethren, I make known to you, says the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, 1, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, and which also you stand, by which also you have been saved. For I delivered unto you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures. and that he was buried, but that he was then raised from the dead. And the third day, according to the Scriptures, and the third day, according to the Scriptures, is a very good day. Oh, yeah. Bringing with it lots of hope. Which is why this morning, this Easter weekend, I want to talk about hope. Something that for many people on this Easter weekend is in very short supply. Indeed, two kinds of hope I want you to think about with me. Because the first is a kind of hope where we are hoping for some thing. Nothing wrong with that, but we're hoping for some thing. The second kind of hope is a kind of hope where you're putting your hope in someone. See, when you're hoping for something, which again, there's nothing wrong with that, but you're hoping for a particular outcome to something. You're hoping for a particular circumstance to turn out the way you want it to turn out, the way you need it to turn out, the way you hope it would turn out. I hope I get that job. I hope I get that house. I hope I get that promotion because what you're hoping for is a particular outcome is for a particular circumstance to turn out the way you want it to turn out the way you hoped it would turn out and sometimes we hope for things that we know are a long way off and in the waiting for this thing that's a long way off we actually begin to lose hope that the thing we're hoping for will ever come which is something I actually experience every single spring and it has nothing to do with waiting for spring, which is something we hope for and lose hope in ever coming. But for me, it happens every spring. This year is no exception. As we enter into the 101st year of the Chicago Cubs, and you just kind of lose hope. But sometimes, and you know this is true, there are things that we're hoping for a lot more serious than whether spring is coming or the cubs are going to do well. Much more at stake. Hope she comes back. Hope we don't lose them. Hope it's not cancer. But one day, it will be. And if it's not cancer, it will be something else. Indeed, one day, everything we hope for will eventually disappoint us, even if we get the thing. It will eventually disappear, wear out, give out, fall apart, and melt down. And when that happens, desire is often stirred for a deeper kind of hope, for a more substantial, foundational, fundamental kind of hope, not in something, but in someone in whom we can place our hope. And I want to talk about that someone today. Because the testimony of Scripture, indeed the testimony of history, is pointing to this one, this Jesus, not because he gives us everything we ever hoped for, but because he is the one we can put our hope in when everything has disappointed or disappeared, as it surely will, even if we get the thing, all of which brings us to the Easter story, which according to 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verses 1 through 3, is a third-day story, and third-day stories are full of hope. But it turns out the Easter story is not the only third-day story in the Scripture. In fact, this third-day theme, and it's part of why I picked it, it's obviously an Easter context or concept, but this third-day theme is pretty much a big deal all throughout the Scriptures. And every time this third day theme would show up, wherever it showed up in Scripture, it would speak to hope, particularly in the context of circumstances where people had lost all hope. Indeed, there was a kind of pattern to these stories. Again, all through Scriptures, where in the beginning of a third day story, it looked like all hope was lost. And it looked like that for a period of time. So in the beginning of a third day story, the way the pattern would work would be this, that the first day was a dark day. The first day was an oh-no day where the thing you dreaded most is what's finally happened then. It looks like every hope you ever had in whatever this thing was that you wanted or needed is gone. And that's the first day of the third day story. And sometimes these first days are not just 24-hour periods of time. There's a symbolism in this. You're in a first day when the horror of something dawns on you. But that moves into the second day. And in some ways, The second day is worse than the first day because the reality of it really settles in in the first day. I can't undo what happened on the first day. It's just devastating, and it settles in. But another characteristic of the second day is that in the second day it looks like nothing's happening. It feels like all is lost, but something is happening in the dark during the second day. In the symbolism of these third-day stories, there's something happening in the dark. God is moving in ways you cannot see such that it issues in a deliverance day. And that deliverance day all through the scriptures, consistent with all of these kinds of stories, was called the third day. And the third day was a very good day because the third day was God's day. Now, the people of God in Jesus' day, and this is something we've been dialing into a lot in the context of this series we've been in on Jesus as a rabbi, kind of continually dialing into the historical context of things, The people of God in Jesus' day were raised on these kinds of stories. Because the fact is, they were their stories. Some of them were actually quite obscure. One such obscure story happened early in the history of Israel. I'll tell it to you quickly so you can see the pattern. It's really not an Easter text, but I want you to see the pattern of this third day story theme. Recorded in 1 Samuel 5. It's after the 40 years of wandering in the desert. The people are carrying with them the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark of the Covenant has a lot of significance to the people of God. It's a symbol of God's presence and provision to his people. In the Ark of the Covenant was the tablets of stone upon which the Ten Commandments were written. There was a sample of manna in the Ark of the Covenant, which was a symbol, again, of God's providing for them while they were in the wilderness. But more than that, the big thing was, this was a symbol of God's presence with them, their provision, his provision to them. And part of their identity is the people of God tied to the Ark. Well, they had gotten to the promised land, but they were struggling. They don't have a king. It's before the time of David and Solomon, and they're fighting the Philistines, their arch enemy, and their fight with the Philistines is literally a fight for survival. So they're hoping for something. What they're hoping for is victory over the Philistines in order basically to survive, but they're not getting it right now. In fact, they've lost a couple of battles, and by the time we come to 1 Samuel 5, they've entered into a loss that was so devastating that they not only lost several thousand men in this battle, including the sons of Eli the prophet, who were called Hophni and Phinehas, these two brothers, the sons of Eli the prophet, but they also lost the Ark of the Covenant in this battle. The Philistines had captured it and brought it with them, so this was devastating. In other words, they had lost everything they'd been hoping for, including the sense of their identity with the presence of God and the provision of God, it's gone. All hope is gone, but that's, in these third day stories, it's when all hope is gone that things begin to get interesting. The Philistines carry the Ark of the Covenant to a city called Ashdod. It was kind of their capital city where they had a temple to their god, Dagon. And as part of their celebration and also kind of part of their way to rub Israel's nose in their defeat and to kind of taunt the god of Israel, they brought the Ark of the covenant into the temple of Dagon and place this temple before a massive statue of their god Dagon as if to say like that that's what they were doing and so they have a big party in the temple with the ark of the covenant there symbol of God's presence you lose Dagon wins having a big party big celebration they do it all day long at the end of the day they get tired time to go to bed they go to bed turn off the lights leave the temple next morning it says in first Samuel 5 3 that when the Astrodites arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord, which is a very weird thing. And it looks suspiciously like Dagon has begun to bow down to the God of Israel, which doesn't sit real well with the Astrodites. And the way it looked was like in the middle of the night, some fight had taken place that no one saw, some movement of God was going on that no one had seen in the middle of the night. So they prop up Dagon, their statue, and dust him off and celebrate their victory for a second day. And they begin to party. And just like the day before, they go all day long. And at the end of the day, they get tired and they go to bed. They turn off the lights. But when they arose early the next morning, verse 4, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face again before the ark of the Lord. But this time his head and hands are cut off and laid neatly across the threshold. only, the trunk of Dagon was left to him, which is, you know, the typical Easter text you expected. You hear this morning. It's so weird. It is so weird. Okay, here's the deal. A lot of things about that text we could talk about, and it illustrates a number of things. But what I want us to see on Easter, that's the Easter connection, is that this is a third day story. First day, very dark day. The God of Israel is defeated. The glory of God, the presence of God among us is gone. while hope is lost. And indeed, there's a very poignant story in the middle of this story of Dagon and the Ark of the Covenant that illustrates this first day, dark day reality. When the news got back to Eli the prophet that the Israel army had lost, that his sons were dead, that the Ark had been captured, he just drops dead. It's really weird. He falls off the wall and drops dead. In addition to that, his daughter-in-law, who was pregnant at the time with his son's child. Because of the grief she's in, goes into labor and has a son. And as she has this son, actually just before she dies, she does one thing before she dies, and she names this child Ichabod, which means the glory is gone. Ichabod is the Greek word for glory. You put the letter I in front of a word. In Hebrew, it makes it a negative. It's like putting the letter A in front of theists, because an atheist is the opposite of a theist. So Ichabod means the glory is gone. Imagine having a name like that. It's a weird name in any context, but basically Ichabod, as he grows up, is living proof. No glory. And what she's saying, this is not just bitterness. This is like an expression from her. What she's saying in naming this child this is this, there is no hope. This whole thing of God's great dream of ministering and calling out a people to demonstrate who God is in the world, that was just a pipe dream. Abraham was wrong. Moses was wrong. There is no God. There is no glory. There is no hope. Life doesn't mean anything. You're born. You die. That's it. And my little son might as well know that fact from the beginning of his life. Ichabod, the glory is gone. That's the first day. And the truth is, as bizarre as that story is, some of you know about that day. Indeed, some of you may be having that day, on this day. Because the first day is the day that the heavens are silent, when hope is lost, when the glory is gone, And the second day, quite frankly, isn't much better. In fact, the second day in some ways is worse because in the second day or the second season, if you will, of these three-day themes, it all sinks in. It really is gone. They really are dead. But things in these three-day stories, in the second day, things are beginning to happen that you can't see, that happen in the dark and movements of God that aren't apparent on the surface like Dagon bowing down to the ark in the middle of the night. But then the third day comes and the third day is God's day. And the whole story takes a 180 degree turn when it gets revealed that what Satan indeed meant for evil, God in fact meant for good. The time of captivity is over. God is coming home to his people and his people are coming home to him. The ark of the covenant was restored on the third day because the third day is God's day. And the third day, which is God's day, very good day, bringing with it lots of hope. And it's just this theme. All through the scriptures that the people of God in Jesus' day kind of grew up on, this third day story. Like in Genesis chapter 40, Joseph, when he was in prison, remember that? Said to the cupbearer, there were three people who had a dream and one was a cupbearer. And he says to the cupbearer, while they were both in prison, In three days, there it is, again, Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore your job. So for three days, the cupbearer waited. First day is a dark day. Second day, scary day. Third day is God's day. And on the third day, according to the story, it happened. In Exodus 3, verse 18, Moses says to Pharaoh, let us go into the wilderness for three days. Why? Here's why. Exodus 19, 13, because on the third day, God will come down. On the third day, the third day is God's day. It's part of the story. It's part of the rhythm of the people of God and how God worked with them. So consecrate the people and make them ready by the third day. And on the morning of the third day, verse 16, it came to pass and the Lord came down because it was the third day and the third day is God's day and the third day, God's day, very good day. I've heard the story of a young woman named Esther. who felt like she was in way over her head because she was having been called by God and placed by God in a position to bring deliverance to her people when they were in bondage if she could only find the opportunity and then the courage to speak a risky word of truth to a very scary and very powerful king. So she fasted and she prayed. Guess how long? Three days. And on the third day, she went into the presence of the king and spoke a word that if not received could cost her life, but on the third day, God showed up and made a way for Esther and for the people of God to be delivered, and they did it on the third day. And then there's Jonah. You know that story as well, I'm sure, on the belly of the fish. How long? Here we go again, three days. And we don't know how many times during those first two days, Jonah thought he was going to die, because that first day being swallowed by a fish, however that happened, very dark day, not a good day. Second day may be worse as it begins to sink in. I'm in here. I don't know how to get out. And he began to pray two things. Lord, let me out. And Lord, let me go out the same way I came in. Yeah. Yeah, please. Oh, please, oh, please. But on the third day, God showed up and made a way because third day is God's day. And the third day is a very good day, bringing with it lots of hope. And these were the themes. that the people of God in Jesus' day grew up on. And all of that is at least part of why Paul says what he says the way he says it in 1 Corinthians 15, 3, that I delivered unto you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ Jesus died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised, and the third day according to the Scriptures. And according to the Scriptures, third day, really good day. Because it's God's day, bringing with it lots of hope, because from everything that could be seen at the time in Jesus' day, those first two days were very bad days. First day as Jesus hung from the cross, very dark that day. The glory is gone. Our hopes are dashed. Second day in some ways was worse as the reality of what happened on the first day begins to sink in. This really is over. He really is dead. This really is final. But then comes the third day. And the third day is a very good day. Bringing with it lots of hope. Indeed, if I didn't know better, and this is a little goofy to say it like this, but I'd almost think God's showing off here. As if he's intentionally setting the stage to show up at the last minute, in fact, too late, like he did Lazarus. As if he thoroughly enjoys his role as the Redeemer. the deliverer, the healer, restorer, and the savior of his people. Amen. Well, I think you're getting the point. I think you are. This third day thing is kind of a big thing because the third day is the day the prisoners get set free and people get restored. The third day is the day that mountains shake and waters parts. It's the day that young harem girls named Esther face down kings and stubborn bold prophets like Jonah get dropped off at seaside ports by very large fish and it's the day that stones get rolled away and a rabbi named Jesus comes back to life. Indeed it's such a big day this stone gets rolled away day that from that day that resurrection day until this day this rabbi's followers who used to only observe the Sabbath began at that day to also observe what the Apostle John in his revelation refers to as the Lord's Day. It says in Revelation verse 10, I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day. That term wasn't used until the third day thing with resurrection. It became known as the Lord's Day, and the Lord's Day is God's Day. That's the third day. And what that means among other things is this, dialed also into this, that we are now third-day people. We are third-day people. It's not just this concept of a third-day story. It's who we are. It's the root of why we hope. Here's why we have hope. Because of the Lord's Day. The Lord's Day. I'm going to talk about the Lord's Day thing for just a second here. Because when I was a kid growing up in church, my understanding of the Lord's Day, any reference to it was limited to the fact that it was physically on Sunday, because Sunday was called the Lord's Day. We were always called the Lord's Day, and when I was a little kid, we, you know, today's the Lord's Day, and I didn't always die. I know what that meant. We went to church, and kind of nobody ever said this exactly to me, but I kind of interpreted things this way. Because it was his day, you had to behave a little more than normal, and being a nine-year-old kid, you know, it was kind of tough, and you had to stay clean. You couldn't get dirty, because it was the Lord's Day, and you had to be quiet because it was a Lord's Day, and you didn't want to spoil his day. Again, nobody ever said that to me exactly that way, and I didn't actually experience Sunday slash the Lord's Day as a horrible day, but I got to tell you the truth. As a nine-year-old kid, it wasn't my kind of day. It was more the kind of day where you did the things you're supposed to do because they're good for you. Kind of like eating your vegetables. Well, that was kind of like going to Sunday school. It's good for you. I believe that. And going to church, it's good for you. And while the truth is, I know this is true, some people still experience Sunday, which is the Lord's Day, still experience it that way. But it means we're kind of missing the point. Let me explain it this way. several years ago there was a guy on the LA Dodgers named Sean Green who on one Saturday afternoon hit four home runs in one day and it's a fabulous feat and it got a lot of attention but what was interesting about this and it fits in with this even better he'd been in a big slump and so everybody kind of going where did this come from all of a sudden he explodes with four day four home runs in one game again big deal um because no one had ever done that before let alone Sean Green, and so people are going crazy and wanting to talk to him. But what I remember most about this whole thing, and I do remember this very well, was his response when reporters asked him this stupid question that nobody has an answer to. How'd you do that? Well, I wish I knew because I would do it again. You know, he doesn't know. Sue it, he said, he got a little sheepish and he just answered the way athletes answer. Whatever. What he said was this, and this is what he says, I really don't know how I did it. I guess it was just my day. I want you to get the picture here because the Lord's Day isn't just the day you tip your hat to God because it's Sunday and it's the Lord's Day so be quiet on that day because it's his day you don't want to spoil it. No the Lord's Day here's the deal beloved. The Lord's Day is the day that he hits it out of the park. The Lord's Day is the day. He parts the waters. He makes a way. He raises the dead. He heals a heart. Indeed, the Lord's day is the day when if the Lord himself were asked by reporters, so Lord, how did you heal that disease, restore that marriage, transform that life, rekindle that hope, forgive that sin, redeem that life, part those waters? How did you walk out of that grave, then ascend to the Father, then send your spirit to empower your church, he might have to say with a bit of a grin, well, I don't really know. I guess it was just my day. And yes, Friday was dark as he hung on that cross, but that's the first day. And Saturday in many ways was worse than Friday because it all looked so final. He really is dead. All hope is gone. That's the second day. But the third day, that's God's day. That's the Lord's day. And the third day, according to the scriptures, is a very good day. So get your hopes up, church, because we are third day people, and the third day belongs to God, and so do you. So sing and dance and laugh for joy. Somebody say amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
