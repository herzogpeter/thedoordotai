Thanks! I always appreciate the opportunity to come back and talk to Open Door. I was about 10 years ago. I spent a summer preaching here when Dave took a sabbatical. And my wife and I attended Open Door for four years before that. So there's kind of this unique bonding thing that has gone on. And so it's always a pleasure to come back here. I love this ministry. I completely agree with the philosophy of taking the arts back for Christ. Using film and other artistic expressions as an opportunity, as a springboard, to address the questions that they raise. And it takes a certain boldness to do that. There is, I think, in the evangelical subculture, a tendency, a strong tendency coming out of some fundamentalist roots, of getting a sort of Masada complex, where you just want to barricade yourself off from the world and don't have the freedom to really engage the culture on its terms. You insist that the culture engages on your terms. And there's a sort of prudishness about that. It takes a bold spirit to say, okay, let's explore these films, this art. Let's read the philosophy. It impresses me how Paul in Acts 17, the way he relates to the Athenian philosophers is by quoting their own philosophers. He knew them. He read them. And so he could dialogue with them. Sharing the gospel is about building bridges, dialogue with the culture. We're much more comfortable, I think, on the whole, standing on an island and throwing stones at it. But that's not the way you win them. You win them by dialoguing with them and engaging them. And so I just think this ministry that you have here is bold and brilliant. And I think Sid is bold and brilliant. And so I applaud you for doing this. Amen. Give her a hand. Sid, you owe me now. I am going to be speaking for some time here on The Matrix. this is an odd thing for me I'm not quite sure why I was invited other than that I preached a sermon on the matrix and now I find myself being a specialist on it which I'm not but I've had several occasions I was over in Ireland and they wanted me to talk on the matrix it was odd so I'm turning into this matrix person I do love the movie I saw it four times and have seen the sequel twice and we'll probably see it a few more times. But I think that it is, in some ways, a profound statement of the human condition, and that's what I'm going to talk on. I'll share 45 minutes or so on what I think is the most profound aspect of this movie, The Matrix, how it intersects with biblical truth, and then we'll have some time to just have questions or dialogue about this, and we're going to shoot to be done right around 9 o'clock. So that's sort of the outline of this. Paul says in Romans 12, verse 2, Do not conform to the pattern of this world. And the word he uses there, it's the word for conform to pattern. It's syschematizo. It means don't let your schema, your schematic, coincide with the schematic of the world. Syschematizo. But be transformed. metamorpho, which we get the word metamorphosis from it, be metamorphosized by the renewing of your minds. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is. That means sort of find out on your own, experience for yourself what God's will is, which in contrast to the schema of the world is good, pleasing, and perfect. In John 8.32, Jesus says, You shall know the truth. And the word truth there is aletheia. it's a combination of two words a meaning not and lanthanos which means to uncover to bring out of concealment you shall know the unconcealed thing what you shall know shall be brought out of hiding that's truth it's not concealed any longer you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free and the question that we need to ask tonight and I'm going to be addressing this it comes right out of the movie that last scene that you saw is will you take the red pill or are you going to continue to take the blue pill? This story, I'm assuming that either from the clips that you just saw or maybe you saw it on your own, the story is basically this. There has evolved on the planet this artificial intelligence which has taken human beings captive. They are using us for energy. We are their batteries. And the way they do that is they grow us in these vats and create in our brains a virtual reality. They are able to control the neurons in our brain so that it's sort of like the internet in a way. We live in this virtual reality. We can actually still dialogue with one another and whatever. But in fact, it's not reality. It's just an illusory virtual holographic reality that's produced by the stimulation of the neurons in our brain. That is the matrix. The Matrix is this system of illusion that this artificial intelligence has fostered upon us. The movie is packed with religious symbolism, both Christian and non-Christian. You find some strands of Buddhist symbolism in there and Buddhist teaching and things of that sort. It's quite eclectic, actually. But the Christian symbolism is the most prominent and, I think, the most profound. And just a few of the things in the movie that are symbolic is the fact that the hero is Neo. Neo means new. He's the new man. He's referred to several times in the movie as Jesus Christ, kind of in incidental ways. In the early part of the movie, a person sees him and he fixes a program and the guy says, you're my Jesus Christ. And there's kind of an irony there because Neo, the new one, plays the figure of Jesus Christ throughout the movie. His name is Mr. Anderson. Anders is the Greek word for man. Son is son, and so he's the son of man. And so he's the Messiah figure, the son of man, the new one. He meets Morpheus. Morpheus was the ancient Greek god of dreams and was associated with transformation that takes place in dreams. He was also associated with the one who wakes people up from dreams. And so his job is to wake people up from this dream world that they are a part of. They're on a ship called the Nebuchadnezzar. And Nebuchadnezzar, of course, in the Old Testament, was the prime example of someone who went through a process of metamorphosis trying to understand a dream. The license plate on the Nebuchadnezzar is Mark 3.11, which is about setting the captives free. Neo is betrayed by one named Cipher, which you can't mistake the subtle reference to Lucifer. And he's betrayed by him. He's sort of a Judas figure. Neo at one point is killed in the matrix, but he's resurrected by the kiss from Trinity. And there's all sorts of symbolism. That's just sort of the tip of the iceberg there. It's profoundly symbolic. And it delivers, I think, a very important and profound point. Before I get to that point, though, I'll just say a word about Matrix Reloaded, because that also is full of this stuff. I don't think it's as packed with new symbolism, and it's not as profound as the first version of it, but there is in Matrix Reloaded. I'm just going to say a word about this, and then I'm going to go back to the main Matrix. As I interpret it now, and there's room for different interpretation, I think, but as I interpret it, the theme that really comes out in the Matrix Reloaded, and it's implicit in this one, but it becomes explicit in the sequel, is the question, are human beings free? Because this movie leaves you, as we'll see here shortly, with the impression that we really aren't free. Or if we are free, it's in a very small degree. And so the whole sequel is about freedom. Are we free? With that is another theme that comes up, and that is, what is the relationship between humans and machines? and what is the difference between humans and machines, which is synonymous with the question of are we, in fact, free? How many of you have seen Matrix Reloaded? Okay, most of you have. Good, then I'm not going to worry about blowing the end. You know, and here's kind of, here's what gives me the, plug in your, you know what, if you've never seen it, you'll appreciate knowing what the end is because the thing is so confusing the first time around that, you know, it'll spare you going to it a couple more times just to figure it out. But in the end, you see, what happens is that Neo confronts the one who constructed the Matrix, the architect of the Matrix, right? The architect of the Matrix is simply embodied in the Matrix as a person, but really he's a machine. And it turns out that Neo all along has been part of a program that he's running. In fact, he's run it five more times. Neo is the sixth one, or is he the seventh one? I forget. But that everything has been planned all along by the architect of the matrix. And the reason he runs these Neo loops where he raises up the one and has him go through this whole thing and predestines him to come back to the architect is because he can't get his equations to work out. It was referred to a little bit in the first installment of the matrix, but it becomes more explicit in the second. in the sequel, that the problem with human beings is they can't live in a world where they don't have choice. They need to be free. And so he has these equations that he thinks result in a perfect world, but it never works. These humans keep on dying because they don't have any kind of freedom. Now being a machine, he doesn't understand freedom. He doesn't get freedom. He thinks it's some kind of a defect. And so he said, you know, the solution to this equation required a less perfect mind than mine. the arrogant machine. And so he's trying to learn about these human beings, these beings who he thinks are too imperfect for a perfect brain like his to understand. So he's collecting data, and he keeps running these programs trying to get the matrix to work, to get his equations to run out. Thinking, he assumes that there is no such thing as freedom. Freedom is a virus. It's sort of a glitch in the system, and so he wants to extinguish it. Now this is the evil god of the matrix. You got to remember that. And I think that's a profound point about turning us into automatons and into robots. And what is really profound, and I'm not going to talk on the sequel here, I'm going to talk on the first Matrix, but let me just say this. What's really profound is, I think, and something to think about, all along in the sequel, you have Morpheus and others who keep attributing everything to fate. And it's all providence, and there are no accidents, and, you know, the oracle is foretelling victory for us and all that stuff. It turns out the oracle is a program from the architect, and is just doing what the architect programmed her to do. And it turns out that all of that pious talk was feeding into the plan of the architect. It was just feeding into the whole thing. Now, just think about that, and it's got, I think, interesting theological implications that I'm not going to talk about. I want to talk about the first matrix. That was just the second one. The first one. And I'll just say one more thing. And that is this. Part of what's happening, I think, is that. Now, this is my oracle prophecy about what's going to happen in the third one. Maybe I think too much about these things. My wife always accuses me of overthinking movies. Just enjoy the movie. So maybe I'm overthinking it. But I see, I think what's happening is that there is a converging of man and machine in the Matrix. That's why Neo is finding that the powers he has in the Matrix, he's beginning to be able to use outside the Matrix. And things that happen outside the Matrix are impacting what goes on in the Matrix. I think the realities are being fused because I think that the movie is heading towards a sort of incarnational, twisted, but incarnational theology where Neo represents a new humanity that's going to reconcile the two worlds together. And in Neo, you have now both man and machine. I think that's what began to happen when he entered into the agent in the first one. And the agent takes on properties of him, and he takes on properties of the agent, and so there's all sorts of funky stuff going on. I could be totally wrong about this, but that's sort of my hunch. The Matrix, number one, and the whole concept of the Matrix is fascinating to me because I find it to be plausible. In fact, I find it to be compelling. All of reality that we know, all of reality that we know is processed through our brains. The only me that you know is the me that is the result of the neurological transactions in your brain. You are a three-and-a-half to four-pound blob of noodles between ears, and you are interfacing with what we believe to be objective reality. And the way this is happening is this. I'm up here talking to you. I'm manipulating vocal cords that are manipulating airwaves, that are manipulating your eardrums, that are manipulating your neurological system, which is activating neurons in your brain that you are decoding and giving it the meaning, oh, there's a person up there talking to me. And the way that you know that I'm up here is because you hear me and you see me, the lights coming down here at 186,000 miles per second, bouncing off of me, going into the retinas of your eyes and jiggling the optic nerves, which is again going into your whole neurological system, activating the neurons in your brain, which you are decoding as a person standing in front of you. But the only me that you know is the me inside of your head, and the only you that I know is the you inside of my head. You see, all of reality is the result of these neurons firing in our brain. there isn't any other reality that we know other than that. It's all neurological stimulation. This is all one giant chemical reaction. And that's not a speculation thing. We know that from neuroscience. This is why if you hit me on the head real hard, you're all oblivious to me, okay? The system shuts down. The only you that I know, the only world that I know, is the one that I interact with through this organic computer, if you will, with incredible sophistication in my brain. Now, a neuron is a conductor of electromagnetic currents. We have a hundred trillion possible connections in the average brain. You have here, you have axions, you have synapse, you have dendrites. The dendrites are the little spidery things at the end. And the way this computer that we have works is that these dendrites are just a little, they don't quite touch for the most part in our brains, but they fire on one another. And they fire in response to things that trigger them. Like, for example, the words that I'm saying right now and the light that you're seeing right now and the smell of the person next to you that you're smelling right now and things of that sort. They fire, and that whole firing, that network of neurons firing at one another, the average thought and sensation takes about one three thousandths of a second, that is what produces in us, from the inside, this sense of holographic reality that we're a part of right now. A thousand trillion possible dendrite connections in the brain. There are more possible dendrite connections in the brain than stars that we've so far discovered out there in the universe. It's absolutely, breathtakingly complex and awesomely marvelous. And it all operates by electrical charges. Here's a picture of an actual neural net. This is a neural net of fear. We actually have cameras that can get this small. It's a chemical firing. and the way that I don't have no idea what triggered this it could have been a thought or could have been something that you saw a big dog or a thought of a big dog which then activates a memory of how a big dog attacked you when you're four and boom the neurons fire and what it looks like from the outside looking in is this what it looks like from the inside is a at one three thousandths of a second a flash of a dog when you're five years old and it produces the fear that you had when you're five years old it's all a chemical reaction your brain is trying to do you a favor by warning you, and seeing this modern dog warning you that dogs are dangerous, by recalling at one three thousandths of a second far, far faster than your conscious mind can ever attend to. Our conscious mind can usually attend at most, when we're very awake, to five to seven pieces of information per second. Your brain, this computer, operates at one three thousandths of a second, which means that the vast, vast, vast majority of what you think, you don't know that you think. That's how come memories and phobias and all those sorts of things have such control over us. You can't just will yourself out of them. This machine that we use to interface with the objective world is incredibly sophisticated, and it's all a chemical reaction. Here's what the hard wiring of the brain looks like. I don't mean to insult you, but this is what you look like. Take off your skin, open up your skull, and look very, very closely. And this is me. This is you. We are this incredibly, this web of neurons and axions and synapses. This is our hard wiring. The hard wiring is mostly complete by the age of one. But the programs that we run on this hard wiring are not. The programs that we run on this hard wiring are given to us by the world around us. And the brain at lightning speed draws conclusions about the nature of reality. These chemical reactions form neural nets. There are paths of electromagnetic currents that get woven into our brain. And they run on an autopilot system. The most fantastic aspect of the brain is that we don't have to keep on learning things. Once something is learned, the brain files it and it becomes part of our autopilot. The brain is mostly an automated system. For example, I don't have to now tell you what the word example means. You know what the word example means if you've ever learned the word example. And this is how the brain can learn so much. It doesn't have to always relearn things. It runs on autopilot. The word example is simply a certain jiggle in the airwaves that produces a certain jiggle in your ear, that produces a certain jiggle in your neurological system, that produces a certain jiggle in the neurons in your brain that you decode as meaning. and the meaning is example. And once you've learned that, then you just file it and now you can learn other things. This is the autopilot of our remarkable computer that is between our ears. It works for us when it's in congruity with truth. It works against us when it's not in congruity with truth. Because that same speed, the same speed with which you can believe and learn truth is the same speed with which you believe and learn lies. So it becomes very important to be in control of this neurological system. Your entire sense of what is real, of what life is about, about what your worth is, about what the purpose for things are, about the meaning of things, all of that is the result of the hard wiring being programmed in certain ways by your environment, by the electromagnetic currents that stimulate the neurons in your brain and that decode meaning in the world around you. Someone looks at you in a certain way, and all of a sudden, you're sure they're mad at you. It turns out they're not mad at you at all. But see, you, for whatever reasons, have got that autopilot locked in that that look means they're mad at you. Someone doesn't notice your haircut, and all of a sudden, you're offended. Well, the meaning of not being noticed was somehow installed in your computer here, and it runs on autopilot. And it will continue to run on autopilot until we do something about it. So the reality is this. It's just conceivable that right now, you and I are in fact in a vat. I'm not up here talking to you and you're not out there listening to me. For all I know, you don't even exist. I could be, it's conceivable, it's just logically possible that I'm actually an alien in some other planet and I was a criminal, so they caught me and they decided to do experiments on me. So they put me in a vat and they're controlling the neurons in my brain. And as of two minutes ago, they're running this program. Of course, it doesn't seem like two minutes because they programmed an automated memory that makes me think that I'm 46 years old and that we've been talking for 15 minutes now. But all that's memory. What's memory? It's just the neurons jiggling in your brain. And all of this is simply some sick experiment that they're doing on me as punishment for the crime that I committed on some distant planet. It's just possible. I'm not saying I'd die for that, but it's conceivable. One final thing about that is this. What activates the autopilot system in the brain are what we call triggers. The person looks at you a certain way. Your mother used to look at you that way, and I always miss you as mad. Boom, there's a trigger. And the brain says, oh, that means this. That means this. Someone doesn't notice you. That means this. Someone's voice is raised a little bit. That means they're angry at me. No, maybe they're just passionate. But see, because it's automated, we assume that the meaning's out there rather than in here. We assume that our map is the territory, we sometimes say. The neurons in your brain are a map, the map that you go by to know the territory. But in fact, the territory could be very different than that Because your map has been, is the result of thousands upon thousands of conclusions that you've drawn that are now installed in the autopilot of your brain, and they get activated instantaneously, just as instantly as you understood every word that I just said right now. So also we interpret looks, we interpret life, we draw assumptions about what is valuable, about what is good, about what is evil, and that is our entire sense of reality. Now, here's the thing about the matrix. I said that it's plausible. I actually believe that it's actually compelling because I believe that, in fact, a scriptural view of the world would get us to conclude that that movie is pretty close to the truth. The movie is pretty close to the truth. Here is, if you can put it up there, how God designed this system to work. As God created us, he created us to be his viceroys upon the earth, to carry out his will on the earth. He wants the earth to be the dome in which he is king. That's the kingdom of God. And the way he wants to do it through us is that he wants to be the Lord of our spirit. Thank you. The Lord of our spirit. The spirit is our innermost being. It's the center of our will. It's the core of who we are. In God's design, The spirit then would be Lord over the soul, psuche in Greek, which refers to our thoughts and emotions. Emotions are just the flip side of thoughts, thoughts the flip side of emotions. The two all go together. Every emotion you have, and this is worth the price of admission tonight just to get this little truth in, every emotion you have is not a response to what's out there, it's a response to how you represent, how you think about what's out there. All right? It's, you are the one causing the emotions by how you're interpreting what's going on out there. In God's design, the Lord would be the one who tells us who we are in the core of our being. We would then be masters of this interfacing computer that he gave us, these three and a half, four pounds of noodles between our ears. We would tell our brain what is true. It would align with the truth that we've received from God. Our brains, our thought, our feeling would then tell our bodies what to do. And in fact, the body is wired to act out what you believe to be true in your brain. So the Lord over the Spirit, Spirit over the soul, soul over the body, and then the body would impact the world. This is God's design. We'd be defined from the top down, Lord to us, and from the inside out, spirit to thoughts and emotions, to body to world. You see, by mastering our thoughts and emotions, we master our body. By mastering our body, we impact the world. When our spirit isn't congruent with the Lord, and our mind isn't congruent with the Spirit, and our body's in congruity with the mind, then the world gets in congruity with the Lord. You see how that works? And that was the plan from the beginning. He created us to have lordship over our thoughts and therefore over our body and therefore over the world. And in doing that, Satan would be kept at bay, which was one of, as I interpret it, one of the jobs that we were to have. The enemy has a different design, though. Here's the enemy's scheme. The Bible says that Satan is the god of this age. He's the God of this age, 2 Corinthians 4.4 He's the principality and power of the air, Ephesians 2.2 Jesus calls him the ruler of this age three times In John 12 and in John 14 and in John 16 In 1 John 5.19 it says that Satan has control of the entire world The authority that we're supposed to have over the earth We surrender to the enemy That's why he says to Jesus in Luke 4 That he owns all the kingdoms of this world And he's willing to give them to Jesus If Jesus will just bow down and worship him And Jesus doesn't say, ah, Satan, you're exaggerating. You know, you don't have that much authority. He concedes that, in fact, Satan has that much authority, but he won't bow down to Satan in order to get them back. So Satan is the god of this world. In his design, he wants to reverse the whole thing. The word perverse comes from the word perversio in Latin, which means to turn upside down. He is a perverse being who is trying to influence a perverse world. He turns everything upside down. So now, here's the schemata, the matrix of this world. Satan wants to use the world and the experiences of the world, the things that come at us from the body, he wants to use that to impact our body, which then tells our thoughts what to think, which then tells our spirits who we are, which leaves God out of the picture. Instead of being defined from the top down and the inside out, we're defined from the bottom up and the outside in. So we draw conclusions about what is true and about what our worth is and about what life's all about based on things that we've experienced from our senses. And to that degree, we are defined, our essence is defined by our environment. We are footnotes to our environment and therefore footnotes to the enemy who's controlling the environment. I'm not saying that everything that happens in our world is satanic, but he can use all of it to communicate lies to our brain. We degenerate down to the level of animals. animals are extensions of their environment their neurons are simply controlled by external stimuli a frog sees a fly frog says flies are good frog sticks out tongue gets the fly it's all just autopilot there's nothing more to the frog other than the autopilot and that's good for a frog but it's not good for human beings but that's the level that we are reduced to insofar as we're conformed to the schemata of this world Satan controls the world Use the world to influence our body Comes at us The body tells us what to think And therefore what to feel We're programmed exclusively by the outside in And then we draw conclusions about who we are What our essence is On the basis of what we think and what we feel Most people don't know that they are spirit They think that they are only brain They're nothing more than these They don't think about this in a philosophical way But their assumption is I can't help it. That's just the way I am. I just think that way. They're slaves to the chemicals in their brain which have been programmed by the world, which have been influenced by the enemy. And so long as that goes on, whatever you consciously believe, you're going to be to that degree in bondage to the schema of this world. Oh, let me go back. In the redeemed person, here's what happens. The Lord, when you submit to the Lord, you are in the core of your being submitted to Jesus Christ. This is a matter of you in the core of your being. You say, I no longer want to be Lord of my own life. I surrender my life over to you. He now is enthroned as Lord over you. And so there is a right-ordered relationship between the Lord and your innermost being, your spirit. But see, the autopilot of our brain continues on. We accept in very rare exceptions are the tapes erased in our brain miraculously when we become a believer. The brain still operates on the old assumptions. It still operates on the old conclusions, the old experiences. The autopilot still is working magnificently. God, his mode of salvation is not to destroy and recreate, but to transform. And so he's transforming us. He doesn't just annihilate everything that was before. He plants a mustard seed that wants to grow and take over the whole garden. And as it takes over the whole garden of our thoughts, it takes over the garden of our emotions, which then takes over the garden of our behavior, which then takes over the garden of the world. But what we need to know is that there's still a continual influence on the part of Satan to the body trying to program the brain. That thrust, that momentum continues on. And so the battle, the war zone, you see, is in the four pounds of noodles. The spirit is now under the lordship of Jesus Christ, but everything else is working against you. So, as I said here, the person who submits to Christ's lordship has a renewed spirit, but yet lives in a world dominated by Satan, 1 John 5, 19. They thus struggle against what the Bible calls the world. The central battle arena is the soul, the emotions, the mind, the personality. And that's the war zone. So often we focus in discipleship and sanctification on behavior. Like, don't do this, don't do that, don't do the other thing. And we think that the behavior is the problem. And there are certainly, you've got to curb the behavior, you've got to address the behavior, but it's so important that we understand that that's not really the issue. Behavior is always a symptom of something that is the issue, and the issue, assuming the person, the issue is not the spirit, assuming that the person really is, and the core of their being is surrendered over to Jesus Christ, if that's the case, then the issue is, how are they representing things in their brain? What's going on in their brain? What is the meaning of things in their brain? That's why Paul says, be transformed. Not by trying hard to not do the behavior. He says, be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Don't be conformed any longer to the schema of the world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Shooting at behavior is shooting too short. The pattern, the schema, the matrix of this world, I submit to you, is the total package of lies we've been conditioned to believe. And in fact, we are all to some degree, in fact, we are all to a large degree conditioned by the matrix of this world. That's why it's possible to be a believer and to be very screwed up. You know, and sometimes people question, well, are they really saved? You know, because how can they have this, that, or the other thing? Well, you know what? You can be. And if we're honest, we'll all say that. You know, it's... The only reason that we question it in some people is because we have a little selective sin list, and certain sins count greater than other sins, and so we think, oh, that's a sin that calls into question. But that's eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And you're feeding yourself off on thinking that your particular issues aren't as great as somebody else's issues, and so you can stand in judgment over them. As a matter of fact, none of us have brains that are in total congruity with the truth. None of us have brains that are in total congruity with God. All of us are to some degree screwed up. Your spirit is willing, okay? Your spirit is submitted, but the autopilot of your brain operating at a speed that's way faster than you can consciously attend to is working on all the wrong information. And so we believe lies about what is real. We believe lies about what is life. We believe lies about what our worth is. We believe lies about what is good. We believe lies about what is evil. And it's those lies that have got to be confronted if, in fact, we're going to get freed from the matrix. You know, and here's how it works. A lady that I knew of was, I'll just give a couple examples of this. She, when she was, she was a normal, intelligent, and rather successful 32-year-old or so. There's one weird thing about her, though. Maybe there's other weird things, but one weird thing that I knew of, and that was that she had this terrifying idea of bugs. Any kind of bug she was terrified of. It was, I mean, weird to the point like where she would plan her vacations around, you know, to make sure she didn't go to places that had bugs or too many bugs. So she went to Alaska a lot, you know, in the winter. Great time. She had trouble walking on grass because there's bugs in the grass. If she saw a bug, any kind of bug, it would freak her out. Now, she knew intellectually, she knew, bugs can't hurt me. And here in Minnesota, I mean, how many poisonous bugs do we really got? There's just not a lot of danger there. And intellectually, she knew that. And she would tell herself, bugs can't hurt me, bugs can't hurt me. But still, there's this terror whenever she had to confront a bug, even when she thought about bugs. Even seeing bugs on televisions would just kind of like make her cringe. Now what's going on there? Here's what's going on there. At the age of, I think, six, seven, eight, right around there, she was taking a little nap out in her backyard, and her mischievous little brother was collecting bugs. And got a whole jar full of beetles and spiders and other things, and then saw that his sister was sleeping. So he lifts up her dress and pours down those bugs. She wakes up to bugs crawling all over her. She's covered with bugs. And she draws a seven-year-old conclusion. I'm being eaten alive by bugs. These bugs are going to eat me alive. And so she is terrified to the core of her being. Her brain, this wonderful computer that she's got, takes that, takes a snapshot of it and says, okay, remember, bugs are very, very dangerous. Now there's a trigger. The thought of bugs, the appearance of bugs, the possibility of bugs is a trigger that now sets off a Neuronet. The Neuronet is of her as a seven-year-old covered with bugs. She is at one three-thousandth of a second back there, experiencing as real as we are talking to one another, though she's not aware of it. She's experiencing herself being covered with bugs. So she goes from being this 32-year-old intellectual woman who knows that bugs can't hurt her, back to being a seven-year-old who's convinced that she's going to get devoured by bugs, and she feels the fear. She doesn't know she's having the thought, but she does know she's having the fear. She doesn't know why, though. She's being controlled by the matrix. The lie, the autopilot of the brain is just going on. And it will go on. The brain thinks it's doing her a favor because it's been fed a lie. This is a sort of prototype of how the enemy keeps us in his vat, how he keeps us in a bondage. A person was abused by a babysitter. and installs in her brain, men are dangerous, sex is bad, sex is dirty. And even when she later on learns that it's a beautiful thing in marriage, she can't turn off that button. She can't turn off that button. And that has very negative implications for her relationships with her husband. Someone else is sexually abused by someone, and we don't know why people process these things different. The mind is so complex, we can never understand all that's working. But she comes to a different conclusion. Her worth is found in sexuality. And now she finds herself, even though she knows better and believes that it's wrong, she finds herself just gravitating irresistibly towards sexual relationships with people she hardly even knows. You see, the lie gets installed and it runs on autopilot and it just keeps on going. Many people have, either through particular events that happen or through an ongoing process of how they are raised, we install, all of us do this, some more radically than others, but we install lies in our brain. Lies about what our worth is, who we are, what God is about, what reality is about. A lie that, for example, that your worth is found in what you achieve or your worth is found in what you wear or your worth is found in your body shape or your worth is found in what people think about you or your worth is found in how religious you are. And so there's this thing going on autopilot that just, even though maybe your theology says you don't need to do this, you find this, you feel yicky if you don't do it. You feel inadequate if you don't do it. You're compulsively trying to perform, even though you maybe intellectually know that that's not what salvation's all about and that's not what your relationship with God's all about. Yet this momentum is just there because the brain, the autopilot, the magnificent splendor and the complexity and speed of the brain is working against you rather than for you because the hard wiring's been given this lie. the pattern of this world, you have absorbed it. What doesn't help at all is the fact that this isn't just childhood stuff. This goes on every day of our life. We are, today you were bombarded with at least a thousand and more likely 10,000 lies. Unless you just spent the whole day in a prayer closet. The world is a world of lies. Ask yourself this question. With every movie you see, with every magazine you read, with every billboard notice, what is the presupposition about God, about life, about your value, about other people's value, about what is right, about what is wrong. What's the presupposition of that in the message that you're looking at? All of that has a subtle impact on us. When I first was putting together this message, it just happened to the night before I was giving it, I test marketed one minute of commercials on television. Here's what I came up with. In one minute, it was a random one minute. It was just a random one minute. There was an advertisement for American Idol. What's the presupposition of American Idol? Okay, what's that all about? Who's Hot? That was the next movie they were advertising. And they were just going to, so far as I could see, it was kind of like a swimsuit exhibition thing. Who's Hot? All-American Girl was the next movie. Do some of you know these movies? I'm too holy to ever watch such things, but it just sounds bad. No, All-American Girl. All of it was about, you know, life isn't beauty. Life isn't sexy. Life isn't talent. Life isn't stardom. Life, you know, this is what is good. And this is what was supposed to be pursued. Then there was a news advertisement about these models who are selling their eggs on the internet. Now, what's the presupposition about life in that one? You know, I want to have a baby that looks like a model. And I'm willing to pay for it. And now with our genetic experimentation going on, it's very scary. What this is going to do in terms of our understanding of normal. You know, what it does, it's just sort of like, you know, up the ante. What does it do to our sense of what it means to be a human being? Okay, the presuppositions are coming. Then there was the thing on American marriage where you vote about who you think should marry who and what's that thing about marriage? See, all of that is affecting the neurons. Now, you can't barricade yourself from the world. You can't do that. We're in the world, but we're not of the world. But what you've got to know is the difference between being in the world and being of the world. To be aware of the presuppositions that are coming at us. In a multitude of different ways. Messages about what our worth is, what our value is, what life's all about. You're not okay as you are. It goes back to Genesis chapter 3. It's not okay just being a human being that can rely on God and get your life from God and get your worth from God and get your value from God and celebrate the life of God. No, the serpent says, no, if you're going to have full life, if you're going to really actualize yourself, there's a tree out there of knowledge of good and evil, which is all about now you defining for yourself what's good for you and shunning what's evil to you. You're going to eat of this tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And that same message comes at us in a trillion different ways. You're not okay as you are. You need this kind of toothpaste. You need this kind of beer. You got to drive this kind of car. You got to wear this kind of clothes. You got to live in this kind of house. You got to earn this kind of money. You got to star in this kind of thing. You got to have this kind of talents. You've got to do this, that, and the other thing. And all of those are part of the matrix that keep us controlled. They keep us like frogs. You know, where we just sort of stimulate. Okay, I've got to do this. Oh, I need this. I've got to buy this. And I must have this. And we're being jerked around. You know, there's an enemy out there. This is the one true conspiracy theory, folks. There is an alien force out there controlling our brains. Telling us lies about what life's about, what our value is, and the whole thing. and the stuff sticks in there. I just, here's the most recent revelation I had. I just noticed, and I've done a lot of work in this stuff, you know, but it's, there's so much of it. I happened to notice in the last several months that whenever I'm enjoying myself alone, reading a book, you know, writing something, listening to some music, if someone else, if I hear someone else coming around, I immediately get nervous and I expect my good time to end. Now, why is that? Why wouldn't I expect them just to join me? Well, the answer is, I have now, I just discovered this. Whenever I'm enjoying myself and I hear someone else, there is at one three thousandths of a second a flash of my stepmother. My stepmother didn't believe children should play. She had this weird, morbid view of life and if she ever caught you playing, and that was another little neuron that I had to get over. You know, if you're going to have fun, you always have to do it in secret. You know, and if it's not in secret, it can't possibly be fun. What a sick, what a sick, sick, you know, really, it's only fun if you're sneaking. You know, that just isn't healthy at all. Okay, I got over that one, but now I realize that there's this other thing that people don't want you to have fun. And now it's, of course, my map's not the territory. People, my wife's very happy with me, enjoying myself, being alone, writing a book, reading a book, doing whatever I like to do. She doesn't want to end my stuff, but my stepmother in my head does. And the trigger was still there. There's ways of collapsing that trigger, taking every thought captive to Christ. But see, unless you change it, it goes on autopilot. It keeps going the way that it was programmed to go. To the degree that we are under the enemy's design rather than God's design. To the degree that we haven't taken thoughts captive, to the degree that we aren't programming our Neuronet computer as opposed to letting other people control it, to that degree we are robots. To that degree we are fated. We are determined. You are a footnote to the abuse that happened to you. You're a footnote to your ex-husband, to what your dad said, what your mom said, the car accident, the bugs that were poured down your dress. You will live your life a slave to that Neuronet. You are being controlled. You're a robot. You've been reduced to the level of a toad. You're living a sub-human existence. I'm living a sub-human existence. To the extent that my stepmother still has authority in my brain rather than Jesus Christ, I am giving her authority to define who I am in the core of my being. I'm giving her authority in terms of determining the quality of my life and in terms of the opportunities that are available to me. We're robots who are programmed to reduce the level of a toad on the basis of an alien power that has permeated this world. And what Jesus is saying to us is, it's times to take the red pill, amen? It's time the red pill. Wake up to the lies. Wake Up To Truth. Jesus said, you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. You shall know the thing that is uncovered, the lie being exposed. You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. The reality is this. You are no one's victim. You don't have to live as a victim. You don't have to live as the always, you know, the tragic figure that if only life had been different for you, if only this or that or the other thing hadn't happened, you don't have to live like that. You were created to live full. You were created to be free. You were created to live in congruity with God who is all about truth, who wants to invest you with infinite value. You were created to dance the dance of the triune God and to live from the inside out and to celebrate. We are created to have dominion over this world, not to be defined by this world. But to do that, we've got to take the red pill and wake up. Okay, let me say a few words about taking the red pill and then we'll draw it to a close. I said you're taking the blue pill, but I meant the red pill. Here's the red pill. I'll just outline a couple of steps here. Number one, the first and foremost thing that has to happen is in the core of your being, You have to surrender to Jesus Christ. Surrender to— See, if the spirit issue isn't taken care of, you can still gain, you know, be helped a lot by gaining control over your thoughts and stuff. But you're— There's going to be incongruity all over the place in your life because you are in the core of your being not aligned with God. The first step to waking up, to getting free, to living life as life was meant to be lived is to commit to letting God tell you what is true, Letting him tell you what your value is and nobody else. Let God have more credibility to you. This is the core thing, you guys, to getting free. God has to have more credibility in your brain than you do. Because you're all screwed up. You've been polluted with your stepmother. And so I will only get free to the degree, no matter how I feel, no matter what I'm thinking, I've got to know my map's not the territory. And the only one who knows the territory is my creator. And so I'm going to determine that what he says about me is true. First thing he says about me is that I'm a sinner, and I need forgiveness found in Jesus Christ. Now, I don't care if you don't feel remorseful or guilty or whatever. You just got to know that that's true, whether you feel it or not. In fact, being able to feel it is a sign of health. I expect a lot of people can't feel it. That's why requiring that they do feel it before they turn around is not really appropriate. You know, people like me and others I know have had their emotional system pretty much severed. Being able to feel stuff is a good sign of health. No, just know this. If you believe this in your heart, surrender to Jesus Christ. That's the first step in getting free. No longer be Lord of your own life, calling your own shots, defining your own reality. Wake up to what Morpheus called the splinter in your brain. And this is one of the most beneficial things you can do for people is to get them in touch with that splinter in their brain. They all have it. Everybody has this. Unless they're just irrevocably, irreversibly lost, they still have a gnawing sense that this can't possibly be all that's real. You know what I'm talking about? That gnawing sense that life's got to offer more than this. Audius Huxley said that there comes a time in every person's life, and he didn't believe in God, he was just reporting human behavior. He said, after Beethoven, Mozart, and Shakespeare, we still ask the question, is that all? There is a deep, profound sense of dissatisfaction with the here and now. The longings of the heart aren't met. That's a splinter in the brain. Isn't there something in your life? Maybe you're here and you're not a believer. Let me talk to you for a second. Don't you know, examine yourself. Isn't there been a splinter, a thorn in your brain that's saying, this can't be all reality. It doesn't make any sense. It's absurd to think that we just exist and then we die and that's all there is. You know on some level, don't you, that that's not reality. Would you like to take the red pill? first step is to acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord of your life and now you're heading in the right direction second thing is to be metamorphosized by the renewing of our mind Romans 12 2 be metamorphosized by the renewing of our mind the Bible teaches this over and over again Paul says the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but they're spiritual to the tearing down of strongholds every one of those little neuro nets in your brain that are triggered automatically under the right stimuli that reduces you down to the level of a frog chasing a fly every one of those is like a little stronghold. It's a little enemy fortress. A little enemy fortress. Your spirit's sanctified. Maybe a lot of your brain is sanctified, but you see a bug and you've got a fortress there. And here the enemy's saying, we still got her on this one. And it activates on autopilot and boom, you're afraid of bugs. Seriously crimps your life. There are strongholds. Paul says, the weapons of our warfare are not carnal. They're not like bombs and missiles. They're spiritual to the tearing down of strongholds. Whereby, he says in verse four, we come against every thought and every imagination. The term there means something like arguments and pictures, every reasoning process and everything we see in our brain. We come against everything that sets itself up against the knowledge of God. Know God, know the truth, and you'll be free. And everything that doesn't agree with that, boom, you come against it. And then he says in verse 5 here, we take every thought captive to Jesus Christ. I'm so utterly convinced that this is the main job of discipleship. If you make this your goal, you've got a full-time job. 24-7. Taking every thought captive. Is this a thought that is under the dome in which God is king? Or is this a thought that's simply under the dome in which my stepmother is king? And to start looking at your brain. Become a detective of your skull. Start asking yourself, where do I get this? Start questioning your map. The trouble is we just assume the map is the territory so we never question it. We assume that we're right. No, start questioning it. started looking at that, saying, is this really true? How do I, why do I always interpret that look this way? And you might find, in fact, that you've got a stronghold there, and you come against it in Jesus' name. Paul says, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is beautiful, think about these things. The Bible tells us what to think on. Look at this. The very fact that the Bible commands us to think a certain way shows you that you are more than you think. See, if you were only the neurological stimuli in your brain, you couldn't possibly control it. You are it. But the Bible says, no, you control your thoughts. Someone once said to me, sounds to me like you're telling us to brainwash ourselves. And my response was, absolutely. Absolutely. This computer was meant to be washed. Someone's got to program it. Now it's either going to be you or your stepmother, you or your little brother, you know, you and the commercials, you and the billboards, you and the car accident that you had, You and the babysitter that raped you. Who's going to get the rights to control your computer? That's what it comes down to right here. The fact that the Bible tells you, spirit being, to program this thing in accordance with God's design. See, now you're under the right structure. You have the authority to control your brain. I rebuke in Jesus' name the lie. I can't help it. That's just the way I think. Man, if you believe that, you might as well say, I want to be a slave. You can control the way. No, it's not easy because the brain thinks so good. But you got to know the starting point is to know that you have authority over this take captive You spirit being who are not simply a a reducible down to neurons You take captive all those neurons and you program them in accordance with god you decide what is true And now boom start programming that thing you got a lot of years of momentum to work against. It's not easy This is the main task of discipleship but you start doing that and now you're bringing your brain and your emotions and then your body and then the world under captivity of Jesus Christ Paul says put away your former way of life your old self corrupted and deluded deluded that's your old self be renewed in the spirit of your minds clothe yourself with a new self you see on a spirit level you're a new being old things have passed away all things are new you're robed in righteousness you're the bride of Jesus Christ you sit with Christ in heavenly places You know, all of that is true about you in terms of your essence. You've got new spirit blood flowing through you, okay? You've got new marrow going through you. But your computer is still screwed up. So life is a process of putting off the old here and putting on the new. Putting on the new. Oh yeah, I forgot. Here's who I am. Here's what life's all about. Here's who God is. And constantly renewing your mind. Put on that new self that is created according to the likeness of God and true righteousness and holiness. Put away all falsehood. And finally, Jesus says, As I said before, you shall know the truth and the true self set you free. And as you do this, Paul says, as you're transformed by the renewing of your mind, no longer conformed to the matrix of this world. No, you are telling your brain what to think. As you do this, Paul says, then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is. His good, pleasing, and perfect will. He's got a will for your life. It has to do with that spirit, who you are in him, what your worth is, what his plan for you is. But to the extent that your brain doesn't agree with that, it clouds the whole thing. It suppresses the whole thing. It squashes the whole thing. You'll never experience the truth until you know it, until you know it, until you represent it, until you are moving in that. That's why so many people are like, I believe it's true, but I don't experience it. I just don't, you know, I don't feel holy. I don't feel righteous. I don't feel like I'm infinitely worthwhile. I don't feel like God loves me. And incidentally, if you're taking notes, take a note on this one. It's so important that while you can't— Feelings are important to get in touch with because they will trace you back to a thought. And that's how you discover what you're doing in your brain is by tracing back feelings. But in terms of being transformed, if you give feelings the authority to tell you what is true, it ain't going to happen. People are so— One of the sad things about our culture is that we have enthroned feeling as a God. I feel like this is true. I feel this. I don't feel like... Well, you know what? See, the feelings are simply a result of what you're thinking. Now, your thinking is screwed up, so of course your feelings are screwed up. And the only way you're going to make headway with this is by saying, even though I feel like I'm worthless, I know the Bible says that I'm worthless. And now, against your feelings, you try to represent that in your brain. You try to reprogram the neurons in your brain, and eventually, eventually, the feelings start to change with that. When it really starts to... When the neurons, when the dendrites start to fire in a different way, it produces different feelings. But you'll never get there as long as you're letting the feelings, which are the result of all this bad neuron firing going on, as long as you put that as lord of your life and thrown it as the arbiter of truth, you're not going to make any headway. You should know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Okay, one final thing here. And this is the biggie that I can't get into. But how do we do this? How do we do this? how do you take thoughts captive to Jesus Christ how do we do this what you got to know is this I tried it if I was going to distill it down to a five minute thing what would I say and here's what I'd say you need to know that the mind thinks we know this neurologically now the mind thinks by representing reality with all five senses look at that word representing it means re-present the mind thinks This is what makes it so extraordinary. I can think about my wife even though she's not present. I make her present again. I re-present her in my brain. Okay, I'm thinking about my wife right now, right? The way I do that is by imitating reality in my brain. The same neuronets are activated when I think about her, if I'm thinking about her with all five senses, if I'm thinking about her concretely, as are activated when I actually see her, roughly speaking, the same things. The brain doesn't think with information. Nobody. There may be a few idiot savants who do this, who think in terms of strictly abstract thoughts. There's a theory out there about them on that. But for the most part, and almost exclusively, when we think, we think by re-imaging reality in our brain. No one gets a ticket tape piece of information going across their brain. When I'm thinking about my wife right now, there's not a piece of information that says, she's five foot four, she's beautiful, She, you know, is this old and weighs this much and likes these activities. You know, I don't see... Now, if you ask me about her, I will tell you that abstract stuff. But that's not what I'm seeing. I just can't give you the picture, so I chuck it down into abstract information to give it to you. Our problem is that we mistake the abstract information for what's really going on in the brain.
