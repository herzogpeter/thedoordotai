Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, the first chapter. The book of Ephesians, the first chapter, starting in the sixth verse. We're starting to make progress, believe it or not. We're moving on. Let's pray as we begin. Lord Jesus, we thank you for your precious word, for its ability to teach us, to change us, to show us the things in our lives that need to be altered and moved, and by your Spirit, as your word is brought forth, Your Spirit is able to do its work in our hearts. And Father, we pray that your Word would do its work in our hearts and in our church this morning as we break it open. In Jesus' name, amen. Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to define for the believers in that community that the church is the body of Christ. The church literally, we are finding out from this study, is Christ incarnate in the world. That's one of the emphases that Paul is placing on the body of Christ. Christ incarnate in the world, indwelt by the living Lord himself. The church of Jesus Christ is not an organization. It is not a business. It is an organism. It's a living, breathing organism. It is, in fact, Jesus in the world. We've talked about the fact that we could very possibly call the body of Christ body too. 2,000 years ago, Jesus of Nazareth was God incarnate in the world, and he manifests himself to men through that body. Today, he does that same work through his church, the body of Christ. We've discovered that that's one of the strong, fundamental thrusts of the Apostle Paul in this book. And we want to notice that as the Apostle Paul is speaking in grandiose terms, he is not using local references to the church in Ephesus. He is not speaking to, at this point at least, he is not speaking to individuals in a given city for specific kinds of problems, to a specific congregation. He is talking here theology, and it's the theology of the church. And before he can get specific and tell them how he wants them to live, he needs to tell them what they have, the theology of the church. He needs to tell them that they are not just the flock with a shepherd, and not just a branch with a vine, not just a kingdom with a king. They are a body. We are a body. And Christ is the head. And now before Paul gets into the functioning of the church, which we're going to be hitting in these next few chapters, under the inspiration of God, we have already learned that in these first few verses, verse 3 through 14 especially, as the praise of God just begins to pour out of Paul in one long sentence from verse 3 to 14, we have been privileged under under the inspiration of God, to go back into the council chamber of God, as it were, before time began, and see God's magnificent plan in the forming of the body of Christ. And we know from the last few weeks that we've been studying this text, that the plan breaks down into three basic phases. First of all, verses 4 through 6, the past aspect of this plan. And the key word for the past aspect of the plan is the doctrine of election, sovereign selection. God chose. We have learned that this entire plan of God informing his church is predicated on God's sovereign selection. Okay? Phase two, we're moving into it now. And that is the present aspect of this divine plan that was devised before the foundation of the world. And that's found in verses six through ten. And the key word there is redemption. Redemption. In other words, redemption is the present working out of God's sovereign selection. Okay? Past election, present redemption. And then the third phase will be in verses 11 through 14. And the key word in this is, this is the future aspect here. We have past, present, and future. And the key word in this particular phase is inheritance. And so we see that he chose us in the past. He redeems us in the present so that in the future an inheritance will be ours. Okay? So in this plan, what we see is we see elective purpose, we see a redemptive plan, and an ultimate inheritance. Again, as I've said in the last couple of weeks, we have spent time discussing this doctrine of election and trying to explain it. We spent two weeks in those first four verses. A lot of time, a lot of teaching. Had to go, we had to do it. Today we're moving on. We come to the present working out of God's plan, and that is redemption. Let's read the text, starting in verse 6. To the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us. King James Version says that we are accepted here in the Beloved. It should be read, and I want you to take a note of this, the Beloved One. This is speaking of Christ, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved One. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace which he lavished upon us. In all wisdom and insight he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his kind intention which he purposed in him with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of times. That is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things upon the earth. Redemption. I want you to put your thinking caps on with me, because we're going to do some work, we're going to do some study. First of all, I want to give you a definition of the word redemption. A definition, simply this. This is a theological definition to begin with. It is an act of God by which he himself has paid as a ransom the price for sin which has outraged his holiness. You got that? Move on. No, you didn't get that, okay? Redemption, theological definition, is that it is an act of God, it is an act of God by which he himself has paid as a ransom, okay? It is an act of God by which he himself paid as a ransom the price for sin, the price for sin which has outraged his holiness, which has outraged his holiness. One more time, very quickly. An act of God by which he himself has paid as a ransom the price for sin which has outraged his holiness. Basically, it's deliverance by the payment of a price. Now, that's a secular meaning. I want to give you two Greek words in the New Testament that will help us understand redemption because it was used in a secular way also, and it gives a deeper meaning. The first word is ex-agorazo. The root word for the word ex-agorazo is agora. It means simply this, marketplace. Okay? The word exagorazo, ex means out of. So what we have here, the word means simply this. Exagorazo means out of the marketplace, to buy out of the marketplace, to purchase, to buy it and make it yours. Another word in the New Testament for redemption is apalup. Don't you love it when I throw these words? Apalutrosis. There we go. Apalutrosis. It simply means this. To pay a price to set someone free for bondage. to pay a price to set someone free from bondage. Now again, these words, that was the word that is used here in our text, apolutrosis. Okay? To pay a price to set free from bondage. Now, this doesn't really connect with us that well because we don't have anything in a secular way to look at and say, aha, I understand exactly what that means. I have an illustration in life that gives me a graphic picture of it. But I want to tell you something. The New Testament believers who heard that word knew exactly what it meant. In those days, there were six million slaves in the Roman Empire, and buying and selling people was a common thing. Just like buying and selling animals. You want a dog, you go look in a paper, you get a dog. Same kind of thing, six million slaves. And there were marketplaces, and slaves would be there, and you would take your pick, and what you would do is you would pick the one that was the best, and you would pay a price to Apollutrosis to buy him out of the market. Okay? A physical thing, it meant something to them. Now, one of the strange things that would happen from time to time is that someone would be buying slaves and he would do something really strange and really crazy. He would see these slaves for sale and he would buy them for the purpose of setting them free. That is the meaning of apollutrosis. He would buy them out of the marketplace for the purpose of setting them free. Redemption is the deliverance by the payment of a price. Okay, you got that? Hang on, let me go a little bit further. using this illustration I've just given you from the marketplace on a secular physical way to give you a deeper theological meaning here. The picture is this, that every one of us, everyone who's ever entered the world is a slave, is a captive. We are slaves. We are in the marketplace, as it were, bound. The question that would have to come and has to be answered is who or what is holding us captive? Okay? To whom are they slaves? John 8, 34 says, Jesus said everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. Romans 6.17 speaks of us being slaves to sin. Romans 7.14 says, For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh sold into bondage to sin. Romans 8.21 speaks of the fact that we are slaves to corruption. So, sin is the captor, and that holds all men, for all have sinned. And so every one of us are captives. And the problem is, again using this illustration of the marketplace and having to be bought out. The problem is that sin and Satan, like any possessor, demand that a price be paid for the release of the victim. Okay? I'm making this very, very simple and very, very clear. The price to release the victim is simply this. Every one of us knows it. The wages of sin is what? Is death. The wages of sin is death. So I have to add another thing to this picture we're painting of that slave, we who are on that in captivity to sin and Satan, I've got to add another dimension to it, and it's this, that we're condemned. We're condemned to death. The price that needs to be paid is death. The Old Testament says that the soul that sinneth, it shall what? It shall die. Therefore, to purchase sinners from the grasp of sin, Jesus had to die. Jesus had to die. Hebrews 9.22 says, Without the shedding of blood, There is no remission of sin. So what does it mean when we say that Jesus redeemed us? It means, and what we mean is simply this, that he paid the price that sin demanded, and when he paid the price that sin demanded, we were set free. This is the point of this entire book, this entire word of God. Galatians 5.1 says that it was for freedom that Christ has set us free. Therefore, keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery. Don't go back. Once you've been redeemed, once you've been bought out of the marketplace, don't go back to that yoke of slavery that once you were in bondage to. Galatians 1.4 says, Christ gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us out of the marketplace. Colossians 1.13, for he delivered us from the domain of darkness. Again, I'm on the trading block. A slave bound. The sentence on my life is death and he transferred us from domain of darkness into the kingdom of his beloved son. Galatians 3.13 says, Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. And maybe the best is Hebrews 2.14 and 15, saying this, that through the death of Christ, Christ might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is Satan, and that he might deliver those who through fear of death, listen to this, were subject to slavery all their lives. He has bought us out of the marketplace. He has set us free. Redemption. Okay, I want to give you a little bit more help in understanding this completely. By comparing this term redemption with a few other terms that will just kind of enrich our understanding of it, give it a little bit more depth, and give us a real handle on what it means. And this is very important for you to get it. five Greek terms from the legal vocabulary that really give us a grasp of this. The first term is the term dikiosis, and legally it means to be acquitted, to be acquitted, to be declared not guilty. You stand before the judge condemned, you stand before the judge with a charge against you, the judgment is made not guilty. We translate that term into the English justification, Just as if you didn't do it. Acquittal. Another term you need to know is aphasis. And we're going to pull these together in just a minute. I want to give you a definition now. Aphasis, to cancel a debt, is simply what it means. A lawsuit is wrangling in the courts. A judgment is made. The judgment is simply this. You don't owe a thing. A cancel of a debt. Cancellation of a debt. Translated, forgiveness. Retribution has been made. The debt has been canceled. You're forgiven. Aphasis. Euathasia means adoption. Legally it means adoption. And people would go to the court to adopt a child. And euathasia means they would have that child adopted. That child would become theirs. And the Bible uses this term over and over to speak of sonship and adoption into his kingdom. Katalaso means reconciliation legally. It's legal reconciliation. The picture you'd have here is that two squabbling factions would come together in the court of law and in their dealings in the court of law, they would be reconciled. The problems would be taken care of. Someone would be going for a divorce, a man and a wife. They would come to court, the problems would be reconciled. They would be brought together, the problems would be set aside. The Apostle Paul talks about being reconciled to God. There is now therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ. We are reconciled. Those things that were wrong have been put aside. Reconciliation. And apollutrosis, this thing again, redeemed, to redeem, to purchase, to set free. These terms are absolutely magnificent as I begin to put them together and let them sink in. You see, in justification, the sinner, that's me, stands before God accused, and he is declared righteous. In forgiveness, the sinner stands before God, a debtor, and he finds out that the debt has been canceled. In adoption, he stands before God as a stranger, as an alien, And he finds out not only has he just been introduced to God, he has been made a son. In reconciliation, the sinner stands before God as an enemy of God, and he's made a friend. In redemption, the sinner stands before God as a slave, and he receives his freedom. We are accused, but he has borne our punishment. We are debtors, but he has paid the debt. We are strangers, but we are adopted as sons. We are enemies, but in him we have been made friends of God. We are slaves. But because of Christ, we've been set free. And all of these terms come together and describe for us different facets of that magnificent diamond that we call salvation. And redemption is only one tiny facet of what salvation really is. Let's break down the text. Break down the text very quickly. I have five aspects here, and I don't want to let that scare you because we're going to go through them very quickly. Five aspects as we break down the text. By the way, one of the things that I wanted to express to you as we began to just live together and function together and break open God's Word is that I love to preach expository sermons. And there's several different benefits of that. I think we learn God's Word that way. I think that we end up hitting all the topics that way. There's all sorts of benefits. But one of the benefits I hope you pick up, almost by osmosis, is that we learn how to study God's Word. We're just going to do real simple things. There's no big genius in this. We're just picking words apart and putting them down on paper and understanding what they mean. Let's go along. There's five things we see here in this text. First of all, in this whole dimension of redemption, we see who the Redeemer is. We see the Redeemer. This is a very quick one because we already know this. We see that in Him, we have redemption. Verse 7. In the Beloved One, we are accepted. So we see that our redemption, the Redeemer, is Christ. Okay? That's very simple. I want you to notice a term very quickly, however. And that is one I've already alluded to very quickly. And that is in verse 6. We have been accepted in the Beloved One. Beloved One. That is God's very special term, God's very special name for His Son, Jesus. In Mark 1.11, He says this, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And later on, He goes on and says, This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him. Jesus Christ is the Beloved One of God. And as the Beloved One of God, as that special, special person, he receives from God and is the recipient of all that God is and all that God has. And then the exciting thing is that because he has paid the price and bought us out of the marketplace and because we are in the beloved one, all of the things that pertain to Christ pertain to us. Someone wrote once that, speaking of his nearness to the Lord and his relationship to God through Christ, saying this, near, so very near to God, nearer I couldn't be. For in the person of his Son, I'm just as near as he. Dear, so very dear to God, for in the presence, or in the person of his Son, I'm just as dear as he. The Redeemer, the Blessed One of God, Jesus Christ himself. Not only, however, do we see the Redeemer, we see the redeemed. Who is it that has been redeemed? Ah, that's easy. Ah, come on. Let's get into it, okay? We're breaking this down. In him, that's the Redeemer. We, that's the redeemed. We are the redeemed. Let's look over in verse 6. we see that it's us who are accepted he has accepted us so the redeemed so we have us and we they are the redeemed but who are the us and the we we see the us and the we are the pronouns but where's the antecedent who is the us and the way like to introduce you to these people a delightful bunch of people and the place we find out who the us and the we are that christ has redeemed is in chapter 2 verse 1 and you so not only is it the us and the we but it's the us the we and the you These are the people who have been redeemed by the beloved one of God. You, who are dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince and the power of the air of the spirit, that is now working in the sons of disobedience, among them we too all formerly lived in the lust of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath. What do we have so far? Who is it that has been redeemed? Well, so far we know that they're dead in sin, they're controlled by Satan they're guided by the lust of their flesh they're guided by the desires of their mind and by nature they're children of wrath a real nice bunch of people huh? that's the us and the we and the you those are the people who've been redeemed you want some more? let's get some more chapter 2 verses 11 and 12 zipping right over therefore remember that you the Gentiles or the heathen in the flesh are also called the uncircumcision so you're the heathen verse 12 remember that you were at one time separate from Christ excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. Chapter 4, verse 17 through 19. Some more on these wonderful people. This I say therefore, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer, just as the Gentiles or the heathen also walk in the futility of their mind. So that's the yesterday we knew. These are the people who've been redeemed. They walk in the futility of their mind. They've been darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God. Ignorance is in them. The hardness of heart, verse 19, become callous, giving themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity and greediness. Nice bunch of people. This is the us, the we, and the you. The beloved one of God has bought out of the marketplace. Who are they? They're lewd. They're greedy. They're blind. They're ignorant. I should say this different. We were lewd, greedy, blind, ignorant, alienated, darkened, vain, Strangers to God, absolutely no hope, and without God. That's the us, the we, and the you. That's you. You are losers. The beloved, the beauty and the joy of our salvation is that the Redeemer, the beloved one of God, has chosen to redeem sinners. That's you. That's us. That's the we. Titus 2.14 says he gave himself for us that he might redeem us from iniquity that he might buy us out of iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own possession. How can he call us his possession? Because he brought us out of the marketplace out of the bondage and the slavery of sin. Jesus said this I am not come to call the righteous but I am come to call sinners to repentance. You know, that's really a dumb plan. Yeah, don't you think? I think you or I would have done a little different. I know I would have done it different. If I was looking for people to buy out of the marketplace, buy out of slavery and all that kind of mess they were in, I think I would have looked around for really good people. Don't you? I would have looked around for people who were really sharp and really together. God had a problem there because nobody was. They were all a mess. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. But I'm so glad that instead of looking for good people, righteous people, he came to call sinners and he brought me out of the marketplace and he brought you out of the marketplace, out from under the slavery of sin. I hope I'm able to paint this picture for you enough that theologically what is really happening to us under this doctrine of redemption, the picture is simply this, that he looked at David Johnson and I was standing on the block, the trading block, and my life was just absolutely condemned. And all he could say in his holiness is look at Johnson, what a mess! What a mess! And I have to be very honest too, as we see the holiness of God and the depravity of man, and that's where we are dead in sin, is if I was able to kind of conjure up that picture and God was looking at me and saying, a slave to sin, and I was looking in his face, I'd have to look away. I couldn't stand it. I'd be full of shame. I'd be full of shame and guilt. But he bought me out. He bought me out. So no longer would I be a slave. But now I'm a son. Now I'm a son. I'm adopted as a son. And part of this new relationship that I have with Jesus, the one who, in the trading place, pulled my life right out. The new relationship I have now is no more wrapped up in shame and guilt and fear. Now, David Johnson, that one who was a slave, dead in sin, now comes boldly into his presence. I have no righteousness of my own and neither do you, but we are accepted in the beloved one. And every one of us go, oh, but I don't deserve it. That's for sure. That's for sure. But you've been bought. You've been purchased. You know, as I think of this, I think of the picture that we've been trying to paint of the slave in the market and the redeemer pulling them out. One of the things that just comes into my mind is a question that's simply this. Where is pride? The fact that self-righteousness can be existing in any form in a church is something that's absolutely incongruous with this kind of teaching. when we see who we were, dead in your sin, darkened, blind, ignorant, absolutely without hope, but the Redeemer, the Beloved One of God, purchased the Bible. Where's pride? Where is pride? Where is self-righteous? Where do we get, Christian believer, Beloved One of God, where do we get these pompous attitudes sliding into the church? I can't imagine. Unless it's sin. Where do we get pious, pissy kinds of looking down our spiritual noses at people. You were dead, darkened, blind, ignorant, no hope, without God in the world. While it's very hard to figure out where pride and pompous arrogance could possibly filter into the church of Jesus Christ, it's also very hard for me when we understand this kind of doctrine, it's also very hard for me to see how Christians could be walking around condemning themselves with real low self-esteem. I can't imagine that either. Somewhere along the line, we've got to hit the balance, folks. Because we were dead in our sin, but God in his great love has bought you out. He set you free. He's redeemed you. He's forgiven you. There's nothing we can do to earn it, to achieve it. All we can do is receive it. Believe him and thank him and praise him and humbly serve him. Okay, we see who the Redeemer is, the beloved one of God. We see who the redeemed are, the us, the we, and the you. Dead in our sin. Ignorant, blind, naked before him. Then we see the redemptive price. In him we have redemption through his blood. Okay, we're just breaking this down. It's very easy. In him, that's the redeemer. We, that's the redeemed, have redemption through his blood. That's the price. That's the price. His blood means death. There's all sorts of different terms that are used to signify this. I think you probably know, but I want to say it anyway, That it wasn't enough for Jesus just to bleed. Okay? This is a metonym for his death. He had to die. There's different ways the Word of God says this. In some places it says he gave himself. He gave his body. He gave his soul. He gave his blood. It all means he died. He had to die. I want you to get this. If you're taking notes, write this down. And if you don't really get it, maybe we can talk about it a little bit later. His blood actually made redemption. Now that's kind of strange talking. I want you to get it. The emphasis especially being his blood actually made redemption. What I mean by that is simply this. As we look into the Old Testament, we see that it was the blood of goats and bulls that was poured forth and it was kind of a temporary thing. It had to be done over and over again. The blood of goats and bulls was symbolic of something else that was to come. It was a type. It was typical of something else that was to come. It was not complete. It was something that was kind of holding judgment off, as it were. But his blood, the blood of Christ, was the actual working out of redemption. It was final. It was complete. Absolutely paid in full. And it was all planned before the foundation of the world. For by one offering, one offering, he has perfected forever them that are sanctified. And when I think of that, I begin to understand that it's no wonder at all that Peter said in 1 Peter 18 and 19, knowing, listen folks, that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold. You weren't bought out of the marketplace because he threw out a little bit of cash. You were redeemed with the precious blood of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ. And then I also begin to understand why in Revelation 5, 9, The angels are singing a song and it's called a new song. They sang a new song and that song is the song of the redeemed, the song of those set free. You know the angels only sing when there's redemption? That's the only time you hear the angels sing. Even when the birth of Christ, the angels didn't sing. They sing in redemption and they sing a glorious song. And it's one that I wonder if we can even perceive it in its most minute details, how glorious and magnificent it is. Worthy art thou to take the book and break its seals, for thou wast slain. And these angels saw what he did. Thou didst purchase, purchase for God with thy blood men. From every tribe, from every nation, from every tongue, thou didst purchase. And it's as if we can see the thousands and thousands of angelic hosts getting up off their angelic seats in praise and adoration to the one who is worthy as they sing. Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive glory and honor and power forever and ever. The song of the redeemed, I think of the song that we sing so often. I remember as a kid singing it without even thinking. Redeemed. Redeemed, bought out of the market. Redeemed how I love to proclaim it. Redeemed by the precious blood of the Lamb. Redeemed through His infinite mercy, his child, forever I am. The third verse goes on and says, I think, I come to church and we have a sermon and I think of my blessed Redeemer. I think of him all the day long. I sing and I can't be silent. His love is the theme of my song. We've been redeemed. We've been redeemed. So we see the Redeemer, the beloved one of God. We see the redeemed, the us, the we, and the you. We see the redemptive Christ. his blood his precious blood worthy is the lamb that was slain and then we see the redemptive results and this is where it really gets exciting the redemptive result the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace which he lavished upon us forgiveness forgiveness according to the riches of his grace that's another little term I want to get you very quickly on you need to understand this it was according his forgiveness is according to the kind of tension according I'm going to say according to the riches of his grace it was according to the riches of his grace not out of the riches of his grace I want to illustrate that if we had a need in our church it was a financial need we had a project and it was really something the Lord was leading us to and we needed $20,000 and somebody knew this guy who was just a billionaire had all sorts of money he was a Christian and we thought maybe we could go to this guy and tell him about our need and see what he would do so we go to the guy with our need and we say hey the Lord is leading us to this thing we need 20,000 bucks blah blah blah blah I don't think we'd do this but this is an illustration okay maybe I shouldn't even use this as illustration we would never do this this is an illustration okay we'd go to him and he would say we'd tell him our need we'd say we want you to pray about and see what you can help us out with and he'd give us 20 bucks and I'd go hey thanks yeah good that would be good you know what he did he gave out of his wealth understand that then we'd go to another guy you'll understand it now when I give this part we'd go to another guy and he's a billionaire too and we'd tell him our need we need 20,000 dollars and we'd say we want you to pray about it He comes back and gives us $30,000 and says, I gave you $10,000 just in case you need some more. You know what he gave? He gave according to his wealth. He gave according to the measure of what he had. I want you to know, it's important to know, that the forgiveness that God has given us is not out of his mercy. It's not out of his love. It's not just taking a little bit and giving. It's giving it all. It's according to, according to the wealth that he has. That's how he forgives. It's complete. It's complete. the word forgiveness is the word athemi and it means to send away never to return Isaiah 44 verse 22 and 23 says I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloud I have sent them away your sins are like a heavy mist and they will never return to me they will never return to me for I have redeemed you shout for joy oh heavens for the Lord has done it. You know what's crazy? With all these promises, with all these assurances, with all this whole thing about redemption and forgiveness being complete, it's hard to conceive of Christians still walking around with a hanged dog look. You know that? We still do it though, don't we? We still, unless there's sin in your life, there's going to be, if there's sin in your life and you're just consistently walking in sin and rebuking the Lord and not caring at all about that, you're not going to be a very happy person. But I'm afraid there's an awful lot of believers who love the Lord totally, who have given themselves to Him. There is no specific thing going on. Yes, we have little struggles along the way. But there's some sort of perverse kind of approach to the Lord that I'm afraid too many Christians are involved in. And it's the kind of thing I've mentioned already before. It's this thing that if we feel a little bit lousy, if we feel a little bit guilty, that means we're a little bit more spiritual. And so we walk around just kind of feeling just a little bit bad about ourselves. We mope around. You know what? If that's your attitude, if that's your approach to the gift that God has given, and you kind of just are dwelling and wallowing in this vague sense of sin, you know, and letting it cause defeat, I got news for you. It is a bombshell, but you are in sin. You are in sin. You know what the sin is? That you don't believe that what God said about you is true. That's your sin. And that's why you're defeated. That's why you're always depressed. I've got to ask you a question. What's the truest thing about you? Is it what you feel about you or is it what God said? I dare say that most of us live on the level that the truest thing about me is what I feel about me. If I feel lousy, then that's how God feels about me. If I feel good, then everything's wonderful. Isn't it great? You know, we're called to live by faith, aren't we? Paul says, fight the fight of what? Becoming acceptable? No! Fight the fight of faith, believing that what God said about you is true. You're forgiven. You've been redeemed. You've been bought out. He has said that in him we are holy and blameless before him, accepted in the beloved one, inheriting the kingdom forgiven. The question I have is simply this, are you going to believe him or not? Are you going to believe him or are you going to mope? It's your decision. You know, I come to the conclusion that I can't and you can't and nobody else can make anybody else stop moping. I can't make anybody start living their lives by faith. If you want to mope, mope. Okay? Go ahead. You know what? You got a pastor who's just dumb enough to take these things we're talking about, about redemption, about forgiveness, about being accepted in the beloved one, and I'm just dumb enough to look at that and say, I believe it. I believe it. I believe that before God right now I stand holy and blameless and it's not because of anything wonderful thing I've ever done it's because of his precious blood his precious blood and you know what I'm just stupid enough to walk boldly in his presence and I'm just stupid enough to say Lord because of what you've done for me I think you're going to use me I know you're going to use me if I love you and I know you know I love you because I know about redemption, because I know about forgiveness, and yes, I can hear all my life, how you're forgiven, it's total. I've heard it a million times. It wasn't until I said, I believe it, I believe it, that it ever had any impact on my life when God's going to use me. He wouldn't promise he would. What gall. What gall do you think God's going to use? You think you are. How arrogant can you be? You know what? I think that's living by faith I think that's looking at my life and saying Johnson you're a jerk I know that I know I'm a bigger jerk than anybody here could possibly imagine it would probably it would probably really defeat some of you if you knew how big a jerk I was but I've been redeemed I've been brought out of the marketplace I've been forgiven you know what living by faith is? it's acting like what God said about me is true let's take let's get a little terminology change there it's a little different living by faith is simply acting like what God said about me is true I'm just going to act like it I'm just going to act like He's forgiven me I'm just going to be free I'm just going to love Him I'm just going to accept it I'm just going to act like what He said about me is true I'm just going to act like that see I'm forgiven you know when victory comes when I believe it you know I'm redeemed and you know when victory comes when I believe it I've been set free you know what I'm glad I'm glad oh we have so much as believers you know who lived like that kind of a different context because it wasn't dealing with sin so much but the one who lived like that simply in simple bold believing God little guy named David remember David remember David I love this story David and Goliath kids now you can start listening it's a story for you David and Goliath I just love that he pulled into that camp on his little Honda you know getting some McDonald's hamburgers for his friends and stuff and it was just a wonderful kind of situation he didn't know what was going on but all his brothers and all these these wonderful men of God you know wonderful armor great big muscles had prepared for battles like this all their lives going to seminary the whole bit you know they were prepared and what were they doing when the enemy was out there They were sitting in their cabins, in their tents, praying for the victory that God had already said was theirs. You know, that's a stupid thing, isn't it? That's a stupid thing to ask God to give you what he already gave you. That's what they were doing. Oh, Lord, help us. I don't know what to do. And little stupid David comes in there and says, What's the deal? What are you asking God for whatever he already said you have? You're sitting there cowering like crazy. Give me a slingshot. Give me a slingshot. I'm going to nail that turkey. what gall and I guarantee you that some of the men especially his older brother thought what a peanut who does he think he is how arrogant in the world can you get King Saul wanted to give him all the armor and all that stuff what gall how arrogant not at all not at all see he looked at the giants he looked at the giants you know what arrogance would have been arrogance would have been if he would have walked out on the field and looked at the giant and then gone like this. Hmm. Okay, I'll take him. And compared a giant to his own ability, his bicep, I don't know about out to here, he's out to there, but I'd give it a try. You know, I got the slingset too. That would have been arrogance. If he would have looked at the giant, compared the giant to himself and says, I can be. He didn't do that. If he would have looked at himself, he would have been cowering in the corner like everybody else. That's where he should have been. But you know what he did? What gall? What a fool. He looked at the giant. And then he looked at the promise of God concerning him. And you know what he did? Then he laughed. He said, you're dead. It's over. I won. He acted. He acted like what God said about him was true. And he went out there and he stuck them. Beloved, your sins have been sent away, never to return.
