I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, chapter 5, verses 1 and 2. Ephesians, chapter 5, verses 1 and 2. Therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children, and walk in love just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. I'm going to ask as I begin to pray that you would join in with me and pray silently, that you would pray for me as I bring to you some things that are very deep upon my heart. And pray for me too as I am feeling very, very weak of heart in dealing with these things. I need your support this morning. Would you pray as I pray? Lord Jesus, your word is alive. And I have been smitten by the things you are saying to us, to me, to our church, to the church. in these two little verses. And I pray, Father, that while my words may fail, that your Spirit will prevail, that your Spirit will teach, and that we will do more than know, that we will respond and do the things you've called us to do. I ask this in your name. Amen. I need to begin this morning by sharing with you a little bit of the things that I feel as I'm approaching this text for the second time. A pastor by the name of S.M. Lockridge, a great, big, huge, black pastor. I heard him speak at Founders Week at Bethel several years ago. He said that great preaching will do four things for you as you listen to it. And I don't want to get into his lingo at all, but it's hard to do it as I see him in my mind without getting his accent a little bit. It says it's going to stretch your mind. It's going to inform you. Another thing it's going to do is it's going to tan your hide. It's going to correct you. Good preaching is going to warm your heart. It'll inspire you. Good preaching is going to provoke your will. It's going to challenge you to act differently than you act right now. And that is a fact. And I concur with those things. That good preaching, when we look at the Word of God, it needs to stretch my mind. It needs to inform me. It needs to tan my height. It needs to warm my heart. And it needs to challenge what I'm doing now. The question I have as I consider that is, how do you do that? There have been times in the book of Ephesians where we have gotten stuck, and it's kind of gotten to be a joke around here that we spend three or four weeks on one word. And I want to just share with you a little bit this morning as I've gone through the same kind of dilemma this week in approaching this text that I do not believe that we accomplish those four things by opening a text and opening it up like we would a can of beans and just dumping the contents on people. This is what it says. This is what it means. Now you know. We're done. We're not done. You see, I believe that what I would have to add to this particular thing here that good preaching is is that basically, fundamentally, what teaching really is, What the prophets of old did when they said, Thus saith the Lord, was do more than just impart information and just open up a can and pour it out, the contents of which might have been right. But it was the sharing of a soul. It was the sharing of a heart. It was the sharing of a burden. And it was all in the power of the Spirit. But when we preach like that, and when I share with you every week from the pulpit my struggle, there are problems with that. The problems are this. I feel like I violate every rule I ever learned in seminary about how to write a sermon. One, two, threes, and a little save, surrender, and sanctify rhyming things and all that kind of stuff. And I also believe that I bring to this kind of attention. We don't always tie the ends up real nice and the things aren't always concluded and you don't always have answers and the crazy guy starts a sermon in the morning and finishes it in the evening. But you know what I want you to do this morning is enter in with me to the struggle of understanding what it really means to be an imitator of God. To what it really means to walk in love and what it means, not just so I know, but how that translates into what I do and how that translates into what we as a church ought to be doing and what we ought to be concerned about and where we ought to be going. And as I share with you that way. I trust that you will be informed, and I trust that you will be tanned, and I trust that you will be warmed, but I trust most of all that we will be provoked to change. I need to start with some background, just kind of reviewing where we've been with this particular text, and I'm not going to go back too very far, but just to this particular verse. The key word in understanding what it means to be an imitator of God is the word imitate, to be an imitator of God. The word there is mimiti, we went over this just a couple of weeks ago, it means basically to mimic. But again, as I expressed to you a few weeks ago, the problem with my understanding of mimic is that it is very, very external. I come up with pictures of someone like a minor bird. I would tell them a word and the bird would say it back. I come up with pictures of external characteristics. You see, I look at external characteristics and I try to copy those characteristics. I think of Rich Little trying to do John Wayne or some other person. He looks at external characteristics and he copies them. That is not at all what is being dealt with here when it says, therefore be imitators of God. This is an internal kind of quest. It is an internal kind of condition. Be imitators of God. It is not me looking at God or looking at little things I'm supposed to try to do and try to provoke those things up in me as much as it is simply this, God living in me. And as I give God, the creator God who's given me a new nature, as I give him access to my will, he begins to express his very nature out of me. And I begin to look a lot like him. The concept, as I was dealing with it a few weeks ago and trying to explain it and teach it, exploded for me and I trust for all of us as we saw this in conjunction with the way it's being said here, therefore be imitators of God. How? As beloved children. As beloved children. What a great designation it is to be called the child of God. And the reason this exhortation has any feasibility at all, the reason this exhortation is not totally futile to be an imitator of God is because of that basic relationship, that he is my father and I am his son. I am born of God. That would be a totally futile exhortation to give to one who is unregenerate. It would be a silly thing to say, be an imitator of God, to one who was not born of God. Absolutely futile. But I have received the adoption as a son. And because I am a son, God has sent forth the spirit of his son. Where? Outside here for me to look at and try to be like? No. He has sent him into my heart to live his life through me. As I give him access by an act of my will, he begins to live his life through me and I begin to look more and more like him therefore I am no longer without resources I am a son and if a son then an heir of God we literally are children of God we literally are born of God we literally are the offspring of God begotten by an incorruptible seed and as his child and this was the clincher for me as his child if in fact I have been begotten by an incorruptible seed, if I have been born of God, then as His Son, the most natural thing in the world for me to do would be to look like the one who bore me, would be to have the characteristics in me of the one who fathered me. Now we've been talking these last several weeks about the characteristics of things in our lives that are born of Satan and characteristics in our lives that are born of God. And every time there is something in our lives that is born of Satan, it makes us look like that's our Father. And every time there's characteristics in our lives of something that would look like it's born of God, it makes us look like that's our father. Talked about it on a very physical level. The fact that physically I look like my dad. Most natural thing in the world. I've got the same nose, same roll of fat on my waist, same kind of pudgy stuff, all that stuff, same. And it's natural because I'm born of him. The seed of his life is within me. Natural. But there's more to it than that. That is still something that's external. The guts of this is this, that the relationship I have with my physical father is one of love, and when I look at my relationship with my father, and I see the characteristics of his life, I want to be like him. And the characteristic of one who is born of God, if you love the Lord, if you love Jesus Christ, the heart cry of our attitude is this, I want to be like him. I want to walk like he walked. I want to talk like he talked. I want to give like he gave. I want to love like he loved. I want to minister like he ministered what does it mean to be an imitator of God? two weeks ago we discovered that the characteristic the bottom line in being an imitator of God is found in verse 2 to walk in love the characteristic of my life that most identifies me as being born of God as being his son is that I walk in love but let me go through the progression of this as I struggled with this therefore be imitators of God as beloved children okay you all set you want to go great what does that mean well it means simply this it means that you're going to walk in love great it means I'm going to feel warm and gooey and sentimental about everybody here and I'm going to feel guilty when I don't I'm going to try real hard to just feel and overlook all the things I don't like about you and all over just know we're supposed to speak the truth it is something far deeper than that well what does it mean well I have a pattern the plea first is walk in love I have a pattern that goes on like this I ask the question, what does it mean to walk in love? Well, it means this, just as Christ loved you. Oh, okay, that explains it, right? No, it doesn't. I'm still confused. I should by now say, yes, that's fine. You know, I've heard this ever since I was a little kid, walk in love just like Christ did, and we go, okay, I'll try. And we still don't grasp it. What does that mean? How was it that Christ loved me? It goes on and it says this. The bottom line and what it means. to be an imitator of God to walk in love to walk as Christ walked to love as he loved is this he gave himself he emptied himself he donated himself literally it's this Jesus broke himself Philippians 2 says this have this attitude in you which was also in Christ Jesus who although he existed in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but did what? He emptied Himself. He humbled Himself. He broke Himself. And what I want to just stress in this particular text is this and grab your hearts with, is that we look at texts like that and I look at things like this and I think, oh, God loved me and He gave Himself for me and He broke Himself for me. And we sing all these wonderful songs. We say, praise the Lord. I thank the Lord that He broke Himself for me and that He loved me and that He gave Himself for me. But what I want us to see in this particular text is what's happening here is the table is being turned and it's saying this. Yes, that's what he did. Yes, that's how he loved. Yes, that's how he gave. Now, you, believer, walk even as he walked. To be broken. To be broken. Be ye, therefore, imitators of God. Be ye, therefore, imitators of that kind of giving. be therefore imitators of that kind of loving be therefore imitators of that kind of ministry and that is the fragrance that is the thing that smelled so good to God then in verse 3 one of the things that happens here we're not going to go down into this we're going to spend some time in here next week but one of the things that happens in verse 3 is after he has described this magnanimous kind of love this magnanimous kind of self-giving in verse 3 he turns that around and says you know something just like in every other situation we've been talking about when God has a kind of love Satan is going to pervert it. We talked about that before. If there is a brand of truth that is born of God there will also be a brand of truth that is born of Satan. It will be deception. It will be lying. There's a brand of anger that is born of God. There's a kind of anger that is born of Satan. There's a kind of communication from the mouth that is born of God. There's a kind of communication from the mouth that is born of Satan. there's a kind of love there's a kind of self donation a kind of self giving that is born of God and there is also a kind of love that is born of Satan I heard not too long ago about a couple that had just gotten married and they were just about to get into this they got into this little horse drawn carriage and they were riding along and as they were riding along the horse bolted and he looked at the horse and he said that's one and they were going on a little bit further and it bolted again and he said that's two going on a little bit further and the horse bolted again he got out and he shot the horse in the head and the wife said what are you doing? that's one you see saying this kind of love doesn't leave a lot of room for error it doesn't leave a lot of room for you not doing it just the way I want what I want to get to here and my words again are going to fail me as I try to get to the depths of what this text is saying is that those are the obvious kinds of things. You see, I am not, I shouldn't say this, but I'm going to anyway, I am not nearly as concerned about the problems of fornication and immorality and filthy talk coming in and being the pervasive attitude of our church. You know what happens in our church when those things come? I get tugged on the sleeve and I get pulled aside and we have a meeting and we deal with it and we love that person back in and we discipline when we have to. But we're aware of those things. Those are the obvious perversions of God's love that we see. and I do not fear that perversion as being the kind of thing that can destroy our church what I fear are the subtle perversions of God's love what I fear are the subtle perversions of God's giving his breaking of himself that we don't even see among us and it's causing us to be stagnant and powerless in terms of our ministry because we're afraid to break ourselves we're afraid to be broken and anytime we're afraid to be broken when I am not being broken I am not walking as he walked when I'm not giving as he gave we can't be the body when I'm not loving as he loved I can't be the body and the ministry falters and we wonder why we're dead and we wonder why it's boring and we wonder why the impact isn't there you see I believe that Satan is masterful and has been masterful in the way he's been able to express himself to us through our world system in ways that we don't see. That is the tragedy. It's in ways that we don't see that we have moved away from the dynamic, radical nature of our gospel. It is not the obvious, the fornication. Again, we'd have a meeting. We'd deal with that. I believe that our society has infiltrated our churches. It has infiltrated our thinking. And even it has infiltrated, I believe, our ability to define sin itself. The result is that far too often our Christianity is no longer an imitation of the radical love, the radical giving, the radical life-changing power of our God, but rather a reflection of our culture, a reflection of their values, a reflection of their needs and their wants, and they've crept in. And the tragedy is not that they're here. that can be forgiven. The tragedy is that we don't see it. You see, fundamentally, I'm not here with the driving passion of my heart to be simply this, to walk as He walked. The driving passion of my heart and our church's heart is not to find out what it means to be a follower of Christ, to find out what it means to love like He loved and love that way, to find out what it means when He says He gave and then give that way, to find out what it means when he said he broke himself and then break myself that way and open myself up to God. Instead, we settle for religion and we settle for weakness and an insipid kind of powerlessness, a reflection not of our God, but rather of our culture. And the real tragedy, again, is that in so many ways, we don't see it. we don't see it it isn't like we're so sinful and just don't care about God and just don't care about anything that's important we do, we care we don't see it and sometimes we get into a situation in our going to church and our reading our Bible and our listening to KTIS and our listening to the sermons that we actually begin to believe that by coming to church and sitting in the pew and never touching anyone and serving on the committee and joining the church and singing the hymn and preaching the sermon and leading the song, that I really am doing what it's called for right here. That I really am following the criteria of what it means to be the body. That I really am, with all those little piddly things I'm doing, without a breaking of my spirit, without a giving of myself, that I really am walking as he walked. The real tragedy of Sodom and Gomorrah, get this, the real tragedy of Sodom and Gomorrah was not the level of sin that they fell to. The real tragedy of Sodom and Gomorrah was not the decadence of their sin. It was not the kind of thing they were doing. That was not what put them in a position of being irreversibly under the judgment of God. Because you know what? God could have forgiven anything they did. What put them in a position of irreversible judgment of God was simply this. They liked it that way. They liked it that way. They thought it was okay. They were content with what they had. the real tragedy of the Pharisees was not their hypocrisy hypocrisy is a sin hypocrisy is a sin but it was not the tragedy of their lives was not their pride in themselves the tragedy of the Pharisee was not their self-righteousness all of those things could have been forgiven the tragedy of the Pharisee was that they liked it that way the tragedy of the Pharisee was that they never saw their sin they never saw their need They never saw their separation from God. They liked it that way. They never saw their need to be broken. They never saw their need to be broken. If I were to ask you a question, it would be simply like this. I want you to, you don't have to close your eyes, but I do when I imagine. But to think of Jesus' ministry when he was walking on the earth. And my question would be this. Where was it that he was most effective? Where was Jesus' ministry most effective? Again, we understand that he came to break himself. He came to give himself. He came to meet people's needs. And where was that ministry most effective? And immediately, every one of us know. You know where I'm driving, especially when I'm talking about Pharisees. He came to the temple first, but when he went to the temple, everybody was satisfied. Everyone was content. We've got what we need. We've got the answers. We've got the formulas. What else do we need? You know what he did? He left the temple, and he went out to the people who were sinful, He went out and his most effective ministry was with the sick. His most effective ministry was with the outcast. It was with the alcoholic. It was with the drug addict. It was with the prostitute and it was with the pimp. Now let me ask you this. Why was that? Well, always I have thought, and as I would hear even people preach sermons on that kind of thing, why was it that Jesus was so effective with them? It was because he had a special love for those kind of people. And really the message is that, right? That what we should do is have more love for those kinds of people. I think that's missing the point I do not believe that that Jesus was effective with those kinds of people because he had some sort of special affinity for prostitutes and pimps you know why he was especially effective there because those were the people who were saying I am sick and I need a healer I am sinful and I need a forgiver I am bound up and I need a redeemer would you help me and that's where he went and that's where he went and he broke himself for a bull. Went to Speeby about a month and a half ago and I was sitting in the office of one of the administrators and we were just talking back and forth and I was there about five minutes and we began to talk about the life of the church and we began to talk about the movement of the spirit or the lack of it in the churches. And we were talking about Alliance churches and I want to share with you and I think you can hear my heart on this, but one of the things that was voiced by him as a real concern for our churches was this, that it seems that in these days so many of our churches are just going through the motions that where is the fire? Where is the power? Where is the breaking? And when I talk like that, I'm almost afraid like I sound like I'm picking on the church. I want you to know something. I love the church. And that is why there is no way in the world that we can let it die. I believe that if we are going to see the revival that so many people that I know in our church are praying for, that if we are going to see the revival of God moving among his people, if we are going to see a renewal of what it means to really walk as he walked, that one of the first things that's going to have to happen to me, And one of the first things that's going to have to happen to us as a congregation is that we are first going to have to see ourselves as the beggar by the side of the road, the sick who need a healer. But I'm afraid that too often, and I see this in my own heart, that where I really am is that I am far more like the Pharisee who's got all the answers, who's got all the solutions. And I just kind of come, and it's so easy just to kind of go along and maintain and keep it going and go with the flow and don't make any waves and just let it slide and never grow and never be stretched and never be broken never really give myself. Maybe what we need to do is see that we are the Pharisee that we are the smug that we are the self-righteous that we are so secure and we are so right and maybe what we need to do more than anything else is admit that we are the sick and that we are the hurting and that we are the ones who need the healer but like the frog who sits in the boiling water and is about to die and doesn't know it so too the church very often having been infiltrated by subtle kinds of perversions of God's self-breaking self-giving is boiling and doesn't know it the clearest way I can see the infiltration of a society into my way of thinking is by comparing my ministry and my giving and my caring about people with Christ. It's the clearest way I can do it. And again, this isn't real structured. You're going to have to grapple with me with these concepts. It's just by looking at his. And if there was a pattern to his ministry at all, it was simply this. It wasn't that he had a special thing for the sick. It was simply this, that whatever he had to do to minister is what he did. Wherever he had to go to minister is where he went. wherever he had to go to meet a need is what he did. That's where he went. It wasn't like he liked certain people more and thought he'd get better results there. He gave the truth wherever he went and whatever it took to meet a need, he did it. And if it meant he had to die, he would die. That's all well and good, and I've heard that before. What that translates into is this. And again, as I would transfer his ministry into our church, it would be this, that Jesus was not a maintainer of the status quo. I believe that Jesus' very presence in a room would demand change of you and me. I just believe his very nature demands change. And I don't think that that change will ever stop. I don't think we ever can stop growing. And if we do, what we're beginning to do is maintain the status quo. Just keep it the way it is. Just let it slide. Just let it go the way I am. And then the sixth thing is I like it that way. I don't believe that he was a respecter of persons. And by saying he wasn't a respecter of persons doesn't mean he didn't have respect for people. What that means is he wasn't trying to say things to certain people that would get him on their good side. I want to tell you something. If Jesus had any political savvy at all, he would have gone into the temple and coddled the Pharisees. He would have gone to the Pharisees and kind of tried to get in on their good side and said the things that he knew he would like and then later kind of introduced some of the things that were off-key and off-color a little bit. He would have coddled them. What he did with them is he told them the truth. His very nature goes against the grain of self-serving. His very nature countered the culture of his day. His very nature rejected the religion of his day that was wrapped up in ritual, that was wrapped up really in self-serving. They didn't think they were, but they were. And you know what? The result of his kind of living, the result of his kind of giving, the result of his kind of breaking, the result of his kind of ministry was twofold. One, people got healed. And two, he got broken. He got broken. Be ye therefore imitators of God. How? Walk in love. How? Like he did. How? He broke himself. The infiltration of our society into our way of thinking so that it's a perversion of God's giving is subtle. It is sophisticated. But I also believe that it is very real. Again, it is very hard to see, and that is the danger. And that is the reason I am talking about it both this morning and this evening. I'm going to give you three. I've got the time. I'm going to give you three of the things that I have seen and just perceive as being characteristics of the church that have come to us from a society that are very, very hard to see. But again, I want you to hear my heart. I want you to see, you know, when Paul was dealing with the Word and was dealing with inspiration of God, he spoke as if this was a command. There were other times when he backed off and said, I am not saying this is a command, but these are the things I see, and this is what I'm saying this morning. This is not as of a command. These are the things I see, and these are the things I fear in terms of being the perversion of what it means to walk as he walked. Our task as we go through this, this morning and this evening, is going to be to see if we can extricate ourselves, even in some small way, and maybe the only way for some of us this morning and this evening will be to begin to think about the ways in which we've been moved away from this real ministry, to extricate ourselves from that kind of thinking. The first thing I want you to see, and this is kind of in laying a foundation for what we're going to be talking about. The first thing I want us to consider is the fact that we live in a technological society. Now that is something that sounds really bizarre, and sounds like what in the world does that have to do with how we've been perverted? It has a lot to do with it, And it's also something that is very, very current. My grandmother's grandmother didn't have to deal with this in terms of her Christianity, but we do. We live in a society that is highly technological, and basically what that means is this. We live in a society that says what matters is what works, what matters is what produces, what matters is what produces quickly, and what matters is what produces quickly for the greatest number of people. No. No. There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing sinful about technology. There's nothing sinful about that kind of attitude, is there? No, I don't think there's anything sinful about that. The problem is this. What I want to introduce to you this morning is this, that even though that mentality, that though that condition in our society is not sinful, well, we need to understand that it is not neutral. It is not benign. It is not static. I believe it is all pervasive and it has infected our thinking in ways we don't even know. Hang with me. Let me give you one example. This is point one, if you're taking notes. I don't know how you're doing that, but here we go. One of the ways in which our society has infected our thinking is this, that in ways, again, that we don't even see, we have moved into a position where we are maintaining things more than we are meeting needs. We are more concerned with maintaining things because they're more important than meeting needs. Let me give you an example of that by just getting you to look at our building. Our building is a result of technology, right? There are years before they never had these kinds of things. They never had a beautiful edifice within which to carry out what Jesus carried out, okay? We have this beautiful thing. now there's no way in the world in which a building is sinful is it that's ridiculous that's crazy a building is pretty much benign no it isn't what we need to understand is that we are being affected in ways that we don't see i'll give you a hypothetical situation hypothetical situation is a situation that didn't happen here but yes it did okay let's just say this Mrs. Jones her grandfather died and he was a real man of God and he was into ministry and he was into giving and he was into breaking himself and he did it and he had a tremendous impact on people's lives and she came with some money to build a memorial room for Mr. Jones very fitting kind of thing so we take that money and we put carpet on the floors and we put little paint on the walls and a picture of Mr. Jones on the walls and it's really really nice everything's wonderful problem is somebody comes in and they use that room and they spill coffee. The older ladies come in and they spill coffee on the carpet. What are we going to do? Immediately, there's an emergency meeting of our building committee and they have a meeting and they decide, well, I'll tell you what, no more, they make a rule, no more refreshments in the Jones Memorial room. Okay, very nice. That's fine. A couple weeks later, the young people use the room. Dumb things. Don't ever let the young people use that room because what happens is, yeah, what happens is the rug gets snagged and a little thing on a wall gets broken, and something gets marked. So there's another emergency meeting of the building committee, and we decide that no one under 21 can use that room. Very fine. A couple weeks later, an outside church, a parachurch group comes in and wants to use the church, and they want to use that room. So we give them the room, something like Campus Crusade or something like that. We give them the room, and they break something, and oh, we have another emergency meeting of our building committee, and they say no more outside groups. Fine. You know what? I'm not saying that we should abuse our church. What I'm saying is this. You know what's happened without us even knowing it? The people on that committee, and again, this didn't happen here, things like it have. The problem is this, that the building committee, instead of sitting there and trying to figure out how it is that we should use this building to the glory of God, how it is that we should use it up and break it and give it to God and let it be used, basically our function is how not to use it, how to keep people out of it. and yes it even affects our message because our message whether we realize it or not is coming loud and clear it's this the carpet's on the walls and pictures the carpet the carpet on the floor and pictures on the wall is more important than meeting people's needs it's very subtle and it isn't because we're mean people it's because we don't see it you know what the problem isn't technology and the problem isn't our building and the problem isn't the john's memorial room the problem is that we're really struggling with what it means to imitate god the problem is that we're really struggling with what it means to break ourselves from ministry to do whatever it takes to minister to go wherever we got to go to meet people's needs, to give up whatever I've got to give up, to let be broken whatever needs to be broken in order that people can come to know who Jesus really is. And he was about the business of meeting people's needs and breaking himself. I wonder sometimes how he would react if he came to some of our quarterly meetings and some of our business meetings and heard the things we cared about and heard the way we protect and hold on to and just get fear in our eyes. And the problem isn't the building and it isn't that it's that we we're afraid to be broken we're afraid to be giving we're afraid to say I think if Jesus was the chairman of the board at our church what we'd be about the business of doing is trying to find out how we can use this with integrity 24 hours a day till everything is worn out we need to begin to open ourselves to ministry and whatever it takes to minister, we're going to do. And whatever it takes to give, we're going to do. Whatever it takes to care, we're going to do. Whatever it takes to be broken is what we're going to do. The problem is it's subtle. The problem is we don't see it. Another problem that comes in is a result of a society that is kind of dictating to us and we begin to imitate rather than imitate God, rather than imitate the ministry of Christ in the breaking of himself, we begin to imitate a culture that cares about those things. We begin to imitate a culture that cares about holding on. That's the perversion of God's love. The perversion of God's love is God's love is giving, Satan's love is taking, holding on to, protecting me and my interests. Narcissism, that's another thing we're going to be talking about tonight, has infected us and we don't see it. Another thing, another effect on the church that has come in very subtly, it's this. that when we allow ourselves to be perverted into thinking and into not understanding what it means to be broken before God, that the emphasis in our church is before we know it becomes to be technique rather than really building relationships. It becomes to be technique. Okay, let me explain this. One of the things we're going to be talking about next week in verses 3 through 6 is this concept of immorality, fornication, and how that is a perversion of God's love. Let's use that as an example this morning of how we deal with technique. Sexual relationships. Something that has been given to us by God as beautiful and rewarding and fulfilling and right and good and pure within the guidelines that he has given. But let me ask you a question. In the vernacular of the street, and I don't want you to get too earthy here, but what is the term that people use for a sexual relationship? You know what it is? It's this. You do it. You do it. Okay? And the question people ask when they do it is, how was it? And how was it and how did I do? And that kind of thing. It's all technique. No relationship. No caring. No giving. It's all taking. How was it? It's gotten down to a technique. And you find books in the bookstores that give you seven ways to do this and eight ways to do that and nine ways to do this and on and on and on. It's all technique. It's wonderful. And that's where we find our fulfillment. That's a perversion. We would never do that. That doesn't come into the church. The same mentality comes into the church. Before you know it, we're finding out how to have sex with our wives or whatever in a Christian way. And Christian technique, it's wonderful. One of the things that scares me is that the best-selling books, even in our Christian bookstores, are technique books. They really are. Eight ways to overcome depression. Six ways to have a happy marriage. Five ways to know God. And what we want is everything spelled out for me. There's nothing, oh my goodness, there's nothing wrong with finding biblical principles and applying them to my life. What's wrong is that I really begin to believe that. I really begin to believe that if I follow the formula, five little steps, that's where the fulfillment is. It's all technique. The tragedy is we don't see the danger of that. Maybe some of you are a senior. What's wrong with that? I like those things. I go to seminars all the time, finding out the seven ways to have fulfillment, the abundant life. You know, it's amazing to me. how much Jesus would have benefited by some of the seminars that we have on learning all the 12 ways to do this and that. You know, a little interjection here too. You know, the cycle in this kind of thinking is vicious. It really is. It goes like this. You know, I grew up in a church and I learned the formulas, but I don't learn them very well. So what I want to do is I want to go to seminary, and seminary is where the formulas and all the answers will get concreted in my mind. And I know that some of our young people who are going to school and college right now are thinking that. The reason I'm not ready for the ministry isn't because I haven't been broken before God. It's because I don't know all the answers. And seminary has all the answers. So that's where I'll go and then I'll come back and I'll give them all the answers. Wonderful. And they won't ask any questions because it's all real, rigid, and right here. Jesus would have loved it. He would have benefited greatly. I can't believe it how silly he was when he did his particular ministry and he was teaching. You know what he used to do? He used to go in front of people and say this, Matthew 5, blessed are the poor, blessed are the meek, blessed are the persecuted. And when he was all done, people would look at him and say, huh? Then he'd stop and say, well, it's like this. It's like a man who builds his house on a rock and another man who builds his house on a sand and the water comes and one stays and the other one gets blown away. And they'd go, what? And he'd say, see you guys, I'm going to bed. And he'd let him struggle with it and he'd let him fight with it. But we have five answers and five questions on and on and on. I want to read you something from A.W. Tozer so you don't think I'm the only radical around here. He was a lion. I want to read this and I want you to hear it. We now demand glamour and fast-flowing dramatic action. We are a generation of Christians who have been reared among push buttons and automatic machines and are impatient of slower and less direct methods of reaching our goals like having relationships and being broken and caring and fighting with concepts. we want other people to do our thinking for us we have been trying to apply machine age methods to our relationship with God we read our chapter we go to our seminar we have our short devotions we find our six rules we rush away hoping to make up for a deep inward bankruptcy by attending another gospel meeting or another seminar or listening to another thrilling story told by a religious adventurer lately returned from afar listen the tragic results of this spirit are all about us shallow lives, hollow religious philosophies, the preponderance of the element of fun in gospel meetings, the glorification of men, think on that one, trust in religious externalities, quasi-religious fellowships, salesmanship methods, the mistaking, listen to this, of a dynamic personality for the power of God. Does that hit you? It gets me. These are such as these are such as these are the symptoms of an evil disease, a perversion of what it means to be broken, a perversion of God's love, a deep and serious malady of the soul. One of the problems in our churches today, how many of you have got this idea of colleges, like when our kids go off to college, we don't understand, they were reared in the church, and they went to our Sunday school class, and we gave them all the answers and all that, And then they went off to that terrible school. They went off to the university. And there they got perverted. And there they got destroyed. And it's that evil university. Maybe the problem is that when they were in our churches, we thought that by giving them six little formulas and never teaching them to think and never teaching them about relationships, that when they went to a secular university where they were taught to think but given all the wrong formulas, given all the wrong answers, but they were liberated to think and they latch down to all the wrong philosophy. In subtle ways, technique becomes more important and takes the place because we're afraid. We're afraid. See, it can't be as simple as just breaking myself. We've got to have something else. It leads me right into the next concept. It's this, that without even knowing it, style becomes more important than substance. Style becomes more important than substance and we've brought this right from our culture. It works simply like this. The thing that matters most is how things look. The thing that matters most is how things look. I don't have time to give illustrations of this, but just let your mind flow a little bit and think about the ways we try to sell our Christianity. I think that we try to sell our Christianity just the way Madison Avenue tries to sell Jordache jeans. We just try to put a nice happy face on it and say, everything's going to be great. You're not going to have any problems. Everything's going to be wonderful. Come and join the bandwagon. It's just wonderful. and what we want is a church program that's got style and so we look for a pastor who looks like Joe Jock and we look for a we look for a youth pastor who's an All-American at Yale you know or someplace that's a liberal school we wouldn't want it from there but he'd be an All-American and he'd look really good and everything would be fun and it'd be exciting it'd be wonderful and always happening and oh all these things to go to and oh wonderful and good speakers would be good speakers because they're funny and good speakers would be good speakers because they make me feel yummy in my tummy, you know? And good speakers would be good speakers because I wouldn't fall asleep when they talk. And it wouldn't be about what is he saying? And it wouldn't be about I feel challenged and I need to think and I don't understand so I've got to fight with that. And it wouldn't be because they told the truth of God's word. And it's real subtle. A guy named Mike Iaconelli tells of a time that he went to a conference and spoke before or hundreds of young people. And when it was done, he got a standing ovation. They just loved him. And when he was leaving, his wife kind of nudged him on the side and says, you were really funny today. He says, yeah, well, I'll tell you. What can I say, you know? Pretty good. I was really funny. Then she went on and said something like, I can hear my wife saying to me on the way home from something like this. Problem is, you didn't say anything. What? I didn't say anything. What do you mean? I talked about Jesus. I gave him six principles. I told them verses and all this kind of thing, and they laughed. What do you mean I didn't say anything? As he began to think, he began to realize that he was right, that basically what he was there to do was to really kind of let them like him and try to promote a style, and oh, isn't this wonderful? And they laughed, and it was wonderful, and they even asked him back. And they went on to say that the real tragedy was not only that he didn't say anything, get this, the real tragedy was not only that he went to those kids and didn't say anything, the real tragedy was that they thought he did. And then they asked them back to come and say some more things that weren't nothing, that weren't anything. I don't know what I said. You know what's great about style? It sells well. You know what's great about style? It feels good. The thing that's nice about style is it never makes me think. The thing that's nice about style is it never makes me grow. It never makes me be confronted. It never makes me change. It never breaks me. I want you to think on this for a minute just as I close. If style is the priority, people will never be broken. Never. People will never understand what it means to walk as he walked and love as he loved and break as he broke. The reason is this. That if I'm into promoting a style and making you think that what Christianity is, then I can never let it down. I've always got to be. and I can never show you my pain and I can never show you my struggle and I can never show you my sin and I can never confess my sin. Oh, oh, are you kidding? Here in the church for us becomes the one place on earth where I could never tell you what's wrong. I could never share my heart. I could go to my unsaved neighbor and unburden myself, but because we're into style, but because we're into like that, I can be living here and some of you can be here in such agony and pain of heart and inconsistency in your lives but never say it and never deal with it and live with the lie and we're like the frog who sits in the boiling water going ha ha ha and the result is that we all go home sick tonight I'm going to finish that list a little but the bottom line is this before we go to any list of insights. The bottom line is this. I need to deal personally with verses 1 and 2 of chapter 5 of the book of Ephesians where it says to me, be an imitator of God, David, as a child of mine. And what that means is to walk in love. And your pattern for that is Christ because he loved you and what he did was he broke himself. Thank you.
