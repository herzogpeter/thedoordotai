Well, I am grateful that I'm here, and I'm thankful for the people that are here, and I pray that your spirit would be honest information, to the way to liberate some peace and maybe in the field, so it can enlighten us. We pray your truth, and we do believe that you're such a free, and we pray that your spirit would be here in a strong way. I am assuming you know what this class is, the role of women in ministry. This is set up in a number of ways, so you know what we're doing. This is not just kind of an intellectual exercise for me, for us. What I'm sharing with you is kind of the position of our church. What I want to do is more than just to be teaching, though, I want to kind of share with you the whole process of this thing. It was about six years ago, more than that, actually, probably about seven years ago, that there was a growing awareness among our elders, our leadership, that as people more and more in our church got set free for ministry, that gifted women, obviously, were emerging as it relates to significant roles of leadership. And when we were in places as leadership to consider spiritual gift to people for leadership situations, women were emerging. I mean, it was obvious that that was happening. When we began to consider eldership, and whenever we'd sit in that context when we were born, okay, we need elders. One of the things that had women's names would emerge because we were looking for gift to people, There's always an openness and excitement and affirmation. Women are ministering at significant levels in our church, but there was always this strong hesitation, and it felt like a biblical one. And that was the words of Scripture that seem to say to women, relative to ministry, as it relates specifically to leadership, not just ministry, but leadership kinds of issues and teaching kinds of issues, The scriptural word to women, it seems to be, from most of our backgrounds, maybe not yours, but ours, was null. Women can't leave. Women can't access the story. Women can't teach. What do you do with 1 Corinthians 14, where it says women can sound the church? What do you do with that? 1 Timothy 2, 9 to 15, we can just take it out of the Bible, But what Paul says to Timothy there is I do not allow women to teach or exercise authority. And then he even goes further. He seems to appeal to creation. After all, Adam was first and then he. Okay. And women are safe through bearing children. And that's kind of an interesting thing. And it doesn't seem to leave a lot of room. It can face value. So I guess that's that. But the frustration was still there. And it didn't click. There was something that we weren't satisfied with. It wasn't settling down. And it wasn't just because of what we wanted it to be. But it didn't seem those passages didn't even seem to coincide with other passages of Scripture that seemed to give a lot of freedom to women relative to ministry. And so we were kind of left in this place where, in fact, I remember where I was. and what we were doing at the elder meeting, when I was kind of commissioned to do this study. I'm kind of a person, Dave, you do this, so go do this around this. Another one of the interesting things that we were experiencing at the time was because, and this was not just at the time, this is more of a history thing that I've experienced for years in the church, and that is because women couldn't be in significant roles of leaders, so couldn't be elders, couldn't teach, was that often we found ourselves considering men that everybody in the room knew was less qualified spiritually than another woman, but we couldn't be a woman because they were a woman. It just felt weird, but we're going to do the facts on it. That's, sorry, that was kind of the thing we did. So Dave, let's get to the bottom of this. Let's, you know, the questions were kind of coming up from us, and rather than going, I don't know, decide, decide one way or the other and then make us understand, and if it's no, it's no, if it's yes, it's yes, and decide. Well, not by myself. The idea was I was going to do the work, come back to the elders, and we were going to kick around the exegesis and see if there was unanimity about that or not. Our heart and our commitment from the beginning was to explain the texts one way or another, to come to conclusions, to do the work. So what I'm going to share with you over the next couple of weeks is not only the result of our study, I want to share with you the study itself and indeed the process that we went through. In fact, you're going to find out in a few minutes. This is probably the most comprehensive thing I've done. It's probably the most comprehensive place you could go in our church, at least that I know of right now, to find out not just about women in ministry, but how to study the Bible. So you're going to get a little bonus, this whole thing about how to do exegesis. We're going to talk about that. I'm going to let you into the craft a little bit more than you might get somewhere else. Three passages are primary that we focused on. These are not the only ones that you can look at as it relates to the situation within the ministry, but I think there are three of those thickest. First is, 1 Timothy is 14, 34, 35. We'll get on that one today. The second is 1 Timothy 2, 9 to 15. That's the one I don't allow women to use, exercise authority. And then part of 1 Corinthians 11. Okay, I want to begin with 1 Corinthians 14. Open your Bibles. 1 Corinthians 14, verse 34 and 35. This is going to start plowing through this thing. 1 Corinthians 14, 34. Read it this way. Let women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak, but let them subject themselves, just as the law also says. And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home for it is improper for a woman to speak. In church, there you have it. Okay, now one of the things that's interesting, long before I ever went to this verse to study it, I had gone to 1 Corinthians, and I was going through 1 Corinthians verse by verse, the way I go through things verse by verse. I remember the very first time I saw this, it was very weird to me, because of where it was. It was like, my first question was, and is, as we get into this, why is he saying this here? Do you know what First Winding of the 14th is about? It's about prophecy, it's about tongues, he's been talking about the gifts of the Spirit in chapter 12, he was tempering it all with love in chapter 13. But in chapter 14, he's talking about prophecy in tongues, and specifically, the whole theme of chapter 14 is about how in the church in Corinth, prophecy had taken a place of elevation. And they had become chaotic in their expression of prophecy. And tongues had become chaotic in its expression. And he was reigning all that in. Well, this is weird. Honestly, I mean, I don't have time to read the whole chapter. But if you read it all in context, it sounds weird that all of a sudden, seemingly out of the blue, he mails the women. He's talking about prophecy that's out of control, tongues that are out of control. And then he says women keep silent in the church. What is that about? Well, there are some explanations to that. Some of them I think are interesting. Some of them I don't agree with at all. I'll give you some of them. This is how you do it in a school. I mean, we'll just give you the answer I like. We'll give you a number of answers. One theory is that he didn't write this. Okay? There's an author by the name of Koenig. K-O-E-N-I-G. That what these two persons are, what they are is a Pauline fragment. This is something that Paul did not write. It's totally out of context. It's added later by an editor. That's a theory around this. He wanted to check the rising feminist movement in Asia Minor. I don't buy that. That's a theory. I don't buy that one. Another one that I don't buy, but it's a theory. It's actually a smorgasbord. Anyway, Paul had a serious problem with women. Paul had a problem with women. You see the fact that you don't know this, but Paul had a very down-the-haring brother. He had a wimpy father. He had a knee-jerk reaction. And every once in a while, he would come out, and it's like, wait, I picture it, it's like Rain Man. He would say this thing, women, be quiet, women, be quiet. And he would just say, women, shut up. You know, he would just do this weird thing. And whenever he comes, you know, in every other area of life, you can trust Paul, but when it comes to women, and by the way, I have heard that. I'm kind of poking fun at that, but if you go to seminary and you kind of deal with all the theories, one of the things you'll get exposed to is that one of the theories is that in every area, Paul's trustworthy, but when the women's there, you can't trust them, so they decide to pull all the false stuff out, which doesn't feel good to me. I'm not willing to do that. There's another possibility that's going to take some work, and the other possibility is that maybe there's something we don't know. Maybe we don't have all the information. Maybe there's some things going on in Corinth and also in Ephesus. Ephesus is the context for 1 Timothy that would help us understand and explain not only what is being said, but why it's being said. I'll stop right there. I've been open to us a long time ago, the priest in your week, da-da-da-da. Just to know what the verse says is not enough. To get into understanding what the verse means, you need to understand why the verse was said the way it was said in the context. The why is just as important as the what. So I want to know not just what he's saying here. It's real clear what he's saying. I want to know why he's saying it. What's behind this? What is driving this? And while we get a picture of whatever that is, We might have a better idea of what he's saying. It might still be when we've been quiet in church. But I don't think we know that yet. Well, here's the question. How do you get to the why? Now I want to start talking to you about principles of solid biblical interpretation. Tonight, before we get to any of the textual work that we need to do, principles of solid interpretation. I don't throw this word around a lot, but you probably hear from time to time, maybe from me or somebody else, the word exorcist. Is it something you've heard anyway? Exegesis. It's a compound word. Exe is the prefix, and it means to exit. And the meaning of it is to exit something out of. Exegesis is an entirely different prefix. Ice, E-I-S, if you're doing that in English. In the Greek, it's into. Exegesis is going to the text and exiting from the text with as little of my collusion on it, my preconceived ideas on it. reading into it, letting the text talk and pulling from the text what it means. Isotesis is, I think, a very dangerous thing, and at best it ends up in shallow kinds of teaching. And isotesis happens like this, sometimes not with bad intent. But I get an idea that I want to tell people about, and I go find 12 verses to support my idea. I have no idea of those verses, and I read into those verses my already predetermined idea. You get it? It's shallow teaching at best. It changes it works. is when I read into a text, I see Jesus is getting out of the text. And people ask me, when I preach for something, what is it you care most about? And I care about many things. But personally, when I walk away from what I think is a sacred vest, even though it's a plastic vest, I think that thing is a sacred thing, not the cultural self, but what we do. One of the things I care a lot about is if I was faithful to the text. If I said what the text said. It matters a lot. well how do you get to that well there's four principles I want to share of exegesis so that we can as best we can and please know we're all affected and so we don't always do this perfectly and we all read something in there but as best we can to do exegesis four principles first is grammatical integrity now this is the stage that involves what is being said at this level of dealing with grammar and language and syntax. This is where original languages are called. Going Greek, going Hebrew. Now some of you are thinking, well, I'm left in the desk right now. I don't know Greek or Hebrew. The fact is, I don't think you need to know Greek or Hebrew to do this piece. There are Bible dictionaries. You can get them at just about any Christian bookstore. One that I would recommend is one called Colin Brown. It's a great big thick book. In just about any word that is compelling to you, you'll be able to find a real solid etymology of that word. That is the history of the word, where it comes from, uses of it in classical Greek, New Testament uses, things like that. And a biblical dictionary can be very helpful. Let me give you some examples of things you've heard that were examples of just simply grammatical integrity. And there are examples of times that when we dealt with the original language a little bit, it kind of cracked open the whole text in some exciting ways. One is part of our history. One, this is part of our history. This is an example of a word that opened up the whole text. Blessed are the broken. That is why this is a critical situation to our church. You know, we've got no video on it. The second one is blessed are those who mourn. And I remember approaching that week going, blessed are the bum, blessed are those who walk around the Mopee. I wonder, what on earth is blessed or happy about mourning? And then I found the Greek, well, I did the work in the Greek. The Greek word is tenphas. If it was a little bit more work, I found out without a lot of work that there were nine Greek herbs for the concept of mourning. And, you know, one of the jokes I've made is that I grew up in church. My dad used to get into grief a little bit. He told us, I remember the time he told us there was three Greek words to love. And I was thrilled. Wow, that's so rich indeed. And then I went to seminary, I found out there was three Greek words for everything. There are nine Greek words for the concept of mourning. And so whatever this particular word was, I wanted to know what that meant. Because there were different ways to mourn. What is it that the Spirit of God meant here? And the Greek word penthouse, you might remember, meant to externally express what's internally going on. So if you're walking around with all sorts of issues and all sorts of pain, and you're very, very sad, but you're not getting it out here, you have not mourned. Lesson are those who start telling the truth about your pain, start telling the truth about your sin, start telling the truth about the issues that they try to hide from everybody. They alone are going to get comforted. Now, I don't know if you've ever heard the teaching, but some of you have some of you haven't. Even if you haven't with what I just gave you, you can just imagine there's all sorts of liberty and health and it all came in studying the word. Let me give you one more, a little more current. Two weeks ago, we were in James chapter 1, and the words I read were these. For anyone who is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, is like a natural man. This man who looks in his natural face in the mirror, once he's looked away and gone away, has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was, but one who looks intently at the perfect law. There was a word there that opened up a real definite meaning for me. It gave me a way to say something I was having a hard time saying. The word was looks. Do you remember what they were? In verses 23 and 24, the word looks was a Greek word that meant what? Do you remember? To glance. Now, the second one was games. The first one was to glance. The second one was an entirely different word, and that affected me because I didn't know English. It was just looks. I wouldn't notice it without the original. And the other person was to gaze. And that word opened up the text. It was just one of the points. And you'll remember that one of the final points I gave about the reason we forget what we see in the mirror, about what God tells us about who we are, what we're supposed to wear, is because we glance at the truth that's revealed in the word, and we gaze at the truth that's revealed in the world. That whole paradigm came out of Greek work. So I'm just giving examples of how I think on a fairly routine basis, you hear that stuff and maybe don't know. Well, that's the piece that Paul is doing. Paul is doing. By the way, we're going to use some of that still, and that's that word when we look at 1 Timothy 2.12. It's not so much a meaning of a Greek word, but we're going to give it some syntax, because one of the things that's interesting about Paul when he says, I do not allow women to teach, he said it's in a present active indicative form, which renders that phrase this way, I am not now presently permitting women to teach their exercise to the Lord. I am not present indicative active, renders that I am not now presently permitting women to do a religious race question. I'm not drawing any conclusions yet. I don't know, we're just getting into this thing. I'm setting things up here. The second principle that you need to know for good biblical interpretation as a Jesus is historic integrity. Understanding the historic and cultural realities that surround an apostolic letter or anything, the gospel, help explain why certain things are being taught or distorted. Failing to work in the historic area results in wrong and inaccurate application. It would be a place that isn't earth-shaking. An example of working in the history area, and it would come right out of chapter 14 and chapter 12, which would be the larger context of where this woman, the silent, comes from. If any of you were in Foundations class, one of the components of that class is that series of human beings is spirit. And one of the things I do is I get into the history of the Korean people and what part of their history was revealed. Before they were redeemed, they were part of the mystery of religion. One of the dynamics of mystery religions was that ecstasy equals spirituality. So one of the ways they proved that they had connected with one of these gods or goddesses that they believed filled the universe was that they kicked out of their consciousness into a divine frenzy. And one of the things that helped them kick into their divine frenzy, as in Plato, actually called it, was drunkenness and sexuality. And I never understood how on earth the Corinthians could get drunk in communion. Remember that? Remember that? They were really nuts. Except now I get it. It wasn't that much of a stretch for them at all because that was exactly what they did. I just gave you an example of how a historic piece goes. In that case, it doesn't change your life. It just makes you go, oh, I'm sorry. But it's worth, it's worth, it's worth doing. helps to understand why certain things are being said. The third principle that you need to apply in any way to do this work is contextual integrity. This one's extremely important. And I have a pet peeve. It's like I think you can take verses and use them to affirm a point you're making, a biblical point you're making, but I always, in my own state myself, and when I hear it from somebody else, I always have this, I don't know, I'd like to know what that verse means, if it really means that. I'd just like to read everything around that. If that's what the author meant to say, it's really important. It's incredible how you can take scripture to support what you already said. Just pull all these verses out of context. One of the things that they hammered into us in seminary was this basic hermeneutic, and this is worth writing down. Any text, or any verse, any text without a context is a pretext. Any text without a context is a pretext. And I have some illustrations here, but I have seen how over a few years the Spirit of God, through our commitment to going through the Word together has kind of kept us straight by keeping with context. I'm not going to go into this deeply, but if you were with us, when we went through some paradigm shifts at church around the midst of the Spirit, I remember going through 1 Corinthians and coming to 1 Corinthians 12, and I remember just dealing with it in the context, and looking at the verses as they just flowed out. What I remember was realizing that part of my background that taught me to be incredibly knowledgeable about faithful to the text, and taught me that between such and such at first, and I'm not going to go look it up now, in verse 12 there was this line, and gift of knowledge, gift of wisdom, gift of this, those were okay, but right after that, there's a line in the text, and it says, gift of miracles, gift of healing, gift of punishment, those are for today. And I believe there was like this line in the text, and then when I dealt with it in context, and I just let the text talk, I told him to find the line. I told him to find the line. I'm going to go. Anyway, we've used other things of things taken out of context. Here's one that's harmless. Here's one that's harmless, but it's an example. In Matthew 18, verse 20, Jesus says, Where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am in the midst. I think that's true. But be a critical thinker on that first. Why does it take two? Well, why does it take three? Where one is, there I am. He said me. I just hate me. So, I mean, I never thought of it that critical. I used to use the first. This is not a bad thing. Don't go, I'll never get that first for that again. No, use it for this. I'm going to. But like when nobody would show up for a prayer meeting, I would go, that's okay. Good works, and we're together. There I am. And that was true. It's just not what the first meant. If you get the context, it means something very powerful, and you can still hold to or to a true gathering. There I am. This is not what the first meant. He's dealing with discipline there. He's dealing with one of the hardest things there is to do in the church. And that is when you see a brother or sister begin to wander off to go get them. And we don't want to get involved, and we don't want to have a problem, and we don't want to have them yell at us as to this. They don't want us out of their face. But Jesus says, what I want you to do is I want you to go after them. And if you don't get there, you have to do it. First of all, I want you to go. And as they respond, and they come back, the whole point of Matthew 18, Everybody calls Matthew 18 the discipline. Are you doing a Matthew 18 discipline in flight? Are you kicking him out of the church? Matthew 18 is not a kick him out of the church. That passage in Matthew 18 is the book to get him to bring him back. So you go, and then if they don't respond, then you get two or three more to go. And if they don't respond, then you get the whole church. Everybody knows him and loves him. Go talk to him and try to bring him back. And then the passage says, and if they don't hear him back, then you let them go. You don't ever kick him out. Not in 1 Corinthians 5, you kick him out. I've been looking for a kick out first. First thing, it's five to kick them out because they're 11. But in Matthew 18, you accept your decision. I don't want anything to do with you. I don't want anything to do with God. I'm going this way. Breaks your heart. You let them go. But the two or three are gathered in my name. Is Jesus saying to the two or three who go after your brother or sister, have you ever done it? Have you ever knocked on the door when you're going there to say, you know what, we know you're interested in one of the men. You've done it? Well, if you have, let me tell you how your heart is going. Boom, boom, boom. You'll never be more scared. You'll never be more eager to hear a reason why you can't do that. And right after that, Jesus says, this is so desperately important to me, church. I want to confirm in your heart that I am never more with you than the doors we are gathered in my name, specifically to do this. I just want to read before you do that. I am never more with you. Now, I don't know if that really is the call of the same thing. Now, it doesn't take away at all. It's true. It's going to be so such a great thing you guys said. But now I have a whole different spin on that verse, and that's what it meant. How do you get that from the context? Oh, God, I'll give you another one. I can do all things through Christ's strength. How many of you have heard that? Have you ever heard that once from the high-powered evangelists? You're going to have to prove that anything you want, anything you neighbor claim, you can get it. I didn't know. I can do. It doesn't say I might do. It doesn't say I maybe will someday do. It says I can do. I can do that, couldn't I? Yeah. Yeah. I can do all things. Christ is strengthens me, and then it comes to this big promise. Anything you want, you can have and believe God, and yada, yada, yada. Well, everybody's pumped up. Read the context. Big context. A lot of pretext. Context is a pretext. And see what's interesting to me. I find incredible. I back off all that hype stuff. But I find incredible how peace has to relate to how my life really looks. because what Paul says just before that he says I've heard how I know how to be rich and I know how to be poor I've experienced fullness and I've experienced emptiness I've experienced plenty and I've experienced faith and so have you and then he says I can do all this I can do I'm doing great today and I can do I just got a raise and I can do I got fired today and my wife just died and I can do I could even do that but I can do life. Remember that? In fact, that's what I called it. I just remember that's what I called it. I can do life to Christ's strength. How do you get that? How do you get that understanding? It's not that hard. Just let the text talk and don't come to it with your frequency stuff to try to perpetrate your already developed idea. That's why, by the By the way, doing all these, for us to say, is a discipline. It's a discipline. It's important. And I'll tell you, I think you can tell when you take it seriously. I want you to take it seriously. And part of the reason you take it seriously is if you really believe that the word of God here has power to help you. It really does have power to the same people. Let it tell you to come. And just let it be there. It really woke you up. Principle number four, know the difference. Discern the difference. And this gets worked sometimes. But know the difference between a timeless truth and a regulation for certain people at a certain time. I want you to write that down and we're going to answer them on that one. The reason I want to sit on this one for a little bit is as soon as I say that, and maybe it should, some of your antennas are going, oh, here we go, here we go, now we're going to start playing around. That's a regulation that shows in the media part. Well, first of all, I just want to present the fact that there are, and we would probably all agree, that there are some things that are not timeless truths in the Bible. I'll give you some examples. First of all, I'll start with the timeless truth. In him we have redemption through this blood of forgiveness of sin. Timeless truth are a regulation for people at a certain time. Timeless truth. Safe by faith through grace. Timeless truth or timeless truth. It doesn't ever, forgiveness comes through Christ. Timeless truth. What about this one? Acts 15, 8-11. And God who knows the heart bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did also us. And he may notice things between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. Now, therefore, I'll lay it down to you. First, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in the same way as they are also. We believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. timeless truth, or regulations for certain people at a certain time, for certain reasons. Timeless truth. Same chapter, just a little later, James gives this instruction to the Antioch church to do some things in deference to the true self-church. And he says, yes, therefore, it's my judgment that we no longer trouble those who are turning to God, who are from among the Gentiles, but write them to abstain from things contaminated by idols. Timeless truth, or regulations for certain people at a certain time. Regulation for some people at some point. And it's not an issue for us. Now, there is, by the way, there will be a timeless truth that drives that regulation. We'll get into that again. But sacrificing meat to idols is not a timeless truth. Maybe that's not a issue for us. And from fornication. Timeless truth, regulation for just a little while. Timeless truth, thank you so much. Phew. I have to have a whole other lesson here. Okay. And from what a strangle from what? Okay, obviously, that's a regulation for certain people. The one I want to give you this, that's kind of interesting, and absolutely, from which point, but it's also, I can be funny. And I'm going off and passing by the two weeks. But in Deuteronomy chapter 23, verse 12, God is speaking to his people, and he's talking to them about a number of things they need to do in order, quite frankly, for them to live as a community. And it gets on to real practical things about what they need and what they wear and the other than it are. And then it says, as it goes along, one of the things it says is this. And you shall also have a place outside the camp and go out there. And you shall have a spade among your tours and it shall be that when you sit down outside. I'm a junior high. I still got this junior high thing going on. And you shall have a spade among your tours and it shall be that when you sit down outside, you shall dig within and shall turn to cover up your excursion. Now, that's not that funny. The next thing is what's funny. What's funny is to get these guys through the hole and cover up their excrement. Here's why. Since the Lord your God walks into the midst of the camp, I think that's hysterical. Anyway. Okay, okay, now with all that stuff, we've got four principles there. Give you some examples of how they look and how they're valuable and how we've been enriched by history and context and the languages. Now to get all that in our minds, still in the Trinity Testament, we don't have it all. I'll get back to 1 Corinthians 14. Let's ask ourselves a question. Is this, let's start with the last principle, is this a timeless truth? When Paul says, like, let me keep sound in the churches who are not prepared to speak. Is that a universal principle? Let's say this. Let's just, okay, no, no, no. Say this. Say this. Let's walk down that path, okay? Do that. Do that thing. If we decide that it is, there's going to be some things that will resolve. Okay, well, that's busy. There will also be some problems. Let's talk about the problems. If we decide that the time is true, some of the problems are, first of all, scriptural. So if you take the notes, just say that if this is time is true, problem number one is scriptural. What are you talking about? Well, there are other places in scripture where women obviously speak. I'll give you one, and this is kind of interesting. You don't get it for you if you care about context, because sometimes the context that you're concerned with are the first few verses around the first, but then you have a broader context, chapters, then you have a broader context, the whole book, then you have a broader context, the whole Bible. So it's interesting that in the very same book, in 1 Corinthians 11, same book, Paul says something about some words around women who are prophesying. He's giving some instructions, telling them they needed to wear a head covering, and you need to have your head covering. And we'll get into that later when we do 1 Corinthians 11. But what's interesting, he's giving them instructions about what they're supposed to do while they're praying and prophesying. And now this is where it's hard, because usually when I come to this passage, and I talk about women prophesying or speaking, or they can speak, and then I deal with chapter 11, that they were prophesying, I've got the body of truth that I already dealt with earlier in chapter 14 about prophecy. And the whole dynamic that Paul is appealing to in chapter 14 about prophecy is that prophecy is what you do specifically when you have your come-together congregation. And he's confronting tongues as being that which you need to do when you're by yourself. Now, I'm not saying you can't ever speak in tongues in a large group, But, remember what he says in 1st, I would rather hear five words that I can understand that 10,000 will come. When you come together, he says in chapter 14, what really is the high value is that we prophesy. Prophecy being the proclamation of truth. Well, now I'm confused. Are you confused now? Because now it's saying, wouldn't it be silent? But in chapter 11, it assumed that women would prophesy. Earlier in chapter 14, the place to prophesy is in the church. So we've got some spiritual problems. I'm not saying they're resolvable, but you have to look at the whole picture. It's inside women are silent. We've got women in this very book. I'm talking about Corinthians, the word prophesying, and where you do that is in the church. What do you do with Philip? What do you mean? Well, in Acts chapter 21, verse 9, it indicates that Philip had four daughters who had prophecy gifts. First Corinthians 14, it's weird because I'm just noticing that most of the time I teach this, I've already done all of chapter 14 and verse 18, so I can appeal to what you already know about first Corinthians 14 and that prophecy is done out loud in the church. Well, Philip had four daughters who had prophecy, that's what they were called. How do they do prophecy and be quiet at the same time? That's just weird. Phoebe is another scriptural problem. In Romans 16, it's called the deacon. Priscilla is set in Acts 18, 24 through 28. Taught at Paulus. That's weird. Interesting. I mean, it doesn't mean you can't work it through, but you've got a problem. You don't even have to resolve that. Anna, in Luke chapter 2, was called the prophetess who spoke of Jesus in the temple to all who were looking for redemption. And it sends it in Philippians 4, it says of them, that they may be side by side with me in the gospel. So you might have a lot of explanations for those things, but it's going to happen together. We've got to ask them together. So one problem you've got, this is a timeless truth of some scriptural ones. Now, I just raised them. I didn't solve them one way or the other. I just said you got to jump. Another problem that we're going to have is women are to be silent in the church. It's a practical one. Who's going to shut them up? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, now here's the practical problem of how my movie is. What about us? What about us? As a church, this is the practical problem. What about us? How silent are women supposed to be if we're going to land there? How silent are they supposed to be? Can they do announcements? Can they be in the pulpit? If they're supposed to be silent, can they lead worship? Can they be on the worship team? Can they sing solo? How silent? This is one of the weird things to me about the people who hold that this is silent, is they're not really silent. That's like nobody defines what that means, and they preach. I don't know if he grew up in a church like I did, but I grew up where women, when they preached, they didn't preach. They shared. He grew up in the same church. Women don't preach, they share. That's how that works. It's interesting, when I got into this study, what I discovered about our own denomination, There's some research that I did, and the work I did was decent because I just discovered somebody else's research. And I am, in this part, very indebted to a woman named Dr. Marilyn Weldon, who was for years out at Crown College, and Dr. Wendon Price, who's since he did this research going home to do some work. But he did some interesting, some historic work around our own denomination. Now, I'm aware, all of a sudden, that some of you don't know what our denomination is. If you even know, we were a denomination of church. Our church is part of the Christian and missionary alliance. And we announce that every week. But we're delighted with that. But let me tell you some of our past around that is in the ministry. First of all, the alliance is a little over 100 years old. So that's the history on it. And the first stage of the movement 100 years ago, when H.B. Simpson, who was the founder of the alliance, was alive, women were involved at every level in the ministry. I mean, when I heard that, it was a shock. Because they aren't anymore. They were pastors. They were evangelists. Yes, they were pastors. They were evangelists 100 years ago, teachers. They were officers. They were on the board of managers. It's interesting to discover that of the first eight vice presidents, four of them were women. More than okay, Simpson encouraged and called on women to serve at significant levels. Here's a thing I want to read to you. That's a document from the early days. This is actually Dr. Weldon's working on this. Women had a very important part in the early days of Christian and missionary lines. This fact is reported in the written history of the CNMA as well as its official documents and written portion publications. After 50 Years, which was a magazine called After 50 Years, describes this in the suspension right now. The Apostle Paul, in recording the ministries of the early church, did not fail to make mention of the work of godly women. Especially in the early days of the Alliance, there was a host of spirit-filled women who labored as evangelists and Bible teachers with great effectiveness, and then he goes on to list their names. Dr. A.B. Simpson, the founder of the CNMA, attracted both capable men and women as the fellowship of the deeper life and the cause of foreign missions. Not only did he accept women in fellowship for ministry, he encouraged them. This attitude is seen in one of the statements that appeared in the first illustrated missionary magazine of North America, which he started publishing in 1880. He writes this, The Lord himself gave the word. Great was the company of them that published it. The Hebrew in this place is feminine. And the true translation is, Great was the company of women that published it. By the way, it's interesting to me. This is a hundred years ago. This is a great and growing missionary work for badly women. They're doing nobly at home and raising means. But God wants more of them abroad. Oh, what thousands of homeless lives would be elevated, blessed, and ennobled by such a concentration. May the Lord himself give the word to many a listening ear. Is there no woman who reads these lines and whose heart the half-suppressed whisper is? No. Are you willing to listen to it with an open ear and willing feet? Are you willing to go, or are you half afraid that if you did and thus hearken, you could no longer stay? Then, down later, he says, Someone will express the attitude of women to missions in a religious assembly when referring to the fact that men helped the missionary cause by their wills after they were dead. And women helped the missionary cause with a will while they were living. And added, we are greatly indebted to dented men and light women. Anyway. That was A.B. Simpson who wrote that. And I've not had people mentioning lines for me. Thank you. In the 20s, 30s, and 40s, I'm back now to the Alliance. There was a decline in prominence of women in decision-making positions, but still women were pastors, evangelists, teachers, and especially women in Michigan. That was still, in fact, one of the weird things in the denomination right now, is where the tension was, but in the States, there's a real mode of women in ministry, but I'm guessing she'll be doing it all the time. Some missionaries come back, and we have our council every year, and the women are going, huh? It's pretty interesting to watch. The present to present, pastors, evangelists, women, have officially disappeared. But women still defuncting. We can't call them evangelists. And when I preach, I have my spiritual history. This whole thing of, I'll give you my theory and then I'll give you my history. I have a theory that kind of comes out of this. All my life, what I heard and what I believed was that this, that the inclusion of women in significant ministry roles was a sinless, a sinful, spineless accommodation to the culture that was being overrun by feminism. Have any of you ever felt that? Like if you're in a liberal church, you're letting women in. My theory now is that the slow and systematic elimination of women in ministry, I have thought is that we were starting to let them back in. Well, what has really happened is we have pushed them out. It's so systematic elimination of women in ministry is a sinful combination to a culture that isn't all that different than the male-dominated Jewish culture that Jesus came to do with. We'll talk about that and what that culture was in a minute. What I was going to say that's interesting to me is I was at council this last year, and one of the debates on the floor was women in ministry, and it never quite got to it. I'm excited about the Alliance, and there are many, many good things in the Alliance, and we're staying, and we're out of the way that. But there were some disheartening things as well. One of them was that some people were still arguing, not whether women could be a submission of the welfare ministry, but there was argument whether women could serve communion. And it was like, this is really, we're a little further along than this. It's frustrating. The full picture of it for me was I was at this conference all week long where that was the day when I got on the plane, And I went to the graduation of my daughter at a school. So I went right from there to Kansas City where my daughter was graduating. I don't know how many of you know, but her class takes her to preach at the graduation. I've never heard my daughter speak in public before. I love my daughter. I've seen her grow like crazy. And I saw God laying down her a few years ago. She began in Boston. And I looked at her in the pulpit and I just looked at her in the left. Because there are certain things you can't teach. And she had a presence in the pulpit. And she was funny. She was funny. I was nuts. And one of the things I told my wife, I was nuts. I was nuts. In fact, just a little side thing. As I looked at her, I thought of some of my family history. And what was interesting, I don't know if God gave me a word about this, but I got a good sight. And the spirit that was on my dad, I think is on me. But where did it go? The spirit that was on my dad came from his mom. I know that. This mom was an incredible Bible teacher. She had a lot of restrictions on that. She was an incredible Bible teacher. And that was on my dad, and that was on me. And now maybe I'm my daughter. Maybe I'm my son, Sue, and Michael. But anyway, it was an interesting thing. But it was weird to be in this combination where women can't do what she just did. And I'm going nuts. So anyway. By the way, one of the things we're going to have in two weeks is a panel of women who I didn't get to see. And one of them will be a woman who I've got a lot of respect for. She's in the Alliance. And I tell her, I'm back in the Alliance. I love her. She's very loyal. And she will kind of share what it feels like to be working at a denomination place where the rules are null, but they kind of say, you're right, you should be in the center of the eye. So we'll hear from you. Yeah, okay, let's get back to the text. And let's start doing a little bit more of this work around the, you know, let's start with the history piece. Let's just start with the history piece. What's going on historically? Not just in Corinth, but publicly. What's going on in the culture of this work? And specifically in the first century. In a word, the role of women when these words were written by Paul was subservient. Worse than subservient, they were, in fact, inferior women were. See, inferior second rate. A common prayer you might have heard by a rabbi would be this. I thank you, God, I'm not a Gentile. I thank you, God, I'm not an ignorant man. And I thank you, God, I'm not a woman. I would like to be a woman and hear that. Well, you just heard it. How does that feel? In a Jewish home, the birth of a baby boy would be mellish joy. The birth of a baby girl would be that. It was more than disappointing sometimes. And that ought to make you mad. There ought to be a lot of horror sighted. There ought also to make you think, you know what? It hasn't always, it doesn't always take. There's sometimes that still fear. Let me tell you a story. I'm not going to have you. When I was, when my wife and I first had a dress, She's my oldest daughter. I was born in seminary, and I was doing this assistant football course at Bucsett College. And we brought Drea. One of the ways I remember when we brought Drea home was that we brought her home with David D. Who cares? That's how I remember how we brought her home. Well, I had to go right from the hospital, and my wife, Bonnie, had to drop me off at the locker room to go do the game. And then she went on with the baby and my parents. And I was just so delighted. And I brought Moetrea out in my little bundle here to show all the guys. And one of the guys said, I'll never forget it. He was joking. He was everybody roared. Ha, ha, ha. He was saying something stupid. But I wondered later where it came from. And he was saying, was that a little girl? I said, yeah. And he said, what a waste. That's what he said. What a waste. Because they're all football players. You know? And so what does that tell you? It tells you it's a joke. If it's a joke, it's still there. It's still kind of there. And everybody laughs at me and says, it's really hard to confront, and I'm not going to do it. Well, I did. Worst thing to happen, if you're looking for contemporary things in India, how many of you even know about what goes on in India? What do you do? That's important. And some of you have probably seen it on TV. They have described many reasons, educational programs, and they talk about men who are displaced for whatever reason with their wives and their wives. Yes. He's heard that. And the big thing is that men don't get prosecuted for that possession. How old are they? After all, some are dead. That is an incredible hatred. It's more than a subservient. That's a hatred. Wouldn't it? Okay. That's absolutely what you mean. We did that in New York. Are you serious? outside a locker room a few years ago. It's scary. This is not going away. You know, it's weird. Can you believe these rabbis actually pray for him like that? Well, I mean, it's not that good. Men could have more than one wife in biblical times, at least in a divorce. It was illegal for women to... One of the big arguments about women being elders is women not being elders and deacons is that it says being a husband and one wife. And one of the interesting things, I don't think this is a final argument, I wouldn't lay it all on this, but one of the things, if you know a little history, a biblical history, is that men often had more than one wife, and so an injunction to only have one wife would be an important thing to say. Women never had more than one husband. It was illegal. Why would you say it? They couldn't do it. I'm not going to rest the whole thing on that. It's just an interesting thing. I may have heard that. I've heard that. Well, a woman could be the husband of one wife, and then they could be an element. You don't get it. That was really coming down the floor of a real problem. What else is going on? Husband of one wife. In fact, in the Greek, husband of one wife at a time. Honestly, that's what it meant in the Greek. One wife at a time. In a court of law, a woman could not be a witness, after all. to trust a woman. That would be stinking there. Sheldon couldn't be a witness in that court of law either. Rabbi considered it beneath its dignity to acknowledge the presence of any woman in public. And I'm sure that behind this they thought there was something about moral purity here, but they would not physically look pure-wise and by need. I would not look at you. I would not acknowledge the presence. So if you want to cut that as a moral thing, and if you were saying pure, fine. But I think there's anger to me. So what occurred to me is, I play that out, and if I would see you coming for you and you, and I wouldn't look at you, I'd look away. What occurs to me, he would probably pet his camel, he'd probably look at his dog, but he wouldn't look at a woman. And I just, again, I just feel his anger. They're not permitted to study the Torah. They're not allowed to enter the inner courts. If you were done teaching on that, the temple was a series of courts. The outside court was the courtyard of the Gentiles where anybody could go. Guess where Jesus was, by the way? All of his teachings were somewhere. The courtyard of the Gentiles, where everybody was. How do you love that? And the outside court, inside that was only Jews. Inside that was only men. Inside that was only priests. Inside that was only somebody else. Until you got to the Holy of Holies, where the high priest went once a year into the Holy of Holies where God was. But you know what's cool about that picture? You've got to get more and more explosive and more and more something or other. Until you get to where God is once a year. But the truth is, when God became flesh, became a man who went into the outer courtyard, guess where God was then? He was where everybody was. I love that. That's just amazing. Women, however, were, if you were Jewish women, you could come inside the courtyard of the Gentiles, but you couldn't come inside, you couldn't become that next court. So we were excluded from that. A first century rabbi would say things like this. Rather, should the words of Torah be burned than entrusted to a woman? Whoever teaches their daughter the Torah is like one who teaches with seriases. Is that incredible? I want to talk a little bit about what I've been talking about without giving it a name. Because what I've been talking about is called massaging. Now, I am indebted to the work of Leon Payne and a man named Mario Berger for what I'm about to share with you. And if any of you have occasion or are going to be able to go to the me and pain conference, it's coming. Some of us are going to hear at much more depth and much better than I'm going to do. But I need to tell you, I've gleaned most of this from some of the tapes I've heard and books I've read from me and pain, also from Mario. And I thought it was important enough to at least give you this as a historic perspective on, because that's where Gino is right now. We're doing the history piece. The text is on hold when we're doing our work, so we can get some text on this whole thing with misogyny. Misogyny is a Greek word that literally refers to the hatred of women. Misogyny literally is a generalized hatred of the feminine. And misogyny, another nuance of the word, brings with an overvaluing of masculine characteristics and an under-devaluing of feminine characteristics. By the way, it's important that both men and women can be misogyny. And I wonder if some of the women on the panel have been able to talk about that. Because it's been interesting, how does the biggest resistance come from women? Not always, but it was Christ. According to Leon Cain, at the heart of the Greek pagan religions in the Near East and in the East was misogyny. Interesting, in India, right now is where it's okay to burn women. At the heart of pagan religion was misogyny. Manifested most clearly in these pagan religions in what they defined as a polarized view of women. Now, this is hard even to let it come from my lips, and I'm just getting into what this pagan religion thing is, but they would polarize women to see them as extremely as a virgin or as a whore. Excuse me for talking like that, but they would see them in those polarized ways. The virgin was deified, the whore would be despised. What's interesting, and this is where it just kind of, whoa, did that to me when I heard this, was that in both of those cases, the virgin and the whore, both of them are untouchable. No touch even one. Why? Well, to touch a virgin would defile her, and to touch a whore would defile you. In neither case are you talking about a relationship, you know? In neither case are you talking about an eye-to-eye, you know, where we're on an equal footing here. There's this deification or despising polarization. Both temple priests, prostitutes, and virgins were central to great worship. Now, that would be a term that I wish you could have been here when we were going through this. That was a huge thing. The Egyptian goddess Isis was a mother. She was identified as a mother, a wife, and a woman. And those were three things that identified. She identified herself as one. What's interesting is a major Old Testament theme is I give you this kind of disgusting stuff. What's interesting is in light of that, one of the major Old Testament themes was the spiritual conflict between Yahwehism or the God of Israel, the God of the Bible, and Baalism. In Baalism, there were male and female prostitutes. There was a worship of the procreative faculties. You know what I mean by that without getting too graphic, but telling how bad it is. There would be statues of naked men and naked women and genitals that were larger than life. That would be the deification or the worshiping of procreative faculties. These religions were always pulling at God's people. I mean, if you read the Old Testament, the veil is always pulling at God's people. You can turn it pulling at the poor men. The danger that God was always worrying his people against was falling into veil worship. What's interesting is that feminist theologians have been very quick to embrace the goddess religions. I don't know how many of you are deeply involved in feminist theology, but it's interesting because feminist theologians have been real quick to embrace the goddess religions as superior to Tao-Christian religion, Christianity, because Christianity talks about God being Father, Christ being Son, so that's not okay. Sarah Pomeroy wrote a book, Goddesses, Poorest, Wives, and Slaves. This is entitled. I feel a little embarrassed by that one. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Sure. Wrote. I recommend you change the title. Anyway. Wrote this. Respectable women as well as prostitutes. This was feminist thinking. Respectable women as well as prostitutes can identify with a goddess who is born and born. So you get it? The appeal here is that all women can identify with a goddess who is born and born. What's ironic is that it's the polarized field of women. I think you'll get this. It is the polarized field of women that is impressed with this. This is the anti-feminine. There is a risk in the face. We're not talking about a relationship here. We're looking for footage here. You either despise him or you be afraid. That's what I said. The Jewish ethicist Dennis Prager said this, and I quote, feminist theologians fail to see the revolutionary nature of Judaism's prohibitions against all forms of non-marital sex, which was designed by God to redeem women from her sexually devalued state. Being either the version of the other part. She now has been seen as more than a Judeo-Christian teacher, more than poor her virgin. Now, because of the call of God for one man, one woman, now it calls for fidelity, now it calls for love, and now it's calling for relationship eye to eye as the face equal for it. Unfortunately, a law against adultery, a law that says one woman, one man is not a cure for deep-seeking, sick, and massaging. I mean, if you're deciding to be just what's at the core, like you're at this year, you're saying adultery, and then you're sticking with one woman. Doesn't mean you're not deciding to be this person. I'll tell you, when I first went through this, I don't think that. You know, I think I'm somebody who's, I love the future stuff, liberating stuff. But it made me aware of stuff I wasn't aware. You know, maybe something. The symptoms of massaging, this is one that kind of helps you to be able to see, well, maybe there's more than a film. The symptoms of massaging are varied and sometimes are subtle. Some of the more obvious would be rape. I mean, we're seeing this every day in the news. From now on, when you see it, what's at the core of that? I think it goes back to, you know, bail. It's massaging. Whatever else is going on? Abuse? Every day. Every day. It's a court. If a guy's ever going to get free from that, somewhere along the line, we may never use this word, misogyny, but somewhere along the line he's going to have to get free from it. He'll have to get free from it. All this is misogyny. Break abuse, disregard. Women's opinion? Less obvious manifestations of misogyny. A belief that women are there to serve men. That's why they're here. I remember I was in junior high, high school, when the big civil rights things happened in Martin Luther King. We were just as white as we could be. We were just as white as we could be. And I remember this racism happening. And I honestly can't, I don't think I ever heard this in my family, but I certainly heard it in the circle of people I was in. When the black riots were happening, they were so angry. And what I heard one or one was, they're okay if they would just know their flag. the blacks. Remember that? Remember that? That same hatred is, that same kind of thinking is toward women as well. They're okay if they were just, if they were just no other place. And when women get angry, the response very often is the same way as when blacks begin to be angry and be angry. Another less obvious symptom of misogyny is the need to control. This is where a man wants a woman to be very close, but he can't be controlled by her. So while he wants her to be close, he pushes her away at the same time. It's a quote by Dr. Margaret Rink in a book. She wrote Christian men who hate women. Another interesting time. I had a hard time buying that one. I don't like it. Christian men who hate women. Here's a quote. In one way, the misogyny builds walls around himself to keep the women away, fearing that if she gets too close, she will notice the shame. By the way, what would be a suburb of the sin? What would be the cure of the assignment to be made in grace? Not just to be the murderer, but to be the guy who's made in grace. He is against the human being in shame. Maybe that's what he did. This bullying has a two-sided purpose, to control her and to keep her from abandoning him. At the same time, he's an episode. So at one time, I'm going to beat you up, either verbally or with my fist. to control you and make you do what I want if you're afraid of me, but also to make you continue to be a leader. But also it keeps her at arm's length. In one way he comes across as a self-made man, independent, self-assured, needing no one, yet he's so insecure, so unable to separate from her, that he sees himself as totally an extension of her. Another subtle manifestation of the misogyny is pretending to value and then disregarding a woman's influence. Pretending to value and then disregarding a woman's influence. But, you know, when we're doing that, it's like you're not even aware you're doing it. You know, it's weird. You do your stuff and then you grow and all that stuff. But these are things that, you know, in some ways, you know, maybe a dimension should just be able to talk about this stuff. Because I can identify ways in which I was like him. I don't. I think about it. Maybe I shouldn't even get some presentations like an older person. But I had some real significant issues with my mom. You might hear me talk a lot about my dad. I got some real significant issues with my mom. And I remember early in our marriage, not being able to have a very high opinion on my wife's opinion. And the spread of that. I did that a lot. I don't do that. I worked through some of those stuff. But I did that a lot. It drove her nuts. She was a little bit at standing up to me, so I couldn't press this through my stuff. And it made me aware of, you know, what was it? Because somebody don't value what I say, I have to go back and go, I'm right, I said, well, I'm going to go back and do something. I'm going to go back and do something. I'm going to go back and do something. Now, I'm tend to see the blame women. You know, I get all the shit about, well, that goes back to Genesis 1. That goes back to Genesis 1. A guy comes to age, he came to Adam, did you eat the fruit? Adam Smith said, yes. Instead, he said, no, the woman, the one you gave me, she gave me the fruit. He blamed God. He blamed the woman twice and he blamed God once. Another subtle symptom of misogyny is what I'll call locker room talking. Okay, I've got to fill in the blanks on that one. Women are, I'm not going to say you mean, they're the B-win. Okay? You fill in the blanks. Listen to 12-year-old boys play. If one of the friends doesn't do very well at some athletic thing, you're such a what? You're a what? You're a woman. You're a woman. My voice, I've heard say that. You woman, you woman. And every time you say it, we have a little talk. But I'm telling you, I've heard him say it. I'm not going to go crazy on that, but we are going to talk about that every time I hear that. What is that about? That's something deep-seated. That's something in the culture. It's not okay to me. What's wrong? Every time I say that, my wife or me say, what's wrong with being a woman? What's wrong with that? Are you an idiot? I do talk to my kids like that, and they understand me. I never call them an idiot unless I ever do anything like that. But I do call them an idiot because my kids are idiots. So anyway, another subtle manifestation of the massaging thing. I did not grow up in this culture, but this kind of Christian talk, this one, but I know of many people who did, and that is that when you're in a church and a woman begins to get verbal and disagrees, I mean, you know, if they're out of order, be quiet. But a woman who begins to disagree is called a Jezebel. You have a Jezebel spirit, and you project kind of a witch image on them. Well, it's too interesting that he does talk about a Jezebel spirit, And a Jezebel spirit is a mixture, is when true Yahwehism or God, the true God worship, gets mixed with Baal, or with the entire thing, would be Christianity gets mixed with the culture. It just gets like this. And one of the things that's interesting, according to Leanne Payne, and I wish this was getting dressed out a little bit more, but I'm going to want to talk to her a little bit about this. But according to Leanne Payne, the Jezebel spirit is always accompanied with what she calls an Ahab spirit, an Ahab attitude. An Ahab spirit, if you remember Jezebel and Ahab, Ahab was, Jezebel was the one who scared the prophet. The Ahab spirit is passivity in men, when they cannot speak the truth in the defense of the faith. And women, women, too. But the Ahab spirit is when man is passive and won't defend the faith. Besides the name of women, one cultural manifestation of that would be Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth, in an unbridled drive toward power to become king, says this in the play. This is called, this means, come you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me fear. What is that? That's a devaluing of every attribute that's feminine. And it's a hatred of feminine attributes. Come, you spirits, pretend on mortal thoughts. Unsex me here and fill me from crown to toe, top full of the direst cruelty. Make thick my blood. She's asking to be unsexed, to abdicate for true femininity, and move in a raw drive toward power. That was a very compelling teaching to me. And, again, if you have opportunities to go and participate in the union conference, I'd say there's some incredible liberty and freedom. I'm learning some of this, and I mean, her ability, and it really is annoying to come and assist you. Do you get a feeling, as I'm talking about this, whether some of it you might be there, that's a little weird, but do you get a feeling of eternality almost about this problem? This is not a 90s thing. This is going, this is really, really. All of that, all that I just did for quite a few minutes there, was dealing with the history work around what was revealed women when Paul said there's women through silence. Let's move on. We have a few more minutes, not many, just a few more minutes to talk about the scriptural view or theology. I'll end with this, and then I know exactly what we'll pick up next week. Well, beginning to beginning. Here's, we've got the historical view of women, and that is that they're not thought very highly of. So let's go back to the beginning, Genesis chapter 1, the scriptural view of women. Genesis chapter 1, verse 26, in creation. Then God said, let us make man, man interestingly there is a plural, and it means human, in our image according to our likeness, and let them, so it's obviously man was men, man was men and women, Rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over the earth. And God created man in his own image. He created him, male and female. So the him is a human thing. He created him, male and female. He created them. And God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and multiply and throw the earth. So do it. Rule over it. Over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky. Over every living thing. Rule, subdue, and multiply. What's interesting there is that they, man and woman, they were the glory of God. God blessed, not the man or the woman, God blessed them. God said to them, rule, subdue, multiply. And so what I see in creation is what I refer to as a co-regency, a co-rule. God said to them, rule, them multiply. Genesis 2, as God backtracks and talks about how it was that man and woman were created. The thing is, for our use, in terms of teaching here, is that after God created Eve, it says this, verse 22, And the Lord fashioned into a woman, the riddle was taken from the man and brought her to the man. And the man said, before I read the text, what I want you to know is, first of all, what he did is, I said, picture here, Adam is looking at Eve for the first time. Looking at Eve. Here's what he did not say. He did not say, aha, I'm made to serve me, to take care of me, to baby me, and obey me, and always remember she's subserving it to me. He didn't say that. We say that. He didn't say that. What he said was, and what's interesting about what he said, was that he got it right. He looked at her and he said, that is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. You got it right. You got it right. She shall be called woman because it's taken out of a man. For this cause, for what cause? For bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh cause. For that cause, a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall plead to his wife. And the two shall become one flesh. Now go back to Genesis 1. And he said to them, rule, and he said to them, multiply, and he said to them, subdue. Now, bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh. Now go back to Genesis 1. That is a little bit of a different perspective than a first century rabbi, isn't it? The one who would pet his dog, but he wouldn't look at a woman. A little different attitude. What's going on here? Well, here's the question. Where did the change come? Okay? Now, I've already taken you through this pretty big historic thing. It's given us this almost sense of eternality around this misogyny thing. Where did the change come that all of a sudden women would devalue? And quite frankly, men devalued as well. Well, Genesis 3, the fall. It's what's called the theological fall. Again, we can go on and on about all the theological ramifications of the fall, but suffice it to say that when sin entered into the world, relationships were destroyed on a number of levels. The primary relationship that was destroyed was this one, us and God. And that's why we needed to redeem it. And that's the part of the fall that we talk the most about. But the other dimension of relationships were broken were these as well. Relationships were broken between men and women and men and women and women and people. Relationships were destroyed. In Genesis 3.16, there's an interesting verse. And if you, again, get the context, the whole context here is God kind of giving a litany of what the result of the fall is. And among the results of the fall are things like the sweat of your brow, how there's going to be pain in childbirth, and all these sort of yucky things that are going to happen. And among all the things that are going to come now because of things being destroyed is verse 16, where it says, Yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you. Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you. Well, that doesn't sound, well, the rule over you sounds a little weird, but the desire for her husband, that sounds like, wouldn't that be a good thing? desire, it's like now that's being called the curse. So the curse is that you're going to desire your husband but he's going to rule it. So you'll like it. Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. This is the curse. Now what was interesting what was interesting here, now you've got to do the context. We did that so we know this is the result of fall. That's what this is about. So this is a hard thing here. You also have to do the syntax, what the words mean. It's very interesting because in the very next chapter, chapter 4, God is talking to Cain. Cain has just killed Abel. And God is moving on Cain. And God says this to Cain. If you do well, will not your confidence be lifted up, Cain? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door and its desire is for you. Stop right there. Sin is crouching at the door and its desire, same Hebrew word, and its desire is for you. When you think of sin crouching at the door and its desire being for Cain, Do you think of somebody going, I love it in a cage? The word desire there means to tear down and usurp, to pull down. Its desire is to destroy you. It's to pull you down. It is the same. I don't think it is. It is the same. It is the same word. Very next chapter. One of the things that I've heard here in some of the seminars use that verse as an example of God's ordained pattern. to hear this and that your desire will be from her and him and he will be over you. No, no, no, you don't get it. In the context, this is the fall. This is the curse we're talking about here. And the word desire does not mean what you normally see. I've done this teaching when I'm married. And I do this whole thing. And what I feel to is the desire that's in Genesis 1 is not the desire I see in your face right now for him. The desire in your face right now for him is wonderful. And it's delirious, and it's great. It's why you're getting married. But this desire is a usurping, a tearing down, an evil rule. The rule there is not even loving headship. It's a trust. It's a despotic word to be a despot. Okay? Let me give you the picture, and we'll close on this one and pick it up next week. This is incredible. This has all happened in two chapters, from chapter 1 to chapter 3. When God created men and women, he said to them, rule and multiply, flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone, and for this cause the men and women will come together to become one flesh. And he said to them, rule, subdue, multiply, coal reigning, coal regency, one flesh is the dynamic. That's God's ordained pattern. Okay? Relationship destroyed, the first thing that happens is we're over here. And now, rather than this coal regency, you've got two people fighting to get on top. Now, we've been kind of picking on men here so far, which is a society thing. But the deal is that both men and women are trying to beat the other one up to get on top. And she shall desire him, and that is to tear down and rip him, and push him down. And he will rule over you and push you down. And maybe historically, there's a way in which men win. They're bigger, they're stronger, and there's a way in which they can do that. But there are ways in which women do the same thing. Maybe not with their fist, but there are ways to do the same thing. We do the same thing. I'm not going to go deeply into it because we're out of time. But contrast this one flesh to this, and now we're trying to get on top, knock each other down, to Ephesians 5. Now I'm going to Ephesians 5. Ephesians 5, hardly ever taught in context, by the way. This is another one of these great things. We just go to women, submit to your husbands, which you need to do. I'll tell you what it means. And we tell husbands, love your wives. We have great Christ love the church. A little side note. We would be much better off if the women did their version and the men did their version. We didn't have men doing the women's version and women doing the men's version. But that even misses the point because the context is Ephesians 5.18 where it says, Be being continually kept filled with the spirit. Here's the deal. Be filled with the spirit. Play ride. He dominated men. In fact, this is what I do at letters. I look at the man and I say, your goal in life is not to be the ruler. Your goal, your focus, is not even to be the best husband. Your focus is to be a man full of the Spirit. That's what I mean. You, woman, young woman, your focus in life is to be a woman full of the Spirit. And then he goes in verse 21, just a few verses after that, and then he says a number of things that are the result of the filling of the Spirit, singing psalms with another, remember that, making melody and all that, speaking psalms with another. And then it says in verse 21, another result of the filling of the Spirit, is this, that we are subject one to another in the spirit of Christ. For the spirit, the result of that is that we subject ourselves one to another. Subject, all of a sudden, subject one to another is, I'm getting underneath you and lifting you. I'm getting underneath you and lifting you. How different is that from the desire to usurp and destroy? Getting on top of the book? No. And then he says, women submit to your husbands, getting underneath them to lift. And husbands, lay down your life for your wives. What does that mean? What is it? And love them as Christ loved the church. How did Christ love the church? Well, if he did not get underneath the church, if he did not lay down his life to lift us up, literally into heaven, then I don't know what it means to get underneath somebody to lift. I think the act of rendering that Holy Spirit's 530 with the spirit of the Spirit resulting in subjecting ourselves one to another, wives to husbands, husbands laying down their lives, you get this incredible picture That can only happen, by the way, in a redeemed context where this is redeemed and this is being redeemed. Let's be honest. It's being redeemed. We're in this process of being from the church where men and women are coming underneath each other to live. And now all this language is submission that I would almost shy away from. No, my wife doesn't need to see it. She doesn't get in here. She doesn't need to see it. I can't be with the wife. And I don't get in here. She needs. My wife needs everything that I am to come underneath her and lift me. And I need everything that makes her strong and powerful to get underneath me and lift me. And that's it. And it's so different from this. It's this. And oh, God, you feel it's good. You can do it. We'll pick all of you. We'll pick all of this up right there next time.
