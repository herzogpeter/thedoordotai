Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Hi, everybody. In just a few seconds here, the ushers are going to be coming back down again. We're starting a new thing here this weekend when if the offering doesn't cut it, we're coming back. Lock the doors. Anyway, it's just funny. And if you're visiting, we're kidding. I'm not doing that. You don't have to panic or anything like that. What is true is the ushers are going to be coming down in a second, but they're not asking for more. They're going to have a card. And if you're an attender of open door, I encourage you to take the card. If you're visiting with us, just let it go by unless you're curious. We'll look at it if you want. But we have been communicating for quite some time that we have been experiencing a significant and sustained downward trend financially since the month of September. This trend appears to be the new norm. I think you also know that we made significant adjustments back in November to our budget. We cut spending by $300,000. And as we've also shared, we're prepared to use lease income from Beacon to kind of help our general fund, the operational expenses. We haven't wanted to do that. We have been kind of taking that money to use it for our reserves, but we will do that if we have to to make up this gap. Now, this may surprise you, but I'm not really known as being a detail guy, but I want to break down some details relative to our financial situation right now. First of all, I want to remind you that we're in the last quarter of our fiscal year. We started the fiscal year in June with a $5 million budget, which was a reduction of $325,000 from the previous year. In November then, we reduced our expenses back even further to 4.7, and now believe we are able to, just with some more shaving of things, underspend that by another $100,000, which brings our projected expenses, what we expect to spend, to about 4.6. now to the income side of things. Based on the current downward trend of about 15%, what we're projecting is 4.3 in income. So we're needing 4.6. We're projecting 4.3. And again, with the income from Beacon, we can make that $300,000 up if we have to, but it would be far better if we could close that gap with giving. And that's what these cards and this challenge is about, closing the gap between income and expenses raises a question. How do you do that? How do we close the gap of $300,000? Well, we've been talking about this and we believe the responsibility for this falls on the leadership and the staff and so open door attenders. We talk about community a lot around here and I believe that it's important part for the community to know what's going on in the area of our finances and kind of have a sense of being in this whole thing together and also kind of discerning what are our respective roles. But getting away from, you know, you're talking about a million dollars and a hundred thousand dollars and it just kind of gets a little overwhelming and what could the little thing I do help with all? So let me break it down this way for you a little bit. If we had a thousand people who decided, you know what, we can give a hundred dollars a month more than we normally do, we're there. $300,000 is made up. When I wonder about the reality of that kind of response, However, I know that it could be hard for 1,000 people to give $100 more than what they're already giving, like the rest of the country. 10% of you, for all we know, may be out of work right now. But I also know that nearly 2,400 people here at Open Door who gave last year, of that, 1,500 gave less than 1,000. 1,100 gave less than 500 in the last year, so there may be room to grow there. It's been a while since we shared that kind of information. here at Open Door, but there's a slide on the screen with the 2009 giving levels, and it's also in your bulletin. We realize that some of you can't give another $100. You just can't, you can't give anything right now for a variety of reasons, but some of you can, and some of you maybe can do 50. Some of you can do more than 100. The reality about the giving levels, the percentages didn't change in 2009. Over one half of our people consistently give over $1,000 a year for a variety of reasons don't always know. I read an article in the paper today, and this to me means we need to just be in this thing together. Article front page, Star Tribune, today said that the Twin Cities suburbs have now more poor people than the core cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. A startling, a startling reality. Job losses, foreclosures in this room. We got to be in this thing together. I also want to let you know that this need and this plan to close the gap was first brought to our governing board and then to our staff this last Wednesday. We brought it to our whole staff, and we asked all of them, and they are doing it, to participate in two ways. First, we asked all of our staff and governing board, and they did, to take a card just like we're giving you and to consider how much they can support the open door beyond what they're already giving. And secondly, particularly of our staff, we asked them to spend carefully. We've been doing this all along the way, but honestly, getting down to if you plan to spend $100 on something, can you do it for $50? And that kind of spirit is being picked up by all of our staff and our board. Now, I know that managing money and learning how to give and having a life and a heart that is free from the grip of mammon is hard work. It's just hard work, and it's kind of like if you don't stay on it, you kind of drift in these areas. I know I do. It may be that you're still learning what God has to say about money. It may be that you're finding yourself overloaded with debt, and we find people in that situation where they really want to give, but they can't because of some of those kinds of things. It may be hard to give because of the environment in which you were raised. There's just like no value on this kind of thing. It might be that you don't trust churches when it comes to money, and so there's this automatic aversion to any kind of appeal like this, whatever your story is. What we want to do is invite you into God's story. And we do this in a variety of ways, and now we're doing it as it relates to money. Money talk is complicated. It's often uncomfortable. But I also believe that we can, we really can move more and more from disordered relationships with money to rightly ordered relationships with the same. We realize it's probably been too long, actually, since we talked about money. If you're visiting, you're maybe thinking, you know, this is like church, all I do is talk about money. We hardly ever do. And we're going to bring some teaching on rightly ordered relationships with money a little bit in April. And haven't done that for several years, actually. If you're ready to respond today, and some of you are, though, my wife and I, we kind of found out about this Wednesday in terms of the card, and we needed a couple days to think about it, so you may too. But if you do know, you can, ushers will be in the back of the sanctuary today, Collecting them, but otherwise you can bring them back next week. Put them in the offering or at the welcome place. If you give online, you may give an additional one-time gift online or increase your giving that way for the next few months. Thank you for listening. Thank you for listening. Oh, yeah, I didn't mean to start you clapping, but yeah, whatever. Okay, sorry. Hey, if I go out of the screen, we just, it's a communion Sunday. Usually we sit. I wanted to stand. There's nobody on the camera, so how you doing? anyway anyway okay oh terry's back there just going what an idiot he's such an idiot let's pray father we thank you for the work of your spirit among us through the worship through the word in our very lives be active by your spirit through this word i pray in jesus name amen well last week if you were here i'm sure you remember that we centered our thoughts around a question. A question that was born of Paul's claim in Colossians chapter 2 verse 3. We've been dealing with Colossians for quite a long time now. And here was his claim that in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. All, everything you want to know about wisdom and knowledge you need for life and how to do life, about what the good life is, and how to enter into it. And the question that was born of that was this. Do I have to throw my brains out the window to believe that that is true, that in Christ is hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. The question actually was this, can smart people believe in God? And today, I want to take that same question and ask it a little different way and use it actually to prepare us for the table this morning. My question this week is this, does faith in God make sense? More sense than the alternative. And I'm not talking about ironclad proofs because my question isn't, can you prove the existence of God beyond a shadow of anyone's doubt, but rather, does believing in God's faith and trust make more sense than basing your life on something else? That there is no God, nothing at all out there. And while I think these are important questions, actually on any given day. I find it particularly compelling given the work we've been doing these days in Colossians, where Paul not only claims that in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, but earlier in the same epistle, Colossians chapter 1 verse 15, Paul claims that Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the image, the physical representation of the invisible God. But if there is no God, says Dallas Willard in the book I referenced last week entitled Knowing Christ Today, or if knowing of God is impossible, as it certainly would be if there is no God, then what is left of Christ is really nothing at all. Thus, this question, very important now, does it make sense to believe in God? More sense than the alternative. And to answer that, I want to begin by running through what we might think is clues that point to God. And once again, like last week, I am indebted to Dallas Willard for much of my thinking here and his book, again, Knowing Christ Today. First clue. Let's get right at it here. First clue has to do with creation, that there are ways in which creation speaks to the reality of God. It doesn't prove it, but it's a finger pointing, and it raises a number of questions, like how did the universe get started? Where did the Big Bang come from if the Big Bang happened? Why is there something rather than nothing? I'm not an expert in this, obviously, but I have done some research on this recently. I've discovered some things, and one of them is this, relative to this issue, one of the greatest discoveries of the last century among scientists, apparently, is this, that the universe had a beginning. It does not sound like news to you, but this is something fairly recent in scientific circles, that the universe had a beginning, popularly known as the Big Bang Theory. You've undoubtedly heard of that. And one of the reasons it's kind of a big deal to just say that is because in previous centuries, as I just said, the vast majority of scientists didn't believe that, believing rather that the physical universe or matter always existed. And initially, there was a lot of resistance, actually, among scientists to the contrary. Fascinating little book that Dallas makes reference to by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg entitled The First Three Minutes. It's obviously a book speaking of the beginning of the universe. His theory basically was this, and I'm quoting him here, that in the beginning, all the matter of the universe was compressed into a point of infinite density, what physicists call the singularity. So according to scientists, there was a time when the universe entirely was compressed down into something smaller than an atom, which is really hard to get your head around. Imagine the entire universe. I mean, everything in it, not just smaller than the earth, not just smaller than this room, not just smaller than the head of a pin, smaller than an atom, which means, according to scientists, that the universe had a beginning. It was not, and then it was. Now, here's why that points to something like God. It's a very simple argument, actually, because everything that has a beginning has a cause. Nothing just magically pops into being. Cell phones, the clothes you're wearing, this room you're sitting in, the car you drove in on the way here, everything that has a beginning has a cause. The universe had a beginning, Therefore, something caused the universe. Now, if you're not buying that, think. Try and think of the alternative. The alternative is that something came from nothing. And nothing is very hard to grasp. Young mom, young mom hears crash-like noises coming from another room. She goes into that room and asks her kids, what are you doing? And they say, It's really hard to get your... I don't believe in nothing. We're never doing nothing. Our hearts are beating. We're breathing. We're thinking. Some of you are sleeping, and if you aren't now, give it a minute or so. Not nothing. What is nothing? I can't even... I don't know. It would be complete emptiness. No space, no time, no energy, no matter. not even a void because a void connotes boundaries in a container of something, nothing. Then, with no explanation, no cause, the universe pops into being. It could have happened hard to get your head around, which is at least part of why Stephen Weinberg in this book, The First Three Minutes, not a Christian, just a scientist trying to get his head around this, concludes, and I'm quoting here again, that the existence of the universe itself Points to the existence of something beyond the universe, something that does not depend on anything else for its existence, something of immense power, something that has a quality of what we would think of as a mind. Couldn't go to God, a mind, okay. The Apostle Paul said it this way, about 2,000 years ago to a church in Rome, for since the creation of the world, God's invisible attributes, his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood through what has been made, which does not prove God exists. But it's like a finger pointing, and it calls for some explanation, which leads to another indicator, another finger, if you will, pointing to the possibility of God. It's what a guy named Tim Keller calls the cosmic welcome man. I like this one. Cosmic welcome, Matt, refers to this oddity in our universe that physicists, both secular and religious, they aren't people who've got this religious bent and trying to make some point, like I'm kind of doing. They refer to this oddity as what's called the anthropic principle. The word anthropic comes from the Greek word anthropos, which means man or human. And the anthropic principle is this, that our universe seems to be fine-tuned to be the kind of place that can support human life. It doesn't have to be, but it is. Indeed, says Keller, there are a striking number of conditions and contingencies in biology and physics that have to be just right for life to arise, to be sustained. And as it turns out, they are just right. And then he gives several examples. One is this, quoting Keller again, that the proportion of the mass of a neutron of hydrogen, And I just want you to just get your head around me saying actually this sentence here. That the proportion of the mass of a neutron of hydrogen that's converted to energy during nuclear fusion is 0.007. Who knew? This kind of brings tears to you. Okay. But, but, if it were 0.006, the whole universe would be hydrogen. There would be no life. And if it were 0.008, there would be no hydrogen and no life. He goes on. The precise orbit of the earth, its distance from the sun, the existence of a moon that keeps the earth tilted on its axis at 23.5 degrees creates a climate that can sustain life. In fact, physicists call this the Goldilocks zone. Seriously. You know Goldilocks. Not too hot. Not too cold. Just what? Just right. water he goes on says this has this fascinating characteristic didn't know this that as water gets colder it contracts until it freezes and then it reverses course and expands big deal here's the big deal if it didn't have this weird property oceans and lakes would freeze from the bottom up freezing solid creating a problem what would that be everything would die aquatic life would be impossible. Life in general would be impossible. So this anthropic principle, it's called that by physicists, is this overarching name for the fact that there are innumerable variables from the strength of gravity to the properties of carbon to the exact rate of the expansion of the Big Bang and on and on and on in the universe, in our planet, in biology, all of which had to be perfectly tuned for life to exist. Turns out, it's perfectly tuned. It's ironic, says Dallas Willard then, that when Copernicus demonstrated that the earth revolves around the sun and not the other way around, that a number of people in subsequent generations concluded that the human race will just have to recognize that everything doesn't revolve around us, that we're accidents. Just deal with it. we are accidents in this huge universe. The irony being, says Dallas, that in recent decades, since Copernicus, we have discovered what previous centuries could not have imagined, that the universe looked strangely like it was designed precisely so that we could exist, as if in some sense, the universe really does revolve around us. The physicists, by the name of Freeman Dyson, said it this way, it's as if the universe saw us coming. This doesn't prove the existence of God, but it indicates something. It's a finger pointing at something. Another indicator, not a proof, but something that points, is something that philosophers and theologians speak of, and that is the longing and the hunger in the human heart for meaning and beauty, a sense of dignity and human worth, a sense of significance that as a human being, I am and you are more than a little blob of carbon, a random collection of molecules. We're going to reduce it down to that. It's all you are. It's all we are. A blob of carbon, a random collection of molecules. you can believe that. It takes a leap of faith to believe that too. But if that's true, I mean, just goofy stuff. Why do we love so much? If all you are, a little blob of carbon. I mean, what explains this? See, that's my granddaughter. It's just nothing special there. It's a little blob of carbon, random collection of molecules. What's all the happy stuff for? And why do we grieve so when one of them are lost? What's the big deal? You're just a little blob of carbon. A little random collection of molecules. Nicholas Walterstorff. Guy had to grow up with that name. Walterstorff. A Yale professor wrote a book about justice, actually. Again, not a Christian. He wrote a book about justice in which he raised this question. It was his question, kind of dealt with this whole thing of justice around this. Why do human beings have dignity? Why do they have worth and human rights? That's the justice connection. If children are beaten, he says, if women are marginalized, we say it's wrong. Why, he asks. What is that belief grounded in? And it matters, by the way, what it's grounded in because if this belief that people have value and dignity, basic human rights, if that is grounded in certain human capacities or abilities, think, then when those capacities or abilities are diminished, then to some extent those rights and dignity will be diminished as well. But we believe, he says, we have this sense, we have at least this hunger that all human beings, whatever their age or IQ, Whatever their capacities or abilities have infinite value. Why? Where does this belief come from? What is it rooted in? I don't know. But it's why some pretty smart people a couple hundred years ago wrote these fairly familiar words that we hold these truths to be self-evident. Like, I'm not going to argue about this. I mean, everybody knows this. That all men are created equal and are endowed by their what? Creator. Which, so that proves it. No, it doesn't. But it points at something. It indicates a clue of something. Let me give you another. What one preacher calls the second big bang. First big bang is when the universe came into existence, crying out for an explanation. How do you account for this? second big bang is rooted in the reality that when people die, they stay dead. But then, how do you account for the literal explosion of the early church? Because the fact is this, think on this, there were many messianic movements in Jesus' day. Many people were rising up getting large groups of people to follow them and revolt often against Rome. And in every case, these would-be messiahs were executed by Rome, and when they were, that was the end of it. Yet as a matter of historical record, a massive community of a radically different nature springs up virtually overnight, raising these questions. Like, how did a group of deeply monotheistic Jews come to worship a human being, as if he were divine, virtually overnight? And how did this movement explode so rapidly with no resources or power so as to overtake the Roman Empire in such a short period of time? Virtually all of the disciples and the early church leaders died for what they believed. Blaise Pascal, the French philosopher, said, I tend to believe witnesses who get their throats cut. People simply do not die for what they know to be a lie. They might try to profit from a lie, but they don't willingly suffer and die for it, which is why I think the explosion of the early church is an interesting indicator and reason to believe. But it isn't the best. It isn't the best reason. And neither is the Big Bang thing, or neither is the anthropic principle, or even hunger and desire for meaning and dignity and all that because the best reason, the main reason, isn't an argument. It's a person. And his name is Jesus. When the words of Dallas Willard again comes shining through, over and over and over again, because in Jesus God comes shining through. He is the image of the invisible God, and he comes shining through in the strangest places. In the most unexpected ways, Jesus comes shining through in nursing homes, in prisons, wouldn't expect him there, in bedrooms and bars and schoolyards and job sites. Sometimes he even comes shining through church. Though it's hard there sometimes because a lot of times in church you just get religion, but Jesus comes shining even through that sometimes. the shining of Jesus revealing himself and therefore who God has happened one day to a murderous self-righteous Pharisee named Saul and it happened another day to a scandalized isolated tax collector named Zacchaeus but it also happened to a humble little activist named Mother Teresa to a little boy named Dallas Willard who lost his mother when he was two years old because Jesus just came shining through sometimes he comes shining through Christianity and sometimes he comes shining through in spite of Christianity happened to me I was a little boy weird memory Sunday night service some of you don't know what a Sunday night service is actually Sunday night service is like the JV service of church services if you know It's where the people who can't sing good enough in the morning sing in the evening. So the music is worse. The sermon is less prepared. The crowd is sparse. But every once in a while in these dopey things, Jesus would come shining through. And at eight years old, after we went home, I remember kneeling down at my parents' bed and opening wide my heart for the first time. Because see, it's just this journey of keeping that heart open and noticing that it closes and then opening it up again. But that was the first time I can remember because Jesus came shining through some really pathetic music and a boring sermon. My dad. Dallas Willow tells the story of Frank Laubach, who in 1930 was on the island in the Philippines, climbed to the top of Signal Hill. He was in despair, crushed. And how his life had gone, his career felt like a failure at the time. His dream of becoming a college president had kind of been dashed when out of chivalry, he had actually voted for his opponent on this board and he ended up losing the position by one vote. Three of his children had died of malaria. So his wife and one remaining child were living 900 miles away. And even the people he was trying to help there in the Philippines were rejecting him. So in despair, he goes to the top of this place called Signal Hill and tried to talk to God, and the strangest thing happened. Jesus came shining through. He'd been a Christian, was a Methodist. He was a missionary, for crying out loud, but he didn't know. It's just kind of knowing. Reminds me of another story in the middle of this story. A guy named Doug Coe, head of a little prayer group in Washington, D.C., And Arthur Burns was the head of the Federal Reserve at the time, attended this prayer group that Doug Coe was sponsoring. And a newcomer, not knowing what was going on here, asked Arthur Burns to pray. Fine, except Arthur Burns is Jewish and was coming to this for the very first time. So it was kind of an awkward moment. But they all bowed their heads, and Arthur graciously said he would pray, and this is what he prayed. Lord, may all Jewish people come to know this Jesus. and may all Muslims come to know this Jesus and Lord may all Christians come to know this Jesus. Frank Laubach was a Christian Methodist missionary but there was this knowing that he hadn't. But on this day, Jesus came shining through in such a way that this guy came to understand that a living person was inviting him to speak and listen and abandon and surrender and trust and live with him from one moment to the next moment. And for the next 40 years of his life, he entered into an experiment with that called Practicing the Presence of Christ. And I know that name, Frank Lobach, if you've ever read that book. It's kind of a well-known book among spiritual formation circles, practicing the presence of Christ. It was the experiment of his life. And far from making him obsessed or some weird hermit, you know, disconnected from realities of life, this partnership with Jesus made him a blessing to the world. Frank Lobach became a leader of the world literacy movement. If you've ever heard that phrase, each one teach one, that's him. He became an advisor to U.S. presidents, a key player in shaping U.S. foreign policy in World War II and repairing, rebuilding Europe. And this is what he wrote. Most glorious discovery that I have ever made, that has ever come to me, is that I don't have to wait till some future time to be with God. This hour can be heaven. An hour for anybody can be rich in God through Christ because Jesus shines. Sometimes in places of deep despair, which is where some of you may be right now, sometimes in places of frightening loneliness and gloom, heartbreaking loss. In the unmatched beauty of his life, in the unrivaled brilliance of his teaching, Jesus shines. Jesus meets people in their tears like nobody else. Jesus meets people on their deathbed like nobody else. in the strangest places and most unexpected ways, the best reason to believe has a face and a name. Jesus comes shining through. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come right here, right now, and do what you do among us as we come to the table, as some of us come kneel at the cross through our worship, maybe through our tears. Come be with us. Reveal yourself to us. Come shining through, we pray. Amen. Amen.
