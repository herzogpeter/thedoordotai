Let's pray as we begin. Father, my request is this, that by the power of your Spirit, through the wonder of the Word, you would shepherd your sheep who today are needing your guidance and direction in the context of a very dark day. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. I'm quite sure that you will understand if for the next couple of weeks we put on hold the series of sermons that we have been dealing with these last few months as we attempt to, as a church body, come to grips with and try to walk through as best we can the horrific events that exploded onto the scene September 11th. Last week, we heard the psalmist ask a question. that became our question for the day. Psalm 11, when the foundations are shaken, what can the righteous do? When the wicked bend the bow, when they make ready their arrow upon the string, and in places you do not see, they shoot in darkness, what can the righteous do? Well, this week, I want to take that question and press it to a slightly different place, asking today, what have the righteous done? and what can we from them learn? Historically, when calamity came calling, how have men and women of faith responded to it? How have they walked through it, remained faithful in it? For the fact is this, beloved, calamity, even of foundation-shaking proportions, is nothing new. Now, the particular calamity that we are dealing with these days in our country is new. Indeed, the word that people are using for it on a fairly regular basis to describe it is unprecedented. And the fact is that for us, it is unprecedented. It's never been this close. We've never felt less safe. We've never faced this kind of enemy. We've never fought this kind of war. We've never experienced this kind of vulnerability as a people as a country. It's unprecedented. In different parts of the world, at different times in history, foundation-shaking calamity has been an all-too-familiar reality. But when it becomes our reality, it presses even more urgently. A question that all of us are plagued with, even when calamity is far away. The question that presses on us is this, Why do things like this happen? Even more to the point of where our confusion is, is this question. Why do bad things happen to good people, to innocent people? A few years ago, there was a best-selling book with that question as the title of the book, Why Do Bad Things Happen to Good People? And I don't know how the author of that book answered the question. I'm sure he answered it thoughtfully and well. But here's what bothers me. Indeed, I find it quite maddening. Jesus never does answer that question. Indeed, the closest he ever seems to get to addressing it is when he simply confirms it. John 16, 33, he says this, In this world you will have trouble, calamity. The Greek word there is great tribulation. I don't find that very comforting. I want a different answer in fact there's some things that rise up in me demanding a different answer in this world you will have trouble I want you to think about it with me just a bit as we try to get some perspective on this whole thing think about it historically with me in the context of the early church you see I think many of us have a rather romanticized view of the early church experience and I'm no different. I've got to tell you, I love the first three chapters of Acts. I could preach the first three chapters of Acts all day long. Well, not all day long. For a very long time. And be very excited about all the wonderful things that happen there and call the church to these kinds of things. And I think a lot of us kind of wistfully go, oh, if we could only be like the early church, it would be great. I mean, wonderful things happen in those first three chapters. The Holy Spirit falls. People speak in tongues. Signs and wonders flow. 3,000 people are saved in one day, just don't go to chapter 4. Just stay in chapter 3. Chapter 4 to the rest is kind of a different story. Signs and wonders, power of God, but all of a sudden, into the mix comes all sorts of trouble. Now, when you just stick with the first three chapters, and you experience the first three chapters in one way or another, whatever else seasons like that do, where God is moving in powerful and wonderful ways and trouble is not in view at all. Whatever else it does, it raises your expectations, leading us to believe, not because we're bad people or shallow in any way, but when you're on a roll like that, you start to think, this is the way it's supposed to be. This is the way it's always going to be. And if that's all you see, as the first three chapters of Acts in a metaphor, and that's how you kind of view life, or that's all you choose to see, you can begin to get some rather interesting, but I'm afraid inaccurate ideas and expectations about what life holds for us, about what God owes to us, about what His power can do for us and His promise is secure for us. For if you get the whole picture of that early church experience, one of the things that assaults you and you need to let it bother you about that early church experience is this, that every disciple but one died an awful death. They had trouble. Calamity. I mean, imagine having the Sunday where you had to make as part of your announcements the fact that last Wednesday afternoon, Stephen was stoned to death. James was beheaded. Peter was crucified upside down. Paul was executed as well. But before Paul was executed, he was beaten times without number, often in danger of death, when he wrote the book of Philippians, he was, as most of you know, in a Roman prison, fully expecting to be executed any moment. He wasn't, but eventually he was. Through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure, that was the experience of Paul, as recorded by him in 2 Corinthians 4. And when I hear that as being the experience of people who loved God and lived to serve Him, were totally faithful to him. I'm hearing this stuff and I get confused. I think, Paul, where? Where is the beach house on the Sea of Galilee? That's what I was expecting. Paul, where is the gilded edge guarantee that when we believe God, follow his principles, obey the word, the gilded edge guarantee of health and wealth, prosperity, and absolute protection? I have a pastoral concern this morning That's driving much of my talk It's this That some of us have developed In the American church I don't know if it's whatever Some of us have developed Some understandable But I'm afraid false Expectations born of faulty belief that makes it particularly hard for us who hold this faulty belief to stand firm in the day of calamity. And among the faulty beliefs that I'm talking about is this belief, that if we love God and live to please Him, in other words, if we're good, we will, by that good behavior, always, and there's the operative word, the expectation is that we will always be protected by special and constant intervention from pain and suffering, misfortune, or the persecution of evil men. And without really being conscious of it, none of us would probably say this. We get in touch with it when calamity happens. We kind of enter into a relationship with God saying this, let's make a deal, God. Here's the deal. I will kind of do this, and I will do that, and I will follow the formula. You just make sure my life goes good. And I have no pain, and the day of calamity never comes to me. That's the deal I signed on for. Well, if you signed on for that deal, and the day of calamity comes, you're in bad shape. You're going to be very confused. In addition to being very hurt. Everybody's going to get hurt. You get hurt with the day of calamity. Can't avoid that. Incredible confusion. If these are the things you believe, J.B. Phillips in his book, God, Our Contemporary, said this, we need to look no further than the recorded life of Jesus himself to see that even the most perfectly lived human life, his, does not automatically secure divine protection from evil and suffering. Evil and suffering were things that Jesus experienced, and he didn't experience them because he was unfaithful. Some are convinced in preaching from rather prominent pulpits these days that the reason all of this happened on September 11th was because we as a country have forfeited God's protection by our disobedience as a nation, and we need to repent. Believing that in our repentance we'll get the protection back. Now here's the deal about that. Number one, I believe we do need to repent. Indeed, that is precisely what has been at the heart of the current series we're involved in right now on money, sex, and power. But the assumption of that aforementioned statement is this, that if we do repent, we'll get back what we consider to be this guaranteed veil of God's protection. We think that if we repent, we're making a deal. Let's make a deal and let's get back to the deal we made in the beginning. And that was this, that if we do the right thing, bad things won't happen. If we believe the right way, calamity won't come. And whether you know it or not, I think what's at the core of that, what's at the core of that in me is some desire to control the evil day. I'd like to think I can control the day of calamity with my good behavior. Because if I behave enough, I'll keep it away. Or my right belief, if I believe enough, I'll be protected. Guaranteed. Well, if that's the formula you follow, if that's the way you think it works, I would just say be very careful. Because you could become horribly confused by and be ill-prepared for the evil day, the day of calamity when bad things do happen to good people. People like Stephen, who was stoned. I mean, if you have the formula that bad things don't happen to good people, and if we obey, there's this guarantee that... Where was I? bless her she's winning bless you I have no idea where I was if Stephen gets stoned and you have the paradigm that believing means you're protected you're very confused when Stephen gets stoned I mean what do you do with that people like James who was beheaded James was a good person Peter was crucified upside down he was a faithful to God person Paul was stoned and left for dead beaten times without number eventually killed if you've got this paradigm I'm talking about what did they do wrong? I've got this deep belief that I'm tenaciously hanging on to it's this I thought that if you loved God and lived to please him if you applied all his principles believed all his truth believed them enough You would, by that belief and by that good doing, be guaranteed by God health and wealth, protection and prosperity. Always be protected from any kind of harm. The frightening thing you're setting yourself up for is this. When harm comes, you are totally confused. See, this used to all make sense. I had it all figured out. I would do the good thing and if it doesn't go good I probably did something wrong so I'll just go fix the thing I did wrong okay I'm not protected again. But then the evil day comes and it doesn't make sense anymore. And people who think that way often have a very hard time standing firm in the evil day. Which brings me back to the question I'm pressing into today when the foundations are shaken not just what can the righteous do but what have they done? Men and women of faith in the past who have faced calamity and they have more, much more than many of us. How did they handle it? How did they react? So maybe we can do the same. Paul said the most amazing thing that probably is the goal of every authentic believer in 2 Timothy 4. He said this at the end of his life. Just imagine being able to say this. I have fought the fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. I mean, the Apostle Paul, who did all, at the end of his life, he didn't say, and I built 40 million churches and had this incredible worldwide influence. The fact is, he didn't know of all the things he did. What he said was, I kept the faith. In the middle of incredible calamity, I kept the faith. Here's my question, how'd he do it? In the middle of calamity, how'd he do it? More important, how do ordinary people do it? See, Paul is a superstar. I kind of expect Paul to keep the faith. After all, he's Paul. But how do ordinary, everyday people like you and me do it? Well, that question draws me to Acts chapter 8, a very intriguing story of some ordinary people. Let me set the scene. Stephen has just been stoned. As horrific as his stoning is, it quickly gets worse. Acts chapter 8, verse 1. for on that day what day? the day that he was stoned a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem led by Saul of Tarsus who began ravaging the church entering house after house dragging off men and women putting them in prison the word ravaging there speaks to brutal sadistic cruelty Acts 26 the converted Saul we know him as Paul confesses with remorse. When this was going on, I locked them in prison. When being put to death, I cast my vote against them. I punished them in the synagogue. I tried to force them to blaspheme God by torturing them, being furiously enraged at them. I kept pursuing them from city to city. Why did he pursue them from city to city? Here's why. Because when this persecution erupted in Jerusalem, these people ran for their lives to Judea and Samaria to city to city. It wasn't enough for Saul to just drive them out of their homes. He pursued them from city to city. And as they were scattered, having lost their homes, their security, their leadership, their friend named Stephen, I wonder if as they scattered, they wondered, God, what are you up to? You think they wondered that? God, I thought your agenda was to build the church. I heard you say to Peter, when we were all there, I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail. I don't get this because this doesn't look like the church being built. It looks like the church is being scattered. Are you there? Do you care? Do you think they wondered those things? Well, here's the deal. We don't know if they wondered those things. We don't know what they wondered. We only know what they did. chapter 8 verse 4 here's what they did therefore those who had been scattered went about preaching the word the word preaching there is it literally means good newsing put that in the verse therefore those who were scattered lost their homes, their friends their family connections went about good newsing I will never forget the first time I read that story and I look at these stories and I want to talk to people. You've heard me have these imaginary dialogues with Paul. I would love to have an imaginary dialogue with one of these people who gets scattered from their city and is good newsing. Here's my question. What on earth did you have to good news about? Seriously. I mean, they're going out, good newsing, maybe you have evangelistic crusades and all these people are coming and they're preaching. Good newsing. What do you think they said? I mean, they stood in front of them. Hey, everyone, we have no home. We've lost it all. Our friends are dead. You want to join? Well, once again, we don't know what they said. Well, actually, we do know what they said. Acts chapter 8, verse 5. Here's what they said. Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming an eternal kind of hope that's found in Christ alone. You see, you guys, these people said as they were scattered, maybe with tears streaming down their cheeks, our hope was never in that physical stuff anyway. And we are sad, and we are brokenhearted, and we are more than a little scared, but we are here to proclaim the hope we have for life and life eternal, and they proclaim Christ. And the multitudes were all from the smallest to the greatest with one accord giving attention to what Philip was saying. and maybe the reason they were giving attention was because they were wondering what I was wondering when I first read this story. What kind of people are these? Who even when the foundations are shaken can face and live life without fear and hang on to hope. Who even in the light of verse 3 which says Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, dragging off both men and women into prison. And even in the light of verse 3, they can do verse 4. They went about good newsing. Who are these people? You know, my dad was a pretty straight talker, and he would have little phrases that I remember enough, and they were quite salty, and I can't tell you all of them. But he found himself irritated a little bit with people, Christians. He loved them, but who would over-spiritualize everything. And it was like this way to never actually feel their feelings, never actually wade into anything painful, anything that happened that was negative. It was always this kind of silly grin on their face. Well, just pray the Lord. Just pray the Lord. Are you aware of what's going on? It was kind of in my dad. And what he would call them was cheerful idiots. They're cheerful idiots. It's okay. Go away. You're not any help. It's like you're in denial. So is that what they were? Were they cheerful idiots as they went good news? And you were just, I don't know. It's okay. well if they were I don't think people would have paid attention it says they paid attention I don't think they were in denial begin to wonder if they were different I wonder if they were different in significant ways ways that maybe we in the face of the calamity we're going through even as a nation right now need to go back to and listen to acknowledge and embrace if we hope to stand in this evil day the way they stood in their evil day when the foundations are shaken. Well, I think there were some differences. Difference number one, I do not believe that their paradigm of truth included the expectation that many of us have, indeed demand that many of us have, that if you're faithful and true, you won't have any calamity. I do not believe that they believed that the mark of God's love, the proof of his care, the sign of his power, was the guaranteed promise of financial prosperity and physical protection. For if they had believed that as their core value, they couldn't possibly have gone good-newsing. They couldn't possibly have stood firm in faith. Instead, I believe they would have likely gotten mired in one of two ways of thinking. when the evil day came that they believed could never come because they were doing it right and believing it right, their first reaction very possibly would have been, and they would have just gotten mired in this, something must be terribly wrong with me. You ever do that? You see, if God's promise is no calamity, at least no calamity if I obey Him and I believe Him the right way, and now I'm experiencing calamity, it must be because I didn't obey Him or I didn't believe him the right way. I must be outside of his promise. I must be outside of his will. I must be in sin. I didn't have enough faith. I must be defective because the thing I at the core believe is at the mark of his love, the proof of his care, the sign of his approval is everything goes well. Well, I don't think it's a bad thing if when calamity comes, you take an inventory of your life. I think that's a very good response, very appropriate, and begin to repent. I just would warn you to believe that because of your repentance you'll never have calamity again now you're going to be in trouble with your ability to handle calamity so start to repent you ever do this, you start to repent you really do, you do some things with God and some things that needed to be dealt with or dealt with because he got your attention with some pain that's a good thing but the pain doesn't go away I better repent some more okay, so you repent some more and you find something and you repent of that and now I can't find anything I make stuff up I'm sure I had a bad thought in there somewhere and that's why my day's going bad I get tired of that after a while that leads to the second thing that'll happen if you buy into this stuff after I get tired of believing that there's something radically wrong with me I begin to believe that there's something radically wrong with God he can't be trusted because my core belief was this if I loved God and lived to please him I'd never face the evil day and here's the evil day God doesn't keep his promises here's the deal beloved I do not believe that these early Christians who went good newsing after they got scattered believed that and here is why they didn't believe it because Jesus never promised it and because he never promised it they didn't expect it here's what he promised I will never ever leave you or forsake you. Not even in the evil day that will come. And if in the evil day you have a hard time believing that I'm with you and that is one of the greatest terrors of the evil day when we feel like God has somehow abandoned us and in our humanity we can't feel it. The word of the Lord is this. You can't hang on to me. I know that's terrifying. I promise you I will hang on to you. Especially in the evil day. And some of you right now who love God and are horribly disrupted by the horrible events, you should be disrupted. And you feel like you're not hanging on to God. Just know something. Even if you can't feel it, then maybe one day you'll be able to look back and see it. God is hanging on to you and He is hanging on to us. For nothing, nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, not even the evil day. Life can't do it. By the way, I don't think I'll ever be able to hear or respond to Romans 8 quite the same as I have before since I heard Lori Bunce in our worship last week go into this litany of what can't separate us from the love of God. Death can't do it. Demons can't do it. Things present, things to come. Height, depth. No created thing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus. That's what I promised. But in this world, you will have trouble, says the Lord. even I says the Lord was not exempt from the evil day what was his evil day? well the one day I can think of that was his evil day was the event of the cross but beloved this is where all of a sudden this whole talk begins to take a turn because it is precisely there in his evil day at the cross event that authentic hope begins to rise in the hearts of true believers because whatever else the cross of Jesus Christ says, it eternally says this, what I said last week. Number one, evil is real, and evil has real power to do real damage. Look at the cross. If any place says that evil is real, the cross says that, and it has real power. As those nails went in his hands to do real damage. But the cross also says this, evil is not from God. Satan is the author of evil. and he has come. Satan's job, his agenda is to steal and kill and destroy the agenda of God and the mission of Christ was to walk right into that evil, feel the first full force of that evil on the cross. I have come, says Jesus, to destroy the works of evil. The cross of Jesus Christ says, number one, evil is real. That's why this cross is necessary. Number two, evil is not from God. And number three, what the cross of Jesus Christ says is evil does not ever, ever, ever, ever win. Never, never, ever. For as Jesus went into and through the cross event, he came out the other side alive saying, because I live, so will you. So even if you die, you will live. So even if you lose, you will win. So even in the evil day, you can have authentic hope and you can have eternal hope, which leads to the second thing I think these early believers had that enabled them to be good-newsing. Even in the evil day, they had an eternal perspective. They weren't in denial. They saw the calamity. They felt the shock and grief and horror and fear, and they woke up in the morning the same way you and I have been waking up in the morning these last 11, 12 days since September 11th, with a sick feeling in our stomach that won't go away all day long. They saw reality, and they felt the pain of it, but they saw more. Beloved, we need to see more. I think Paul said it best in 2 Corinthians 4. right in the middle of great personal loss and pain, he says this, verse 8. We are afflicted. I'm not denying that. And I don't like that. And it hurts a lot, but we are not crushed. I am perplexed. I am confused. I take, by the way, great encouragement from that. It helps me to know that Paul, the great leader guy, got confused because I get confused. but not despairing, and persecuted, but not forsaken, struck down, but not destroyed. Why? How? Well, if we were interviewing Paul right now, I think he would say, well, actually, there's a couple reasons. Number one, I really didn't expect it to be any different, to tell you the truth. It's not that I don't enjoy life. In fact, I am committed. I think Paul would say, I'll tell you, hang around me. I'm a person who just sucks the barrel, the marrow, the barrel, the marrow right out of the bone. I love life, but in terms of the whole of life, I didn't expect it to be any different than this. He says that in verse 11. For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So that in how we handle this calamity, people might see Christ. And if they see Christ, verse 12, then the death that's working in me, meaning this death that's breaking down my body and will eventually result in my death, will mean life to some other people because in my dying and my faithfulness to God in the middle of my dying, people got to see Christ and they were drawn to a life that speaks to life beyond this life. Second thing I think he'd say is, I knew something, you guys. I knew something. This is how I was afflicted but not crushed. He says in verse 14, here's what I know. I know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him and will present us with you. Therefore, we do not lose heart. for though our outer man is decaying yet our inner man is being renewed day by day indeed this momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison so quit thinking or quit focusing rather on things which are seen as if those things you see have the final say as to what is true but begin to dial into and be aware of what is unseen for the things which are seen and the painful things that are real are real but they are temporary. The things however which are unseen are also real but the distinction between the unseen and the seen is that the unseen realities are eternal. Paul is saying in that passage I see and I feel the physical reality and the pain of the calamity I just see more and that is why I am afflicted but not crushed, perplexed but not despairing. I have an eternal perspective. This life is not all there is to life, which when believed, frees me up to live without fear, to stand firm in faith, even in the evil day. In chapter 5 of 2 Corinthians, Paul goes on to speak of this same theme. And without comment, I just want to read about It's six verses. And let the word of God. There's some little odd little phrases in here you might not get, but the weight of this is strong. Just hear the word of the Lord. Paul's speaking. For we know that if this early earthly tent, this physical body which is our house is torn down, that is if we die, we have a building from God. That's the truth about us, folks. A house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For indeed in this house, this body, we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven, which is our real home, inasmuch as we, having put it on, shall not be found naked. For indeed, while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed, but to be clothed, in order that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. Now he who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge. Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord, for we walk by faith, not by sight. We are of good courage, even in the day of calamity. So last Wednesday we were at our staff meeting talking about this stuff, and Tom Johnson brought up something he had been talking about with some other people at some other time, saying this, you know, we talked about the fact that we would do well from time to time to see our life as a short-term missions trip. And one of the reasons that clicked for me was because, you know, when Paul talks about these momentary light afflictions, you know, what do you think the momentary light affliction is? You think, well, is it 15 minutes? Well, I could do 15 minutes. Is it a day? I could do a day. A week? A month? Ah! The momentary light affliction, if you keep it in the context of what he's talking about, because he's talking about eternity, the momentary light affliction is life. So the momentary light, it's just one life long. We have to do this. Now I'll put this little paradigm of life being a short-term missions trip. I thought about that. You know, Steve Hansen, who is our missions pastor here, prepares people for a missions trip. Among the first things he does is he talks to them about their expectations for the trip. And among the things he says to them about their expectations is this. You need to know right up front that this trip, while it's going to be wonderful, at the same day, it won't be easy. There will be hardship. You need to know you're not at home. And while I need to prepare you for some trouble that could happen and some discomfort that might be significant, I want you, it's not all gloom and doom. You're going to have the time of your life. Rich friendships, deep workings of God, you'll probably never be the same. But you need to keep in mind that you're not home. You need to keep in mind that we're going down there to do something. And what we need to do when we get there is we need to listen to God. We need to learn from people. And then we need to give ourselves away. That's what we do on this short term. And you know what? You're going to do it at even a higher level. That's why we're here. But always remember the whole time for two weeks, just for two weeks, just this momentary thing, you need to remember you're not at home. and you're not going to be home until you're home so don't expect this to feel like home but one day you will be home and when you are you will fully grasp it was hard to grasp the first week of the trip the first week of the trip you're going I'm never going to get home this is going to last forever but when you finally are home you will grasp and experience that this momentary light affliction of that two week trip was producing for you an eternal weight of glory fire beyond comparison. So quit focusing entirely on what you see. Begin to dial into and be aware of the things you don't see. For the things which are seen, though they're real, are temporary. And the things which are unseen are not only real, but they are eternal. I pastored a church before I pastored here at Open Door, just about for four years while I was attending seminary in the Chicago area. when Tom talked about this life being a short-term mission trip, it was the strangest thing because I had this memory of something that got built into me spiritually in that first church. It was a pretty small church, and friends that we really connected with as couples were hard to come by, and we came up with three or four very, very good friends, couples that we're still very close to and hold dear. One couple in particular, however, that we had connected with real quickly at a very deep level, mostly because the guy laughed at all my jokes, which is, you know, I let you, you're my friend too, just right there, where they were having to move away. And these are people that you just felt this incredible soul connection to. And again, the sense that there weren't many people like this and he was moving away. And I'll never forget the day they left. He had to go to Connecticut. He was a doctor. He had finished his internship. And so he was going back to where he had always planned to be. And even people like that in a church that was so small, you needed people like this who were spiritually minded and were, you know, willing to take some risks and things. And so it just felt like a weighty thing, even in the church. And as he was leaving and we were hugging each other and tears were streaming down our cheeks, I looked him in the eyes and this thought came to me. I said, you know what? We got a job to do. He said, I said, you're supposed to go there. God is calling you there and I'm supposed to be here I know from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head that I'm called to do this thing. And so you go and you man your post, and I'm going to man my post. We've got all eternity to goof around. And I've had people come in and out of my life ever since like that. In fact, it's not even about people coming in and out of my life. It's about even the finiteness of this human body that can't get to you and you and you and you. Do you know how many best friends I got in this room? You know, you ever get a feeling if you see somebody across the room and I'd go, I'd hang with that person. And this is going to sell me, but I don't have time. Because I'm at my post and they're at their post. And we got all eternity. And we are here to give it away. And man your post. I had a buddy come up to me after the first service. He said, I really like that thing about goofing around in heaven. Because he likes to goof around. and he said he kind of made it sound like he can't goof around now and I said oh man I'm telling you what this frees you up to live your life in my term to suck the marrow from the bone of life but to realize that this life is not all there is to life and I'm here to man my post and give it away and we got all eternity to goof around and beloved mentalities like that is how people throughout history when the foundations are shaken stand firm in faith even in the evil day. Maybe if you forget everything I said it's this analogy of a short-term missions trip. Beloved, it's a short-term missions trip we're on. And we're not home. And it won't feel completely like home until we're home. So like a father would say to his son at a critical time in his life or a daughter at a critical time in her life when they need some straight talk that's laced with love, I look you in the eye this morning and I say, quit expecting it and quit demanding that it feel like home because this ain't home. But one day we will be home. And on that day, this momentary light affliction will not be worthy to be compared to the eternal weight of glory that was being built up for us in this life. It will be worth it all. And that is why, though afflicted, we are not crushed. Though confused, we are not despairing. For though we, God's people, see calamity and feel it deeply, we see more. And all God's people said, Amen. Let's stand and be dismissed in prayer. Father my prayer at the end of this word is the same as it was at the beginning it's this that by the power of your spirit through the wonder of your word and the example in the word of men and women of faith who went on good newsing in the middle of calamity that you would use all this to shepherd your sheep in this dark and dangerous time. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
