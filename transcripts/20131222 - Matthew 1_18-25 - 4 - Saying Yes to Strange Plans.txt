His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, But before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet. The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Emmanuel, which means God with us. When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took Mary home as his wife. But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus. Church of the Open Door, this is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Well, whatever else that story is, revolutionary, amazing. Whatever else it is, it's also really, really strange. Isn't it? So Joseph is engaged to Mary. They're registered at Target and Pottery Barn. They're looking forward to a great life together. And then Mary finds out she's pregnant. 14 years old, probably. And I don't know what the first word that maybe came into her mind was or what the first thought that came into her mind was when the angel visited her and said, don't worry, don't be afraid, but you are going to bear the Messiah. You're going to carry him in your womb for 40 weeks and then you're going to give birth to the Messiah in the world. I don't know what the first thing she thought about was, but one of the things she thought about was, I am going to have to at some point tell my fiance about this. And then be Joseph for a second. You know, he had a great plan. He was going to marry the love of his life. Marry. Thank you, Al. He was probably at work building a top story onto his father's house so that they could live there. He was looking forward to their life together. And then he found out this news that she was pregnant. And, you know, we kind of say, yeah, totally. I mean, you know, that's God and that's the way God works. And, yeah, it's so great. I mean, you know, so, Joseph, you've got to catch up to this idea. But for Joseph, it was game over. I mean, it was my fianc√© is pregnant. And I don't know what happened other than I know that it wasn't me. And be Joseph for a second and feel the anxiety and sadness. And the fact that he had this great plan for his life. He was a carpenter. He had a little money saved away. He had a plan to build a life together with Mary. And then he was visited by an angel. And that's, I mean, so we got Mary visited by an angel. Joseph visited by an angel. This story is getting crazier and crazier. And the angel says to Joseph, don't freak out. Don't divorce Mary, as the law requires you to do. Marry her, because she's carrying the Messiah. He's going to save the world from their sins. So I want you to name him Jesus. And then in the text, it says that in the morning when he woke up, so my question is, who falls asleep after that? Joseph had a good plan for his life and then he even had a good plan after he found out Mary was pregnant and the good plan was I'm a man of the law I'm going to follow the law because I don't want to disgrace my family or God by marrying this woman who so obviously betrayed me but I love her so I'm going to do it quietly that was a good plan too now we think oh there's a tale that's horrible I mean who would do that but that was exactly what a person that was following the law of God would do in the first century. It was a good plan. And an angel comes and says, hey, Joseph, you know those good plans that you're holding on to? I want you to let those go. Let them go. Because I have a better plan. So whatever else the story tells us, it asks us a question. And the question is, what do you do when God invites you to let go of good plans in order to embrace God's plans? What do we do when we need to let go of good plans? I'm not even talking about terrible, horribly ill-conceived, sin-riddled plans. I'm talking about good plans, plans that make sense, plans that everyone else has come around you and said, yes, I think you should do that. I think that's a great idea. Go for it. What do we do when we're invited by God to let go of those plans? Well, I think we go through a number of things. Number one, I think, what goes through our mind is people are going to think I'm crazy. Have you been there? People are going to think I'm totally crazy. people must have thought Joseph was totally crazy or the father of the baby or whatever else I think another thing we think is we're terrified because our good plans had a little security in them usually that's why we call them good plans because they're going to work they're going to bring some money they're going to bring that relationship in they're going to work and they're going to be according to what I want to do so we get a little afraid because if I let go of my good plan in order to grab onto a different plan that God has it might result in far less security for me so we're afraid and number three we have no idea how it's going to turn out and so many times I think as we're Christians especially like you're moving toward a plan that you think is God's inviting you toward. And then the question that most Christians ask each other is this, well, do you feel peace? Which is a good question, I think, except for is that the mark of whether or not you should do it? If you feel peace. What does that even mean? Did Joseph feel peace as he got up the next morning and marched toward Mary to tell her, hey, honey, we're going to get married anyway. Did he feel peace? Did he skip his way to that meeting? Or was it more like you and me where we're like, okay, okay, I donno how this is gonna work. I donno what people are gonna say. I guess I'm gonna go to her house. No, I'm not gonna go to her house. Forget it. There's no way I'm going to her house. I gotta go. I gotta tell her. No, there's no way. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. I'm doing it. Because I want what God wants. May your will be done. That was Joseph's heart. So he embraced God's alternate plan, which included marrying this pregnant woman, no matter what it looked like, which including naming his son Salvation and raising the Messiah. What does a carpenter feel like when he gets given that assignment? I'm totally qualified for that job and then oh by the way Joseph don't have sex with your wife for the first year of your marriage go for that that might have been the hardest thing in this whole bargain for Joseph but then as you read Matthew chapter 1 and if you have your Bibles I just want you to turn there for a second we just read starting in verse 18 of Matthew 1 but the first 17 verses of Matthew chapter 1 are verses that we never read because they're totally boring because they're a genealogy, right? We always skip over the genealogies because why would we do that, right? I mean, they're totally ridiculous. I mean, they're just a word and so-and-so begat so-and-so so-and-so begat so-and-so okay, how do I Google search begat and see what that means? I don't even know. And then we start reading some of the names, right? Matthew chapter 1 verse 3 Judah, the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar. Now, anyone remember who Tamar was? This is the genealogy of Jesus, by the way. Tamar was the woman who was married to a man named Onan, who practiced a very cruel form of birth control, which didn't allow her to get pregnant. He died, and then Judah's third son was supposed to marry Tamar, but he wouldn't. and so she's in this unenviable position of needing to carry on the family line, her family line and so she dresses up like a prostitute and seduces Judah, her father-in-law, who sleeps with her and she bears twins. One of those twins is in the line of Jesus. So that's a pretty strange plan. Amen? I mean, that's a little awkward. That's in my genealogy. Church of the Broken Wreath. Right there in Matthew chapter 1. I'm not making this up. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Who would write this down? If you wanted to say, hey, this is the King of Kings, Lord of Lords. Verse 5, Salmon. You love that name. Salmon. very healthy fish also the father of Boaz remember Boaz and Ruth you know that's a very famous story but Boaz's mother was Rahab and Boaz was the father of Obed his mother was Ruth Obed the father of Jesse the father of David King David but Rahab remember Rahab? if you study the scriptures in Joshua when they're spying out the children of Israel are spying out the land the city of Jericho they send in some spies and Rahab was a prostitute. Awesome. Who hid the spies in her house so that they wouldn't be killed by the rest of the Canaanites. And that woman's name is listed in Hebrews chapter 11 alongside the other heroes of the faith who simply lived their actual lives in an unending chorus of yeses to God. she is in the genealogy of Jesus who would put that in their genealogy who would plan that verse 6 Jesse the father of King David David the father of Solomon whose mother had been Uriah's wife David and Bathsheba we know that story I don't need to share it again but that story resulted in a son whose name is Solomon who is in the line of Jesus. So Jesus has in his line those crazy, amazing stories because God somehow, for some reason, loves to dream up crazy capers to get God's work done. You think about Abraham and Sarai when they were old. They were 75 or 80 years old and God comes to them and says, hey, by the way, you're going to be the mother and father of my new people. The first plan kind of went south. Remember Noah's Ark, that whole deal? So my new plan is going to build a people to bless the world. You're going to be the mother and father. To which Sarah, Sarai, does what? Laughs. That is hilarious, God. That a couple of people that are well past the childbearing years would have a son that would be God's children to bless the world. And then they're sent off to a land they do not know. Be 80 years old. Oh yeah, you're going to go to a land you don't know. Just go. To a land I will show you. You like that invitation? I usually like that to be, you're going to go to this land that has a location with a GPS that I can GPS it and know exactly the route that I will take. Just leave your house and I'll let you know. Moses grows up in the palace under Pharaoh kills a guy ends up in the desert for 40 years and sees a bush burning and that's the rest of his life right? you're going to lead God's people out of slavery David gets anointed king David the runt of the litter gets anointed king but before he gets to be king he gets to spend 10 years in a cave, which is exactly the route I would pick. Esther, beautiful woman who for such a time as this was called upon not because of her beauty, but because of the strength of her character to save an entire civilization of people from slaughter. So what does it mean to let go of your good plans in order to embrace a plan when God visits you and says, I have a different idea? What kind of courage is required to say yes to that plan even when you're totally freaked out? It doesn't make any sense. And even when it's not the thing that you choose to do, what does it mean to be the kind of person that wakes up the next morning and says, well, whatever else I am doing with my one and only beautiful life, I am saying yes to God because it's not all about me. So I have a friend. His name is Kurt Vickman. And Kurt for years was the lead pastor of a little church called the Upper Room Community. Many of you have heard of Upper Room. And many of you have heard of Kurt. Kurt has preached here a couple times from our pulpit. And Kurt was the lead pastor of Upper Room. and he was looking for a different place for Up Room to meet because they weren't fitting in the current location. So he was on Craigslist looking for churches to buy. Like you do. Until he visited this one church in South Minneapolis, and he sees the sign that says Food Pantry. And he's like, oh, that's interesting. And it leads to this tiny little closet with a couple of stacks of lima beans and other gross food that no one else would want to eat. And in that moment, he stops. and he goes, that's not right. The people who are hungry would be showed to this little tiny closet. I mean, that's not enough, number one. Number two, no one wants to eat lima beans. And so that just sticks in his mind and his vision is born. What if we created a grocery store where people who were hungry could shop with dignity, where other people who had a little extra could give some money so that people in need could shop and get healthy food. Well, long story short, that little moment, in that little moment, Kurt was invited to let go of his plans to be lead pastor of Upper Room Community Church and start a whole new deal called the Minneapolis Market, who you just gave sponsored 50 families so they could shop there. I visited Kurt on Friday morning. He showed me the space. It's amazing, you guys. What kind of courage is required for you to let go of a plan that made a lot of sense in order to embrace a plan that maybe makes no sense? A plan that you're afraid of. A plan that maybe some people would go, I don't know what you're thinking. Well, I think this kind of thing has to get practical or else we'll never do it. Like if this sermon ended in, so be that kind of person. Woo! Be courageous. Questions come up for me. Okay, when I'm visited by God, how do I know it's God? How do I know it's not pizza that I had the night before? Or my own idea? I mean, I got lots of ideas. Doesn't mean they're from God. How do I know? How do I know? I'm not just bailing on something I need to stick with. How do I know? So getting super practical. How do you be an actual person who becomes a hero by saying yes to God's strange plans? How do you do that? How do you move into that? Well, here's suggestion number one, right? Number one, make good plans. Don't be that person that just goes, well, it doesn't matter. I know I have a family of five, but I don't care. I'm just doing it. I'm just being led in the moment. No, you're not. That's being irresponsible. Make a plan. Make a good plan. Gather people around you so that this plan might have some wisdom beyond yourself in it. Joseph had a good plan. He was building that house and moving toward Mary. Have a good plan. Make good plans. Make plans that make sense, that are rooted in wisdom, that are rooted in other people's ideas, not just your own. Make good plans. But second suggestion, this is when wreaths start to break down, be open to messengers which might change the plan. be open to messengers which might change the plan Kurt Vickman at the end of the day was standing in that little church in south Minneapolis looking at that little sign called food pantry and there was at least something in his mind that said I am open to a change in the trajectory of my life I'm open to it when Joseph in Matthew 1 20 21 I'm going read to you again. But after he had considered divorcing Mary quietly, after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, Joseph, son of David. Joseph, son of David. Joseph, son of the king. Joseph, remember who you are. Joseph, remember where you've come from. Joseph, remember it's not just about you and your story. You're a part of a much bigger story. Joseph, son of David. Don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because what's conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She's going to give birth to a son, and you're going to give him the name Jesus, because he will save people from their sins. Be in that room on that night, where you get visited by a messenger from God. And that's what the word angel means agalos in the Greek. It just means a messenger. It means an envoy. It means one who is sent. Because I think some of you are like, well, angels, I mean, that's awesome. Because in the first century, clearly people were visited by actual angels with light shooting from their nostrils that they could actually see and actually hear. You know, for me, I mean, it's just like this nudge I feel in my spirit. So, I mean, I would totally do it maybe if an angel visited me that I could see and hear. Well, I don't, maybe some of you have seen and heard an actual angel. I have not. But I do believe that God comes in messages and messengers many, many times a day to each of us. Messages and messengers. And I do not believe God wants to make it so, so complicated for you. Like the more spiritual you are, the more of a puzzle it will be. Where God comes to you in a dream, but God is speaking Latin. And that's how you know, because it's super mysterious. Now I think it's a story to be lived out, and we live it out imperfectly. We grab the piece of it that we can grab. We grab it knowing that we're going to grab it imperfectly, knowing that we're going to understand it imperfectly, you know, knowing that our yes is going to be at best 81% of a yes. And God goes, I'll deal with that. I'll go with that. I love that. Yep, I'm doing that. I'm moving toward that. I'm moving toward 81%. I'm moving toward imperfection because I'm moving toward you and I'm moving toward the world. And I want to invite you into my plan of saving the world. That's what I'm inviting you into, Church of the Open Door. Message from God. Sozo, the word that's translated to save in Matthew chapter 1 verse 21 means to save, to keep safe and sound, to rescue from danger or destruction, to save a suffering one, to preserve one who is in danger of destruction. You know what God's father heart, you know what God's mother heart wants to do with the world? You know how God's father heart and God's mother heart does when God sees God's world suffering and in agony? What does God do? God's heart breaks. Who is Christ's body in the world, gang? It is us. We're not Jesus. We're not going to save the world of ourselves. But the mystery of the gospel is Christ in us. We are the carriers of Emmanuel, God with us. God longs to be born in the world again and again through you. God is conceiving crazy, strange, bizarre, beautiful ways to send God's Son to suffering people. And many times he's tapping you on the shoulder and he's saying, man, you got some great plans and I love them, but I'm asking you, Are you willing to let them go so that another pocket of people might be saved in the world? What kind of person has the courage to let go of their good plans and embrace the strange plans of God? Now again, caveat, not all messengers or messages are from God. Sometimes it really is the pizza. Sometimes it really is just your stupid idea that you need to lay out in front of someone else and go, is this stupid? And someone else sometimes might need to say, yep, it's absolutely stupid. All right, cool. Not from God. So get wise counsel. Talk to people about it. Don't say, thus saith the Lord. Say, I don't know what just happened. I feel like God may have just sent me a message in order to do something. It feels totally crazy and totally bizarre. I don't know that I want to do it, but all I know is I know that I need to think about it. Because I do care about moving out toward God's world, which needs to be rescued from danger and destruction. I do want to be a part of that plan. So if you want to be an ordinary, actual person who actually exists in this crazy actual universe who says yes to God's plan. Number one, make a good plan. Number two, be open to that plan changing. But number three, say yes before you know how it's all gonna turn out. You know, that's the worst, right? I mean, that would have been a great time to just say, let's pray together. I wanna know how it's gonna turn out. I want the insurance policy. I want to know that it's going to be an even better plan than my plan, which would result in me being even more secure than I would have been in my old plan. But it seems like, according to this story, Matthew 1, 24 and 25, when Joseph woke up, again, how he fell asleep, I have no idea. He really did have peace. He did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him to do. I love that. He just said yes. He took Mary home as his wife, and he did not consummate their marriage until after she gave birth to a son. And then he gave that son the name Yeshua, which means salvation. And he held salvation in his arms. And I wonder sometimes if when he was holding that little baby in his arms, if he wasn't thinking, man, I almost missed it. I almost missed it. What does it mean to let go of your good plans and to embrace the sometimes crazy, strange, bizarre, beautiful, redemptive plans of God? What would you need if you wanted to be that kind of person? Well, I don't know if you get peace when you move toward a crazy plan. I don't know what that looks like. I mean, I don't know what it looks like just to be like, whoo, now I'm going to this crazy plan, which may totally wreck my life, and I'm going to feel peace. What I do know that I need when I'm moving toward a plan like that is the promise of Emmanuel. I need the promise that God, now even if this ship totally sinks, you are with me. God with us. When Joshua was given the assignment to lead the children of Israel into the promised land because Moses was dead, God visits Joshua and in no less than four times in nine verses says these words to Joshua. Joshua, Yeshua, be strong and very courageous. Be strong and courageous. Yeshua, be strong and very courageous. But you need to know this as you're being strong and very courageous. I will give you every place you put your foot. I'll be there. Even if it feels like that crazy Indiana Jones movie, remember where that, where he's like stepping out into nothing and then there, oh, there's a footstep again, there's a foothold again. I'm stepping out into nothing. Oh my gosh, there's a foothold again. God is saying, I am the foothold in front of you. And when I invite my people to do my work, I promise you I will give you every place you put your foot because I am the God that is with you. Amen. Some of you are in moments of letting go of good plans. Some of you are in moments of grabbing on to really, really lunatic plans of God. And if you are in that camp, what I want to say to you is this. You are in a long line of heroes of the faith that wake up in the morning and simply say yes. I don't know how this is going to turn out. I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know if this thing is going to turn out good or bad. But when you say yes, you just join yourself to a long line of heroes. So the question is, with your one and only beautiful life, what do you want to do? What do you want to do with your one beautiful life? Would you stand? I want to pray a benediction over you. A benediction is something you receive from God. It's not something you do for God. So here's the benediction. as you walk out of this room and into your actual life, into the adventures that may await you, as you move toward letting go of good plans, may you feel and may you know the presence of the one and only living God who will lead you toward life everlasting. Amen. Amen. Amen.
