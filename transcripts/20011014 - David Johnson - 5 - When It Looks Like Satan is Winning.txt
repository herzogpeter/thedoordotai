It's an incredible song as it stands by itself, but it fits into the word of the morning as well and to the mood of the day. So let's pray as we go to the word this morning. Father, I pray by the power of your spirit that through the word today and through the spirit of that song we just heard, you would continue to stir in us and build in us the kind of faith your people need when the foundations have been shaken. I pray that in Jesus' name, amen. If everything goes according to plan, we will next week return to the series of sermons we were involved in for some time on money, sex, and power. But today, just one more week, dealing with these events that began September 11th and have rippled out in a variety of mind-numbing ways since. Events that got us wondering some weeks ago with the psalmist in Psalm 11 what the righteous might do when the foundations are shaken, when it looks like Satan's winning. How do we as God's people maintain our balance when the pendulum of life swings radically from one circumstance in life where things seem to be going well, to another circumstance in life where things seem to be unraveling. This pendulum swing of life, sometimes happening at blinding speed, sometimes happening on a global level, like the events with which we're dealing now. Sometimes, however, this swing of the pendulum happens on a personal level. Whether it's global or personal, this pendulum swing works like this. One day, life is going pretty much according to plan. You've got your share of problems, but everybody does. It's nothing you can't handle. When something unexpected hits, something unforeseen that you couldn't prepare for arrives. And from that moment on, everything is different. Now, on September 11th, that something unexpected, as we all know, was a terrorist attack. And it affected us all. It was national. It was global. And we even got some comfort from the fact that when it's that big, we're kind of all in this thing together. But on a personal level, these things happen as well. And they happen every day. Maybe not to you. Maybe not today. but to someone, somewhere, something unexpected, something unforeseen. In fact, the truth is this, that probably tomorrow morning, someone, somewhere is going to find out that the job they thought they had, they don't. That the financial security they thought they had, they don't. Sadly, some people are going to find out, maybe this afternoon, that the marriage they thought they had, they don't. That the health they thought they had, they don't. For something unexpected, something unforeseen, they couldn't prepare for, comes on the scene and everything is different. And life, as you know, it seems to be unraveling. Among the things that we find most maddening about situations like that that seem to alter the course of our life, especially when we're on the front end of them, is this. That we didn't do anything different today. than we did yesterday. The sand underneath our feet just shifted. The pendulum of life just swung from one eventuality to another. Yesterday, the answers were obvious. Directions were clear. The outlook was hopeful. Today, because of the shifting of the sand, because of the swinging of the pendulum of life, life feels like a hopeless riddle. no matter how creatively you play with the numbers, whether you add them or subtract them, multiply them or divide them, no matter how positively you try to look at this situation in a positive way, it seems to always come up the same. At least right now, at least today, in the swinging of the pendulum, it feels like there's more darkness than light, more evil than good, more hatred than love, more sickness than health, more questions than answers. And among the questions that plague at times like this and frighten at times like this is this question. We've kind of been dealing with for several weeks. What do you do when it looks like evil is winning? What do you do when it looks like the good guys are outnumbered? More evil than good. More hatred than love. More darkness than lights. Well, we have been kind of dealing with that question for this being the fifth week. today to grapple with it a little bit more, I'd like to examine an incident in the life of God's people found in Acts chapter 12 where it did indeed, at least for a while, look like the bad guys were winning, more evil than good. Open your Bibles if you have them with me to Acts, the 12th chapter. Begin with the first five verses just to kind of get us into the story and see what it is that's going on and how the pendulum of life for them began to swing in a real negative way. It starts in verse 1 with these words. About that time, Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to mistreat them. And he had James, the brother of John, put to death with a sword. Literally there, he was beheaded. And that was something unexpected, something unforeseen. The pendulum of life for these believers is swinging wildly into the negative. But it was only going to get worse. For when Herod saw that this beheading of James pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. And when, verse 4, and when he had seized Peter, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring Peter out before the people, having him executed as well. So here's the situation, verse 5. Peter was in prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church of God. Well, what we see there at first glance, obviously, clearly seems to be more evil than good, more reason for despair than hope. It certainly looks to me like the good guys are outnumbered. Looks like evil is having its way, for James is dead, Peter is next, Herod is powerful, cunning and evil, a kind of first century Osama bin Laden. It says in verse 5 that the church, in response to this, gathered to pray. Fervently, it says, they prayed. The word in the Greek is a very colorful word and kind of really brings with it some deeper understanding and can pictures in our minds. It's actually a medical term. it's ectenes is the word and speaks to the excessive stretching of a muscle. I mean, think of praying that way in such a way that it would be best pictured by the stretching of a muscle. Their prayer, given these circumstances, was stretched to the limit. It was strained prayer. It was feverish, intense prayer. It's just a guess on my part, but as I try to put myself into this seen, I would expect that there were probably not a lot of pious, pontificating kinds of prayers going on, not a lot of flowery, thee and thou speeches going on. More likely, I would expect some pretty real speech, some pretty anguished, earthy language entirely possible that in a context like this where somebody you know like James has just been killed, Peter's next, we're just this little group here praying that some so overwhelmed by these circumstances, couldn't speak at all. Have you ever been in a situation praying like that? No words at all. With groanings too deep for words, you're trusting the Holy Spirit could somehow take your heart expression and translate your silence into prayer. In verse 12, it indicates that many had gathered to pray. As I look at that verse and the situation, the truth is it couldn't have been that many because verse 12 also indicates that they met at Mary's house. So how many do you suppose they got in Mary's house? 20? Maybe 30? Not very intimidating. You see, the many weren't that many. They were clearly outnumbered. They were very much alone. So this little group of believers praying for Peter, stunned by the events surrounding James, afraid of Herod, gathered to do the only thing they knew to do, they gathered together to pray. They knew they couldn't beat Herod with a sword. His sword was bigger and sharper than theirs, and he had many more of them than they did. So they entered into the power that belongs only to God. They prayed. And as I invite you to put yourself in this room with them, and as I did the same this week, just thinking about this prayer time, I'm quite convinced that as they prayed, some of them were full of faith. I'm also quite convinced that some of them were full of fear. I'm also quite convinced that some of them were full of faith and fear. Indeed, I'm quite convinced that this prayer meeting in Acts chapter 12 felt an awful lot like a prayer meeting we had here at Open Door, September 11th. And subsequent prayer meetings just about every day around this whole city, September 11th. None of us will ever forget that day, watching TV, however it was you heard, you'll never forget it. I'll also never forget that as we as a staff and as a church tried to grapple with the beyond belief news that was seemingly getting worse and worse and worse every moment of that day, the only thing we knew to do that day was gather to pray, let's throw open the doors, we have no planned program, let's just pray. I'll never forget that prayer meeting. I never will, And neither will you if you were there. And if you weren't at that one, you were in probably some other prayer meeting, not just that day, but for several days to come. And what I remember, among other things about that prayer time, was this, that in that room, people were full of faith. And other people were full of fear. And other people were full of faith and fear and wondered how they could both be there together, but they were. With all the faith and with all the fear all mixed together, they still prayed. What do you think they prayed about? I don't think it takes wild guesses. I think we can imagine this event. It feels very fresh to me and to us. I'm sure they prayed for Peter. That was revealed in the text. In verse 5 they prayed fervently for him. And I can just imagine that as they gathered recognizing that the same fate that landed on James could land on Peter. Oh, God, be with our friend. That he might know he's not alone. We don't know if he's going to live or die, but we pray, Father, that the truth that Peter spoke to us as one of our shepherds about your presence being available in the darkest of days, we pray that as he's in this prison now by himself, that he would know that truth for himself. You think they prayed that way for him? I bet they did. Protect his heart, Father, for inward peace that passes understanding, we pray. And then I think as they prayed, they might have even welled up with faith. And maybe a couple had more faith than others for deliverance, and some with boldness and loud voice began to pray for deliverance. Good for them. God, deliver him. Stretch forth your hand to move on his behalf and intervene against this evil, they prayed. And they should pray that way. I wonder if they prayed for the soldiers I wonder if anybody in the group thought you know you know not everybody thought of it but maybe one person said you know let's pray for the soldiers I wonder if anybody had the gall you know the kind of this is going to go against the grain spirit to say you know I think we should pray for Herod and I wonder if that idea was brought up in the prayer meeting somebody else I wonder if there was somebody else in that prayer meeting, kind of a smart-alecky person, somebody like maybe me, who would hear the desire to pray for Herod and say, yeah, I'll pray. Yeah, I pray for Herod. I got your prayer right here, Herod. Lord, that thing about fire from heaven boils all over. It would be good right now in Jesus' name and everything that would rise up humanly around how you'd want to pray for Herod right now would rise to the top. And I wonder if someone else would gently, lovingly come around, the people like me, and say, yeah, I know how you feel. That's how I feel. But the Master said to us, pray for your enemies. And we would all confess together, I don't know how to pray for our enemy right now. I don't know how to do that. And we would all say together, we don't know either. And it's going to sound even rote. It's going to sound like we're just going through the motions, but we're going to do it. You told us to do this, Father. So we pray for Herod. We pray that you turn his heart. We pray that conviction would come upon him. I've been with people who've prayed for Osama bin Laden. Is that a weird feeling or what? Is that the right thing to do? Yeah. Is anything going to happen? You think he's going to become a Christian? I was about to say weirder things have happened. I don't know if anything weirder than that has ever happened. I do know that the Christians had to be pretty freaked out when a guy named Saul became a believer. Most of them didn't believe it. By the way, Herod's not going to become a Christian. The judgment of God's going to fall on him. We're going to see that in a little bit. There's judgment, there's grace, how they go together. That's not my job to sort out. I think some people prayed for Herod. I'm pretty sure they prayed for themselves. Again, this is all being drawn in my own mind from this September 11th. This story fits so well for where we are right now. As we gathered in that crystal building, and again, in subsequent prayer meetings following, and in times I've had, and you've, I'm sure, had alone, to bring your fear to God, to pray for protection, to pray for our future. I wonder if when they gathered in that room, they prayed for their children. Were you here? Many of you were here the Sunday after the events of September 11th. And basically, I had a word, but we took a big chunk of our time that Sunday morning to pray for a number of things. And you remember one of the primary things we prayed for? We prayed for who? Our children. Remember that? There was something in us that just rose up and said, God, protect their hearts. Keep them from fear. Lord, the future. They are the future. And we instinctively, do you think these people prayed for their children? Can't you hear them doing it? God, be with our kids who don't understand this, who don't need this, who don't deserve this. This isn't fair. Come around our children. These people are no different than us. I wonder if at some point in the course of prayer, they were praying for Peter and praying for Herod stumblingly and praying for their children and for themselves. I wonder if anybody in the group just kind of, it just kind of rolls up in them like it does in these prayer meetings to pray for John. John, who John? Remember John in verse 2 of this story? James, the brother of John, was beheaded. And I wonder if in the context of this movement of the Spirit in their prayer time, some of them just felt this anguish that they feel over James who was beheaded and he was our friend. But you know what? I'm just thinking here. He was our friend, but he was John's brother. And I wonder if in the course of that prayer time, they kind of stopped and said, let's just get around John here for a minute. And they gathered around a sobbing John who had just lost his brother and laid their hands on him and prayed. And they prayed to the one who spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all. God, be with our brother John in his grief. And remind him of our blessed hope. But touch him in his anguish. I wonder what they look like. I mean, I just wonder. The weirdest things. I wonder what they look like. As they gathered in Mary's house, the news of James' execution and Peter's arrest, still fresh and buzzing and overwhelming in their minds. I need to get a visual. And I was thinking about that this week. I wondered literally what they look like, like the looks on their faces I'm talking about. I have a bizarre mind. I know you know that. And so when my mind goes to certain places, I have no control. It's there before I know. And I was thinking about this, and I thought of all goofy things. I thought of a poster. So I was trying to figure out what they look like. A poster that I had in my college dorm many years ago. The poster had this caption, said this, some people make things happen, some people watch what happens, still others wonder, what happened? And as best I can recall, I remember this statement, but the picture, I think, was like of a group of little ducks, little ducks, and they were all looking in different directions, and they had the look of a duck on their face. The look of a duck, in case you didn't know, was they look like, what happened? They just look stupid. There's a stupid look on their face. the obvious implication by the way of this little poster is that you want to be someone who makes things happen that's why i had it in my college dorm when i was in college because i wanted to be one of those kind of people and the last thing you want to be is a person who doesn't have a clue who wonders what happened very uncool but here's the deal and this is how it fits into what i was wondering about how they looked you see when the foundations are shaken and it looks like satan moon's winning, and it feels like we're outnumbered. That is precisely how you feel. That is precisely how you look, dazed and confused, wondering what happened. For try as you might to look cool at moments like that and act like you know. The fact is you don't know, and I'll tell you why you don't know, because James is dead and Peter's next and Herod is huge, and you are among the uncool majority who at times like that wonder what on earth has happened. What I want to do this morning and have obviously already begun to do and reel you into is to have us consider the events of this story in Acts chapter 12 through the eyes of these frightened, faithful people huddled in Mary's house to pray for in a very real way, in ways that apply more this weekend and in this season than at any other time I could possibly preach this text, we are in that room with them these days. We are just like them. For from this room where we are huddled on this Sunday morning, given the circumstances of our lives nationally, and what may be, in fact, I know to be for certain for some of you, the tumultuous circumstances of your life personally we're huddled here in a situation where there doesn't seem to be much we can do to change the situation at least not right away it's a situation that doesn't feel fair it isn't adding up that makes it look like evil can do whatever it wants to do whenever it wants to do it because right now it looks like evil is winning more darkness than light more evil than good more questions than answers. But beloved, all of that is precisely why. I want to examine this story this way. Because it is precisely there. In the middle of questions unanswered. In the middle of situations not fair. That don't always add up. As far as I can see at least today. That my faith and your faith has to live and grow. For my faith and your faith has to live and grow. this side of eternity, this side of the culmination and the ultimate explanation. It has to live and grow in a world where sometimes it looks like the good guys are losing, where sometimes it looks like there's more darkness than light, more evil than good, more questions than answers, questions that buzz around our head like, why does there always seem to be a Herod? They show up in Acts chapter 12. Why does there always seem to be a Hitler? Why does there always seem to be an Osama bin Laden? Those questions bother me, and they bother you, and they bother your neighbor. Well, with all of that stuff buzzing around our minds and stirring dark things in our spirits, let's go back to Mary's house and hear the rest of the story. For it actually has a happy ending if you stick around for the rest of the story. But you always have to stick around for the rest of the story. We know so far in the story is this. James is dead. Peter is next. Herod is huge. And the people are praying when a wonderful thing happens, Peter is delivered. And just in the nick of time, according to verse 6, for on the very night when Herod was about to bring him out to be killed, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains. I'm in verse 6 here. And guards in front of the door were watching over the prison. And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared, and the light shone in the cell, and he struck Peter's side, and then roused him, saying, Get up quickly, Peter. And his chains fell off his hands. And the angel said to him, gird yourself, put on your sandals. And he did so. And then he said to him, wrap your cloak around you and follow me. And he went out and continued to follow. But he didn't know that what was being done by the angel was real. He was still kind of in this sleepy fog. But thought that he was seeing a vision. When they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself. And they went out and went along one street. And immediately the angel then departed from Peter. When Peter came to himself, he said, Now I get it. For now I know that for sure the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that these people were desiring to do to me. Now, there's just some interesting things that struck me about this little part of the story. most obviously, is the miraculous deliverance. The tables are turning. God does intervene. That's all good news. The good guys are at least catching a break. I wouldn't say right now that they're winning yet. They're certainly still outnumbered. I'm not sure if I was Peter, I would feel entirely safe. But this was a wonderful thing. But there's some other things about this little piece in the story that struck me as odd. And I'm not even sure they're worth pursuing, but I'm going to do it anyway. The first thing that struck me as odd was this. Verse 6, when the angel of the Lord came and shined the light, Peter, and it was the night that he was going to be brought out to be executed, Peter was sleeping. Just buzz over that. Don't pay any attention. That was weird to me. On the very night that he was about to be brought out, he was sleeping. Could you do that? Try to be in the scene. Be in prison. You're about to die. James is dead. You're next. I think I'll take a nap. Not only was he sleeping, but he was sleeping so soundly that the light from the angel filling the cell did not stir him. Verse 7 says, so the angel struck Peter's side. That didn't do it and roused him. Light, poke, shake, still didn't get it. I think this angel, after his assignment, went back to heaven and other angels came around and said, it's not about you. You know, seriously, just don't take this personal. You know, normally angels, they come up to people, they go, you know, they get a little cocky, actually. They come up and they go, they show the light and everybody goes, whoa, the shepherd's in the field watching the flock by night. They did a light. Whoa, Peter, you know, it strikes me as odd is all I'm saying. I don't think I could do that. how did he do that? well let me really tell you the reason this got my attention it wasn't just noticing but the commentaries I read actually kind of made a big deal of the fact that he was sleeping and a number of them took the fact that he was sleeping and did what I think we often do with people in scripture and what it does it has a negative effect ultimately because it makes them look so much different than us that we can't relate what many of the commentaries did with this fact that he was sleeping was they idealized this and spiritualized this saying things like this. You need to understand, brethren, they didn't put on this voice, but it was just written. That Peter in the cell was just so full of faith and secure in the hands of God that he just was able to fall asleep. And if you had the kind of faith he had, that you would be able to fall asleep the night before you were going to be executed. And even if your best friend just died, if you had this kind of faith. So, you know, shame on you for not having that kind of faith. And maybe not to shame on you thing, but you always kind of feel like, oh, yeah, he's incredible, and I'm defective because I would never be able to sleep. Just a little word about that. Be a little careful about making things like this the measure of ultimate faith. Because, again, my mind goes to the opposite thing all of a sudden. I'm thinking, well, it could be that the reason he was able to sleep the night before he was supposed to be executed was because he was full of faith. It could be. But what bothers me about deciding that's it is that Jesus, in the night in which he was betrayed, the night before he was supposed to die, didn't go to sleep. In fact, he couldn't go to sleep. He went to the disciples and said, I need to go pray because I'm in a mess right now. And I want you to stay awake and pray. So he went to the garden and sweat drops of blood. And I'm looking at that one now because Peter was able to sleep. Jesus didn't sleep. He couldn't sleep. And I'm going, where's your peace, Jesus? Didn't you have any faith? And then I think, who did sleep that night? Let me think. Do you remember? Oh, yeah, Peter, he was, this guy can sleep. So now I flip the other way. You know, at one minute I was thinking, this guy is incredible and I should be like him. And I'm feeling that defective that I'm not. But now I can spin it a whole different way. It's not faith, it's a flaw. This guy's a jerk. In fact, one writer said this. He put it this way. If you can keep your cool while everyone is losing theirs, maybe it's because you do well under pressure. And that's a good thing. But maybe it's because you don't have a clue what's going on. So maybe this ability to fall asleep when all hell is breaking loose is faith. Or isn't faith. Maybe it's a flaw. And now as I keep on considering these conflicting possibilities, I get confused. Are you confused? One over here is confused and that was the intent. I'm glad you're confused. Let me tell you why I want to get you confused. Because life is confusing. And the truth is I don't always know why people do what they do. But I really like to think I do. And so I spiritualize and I idealize people on one hand and then I figure I guess they're not that great. And then I go over here and I demonized them. The same people that I used to idealize, I then demonized. You know what I think explains why he slept? He was tired. He was really, really tired. I think what the angel caught him doing in that cell was being human. I think Peter was a man who was full of faith. I also think he had his measure of fear, traumatized and tired beyond belief. You know, people react differently. Some people would not be able to sleep. Some people wouldn't be able to stay awake in something like that. Who knows? He was narcoleptic. Or something else I noticed, the sleeping thing was one. The other was this. Did you notice that he didn't recognize the miracle was a miracle until the miracle was over? That was just another thing. You go, well, it's not really worth the whole sermon here. It's probably not even worth the time he was taking here. But I just noticed it, and it was weird to me. It struck me odd. See, I always thought, and this is what immediately came to mind, and have heard people talk, teach rather, or at least some people teach, that the only way to get a miracle is to expect a miracle. And he was asleep. He didn't expect a miracle. In fact, as I thought of that little run of thinking, I could actually see the banner over the stage in the special meetings. And the banner says, expect a miracle. And I can see the evangelists yelling and screaming, just kind of the way I'm yelling and screaming right now. And what he'd be saying is this, expect a miracle. The only way to get a miracle is to expect a miracle. And if you don't expect it, you won't get it. As if what controls the outpouring of the miraculous is our expectation of it. Question, really? Is that true? Peter didn't expect it. I'm not trying to make a virtue out of his lack of expectation. but he didn't even appear to be praying for it. He was sleeping. Well, the people at Mary's house were probably praying for it. Well, we know they were praying for it. They were praying for Peter but here's the deal about even them. When Peter eventually showed up, they didn't believe it was him. It really gets kind of funny, comical. Look at verse 13. Peter does show up. He's been delivered. He goes to Mary's house. And when he knocked, verse 13, when he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant named Rhoda, who was a few sandwiches short of a whole picnic, this girl's great, came to answer the door. And when she recognized Peter's joy, Peter's voice, it's me, Rhoda, Rhoda, it's me. Because of her joy, it's Peter, she did not open the gate. Stop right there. Be Peter. She did not open the gate. The angel was incredible. I got away. The guards didn't go, see you later. Bless you as you leave. They didn't know I, they're looking for me now. Rhoda, Rhoda. She ran in, left Peter at the gate. Verse 16, Peter continued knocking. I think softly, like, I hope you hear inside. I hope you don't hear out here. In fact, when she came and said, he's out there, this thing you've been praying for, that he would be delivered and all these other things you're praying for, he's out there, and they said, you're out of your mind. I think they knew her. But she kept on insisting it was so. Peter continued knocking. Finally, they opened the door, and they were amazed. They were amazed. What does that mean? They didn't expect it. Now, this does not mean, all these things I'm saying, that we shouldn't expect. We should. It does not mean we shouldn't ask. It does not mean we shouldn't believe. And it does not mean that God doesn't respond when we do expect, ask, and believe, because he does respond. What it does mean, simply, is this, however. We cannot control and manipulate these things by learning to push the right buttons the right way at the right time. And we so want to believe that we can. Because we so want to be in control. And we're not. The work of God is still the work of God. Finally, Peter clears his head back to verse 11. He figures out what's going on. He goes to Mary's house in verse 12. And when they figure out what's going on, that it's actually him, they begin to rejoice. And motioning to them with his hand to be silent, verse 17, describes to them how the Lord had led them out of prison. And then Peter says these wonderful words that I just want to put them in your spirit. Because this is like marching orders almost for the church when the foundations are shaken. Here's what Peter says. Report these things. It wasn't him about to report. He's giving them his story. And then he's saying to them, here are your marching orders. Repeat this story wherever you go. Why? Because Church of Jesus Christ, huddled in this room wondering what in the world is happening. When it looks like Satan's winning, when it feels like prayers aren't answered, we need to repeat the stories of faith that remind us once again that God, even when it looks like there's more darkness than light, we need to be reminded that God is still active than he is ever involved, that God is in control. So he told them the most amazing story of how an angel came to him in the middle of the night when he didn't expect it, when he wasn't looking for it. God's amazing grace was just shed on him and how his chains fell off and how he followed that angel out of prison. And the people in that room, I'm sure, were encouraged and amazed. Some got so excited, wanting to believe again that this is the way it always is if you do it right. We're ready to preach and hold some revival meetings. And the sermon even that they might have is said. I can even imagine. I'm a preacher, so I can know. You know how you would formulate it. It would at least begin like this. This would be the title of the sermon. This is how we'd get people to come to the revival meeting, that God is the God who sets the captive free. He is greater than any prison that man or hell can fashion. And they would tell the story, the wonderful story of Peter's deliverance. And I even know how they would close. I know how they would close. The sermon and the meetings, they would start with the question, what kind of prison are you in this morning? Is it financial? Is it physical? Is it emotional or spiritual? Awaken from your slumber. Do not be Peter who slept through this miracle. Throw off your chains. Follow the angel of the Lord and he will lead you out. Somebody say, hallelujah. Somebody say, praise the Lord. Strike up the band. Okay, stop it. But before you strike up the band, remember this. The John the brother of James is also in the room. Be John for just a moment. Listening to the words of Peter and his amazing story of deliverance and miraculous freedom, how the chains fell off. I don't know how John felt, but I do know how I would feel if I were John hearing Peter's story of deliverance. I would probably have tears. I love Peter. from John. And I would have tears streaming down my cheeks of gratitude and thanksgiving to God. He intervened. Praise God. Thank you for your amazing grace. But if there were, you know, this thing about striking up the band, I don't know if anybody would do that. But if there was somebody, you know, about that, I think there would be something in John's spirit who would say, you know, I'm just not quite ready to strike up the band. because as encouraging as this news about Peter is to my thirsty and grief-stricken soul, it raises a question for me. The question I would have would be this if I were John, and it's a question some of you have had and maybe some of your friends have had, and it comes right out of the Twin Towers where some were killed and others were delivered. The question I would have if I were John would be this. Why didn't the angel come for my brother? Why didn't God show up? I don't doubt that God is real, and I don't doubt that it was God and no one else who delivered Peter. Just my question is, why didn't God show up for James the way he showed up for Peter? Couldn't you have done that, God? Your neighbors are asking that question. People in New York City are asking that question. We don't do well answering questions like that. They make us uncomfortable. We like to strike up the band. And we need to praise God and we need to be delighted when we hear of the deliverance. Whether it be Twin Towers, when we hear of the deliverance. And thank God. But what do you do with the one who wasn't delivered? And we want to put this formula to try to make God look good. To make it sound like that's the way it is. If you just have enough faith, if you do it right, you're praying the right prayer. It will always be done. No, no. There were people who died who were praying right through the last second. God gave him a different kind of gift, probably, I would guess. Often when people ask us questions like this, we offer simplistic answers that don't really help and sometimes even hurt. Can you imagine somebody just saying to John things like this? Take comfort, John, because God was through with James. You ever hear anybody say something like this? God loved James so much that he wanted him in heaven with him. You know, even if that was true, and you know, maybe, I don't know, you know, maybe that's true. It's probably not the most comforting thing when what's in your face is the grief. Even if that's true, that's probably not the thing they're ready to hear. Well, and then others maybe working the prayer formula would say, you know, we probably didn't pray enough for James. We prayed for Peter and he got set free because they got it all figured out because that's how. Here's what I recommend when we get asked hard questions like that. What I recommend is the truth, and here's the truth. We don't know why. And here's the point. In fact, the point of this entire talk this morning. It is precisely there. Right in the middle of things we do not know. Right in the middle of things that don't add up, that don't feel fair, that don't resolve, that my faith and your faith has to live and grow. This side of eternity where sometimes it looks like good guys are losing. More evil than good. More darkness than light. More questions than answers. But now let me tell you the rest of the story. I'm not done yet. Because even in this little tiny story, and you know what? That's all this is. This is a little snippet in the life of some people that somehow got in the Bible and therefore it's big. But this didn't last very long. But this little snippet speaks to an eternal reality. This little tiny picture speaks to a bigger picture. This little tiny story speaks to a much larger story. Because even in this little story, Herod doesn't win. And that speaks to the larger story. And you know what that is? Herod never does. The Herods of the world never do win. Let's look at his demise. Verse 20. Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and with one accord they came to him. Having won over Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they were asking for peace because their country was fed by the king's country, so they needed to be nice to him. On an appointed day, Herod, having put on his royal apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering an address to them. And the people kept crying out to them in order to win his favor. the voice of a God and not a man. And Herod believed it. I really am the man. And God said, no, you're not. And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory and he was eaten by worms and died. And all God's people under 15 say, cool. That is really cool. In fact, he was eaten by worms and died. I mean, do you get that? That's really cool. He He didn't die and get eaten. Anyway, nobody else appreciates that but 15-year-olds and me. 24th verse is a verse, by the way, that shows up all through the book of Acts, sometimes on the heels of very positive experiences, sometimes on the heels of very negative experiences. This incredible word is this. But the word of the Lord continued to grow and be multiplied. Let me close all of this with four bullet point principles so you have something to take home very quickly. Here's the first principle that this story affirms. Number one, ultimately God wins every time. Four weeks ago, or maybe it was five, on the Sunday after the September 11th event, I said it this way, when the foundations are shaken, we need to remember that evil never wins. Never, ever, never, ever, ever. I want to end this series of sermons saying that very thing. Psalm 2, 2 says it this way. The kings of the earth, in other words, the Herods, the Hitlers, the Osama Bin Ladens of the world take their stand. And the rulers take their counsel against the Lord and against his anointed. But he in the heavens sits and laughs. He scoffs at them. Why? Because they're going down. And they're going down every time. Herod, in this little tiny story, is just a little tiny picture of a bigger picture. The bigger picture is this. Evil loses every time. Ultimately, God will win. That's principle number one. Principle number two, a little more sober, you may not always get to see it this side of eternity. You may have to wade through some pretty dark things and experience some dark things. And there are saints, and I think they have a very special place in heaven, who die in physical circumstances that feel like the dark, but they die believing. James was one of those. You see, in verse 23, Herod gets eaten with worms, and everybody who's looking goes, well, he's not that tough. He's not that big. Well, I've got news for you. In verse 2 of chapter 12, Herod looked pretty big to James, and he looked pretty healthy to James. No worms in view that day. Principle number one, ultimately God wins. Principle number two, you may not get to see it this side of eternity. Principle number three, it is precisely there. Between the promises of God and the unanswered questions of life, that my faith and your faith has to live and grow. And the faith I'm talking about is not a faith that just says, well, I just know everything's going to be all right in ten minutes. I just know we're going to be delivered everybody's going to be healed we're always going to win nobody's ever going to get hurt and nobody's ever going to die no the kind of faith I'm talking about is what I call fiery furnace faith Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego faith about to be thrown into the fiery furnace you know the story for not bowing down to Nebuchadnezzar said these amazing faith filled words to Nebuchadnezzar our God can deliver us then a little bit more faith they said this, our God will deliver us. Then, with what I think is even more faith, they said this, but if he doesn't deliver us, we're still not bowing down to you because we know that in the end, God will win. And we believe that even if we don't see it today. Principle number four, that kind of faith can only live when deeply rooted in the reality of what we've been speaking of for five weeks, deeply rooted in the reality of an eternal hope. And our eternal hope is this. Scott spoke of it wonderfully last week, that this life is not all there is to life. That I am mortal, and my mortality speaks to my frailty. But this mortal is also eternal. Paul said it this way. for this momentary light affliction of this one life long is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison. For we know that if this earthly tent, which is our house, is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Which is why I can stand before you this morning, huddled in this little gymnasium, And say these words with confidence. And belief that they can take root and make a difference. Be not afraid, little flock. Even when the foundations are shaken. Even when it looks like Satan's winning. Because in Christ Jesus our Lord. By his death and resurrection, an ultimate victory over the evil one who sometimes looks like he's winning. Even if you lose, you win. Even if you die, you live. And that is why when calamity comes, we grieve. But we do not grieve as those who have no hope. Let's stand and be dismissed in prayer. Father I pray in closing what I prayed at the beginning by the power of your spirit through the working of this word you would work into our spirits the kind of faith that can stand even when the foundations are shaken I pray these things in Jesus name Amen the prayer team will be here for anyone who needs prayer for anything at all the rest of you are dismissed God bless you as you leave do not know a little more obedient about what we do know Father a little more humble about receiving from people who we might think unacceptable pieces that may just turn the light on for us as far as understanding Lord I don't know how important this word may be for some people I pray that you would take it bear fruit from it I pray also that you would give people who need ministry directly from your spirit today the courage to come and ask for it up front I pray it in Jesus name Amen You're dismissed.
