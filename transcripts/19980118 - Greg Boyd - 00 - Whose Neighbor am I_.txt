I want to speak on, it's from chapter 10, verses 25 through 27. I want to speak on stewardship and lifestyle stuff. And there are a couple of preliminary words before I get into this message. This is an area that I've become very passionate about. The last six months of the people have been under my goals for about 10 years. This is one of the messages that we'd rather not hear. Or at least a lot of us would rather not hear. Certainly one that I'd rather not hear. And that's the last summer that the Lord decided to launch a campaign against me to chisel a whole lot off the feet. I don't know if you're curious to know. It's chisel time. It means it's miserable time. And I'm just going to say, yes, how are you? I mean, if you're saying that any kind of one, you know, I like to say, you know what it's like to do. It's just a time, amen? And it's tough stuff. And one of the things that the Lord deserves to do back in my life was this message, this thing. And I share it here this morning to have to know that I am very much the opposite of my service. I'm in the process of this. I am convicted by this. What I'm basically doing, I do a simple set of jobs of preaching. I let you in on my conversation with God. And let you know some of the misery that that's why I call it. Because misery loves God. I don't want to do this alone. So I'm going to be inviting you in on a bunch of stuff. That's so difficult. I wanted to see this morning as, you know, I would rather have come here actually and Thank you. Some aspects of preaching in our culture today is that they have wanted to sort of consider mentality. We try to throw the net as broad and as wide, but then also as shallow as possible. And just many people add, that's going to have a fundamental underlying of the gospel. So some of us, maybe, will be a little hard to think. I would encourage you, for your sake, for the joy that was before you, if you let this be confident in your life, to not put up defensive structure to already be hearing your own self talk and you don't hear what God has to say to you. It is so easy for us to prejudge the words. There's something that maybe is going to inconvenience us from calling from the fundamental alteration of our life. We sometimes want to immediately put up your hands, but maybe excuses sort of, kind of, kind of stuff. And so we filter, we compromise the water now the word that God would have for us. I would encourage you not to do this. I would encourage you to hear. Donut even think about, well, this is, I've got to do this part. Don't start putting all the implications of this just yet. This implication might scare us into hearing it or into not hearing it. So just let it sit. Let it lay out. Let me pray right Now that may happen. Father, that may have a positive. We're trying to put it down here. Let it go. There's a possible thing to keep it here. We can keep it in our hearts. We can keep it in our minds and keep it in our minds. Father, I pray that you would be about, as I'm speaking here, Lord God, I pray it would not be about you, it would be about a demonstration of spirit and power. And nowhere, Lord, is your spirit more powerful than what it is. And when it demonstrates that you can get a stronghold in our mind, a social and presupposition that we take for granted that are not true, that cause us to, in some way, Lord God, lack of glory and salvation that you give us. So, Lord, turn down as the word goes forward. That's your job, not mine. Are we link to it? We're going to talk, Lord. You've got to have the power. That's what we're saying today. And all the gospel said, Amen. Okay, kingdom people, this is a kingdom message. It's one that we are very familiar with. I think that I've been through this for very long. For that reason, though, it's kind of dangerous because a lot of people do things over and over again. We get used to them. And when we get used to them, they lose their radical edge. But in a lot of Jesus' teachings, and I would say in all of Jesus' teachings, if you lose the radical edge of that teaching, you want to be. The Holy Spirit, I want to see here that it's as radical as it's supposed to be. We'll read the passage, and I'm going to give a separate comment. We'll put your push on. We'll read it. Verse 25 of Luke chapter 10, just then a lawyer said, a fantastic teacher. One of his motivations level together here, he was really not a human and honest answer here. He wanted to test him. Maybe he tricked him up. Maybe he had to lure him into an intellectual debate about something they were always going to do. I said, teacher, what must I do to a charity? What must I do to a charity? So Jesus said to them, well, what's that? What do you read there? You tell me. You read the Bible. You tell me. The man said, well, the answer is, you shall love the Lord your God with all of your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, with all of your mind, and your neighbor as yourself. This is the bingo, jackpot, bullseye center of the target answer right there. Boom. Everything but everything but everything in the Old Testament and everything in the New Testament and in one way or another summed up in this commandment. Jesus himself heard that. This guy hit the nail on the head. I suspect that he had heard it from Jesus himself because Jesus himself had taught those exact words at a earlier time. And this wasn't the standard teaching of the rabbis in the day. The idea that everything in the Old Testament, everything in the Good Testament, is not there to be a proof that you've got to jump through or a testament you've got to pass. I don't know if I'm going to like you. The idea that Browns are just all there to express love from God to us, and us to God and us to each other, that idea was moved. And Jesus was teaching it. This guy, I met, picked it up from David. So we're going to get some back to David. And the answer that he has was looking at, he said, do we give the right answer to this? And do this. And look at this. But wanting to justify himself, he asked him to do this. Who is my neighbor? You see, the guy, he knew what he wanted to hear. This was the point of the question. He really didn't want to find out what the rhetoric was supposed to do to inherit eternal life. He was going to seek this. He was going to seek this debate. The debate was, who is my neighbor? Who is my neighbor? There's already a point that we've got to get out of this. He was seeking to justify himself. And that is something that is very easy for us to do. None of us want to feel conviction. None of us want to feel inconvenienced. None of us want to have our comfort zone stretched too much. We may be willing to do what we must do with the people, but the natural man, the natural mind, and the natural flesh doesn't want this kind of stuff. And so we sometimes justify ourselves. And we do it so we can't win this guy yet. He had the information up here. It was all up there. But he didn't want to be inconvenienced to the point where it actually would make a difference in his life. Of course, you don't want to say that. You don't want to say, yeah, you know, I know it's true, but you don't feel like living in a cup of fat stuff. So what you do is you insert some issues. You insert some things. You fog up the issue a little bit. You confuse it. You obscure it. You think it's a damn more ambiguous than it really is. And thereby, it can guard you. You actually have to take action on what you know to be true. This guy says, who's my neighbor? He goes, I really like the teaching that you have. This is stuff called, love you, Lord. I got all of my heart, all of my mind, all of my body, all of my soul. Good stuff. A very interesting and accurate, astute insight. It's a revelatory feel. I love the custom, I think. And the idea of loving your neighbor as yourself is wonderful. Who is moving the world to see this? I like to see the world to see this. It's a perfect harmony. But, you know, and I will certainly get on to loving this. I will definitely. I love this. It's a great feeling. I love this. You see, I'm not quite sure about who is my neighbor. I mean, this is not, after all, an easy issue, isn't it? One can say many things, and quite not for situations about who exactly is my neighbor. I mean, after all, if everybody my neighbor, I mean, what must they make some sort of geographic distinction? How close they live to me, because that qualifies it as my neighbor. And what about the social implications of the theory that you're profounding for our consciousness in the first time? And in the article, I'm going to be able to make some sort of geographical implications of the daily established by the others. One just doesn't know what to do with stuff like this when it comes to answer the question of who I'm wrong. Is my neighbor an existentialist? Even thinking about the thing. Oh, what are we going to do? What are we going to do? But as soon as I figure it out, I will surely get around with love to my neighbor. We'll have to get together and take some of these. Jesus, as he always does. That's true, though. Oh, Lord. Boom. And what do you have to tell you? He does not bite the pig. He never bites the pig. But he does. He does people like you to die, right? Everybody does. A man was going down to... He was going down to prove what he said. He was going down to prove what he said. He told him that I have the Robert. Now, by chance, a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. So likewise, I believe I put him into the place and saw him pass by on the other side. You've got to know this. A priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. He didn't even have to bring up the people. He was going to be a cop dog, nice guy, wonderful guy. He said, and the audience, when he really got perspective, Thank you. There's something they do that says they've got to be a good one. They like to keep suffering from their clients, no threats. Those who are, who are victims of justice, let people face them. There are some things out there. And that would be the one that never said to me. I think you can pass them without having to do something about them. So no doubt these, the racial divide, which made me, there was a good thing that there was a responsibility. They were going to be down, they were going to be a responsibility. They maybe had a prayer meeting to go to. Okay, I've got a prayer meeting to go to. I've got to leave 50 people in the prayer, and sorry, I've just got to do that. Maybe I've got a big financial thing I've got to take care of. Maybe it wasn't either a customer to work on the other side of the room. Maybe it was sort of what they said to me and they looked at my head. They saw something up there. It's like, wow, why did they just arrive at the street? And they didn't happen to be on the wrong side of the road. Surely they would justify themselves by saying, and others would justify themselves by saying, And if they really hadn't noticed the full depth of something that was supposed to be wrong, surely they would have done something, but they just happened to be on the wrong side of the world, wrong location. You know, these things are sad. They happen that way, but they're so beautiful. But maybe there was some justifiable, in a natural way, justifiable reasons why they wanted to be on the side of the world. Where were the robbers? I mean, if they beat him up, maybe it was a trap. Maybe it was a wrong setup. What has to be wise and take precautions? Or maybe they're thinking with something like this. I mean, it wasn't too uncommon to see people on the side of the road. You're begging, you're wounded, you're beat up, or whatever. And have the three sports that we have today. And so what could have happened, what frequently happened, that happened, what frequently happened now, is that people say, well, you know what? These gang members aren't always shooting each other. You know, these poor people, they don't even get a job. He probably didn't think of the process of what he was thinking. He probably wasn't involved in some one transaction. We know about those people. We have to depend on those people. And I don't think I should get involved. It's not my problem. I'm a little bit of a problem. Or somebody even dare to say, well, they just had enough faith. God would have protected us. I've never got a problem like that. I don't know why. I love the options that I want. Let's say, look at the other side. And a question, see, in the end of the sentence, but then there was a Samaritan. The Samaritan, you've got to know that, the priest will be by the top dogs of Jewish audience. The Samaritan was a lot of dogs for Jewish audience. They weren't dogs for Jewish audience. They were prejudiced against Jews who were nearly despised Samaritan. These were these people who were the offspring of the mixed Samaritan, the Gentiles. They called them hybrids. They were just seen as holy. American is around. One is American is around, and the other ones are in their hometown. The American is around, like all the scientists, in a different area. The government is in business by stopping to help somebody who is a American. But he's the one who is not. He sees the guy, and he moves with pity. He's got a heart, yes, his heart. He's right, why he's in the people who are in the world. And he went to him and he bandaged his face and put oil and wine on them. They were commodities. And then he put on a glass full of animals. He came. He walked while the other guy moved. He brought them to an inn and took care of them. He got the phone to use that knife and some company guy right there. He called him to do the action. The next day he took out two denarii. He called him to face weight. He gave them to me and he said, take care of them. When I come back, I'll be doing whatever you want. I've got the means. I've got the means. I don't know about this. I've got extra. He's got less than he needs. I'll out of the excess that I have. And the sky's the limit. Whatever it takes to meet the need of this guy, I'll do. He didn't know who this guy was. He had no relationship with this guy. He may never see this guy again. We're all in with the guy who wasn't so cool. We're all in with the guy who was up with a cool, cool, cool life. But what he did see was that this guy had a need. I have the means of needing that need. And therefore, I'm going to need it. Even if it's inconvenient to me, I'm going to need it. So then Jesus asked the question to you before. We should be free. We should be free. which in these three was a neighbor to the one who ran from the man who was a prophet. And he was a genius. He didn't know how he was a man. The lawyers in there saying, who is my neighbor? I need to define this. The issue is outside of me. I'll go to my neighbor, but I have to think about it. I'll say, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he was telling the story, and that comes back to much later. He was a neighbor to. Thank you. Go and do likewise. That is, in the end, the answer to the question of what might be good in the early of your life. That's how you put flesh. That's how you put hard on you. That's how you begin to live out what it means to love the Lord, that God will allow your heart, all your mind, all your body, and all of your soul. All of it is that you love the Lord God. And then the necessary corollary of that is to love your neighbor as yourself. This is why you put flesh on you. The question that I began to ask myself this summer, and I still have asked it, is, who is my neighbor? Or rather, whose neighbor am I? And I'm asking the question, are there areas of my life where I obscure the issue of my own benefit? Are there areas of my life where I render ambiguous and are not ambiguous? Are there areas of my life where I walk on the other side of the boat and do the beauty of the future? Modern psychology, whatever else we think about it, it has a few things about human psyche that are very important. And one of the most foundational things that Freud and Adler and the rest of the time is that human consciousness is largely dictated by self-interest. Broadly speaking, now, they would probably say universally speaking, this is certainly the truth of the naturalized economy. We tend to notice it enters into our consciousness of things which are in our self-interest. Now we tend not to notice the things which are in our self-interest, not to notice. We frequently read the Bible that way. Things that are going to affect us and cause us discomfort, we have a vested interest in not noticing them or reinterpreting them or re-reparaging them or doing a lawyer in the behavior of them. And so we've got to ask people who want to follow the teaching of Christ, who want to be disciples of Christ, as people who forgot to ask the question, are there areas in which we are being like a divine and a priest and one and the other side of the road, not interrogating for a fleshly, the central core of the gospel that we're talking to in flesh, are the ways in which I am benefiting by that gospel. God's wind-up and whammy speed began Thank you. We're missing our way because there's so many people who ordered stuff. The Lord is so narrow. And as we're going by, I think the word is shining over to the light. I guess I might. I was looking out to the snow, and I was on the high. And I was looking at my four or five people. It might have been ten. It felt very good. And he was standing in an untyled that I would call grass. He was, like all the other trials, the smell of it was unbearable. He was on that pile in the hot sun, looking for food. He was supposed to go to that man, and he was proud of me. And he looked up, and I caught his eye. And I'm looking back at him, and he was like, what? I was proud of you, and he was able to get it. And he was just a little bit. I will never forget that thing. And then that was about time. I was proud of you. The spot ran into my head in that hole. There is no reason that any human being can give as to why I'm on the inside of the man, because I'm on the outside of the man. I did nothing in some free system like a bird or something by a right-hand air-conditioned man and to go home with me before I got a nice house. I did nothing to deserve that and need enough to deserve that. It's just my chance of grief to walk down the road. is also by chance, he puts himself a victim. And having phones like that, the only relevant question is who says I spend a lot of money in the money for the people. And so far as humans can know this stuff, it is simply a matter of a lot of time on the inside, not the outside. And the only relevant question we're asking at this point in my life is, how much am I going to cash in on my company? How much am I going to cash into my good fortune for my personal benefit? How much am I going to take advantage of the situation? There's no reason why I was in the poor relationship. I'm going to tell you, like, this is a kind of idea. You're just thinking of a terrible story about her. I asked my daughter this question several months ago. We were talking to the class again. I'm going to stop. She was recording one night. And I just told her this question again. Hey, let's say that there's this, I should say there's a patient child for any child that's starving to death. And he's in my tribe. And he's going to die by the end of this week unless he defeats him. I've got the money to feed him. I can maybe keep him alive for a day at least, maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe an entire year. I can keep this kid alive. But I also am sick and tired of these curtains that I got in my dining room. I rolled the tatters and a little bit of an eyesore and embarrassment. We had friends over, and I really wanted to change my curse. And so the money I spent on the curse, I couldn't help people alive. You know, some concepts here. And I decided to buy the curse instead. It did. So I went down. And I think that I, I asked her, think that I am in any way as an individual being, but even more so as a person who's excited for the price, called to love like a fluffy, tiny way. Thank you. Oh, yeah, that's gross. No, yeah, come on. Obviously, that's so obvious. Duh. You got to get the curtains. And it's right now. Okay. What if? I'm supposed to be a neighbor to that kid. What if the kid's on the end of the book? And I don't have to see him all the time, but I can see him once in a while. But he is starving, and I know that my life can help him working by my curtains. If I'm out of the curtains, am I in any way responsible for his death? I'm going to stab, of course, stab, yes. Come on. Okay, well, what if the kid's not on the end of the block, but not in either city, or what if it's not in the inner city, but in a different state? Am I in any way to be a neighbor to that kid if I know that they're right there and that I have the means of saving them? Does the geographical instance between us undermine my responsibility to be a neighbor to that child? But what if the child actually ends up saying I'm a rubbish kid? I call the neighbor to that child. It's what I know of the church. And I'm talking about what the kids do. My message is about asking a question. What else do you do with our resources? I'm not going to say this. But I'm going to point it to ask a question. What does God call the need to do? Whose neighbor am I supposed to be? I do think that every kid has sort of a unit of measuring kingdom needs. There are needs all around this world. Some of them are physical, some of them are spiritual, some of them are emotional. And we are called to be kingdom people. Let's call sacrificial. The question is, what do we do with our resources? Whose neighbor are we supposed to be? Why are we supposed to walk on the hard side of the road instead of the easy side of the road? Are there ways, are there areas we're in that? Thank you. And so I have to ask the question, what else could I be spending the money on? See, but here's what I know. It is in my self-interest not to ask that question. To try to forget about that question. To try to theologize around that question. To try to come up with some sort of intellectual song and dance. So I don't have to face that question. Yeah, not. It's in my self-interest. And notice that really cute stone on the other side of the road. And then become sort of obsessed with that. And then move on. But that is exactly what Jesus Christ called us not to do. Thank you. that you who read the Bible and stuff, Jews together, you're killing chickens with blaming Jesus. I don't get it. There's this incredible investment of the food and cold. Now, they're eating. What hits me between the eyes is the realization when I got told that we've got our whole town. But you see, whatever kind of culture you're in Florida, the easy thing to do, the natural thing to do for the natural mind is to buy into it to be effective by it, to be an extension of your environment. We live in a culture that tells us, in a lot of different ways, from the media, from the TV, from the internet, and whatnot, that if you can afford it, you deserve it. We live in a culture that tells us it defines success by how much you have. It defines a person's worth by their possession. It tells us that the American dream is to live comfortably and to live successfully and to have a lot of toys. who dies with the most toys, and to live for some, to live for the here, to live for the now, to think about your own issues, and your own problems, your own stuff, to think about your current, and not ask a question about what else you're going to be doing with. And precisely because it so permeates our culture, we've got to ask the question against that culture. Are we in any way caught? Do we have our own kind of voodoo? Are there areas that Jesus actually prohibits in the gospel that we just don't notice because we're going to argue. It's in our self-interest not to notice. I don't know if these are bargaining analogies, but they're that reason. I'm not a catalyst. I'm not a catalyst. Let me be a catalyst. I want to be a squirt under your saddle for a time being. Because I've got to squirt on my saddle, but I don't want to suck on it. But there's a documentary called Showa. It's a powerful documentary. This guy does nine hours of interviews Thank you. The guard in the church opening up the door of Dachau as a train would come in. They interviewed him. The guy, one of the guys who invented was a little piece of the apparatus of the gas chambers. They interviewed him. Some of the neighbors who saw their news being rounded up, they interviewed them. And so on and so on. Some of the farmers were in the ground right next to the concentration camp. He interviewed them. They didn't even try to. They didn't tell them what he was doing. He just said something like, I don't know what it was like. What did you think? What did you see? What did you see? What did you do? And sometimes we can think of Nazi Germany or the Nazi-occupied Poland or Switzerland or whatever, where there are people who got co-opted in the system. We can think of them as little demons because they participate in the extermination of these people. Look at that people. There are priests. There are Levites. Some of them are pastors. Some of them, they don't have fakes. I'm going to say there's a good, decent, ordinary, honest human being that's the word of the mill. That's why most people did exactly what they did. And what they did was simply invited to their own business. There's a lot of priests and a lot of neighbors walking on the other side of the road for this atrocity of 6 million people being asked to happen. They didn't actually do it themselves. They were part of the problem. They said they were part of the solution. What happens here? Say something like this. Say the guy, for example, the guy who was in charge of train, they asked him, well, did you know what was on train as well? The guy who had train him. You knew that they had about 400 miles track to make. Did you know how to keep train? You never think about how the order of the team charge of the life and you guys have a you were taking 20,000 to this camp and you know, you already told me that you were taking a house about 2,000 did you ever wonder what happened to the other 18,000? yeah, I can't, I can't I don't know, I heard I'm just doing my job yeah, but then the next week, the next week, for four years you've booked 20,000 dudes in this camp, you're never stopped to ask the question, what the heck did happen to these people? The guy would say, well, you know, I got a job, I got a job, I got a mortgage payment to make, I just obey orders, you know, I do it up, I don't ask the question, I got my own kids to raise, you know, and you start asking questions, you're going to get in a lot of trouble. So you go along with the system, you get co-opted into the system, it's not that you're a bad person, it's just that you're not a disciple of Christ, that's the problem, you got your own kind of voodoo, whether you're calling a chicken or whether you're calling a chicken or whether you're calling a chicken or whether you're calling not caring enough about Jews, it's the same kind of Buddha. In Christianity, many people were Christians and got caught. And so I ask the question, are the ways in which I am caught and are the ways in which the Church is caught? The thing is this. I don think many of us, any of us, really, in any kind of criminal way, grasp the full radicality of the call of the saint. It is radical. We are called to a radical, sold-out, surrendered following of Jesus Christ. Three times the Bible commands us to follow Jesus. The word there is literally to imitate. Actually, the word is literally to mimic. We get the word mimic from the Greek word that shows there. It means to follow, to be a copycat, to follow an exact detail. The shadow. He does this, we do this. Whatever he does, we do this. The word that was used sometimes in preschools, when I'm trying to teach kids writing, they draw a letter on the board, and the kids would copy that letter. They would mind it. We are called to be exact replicas of Jesus Christ, which is to be called to a radical, self-sacrificial kind of love that comes before all other values, all other considerations. We're called to follow the one about what the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 8, verse 6, that though he was rich, yet he became poor for our sakes. He had abundance, but we were about to do our own fault. He had less than we had in need. In fact, we were in desperate shape. He sacrificed the whole thing out of love for us, and he was in half. He could have gone on the other side of the road. He did. The one who called to imitate, to model in our life, in every area of our life. Also, let this attitude be in you, which is also in Christ Jesus. Philippians chapter 2, verse 5. Though he was in the form of God, more praise could they you, though he was by very nature God, though he enjoyed the blessings of being God, though he had no inconvenience, though he was next to me, though he enjoyed the fellowship of perfect, unsurpassable, unending love throughout eternity, yet he gave the holy love, said the Philippians, he emptied himself, I know this is the word, he emptied himself, and made himself of no reputation, took on our nature, and died, I have a damnable God for the second death of the cross, why? Love, love, is to go out and do like that. He was a neighbor to us, if I could put it like that. A race of people who wanted to be God and wanted nothing more than to be away from him. He made it to God the task of being a neighbor to us. And do what a neighbor does. And he underage into our life. And we're called to follow for that. We're called to follow and teach it to the one who said, this is the one who said, passing that was so easy with our food. Jesus says, unless you give up all your possessions, you cannot be called red disciples. Surely you didn't mean that. So he trusted the way, you know, the FF plus, the sociological, philosophical, and the alien. And he said, well, they're really great at me. I think we're going to get around to one very other time. But we can actually, I'm not just like this. It's great to come out. It's true, guys. Oh. I don't think he's telling us to be homeless people. I don't think he's a virtue of poverty. But what he was saying is this. The things that give up your possession, in other words, stop possessing it. The things that you think are yours to possess, you don't possess. They're the cruel discipleship that you have Jesus that you've done to yourself. And that means that if he's Lord of my life, he's Lord of my health, he's Lord of my car, he's Lord of my bank account, he's Lord of my quality, he's Lord of everything, which means it's his, it's his. I don't possess it. you're not being, you're not called and possessed it, give it up, have a little bit of hope that the Lord says, this should be allocated here, and this should be allocated there, then our answer must be yes, Lord, because you are the person. If the Lord, the issue really is, how much of what I own do I give? Wrong question. Our system wants us to think that way. But it's the wrong question. The issue is, Lord, how much of what is yours? That's the discipleship perspective on the Lord. We're called to follow radical obedience. That is discipleship. And man, please know that this is coming towards me right now. But see, the church in America is first in the church in Laodicea. In chapter 3 of the book of Revelation, the Lord says, I am fought against you. This is the message that the church of America needs to be here for more. I am fought against you because you have said to yourself, I'm rich. We have everything we need. We are comfortable. The average American spends six times more putting on food they don't need and then taking them off than they ever give to people who are starving to death. Think about that. And that's true. That's as true for evangelical Americans as it is for secular Americans. One of the sad things about the statistics, if you look at them, is that the church is a little better in the secular world on issues of giving. The signal would get about 1.5% of 30-month to charity. Even local Christians tend to get about 30%. I don't know if that crisis or so is called. The church to large, we get this off. You think that what we're called to do is build big churches. A lot of people know that. We're called to do that. We're called to. What we're called to do is this. And so we walk on the other side of the road and you think to yourself, well, there are people who are hungry and a hasty kid on that rubbish heap. That's not my problem. That's their government's problem. That's not my problem. And the homeless person is not my problem. That's somebody else's problem. And the hungry person, that's not my problem. The divorced person is struggling with the church. That's not my problem. They suddenly got divorced. And the homeless person in the church, that's not my problem. I got my own friends. I got issues to solve there. I don't need to worry about that. And that teenager who's pointing out a wedlock, that's not my problem. Why did she get pregnant at first night? Maybe that's the character's problem, whatever, but it's not my problem. And if there's a problem in the inner city, that's a black problem. That's not my problem. And the government should take care of that. That's why God has been involved for. Who knows? I mean, it's not my problem. And the church, you know what your problem is. What you think your problem is, ask the question, what do you think about what is your energy towards? What do you most importantly do to bring to? The Church of America, to a large degree, defines its problem. What is it that our problems will solve? Well, how do we really get $3 million organs to really glorify God with this $3 million organ? And we don't need to have to ask the question, is there someone else on the other side of the world who maybe could use this $3 million more than we could with an organ? Or we need a really big church to glorify God with this great glossy advertising photos that the other church has. It's so impressive. You really want to get millions of people coming. We'll be able to lose. You know, so a quarter of our budget is going to have a pension. For sure, for sure, for sure. $18 million for a pension. You know what? If God calls you that, I'm not going to argue with you. I'm not your judge. But you better make sure that God calls you that. And you've got to ask the question to discern the world of God. Is there maybe something else for the kingdom that we could be using this money with? Our problem is how do you get those nice little padded seats so that you don't buy them so you get sore? And our problem is how do we get better air conditioning? And our problem is that I don't let it out. The fact that God is telling us is not our problem. That's not the issue. It's a one-set problem. I like you guys. Actually, I plan over there. I'm proud of the problem. The only problem that we really have is the problem. How do we want to be a second? How do we, how do we mean that every year in our life we want to be a second? How do we intentionally now end up in control? How do we reflect in the value? so that the way we live and the cost of living and the things that we think about, that it reflects in the values. The problem is this. How can we live in such a way that when this world is so materialistic and so secular and so self-centered, when they look at us, they see a people who say no to that view. That's the problem that we speak to them about. Everything else will come as a result of this. Well, here's something I'm saying. Okay, we're wrapping it up. That's not your problem. Okay. So that's it. Sometimes it's like this. Oh, it's a big. What can I do? I mean, the problems are complex. And there's always that historical, political, sociological, unethical, logical reason for why these people are in poverty. And if you're going to be against the solvent by certain money, and if you are very, very wrong, you're thinking of somebody who's going to pretend that you're very, very wrong, it's a complex issue. Right. You've got to be careful that you're not justifying yourself like a lawyer for being asked for something like that. Look at me. The discrimination is right. It's right. Right. It's terrible. You're looking at somebody who stole the world. No. There's a guy in the hill, right? Hey, you can't save the world. You can't. Maybe this one person is going to do something about the kingdom, the mustard seed pros, and he's at a time. So also, we have a song. It's almost me to hear that. You'll see, every time you see Sally, someone's on earth with him. She gets running. She's so guilty. It's like, oh, I'm a bit of a bad. I'm a bit of a American. That's not where it's at. I really just hate that. It's like, oh, there's like suckers for that. I'm sorry. We've ridden this before. Thank you. I'm going to be able to do it. How many lives could I have bought with this watch? I could have done more. You can't put a price tag on a life. What's good with a stupid watch? That's the time class that I have. How many lives? One, two, five. How many lives could have been bought with this? What about a little ornament on the car? How many lives? How many lives could have been bought with a little ornament? I don't need a stupid ornament. In fact, I don't need the car. What was I thinking when I kept this car? I could have got a hundred lives with this car. It wasn't enough. People, there's more I could have done. That's one of those moments of clarity where all of a sudden you think it's the same thing that they really are. God, I believe, has called us to have a moment of clarity in the beginning of that work in our life. The question is, I'm not preaching against heaven. I'm not preaching against heaven. I'm preaching against heaven. I'm preaching against heaven, I'm preaching against heaven, I'm preaching against heaven, attitude. I'm preaching against the American attitude. And the kingdom attitude is the opposite of the American attribute. And we should always ask this question as a kingdom person who knows that the only meaning life even has is pushing forth the kingdom of love against the kingdom of darkness. That's why I live, that's why I breathe. That's God on that. Oh, I spent it. Just ask the question, what else can you do? And it's for a couple of things. Oh, number one. I'm not talking once again about a piece of gold. I'm talking about kingdom stuff. Whatever comes over that, whatever service the kingdom of God, Spiritual hunger is even far more drastic than physical hunger. It has a general consequence. What are we doing about that? That should be in our minds. Secondly, I'm not trying to guilt people for being blessed. I don't care. Like Tucker Giles, that's the last year. It's a millionaire. That's not the problem. You're in the danger of that. You're worried about being rich. But it's not your fault. And you're rich. If you're good at it, be good at it. The issue is not how rich are you to be. Be rich from the sin. The issue is to host your liver. What are you doing? I'm not saying that there's never a place for extras to have non-survival items. You know what? You can go nuts and preach the wacko. I've done that. There have been there, done that. By thinking that every possible non-survival item is a sin. And Jesus changed the water into wine. It's a miracle. Hey, you know what? Couldn't you say that kids will keep you in that same group of power? No one really needed that extra couple of caps of wine, did they? Even Jesus saw that you're not going to hire all and make the world a cold in their place, and if God blesses you with an extra glass of wine, the Lord is not going to be about to drink. Give it back to him. Say, oh, Lord, can you give me some more juice instead? Maybe most gracious would be close enough. That's like a job of stuff. Okay, so you know what? Thank you. They say, I think that you're violating the gospel by the way you live. There are people that I know who've gotten revelation, and they even was a revelation. They turned into little Pharisees going on, judging other people. And one person, God, they said they gave up their house and a lot of other stuff. And they became miserable because if I gave it, I'm not going to any church. There wasn't a church that was right to this. There's no judging. We're all in process on this. We're in process on this. At the same time, the process takes time. My wife and I have had a number of interesting discussions on this. You've got to move slowly. You've got to bring your kids in on the process. You can't also be clear to hang kids. Guess what? No more ambercombe or whatever that story. And we're also getting rid of the house. It's ghetto time, can you? Oh, God. Oh, that's my wonderful. You gotta move forward in love by asking the question, let it take its course in you. The final thing is, at the same time, don't forget, don't give up. One, two, oh, there we go. Man, you guys are room left. I'm trying to roll the bar. Wait for a long cane to come out and be like, ah, yeah. Closing words are my final words. We sometimes accept that we have a stronghold of Americans. We're just in our mind. We'll hear this as a threatening, intimidating, depressing message. And hereby, you've got to know. It doesn't seem like that. But you've got to know that from God's perspective, it's a description of the story. The motivation is not guilty. It's a joy. because God knows how much of the pressure we have in a certain vessel, how much of the joy, how much of the power, how much of the freedom we are missing because we're addicted to things. We cling to things. I would venture to guess that most of our anxiety, our nervousness, our tension, our sleeplessness, the works of the flesh, a good deal of it, at least maybe most of it in our culture, is caused because we possess. We don't let go and not possess. and we cling to it, but this is the stuff that lost and rust and corrupts. So you're nervous about it. You might lose it. You're not allowed to gain to it. You've got to maintain it. You've got to pay the bills. We look over our needs. We're combining in a system and we become slaves to it. And we don't even notice that because it's food in our culture, but it rounds us of the freedom that we have in Christ. There's such a freedom that comes from knowing that you don't need the house. You don't need this extra post. You don't need that car. You can get by with us. So let me eat your meat. And most of all, there is such a joy in the meat. And again, living this word, which is the American way, give me, give me, give me, give me, is miserable. Did you live? In the love that God calls to live, you have other stuff available to you. So let me eat your meat. And now you're in the kingdom. I promise you, I guarantee you, I get the word in God's word. That there is a joy, a peace in that. That's what you're trying to do. We're going to join in Jesus' name. We'll never get to get a bigger boat. We'll get to the next boat. God bless you with that habit, but no one puts you in life. You live in you. You live in you. And that's what we're going to do. Father, Father, heaven, I, in my heart, and I want to be in a prayer here, anybody who is in the first step towards the Lord of all, and step of repentance. I am grateful. And so, Lord, I want to confess and leave others who are maybe disabled and I have made prayer of repentance that we have sinned. Anytime we walk on the other side of the road, Lord, we are sinning and am. God, it is a huge sin. It is a huge sin. It's a way for us to get into it. It's a sin that... Thank you. Thank you. In a loving way, uncomfortable, to bother us, Lord. Bung us, Lord, to conform to the Lord. Yes, it is. Thank you.
