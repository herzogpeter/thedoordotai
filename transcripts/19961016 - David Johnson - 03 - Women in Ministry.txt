As you know, this is the third and final week of this seminar type of deal we've been doing on Women in Ministry, and it's our privilege this evening to have a panel of women. And I shared with you last week that we're going to introduce you to some women in ministry who've been through this and are dealing with this whole issue and are involved in ministry. Some of these women go to our church, and you've maybe seen them, maybe haven't, and involved in significant levels of ministry. What I'm going to do is introduce them one at a time, and then they'll share. What we're going to do is have each one's going to share about ten minutes of their story, and just kind of their pilgrimage. And after that, we're going to have some time for questions, any questions that you might have about their process in this whole thing. But I'd like to pray. It's okay as we begin. Lord, I'm really grateful for the things we've already been dealing with in our church around this issue. And I am grateful for the amazing gifts that you give to your church. That you have given to men and women the gifts that are necessary to, number one, build a body. And for us as believers to be strong as we minister one to another. But you also empowered the church with the gifts of your spirit in order to storm the gates of hell bring back men and women from the dark and from the dead alive in Christ. And I thank you that you distribute those gifts to men and women. And we're grateful for the fact that more and more in the day we're living in, men and women are embracing all of the giftedness that they have to do what you call us to. So bless this time for liberty and healing, and I pray that it would be even used by you to build your body. Some people here from different churches, that is one. Your name is amen. The first person that it is my privilege to introduce to you is Viv Hough. This is Viv. Viv has been on staff here at Open Door for eight years. She came on as preschool pastor and then took the head of our children's ministry. You've been the head of the ministry for how long? Seven years. Okay. Viv has a master's degree in human development, leadership education, and parent education. She has one year of seminary. Viv is not ordained, but she has been licensed by the CMA. And it is my privilege to work with her day to day. And it's been a joy. Viv, you're first. As I thought about what I wanted to share with you, I decided to take a look at my own journey from the very, very beginnings. As Dave mentioned, my master's is human development, and so it was kind of a natural place for me to start because I like to look at the whole scope of life to understand any one part of it. So to understand why it is that I'm here, doing what I do today, I wanted to go back and look at the beginnings. I remember as a six-year-old that my kind of play was a little bit distinctive. My father was a pastor, my pastor, and so I played preaching. I preached to any audience that would listen to me. I'm not a preacher today, but I still think it was significant. And my text was John 3.16, every time. And then I remember in high school another significant marker in terms of who I was and what I felt was worth talking about. When I gave a graduation speech at my graduating class, I titled it, What's Worth Knowing? And it was really my testimony, and what I felt was worth knowing in life. And I shared Christ in that way. I went on to get my teaching degree in public school and college and preschool, and while doing that, I discovered that always my dissatisfaction with teaching subject matter was that it wasn't even after real stuff, and I couldn't integrate the spiritual aspect of it into my understanding of the whole, which I felt was really, really important. Hence, it led me to understand, in a more significant way, the way that God has created us and the ways that we develop. And I needed to understand spiritual development as much as I understood the other areas of it. And so, all of that is to say that God's hand was evident through my early years, right up through all my early work experiences and showing me that the longing of my heart, the passion of my heart that he placed in so early would be fleshed out in a ministry setting because there I would be able to be fully involved in the development of spiritual growth. And that's what I do here. I'm passionately concerned about how it is that children, Parents and volunteers go in their walk with God. So all of that is significant in my journey and part of why I'm here. Well, I entered open door, on staff, as Dave said. And what I'm going to share with you now for the next few minutes are some of the surprises. Because I grew up in a ministry family. I've always worked in ministry settings, but I'm really saddened in my mind. It wasn't my location until I came here. First surprise, I entered staff, and we didn't have a Saturday night service, so I became so totally involved in children's ministry that I could no longer go to a service. And I found that I was here not able to partake in the things that the rest of the body were able to. It was very lonely for a time. I felt like I was living in a bubble that was falling in the sea, and I couldn't get near the water. I was so thirsty and hungry for it. Surprise number one. Number two, the resistance that I met came more from women than it did from men who had only come to their early years. One significant experience I want to share with you is it had a profound impact on me. I was invited to go out to lunch with her another one day. I decided to get that call, and she proceeded to tell me at lunch that there had been a group of women at Open Door who had been angry at the church for hiring a woman in a full-time ministry position, and that they were angry at me for taking it. Therefore, I was not providing for them the role model that they wanted as wife and mother and home. And she repented of that to me, and subsequently asked if she could head up the intercessor prayer team for kids ministry and women personally, and she did that until her death a few years ago. It was wonderful to have that conversation with her, but I was surprised to me that that existed. I expected the sport to come to the moment, and I expected to encounter the resistance in other areas. I discovered, as I got involved in the all-male staff, that I needed to develop a new set of communication skills. I was going to say that! I'm getting so much better at interrupting or timing when somebody's going to end a sentence so I can get my word on it before there's a breath taken and someone else gets it. So I'm learning that. But more importantly, learning how to communicate in a different way so that when I advocated for children in their own own spirit, that my voice would be heard. And I'm learning. And still am learning how to do that more effectively. But it was a surprise to me that I needed to do that. I had worked in mixed working groups all my life. Fourthly, I had a self-revelation, and this is probably the most important one of all. I was doing baby dedications, and I had been speaking almost all of my adult life, and teaching parents a situation, so I couldn't figure out why. To me, a three-minute or a five-minute presentation felt so big and so rainy to me. And then I figured out this was different, this was very different than any other kind of speaking I ever did. I was speaking truth, needing to use the word, and I was so concerned about the fact that it needed to be empowered and it needed to be his, not mine. And then I began to question, as I went through that struggle, whether I should be doing what I'm doing at all. And it was a very private struggle. I remember going to the bookstore, and I bought every book I could find on the shelf about living in the history. Now, I have heard things. I had no problem accepting that position, but I needed to work through the issues for myself. I needed to understand the other side as much as I understood this position. And so I studied it. I bought a Hebrew and Greek Bible so that I could study the word study and compare it with what others said. And finally, the rest of the group came out to be comfortable with the physician. And out of that, the resulting growth came out of that, was confidence in the fall. I mean, I feel like I've been talking about it right now because it was such a powerful and important point in my journey. I was no longer feeling like I was a leader trapped in a woman's body. And that could not be the picture. It could not possibly be the picture thing. So I'm motioning in every now about who it is that I'm called to be. And that is a fully devoted woman loving and serving him every else of my view. Wherever he puts it, wherever that means. And my obedience to that call is what matters to me and it's why I'm here. What am I grateful for in this dream because it has been a wonderful one. A full and wonderful one. I feel at home with it and at peace about it. no matter how hard it gets. I've received encouragement and support, the likes of which I can't even begin to tell you. And lastly, I am grateful for the opportunity to serve and to grow, because it is a constant challenge. The next guest is from the Apostle Paul Church, and the Temple of the Council of the War. He served as a program for the child's church churches, and by the Baptist Church, No, they wouldn't do that sort of thing. You have to be careful what you do. Four years. Four churches over 100 years ago. 20 years. 20 years. Penny was the second woman ever ordained in the context of the Baptist Church Conference. She has a master's of community degree. She is almost completed her doctorate of ministry degree with an emphasis on creation. Right? Right. And this is a good one. Right now she teaches preaching at the Baptist Seminary. That's great. Hi, my students are here. I know. And she's currently the Senate Senior Pastor role at the Baptist Church downtown. Right? Take it away. Welcome. Thank you. It is so much fun to be here. I get your two extra minutes. You didn't use it. So keep the time keeping it. We're all going to follow sort of the same format. So I will start with my childhood, too, and roll right on. I grew up in a very different Christian family who believed in me, believed I could be anything on earth that I wanted to be. And I probably expected me to grow up to be president. And I'm not disappointed, but we're all sort of surprised at the way it turned out. I can remember we were always involved in the church, very, very involved in the church. And I taught Sunday school before I was born because the people who said I was their teacher looked to me like they're my age. But I remember going to church camp for probably the tenth time. The year I was, the 13th. And there was a campfire at the close that night. There was an invitation to come forward and put a sticking fire in the college a full time for two weeks. And I just felt that so strongly. And I got up and I did that and I sat down and I repented of that for the next 15 years. Because I didn't know any way to be in full-time Christian service except to be in missions. And I was real clear that wasn't me. So I thought, well, I just didn't understand what was going on and what it was with, you know, you're a white kind of mother and a very disabled volunteer. And I was all of those things. And I think I showed that moment sort of to the back of my mind, knowing I had been missing in that group. And I was a very busy wife and mother, and I'm an active, active volunteer. I've got two children, and that's when I'm not children. And I had a degree in English, secondary education, and it was time to go out what the next piece of my life was going to be. I went to Oklahoma and I went to the Old World Law School and we all go to the master's teaching English. I don't even remember who said she'd go to the seminary. Well, that's an interesting idea. I'm so involved in the church and already directing the Christian Idol School and teaching a college and career class. I started at Rep. Seminary when I was 30. I took one class of quarter, backwards and sideways and upside down, for seven or eight years. I started off with a degree in Christian education. And after being called into serving the church that I was going to, I switched my degree to the new nursing degree, which was a master's degree degree. And in doing that, really crossed the line of things that I grew up with being a master's degree. I still didn't think too much about it because it was just a different degree. And I took the preaching classes because you were supposed to, and I took the first preaching class to come from Jim Mason. And I sat down after I did my thing, and the eight-minute circle of evaluation looked at him and said, what do you do for preaching? And I said, well, then I'm giving it back. Do you do that here? I said, I don't have any use for that. This would be just foolishness. And it was my last year of seminary, and I struggled so quick on earth to this day, because now this was over a line. I knew women didn't do those kinds of things. But what was I going to do? I entered the preaching contest at the seminary just to kind of check that out. Well, you know, if you think this is such a good idea, fine, here. And I was the first person I entered on the preaching contest, and it meant more to me than it really means to anyone else on the face of the earth. It's not quite a big deal. But it was just this huge affirmation, this is what I want you to do. This is what I'm thinking you can do. And I graduated from seminary with no church to go to and no place to do ministry. And good education people said, hey, we don't know. Try to start a church in the basement. And we don't have a place for you. By then I'd already served in two churches and had just wonderful experience. And after about six months, it took probably to ask about this church and sometimes. And we really would love to come out here and say, oh, it's not what I want to do. I said, no, no, no, we like somebody who's interested in it. We like somebody who's concerned about their children, and it's not the job you think it is. It's the past year. It's the same. It's a whole range of things. So I went there, and I thought, well, I graduated with a Massachusetts degree, and the two things I can never change are I certainly never did. Well, maybe I can share the future. And one day, I would hear this song, and she'd have been a person who was in the church. So, beginning to go through that process, when he's talking about maybe we would share surprises, my whole life, you can just write, surprise! When people say to me, what are you doing here? Hey, I'm more surprised than anybody else on the face of the earth. I never thought any of this up. And maybe that's a good thing, because it is so extraordinary. You know, I think people shouldn't. Sometimes people have taken that the wrong way. If God tells you to do something, you may need to take some initiative. My story is, no initiative, doors wide open, you'd have to be a fool. That's what you're supposed to watch here. It had to be that clear to everybody. In the process of my admission, three times been involved in different levels. Every single time, it was made in the same way. And that's just so clear. You know, nobody can say this is confusing. No, this was real clear. and got under right big on the wall. It was pretty much that kind of thing. It was the first place to be in my position and found out that a lady pastor was so much more appealing than she was already employed at another church. Because I've been told by a lot of people, ooh, we would really love you if you're ever available. Well, when I was suddenly available, it was like, hmm, you don't really think so. So I went eventually to a church that I wouldn't have been my first choice at all to a ministry position, I knew it wasn't very, just only marginally. The time was passed and it wasn't only children's history. Those were some of the parameters that it fell into. In a lot of ways, as a woman in ministry, I have felt like it. I'm squeezed into places that other people wouldn't be squeezed in. No man with that kind of education would get the message to be in that kind of position. But the result of it was that I was in a great place to learn a million years ago and so I was about to have fabulous lessons in the past. I began in the process from there and I learned a lot more teaching, essentially in the back of the teaching. I was involved during that time into a really good education at the center, which just means just a huge gift to me. And so I loved doing my work. I resigned that position last night, and I was sent by a leader forever. It did, it did, and I was here in the church, and I was just like, Lord, for it now. When I had the last part of church, I would be considered a senior pastor if I would be interested. And I told him, hey, last time, I was a favorite of his son. And I really see you have to be mad at something like that. I didn't do it. I just didn't want to do it. And I really believe that's true. I don't think it's just that I didn't think I'd ever get the chance in our denomination, but I just don't think I wanted to do that. And now after a number of encounters with this congregation, I'm really beginning to not be a part. They are willing to do something like an argumentation. It was so absolute astonishing that all of us was, because it couldn't really be something like that. So I found myself standing in a place I wouldn't have been, even too much, even too much. And now knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt, that God has brought me through all kinds of different places, and I've been training and trying to be in this place. of this kind of thing. Finally, at age 50, with a couple of fancy degrees between my name, I'm able to, I believe, stand up straight and strong and say, this is how I am. These are the things I've done. It is the thing that I've done. I'm just, I am the thing that I've done. I will claim that to my son. And that has been very hard for me to say. because it's confusing for me to say it differently, to be softer, not to not acknowledge that in quite the same kinds of ways. When I went down to work in a soccer like that, well, I'll be quiet, I'll sit in the back row, I don't know as much as they do, they're all men, they preach all the time, they preach their occasion, they're totally different. They're rolled into a completely new package. And it's something spectacular. And for me to begin to embrace that, as I went down there, I looked at myself and I thought, you know what, lady? You of all people who are so confident. I really am. I cannot. I feel the pain. I have a message. But every single day of my life, I have so much, some place in the middle of the table. You just are. You just are. You don't really. No more. This is who God is making. And if that's something wrong, it's taken into another level of ministry and fun. It doesn't make my stuff any more important. It doesn't make me any more important than anyone else's. But I am able, I believe, at this point, this time has taken care of me. And it has been so much fun for me. People don't know what to do with a lady pastor. Two fabulous stories. You just never know what will happen to a lady pastor. People are incredibly rude, or they're very funny. There was a janitor at church number, this is good, because now there's so many, no one will know. A janitor who did not know what to do with the lady pastor, he was so thrilled. And he had this huge voice, he'd go, Pastor Penny! And just he had a pot of me on the back. He not only did it once, he did it twice. The first time someone does that, I'm just always so stunned. And then the second time I thought, you know, I just can't put this guy's way away. He doesn't know any better. But then I ran into him on the street one day with my daughter, and I thought, if he doesn't, I'm going to get him. My very best story, though, is a little girl in the congregation I was in last. Her mother said to me, I just want you to know that my daughter's not from Barbies anymore. She said she sweeps off the coffee table. It was Thanksgiving time. She takes the horn of plenty and gets safe like this. She stands up on the carpet table and she says, I am playing cast to Penny. I'm going to tell you a story. To be able to model that for not only the book for us, but any. The next guest is Sarah Anderson. Sarah is... Thank you....... Well, I come from a long line, I should say, I'm a third generation ministry person. My father was a PK, and my grandfather and grandmother were involved in the college and taught there all their lives. Parents went to the mission field, I grew up in the mission field, an MK, and I spent the first 11 years of my life being born overseas. That was a very traumatic experience. I have a very strong opinions about children. And I grew up as a lost child. I'm sorry, just some of the things. Very quiet and just open. And I spend most of my time watching and asking God to bless you. I'm a very, very serious child. And we moved back to the United States because my parents' marriage was falling apart. And my father was afraid of losing his children. My kids, my son, my son, my son, my son, my son, my son, my son, my son, my son. And so I decided to come back to America and put the family back together. And I'm forever grateful my parents for making a very difficult decision. My father-in-law are still in full-time position. They are still supported by the students, the commissionaries, and they work at Bible College that my grandmother and my grandfather died last year. My grandmother is still a teacher, which is fine. And my father is an associate dean. So I come from a strong heritage. And my grandmother, incidentally, comes from a family where her mother signed her name, I May Bolt. Her name was Isabel May Bolt. She was one of them. She's one of the suffragettes here in the Minneapolis area. And she signed her name, I May Bolt. My grandmother was the first woman's fiber side teacher in the state of Minnesota, and physical ed teacher, and fiber teacher, and both of us. And so on this issue, I oftentimes feel a little schizophrenic, because I have very strong models of women in ministry that is almost unconscious to me. But also, the cultural stuff around women in ministry is so strong in the U.S. and women's history that I'm very effective with that as well. So, when I went to college, I went to Bible college and took women's issues from my grandmother and studied women in ministry from my grandmother. And came to pretty much the same conclusions that we discussed in this class. And that was easy for me, arriving at a head to understand the issues. But emotionally, that's been very difficult. I moved down here into the city. I became involved in Open Door. And discovered in my own life that the only thing that I get excited about is teaching work out. I'm a girl, a girl, a girl, a girl, a girl. How do we do that? And how do we do that? And I became aware that I had a gift of communication, a gift of teaching. And I loved it. I loved being involved in here at Open Door and the kids in the classroom. I've been so much for a long time, and nothing gets me more excited than that. But it has taken a lot of people talking an awful lot in my ear to help me emotionally stand with them. And I entered a seminary this last year, kicking the screen, literally, with God. I went because I knew that it was no longer about whether I should, it was really a way. And so I went because it was what I was supposed to do. And I found this last year in seminary, one of the most painful years in the world. I discovered that as a woman, I did not think about the men, I did not think about the men, I did not think about the men. I did not write about the men, not the top, but the men. Thank you. People don't necessarily understand the way it's functioning. It's not an accepted way of ministering. It's not the accepted way of speaking. It's not the accepted way of preaching. So that's a place in this dream that you might find. It's not about whether or not you're very strong about that. You're allowed to not see the fact that you're not allowed to. How do I do that without selling myself? Without becoming masculine and more. Yes. And that's why I'm here. I've been on the elder board. That has been just an incredible experience for me. Every time God has moved me into ministry, he's always given me a two-sided message. One side was children should leave. The kingdom of God is for those who are in a place where I don't know what to do. I need someone to help me. I'm listening to God. It's about when Ezekiel said, Lord, I can't do this. And God said, don't set me to stop. I apologize. And another thing is a very strong conviction of knowing that God has put that word in me. And it is deep in me. And it is there for reason. And it's not right for me to come. For God to come. It's been a real honor to serve here at Open Door on the public board. I just want people to know that I have never felt ignored before. any issue with my human woman. Personally, that's the most issue with that is myself. Learning to speak up and to compete in that environment, to say what's on my heart and to believe that I have the right to say that. I find that I struggle with that woman in the relationship. So, I guess I would share from that perspective again, I do feel that God is asking my ancestors to my parents to me, to share my work with us by the Lord, to share the word, to share the word, to share the word, to share the word, to share the word. When I had the opportunity to speak two years ago here in that public, it was an incredible experience for me to speak the word. It was so in me. I couldn't tell. I've never been pregnant, but it was just, I just had this thing that I had to give away. It was one of those privileged places I ever had. And I knew that God knew that. And when I listened to myself on tape, I didn't even sound like me. I knew that. It was a perfect person to me. I knew that God knew that. It was wonderful. My father heard me speak that Sunday. And my mother was ecstatic, which she doesn't mean to express emotion. And my father, who's very emotional, didn't say anything. And it was very confusing to me. And so my father and I went for a while. And I was shocked about it. And he said, you know, I know that is wrong here. I know that this is what you're supposed to do. He said, well, I never knew you were talking to me. And you said, you know, what a contract. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. God is doing good, and I'm still in process. Just to say that, come to get back. I came to the Lord at the age of eight. My dad led me to the Lord. Wonderful story there. It was on devotions. I did the devotions. Mom would play the kids and love the songs, and it was on the bed. That night, it hit me by the tablets. that mom and dad were saved, and I had never ever been to God in the relationship with Jesus Christ. And at that moment, I had some business to do. And so my dad led me to the Spirit of the Holy Spirit, the way of salvation, and assurance of salvation. And I prayed that prayer, and we knew that night, I was eight years old, that I not only asked forgiveness to sin, but I had dedicated my life one more percent to Jesus Christ. and I was 100% in this kind of world, whatever that would be. I had no idea. But I believe at that moment I felt a strong call for what you would call maybe a full-time Christian church. Somewhere where I could be in the world and be in the world, having a free time to see that you're ever in the world. That morning, I got all my brothers and sisters, six of them, no, five of them, out of the bunk beds, gathered around, And what did I do that first morning? Best that I could, I was a lightning divide that would have died. My Bible is well underlined, and so I went through the whole plan of salvation. And if they would fall, you know, for John 1, 9, I went through that. And I wanted to make sure that my brothers and sisters knew clearly the kind of situation. So evangelism has always been in my heart, following through, I went to school, didn't use Christ. I'd get a minimum. High school, I led my boyfriend to Jesus' Christ. I really had a hard for me. I'd never do me. It's right because it's a key. You can call. You can call. You can call. It's something that never goes away. It calls you're trusting. You know you need calls. You're trusting. I have a experience. and early on then, hearing the call to missions. I think that's because the only model I've ever seen of any woman in the ministry wants to missions. That's all the model I have. And so at an early age, committed myself, I would have ever seen some missions to get this work. And, uh, Baker High School, vibrant, vibrant, and vibrant, actually, to the point where, on two different occasions in the church, I was asked to give you a message. And, as you said, I just love to give you a little dad. And to the best of my ability is a 12-year-old. And really, seriously, that's just really true. I think that's another confirmation. Angevity peace brings us the joy of the service of self. I mean, the confirmation of everything. And I mean, the very many of the confirmation coming after this, having to get slapped on the butt. But, yeah, I got one of these side shoulder hugs. You know, just strong words of encouragement. I guess, strong wisdom. So, I'll come to the Bible College, and I think that's the biggest shock in my life. And I looked at you, so there's some support for me to use. But when I got to Bible College, there just seemed to be already a high level to set up. You see, all presidents are boys, all vice presidents are girls. And on and on it goes. And that was a great disturbing piece for me. And that's the most recent things that I saw in my hand. I don't know if that is particularly, but I think at this end of my life, I started to speak into a hundred people. I think that's the type of loss. I've stolen my life, but already I've been marginal in this process. I'm not really what to do. I'm not really what to go. But staying true to what God would call me, because it's you. It's just staying true. Wonderful God led me to a wonderful man of God. He's not threatened in any way by my gifts and values. In fact, I believe part of our meetings corresponds to the year. And it's interesting that several of these is this past in the year. And one of them that passed, well, I don't know, this is the past, this is the past. He said, one church is two. He said, you choose two parts. And so what he wanted in marriage, the joy of Jesus with people is not you pretending I had less gifts than you. Suppose I had three gifts and you had two. You know, because you're like pretending I have one? No. You know, he was loving enough to acknowledge that gift for you. I'm wanting in some way to come together and see what's going on in the world. And that's exactly the way it's going on in the world. And praise God. He's been my greatest cheerleader in the world of not necessarily believing myself. I've seen myself on the kind of edge of living in the ministry that has been my strongest support. I think one of the painful pieces too. Here I went through a whole degree, four years of Christian education. I went through that process. I come back to my home church, and it's so noted that we have a need for a Christian education. I was a Christian. I was completely overwhelmed. I wanted to choose. The only one with a degree in this capacity. And they hire a UPS member. I have nobody against UPS now. Because if you wonder, what is this all about? You know, what is this all about? But eventually, God did bring the Desirement Heart, the second one of the seeds. And that was a wonderful education in itself, too. It's kind of a weird place out there. It really is. There is so much to do that, at least in the 30 years, the victims are jumping their own office meetings, and at least in some ways, they're going to sit down. But when it came to actual meetings, hiring or electing people for office, it was just kind of a silly thing that a woman knew and there was one woman, very different, She was, this is just what she did. She was wrong. There was so much of a message there. She was definitely a good message there. She was a lot of that. But this moment of the place happened there, it just emerged from courage. We had one woman, we had a new person this morning, gifted church. We struggle a little bit in a lot of things, but this is kind of a hard time, She's a woman in the town. And what's that all about? And really, you have a woman coming from North America, and as a gift of preaching, a boy can't she preach. And what do you do with all that? In God's name. God gave her a wonderful place. She's got very good. You need to take this in your kid. You need to take this in your kid. And so it's wonderful to see the lot is opening up. It's a great place to be in your business. I'll tell you another story. and a woman in Argentina. She's a missionary. Both of you, the summer, in Argentina, and I personally do with a woman in the first place. So I didn't really know what to do with her. After she graduated, so we decided to be a northern part of Argentina. She was a smothering woman. She was a preacher. She was an organizer. And it wasn't enough. She had six years. And that church was real. And it was up to about two times. Pumped. So, what happens with all these people going, you know, in the capital city, they're getting pretty interested in this new site. So what the church did is they kind of sent some of the man up and they evacuated her. So it was kind of an embarrassing thing to have the largest church in Argentina coming in the house. So what they did is they took a lot of time to talk about it. I'm sure they're going to shift the religion of the bottom half. Do you know how long that's in here? Okay. Do you know how long that's in here? About six years ago, that changed. He was going to be the most traditional. It's a hard to argue that he's a success. A little interesting. And we have to understand. Those have this physical challenge. in that moment or not as well as students trying to be out of the direction, a lot of times when people are concerned, it's beautiful and you can. And after those two churches, the Argentine woman is contemplating her and is not separate from the most because she's not alone. And so what the Argentine women along these two years do is, like, they're teaching this literature. The first early woman who changed my mom's the Colorado Springs, our headquarters found out about this. Didn't know what, and so how do you unordained a Christian? So she remains unordained, ministered to Christian and Christian Alliance, and just all that stuff. God is leaving the God of Christian. That's it. I have been challenged in my heart. I was born in Chicago. And they went through the big grants, and they've never done it before. But they've done so many great advisors in church colleges in American history. And there are so many women there. And they're really sick. And I hear what that's true. But she kind of denied the call of God on his own. And how she used it. So God is calling me. And he's like, Thank you. And in that church, she was just attending. And she became three half years old. And five half years old, she became the social pastor of that church. And she was attending the church. And before that, it was the office board. And so I got the five half years old. And then the years after that, she became the social pastor. And then also, she was just that responsibility. Thank you. with each one. With me, I share a wonderful family, Christian families I love and became aware of Jesus' love for me as a high girl in a Sunday school class after a presentation with the Word of Spock. So if you are a Sunday school teacher and you're using these really beneficialistic methods, they work and they stay with you for a long time. My family was very voluntary. My parents shared goals very easily. My dad was very instrumental. He came to me at every point in my life to do whatever I wanted to do. I think that has always been a background. We didn't realize the significance of that until much later. But when I wanted to become a public school teacher, I was concerned about education when I was really young. I was one of those tutors in elementary classes, and I was going to get other kids and help them out and so on. I really enjoyed that. And even then, when I expressed that desire to my dad, he said, well, maybe someday he will be the principal. When I was taking a little position as a Wattag writer for a local newspaper, and when I took that part-time job, I went home and said, well, maybe you would be the editor. And it constantly fed me those kinds of positive impressions. So when I became interested in actually, I said, well, Thank you. about the issues five and we discussed the issue of submission and what that meant. It wasn't particularly promoting women's roles at that point. I don't think they're too much about the emphasis as a subject or senior. But I did have a powerful sense of why speaking to me about it is that someday you are going to know more about this passage and about this whole issue of relationships between men Thank you. and how to transact with the spiritual design, and went to all of the Scottish and Bible studies in a long philosophy, history, and all of those studies that we emphasize that the difference is the higher, higher, the role that they're now is open for them at that time. And we listened to those, and we did not know how to evaluate them. And so this kind of manifestation, She spent time in the year. She got married. My second child, by his time, she was just a student. He wanted him to send a class and did not know he was involved. My son was really born. So I was a little bit sporadic with my son's work. And it's not very good. You know, we have a guest couple who are representing students. It was perfectly familiar, like I said. I think you have heard me have them. They were one of the first of the summer period to go around doing their jobs and teaching. And I'm going to go as in the church. This would have been about 19 years ago that I wanted to do this in the past. What I heard that day was so good that I changed me that way from another. I think things all together made sense in ways that have never been explained or understood by me before. And I walked out of that sense of past, and I wanted to remind you, I wanted to speak the world, what they were talking about that day. I walked out in my day, in the weeks, which is a block that I've had to say, I said, this is the most incredible news that I've ever heard. This is true of their son. We need to feel that just because we need to do this. We need to do this. This is the most incredible news ever. Not everybody in that room, I would like to talk to you about this. So incredible. Yes. And I sat in the front row, not seeing the reaction, what was happening behind me, But that question answered, you know, why she was a pastor in office? And you know, two percent back. And as a help, he just explained the word. He gave scripture and said, look, all things we are going to do. And yet the class didn't even get on our way. Nothing more was done to develop what was done. It just died. My son was running low. I went for years still attending the church, but not seeing any difference in the way you can perceive them, let alone practically, as you can. Many years later, I began to do this education where I chose a kid, and he was hired to me to be corrected. One couple, from the first time I was told, has been invited to be a good person that Thank you. I'm looking at the fact that when you are in the program, you have to preach the word for your credentials. So we put our church in the position of having to incite joys in preaching as part of this college. Okay? So it was just a matter of time. It was like a time you'd come up to come up. And all of a sudden, we had to incite you. We allowed you to do this to get good and great you through our church. Thank you. I don't know. to do this, you have to keep going around. You can go around with the kids, so you have to teach them. You can do it. I was, at that time, just beginning to go back and do it. Of course, I had been a student at my mom for three years, my kids were born, and I was ready to receive a master for giving up a faculty education and enjoy the system. You need to go to school. You can do this. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. And she said, well, one day, by then I went back and started teaching free school just to get my work back to the board of education. And as a picture in our eyes, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Wednesday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and we talked about this. This was the first Sunday introduction, the political polygon, this person who lives, was awesome. He's great. He's great. No, so it was, if you will not go somewhere, at least sign up and take the political polygon. And Berkeley Michelson, your idol, he's close, he's close to attainment. You know, I did, I was, I was, I was, you know, he was, he was, I might have some man who spent time studying women's roles. What are they doing? That's what I thought. That you actually invest in scholarship. You can invest in, you know. It was incredible to me. I thought you were in different organizations in my world. And that's really what I did then. So I was just good. So I said, do it. Take a class. Because then you can say, do it. I was just a little bit of a conversation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I love you. Thank you. I have never thought of being in any kind of professional ministry. And I'm still not sure why I'm here. So it sounds to me like we've got people that grew up knowing that that's what it is. I, on the other hand, was so bossy as a kindergarten that it seemed obvious that I should be a teacher. So I went to Bethel, and I picked up a teacher today, and married my husband. And he had a psych degree, and was best friends in the United States. They were crazy. I was going to give all those stories for me. I did teach art and theater for eight years. in public and private school, and then had this child that we had been praying for for years. My husband became ill with a disease that eventually, by the past six years, died from. And that turned me into a tailspin of a state-of-my-mom, who had different complications, who had not any, I didn't have less faith in God. My faith changed completely because the theology that I had kind of assumed in America was that God would never give more than the people of God and that he would always rescue me. And if you just get it right, God would take care of you. And it wasn't a name and a name. And I just think in America, we are kind of assuming that that's our right. And to cast out the circumstances that men have been standing under, then for which the story is going on, then they have blood transplantation, they have hepatitis, and it wasn't even normal in this process. So theologically, what happened to me was I was asking questions that my friends weren't really comfortable with, And church is going to be in school. So one of my friends here at Baptist University said, Beth, why don't you try taking a class in Canada, who was the only woman on staff that led assembly meetings? And I called her and said, do you think that this would be appropriate for me? This was one year after my husband's death. I have now a five-year-old at home. And this was the first time that I was going to enter back into the center. I went and took five back-to-back classes for that time who led me to a new relationship with God, new ways of understanding who God was, and didn't give me answers to why God was like tragic circumstances. but brought me to a place where I was comfortable with what had happened and felt for the first time that I had something to give back. I was taking a ministering to singles class from her and came to visit Open Door because it was part of an assignment. And it was a brunch where my son and I were both able to come at that time, it was kind of the seven. And I came to this brunch and I was really impressed. I had visits with other singles groups in town. And I knew that they weren't coming for one thing. Singles groups start at the same time to bring a child to bed. I don't know if that's ever, you know, you can come up with that. My husband and I have been involved with couples, leading lots of couples things at our church. I have done all the studies together. I was used to being in the church. The ultimate, wondrous place for me was our church. Because my partner wasn't there. It was my working space. I was used to partnering with my church. So for me, I wrote a paper in this Western Deceit class about Western Deceit class, and I kept this template paper saying, any church of any size would have Western Deceit class if they were just to face these things that they really wanted to, and they wouldn't take any of it to their team. I asked a rhetorical question, and they said, is this only for me too? I don't know, write a paper about who am I supposed to think about this on the course. I called Barry Brown, who was the singles pastor then, during the week after we had come to visit, who was the best way to, what we had seen, the singles group there. And I called him and I said, really innocent, Barry, do you have anything to see the parents? And he said, no, we'd like to start something in the fall. and we'd like to hear about it. Well, at that point, I was terrified because I knew the problems that I was going through as a single parent. So I had no idea of ever doing anything professional in ministry. I was absolutely right for my own personal experiences. And so I said, Gary, let's talk about it, let's think about it. I said, well, just come in for an interview. And I did. And they offered me the job. And I said, I need to think about this. I prayed about it, thought about it, went on an open-door retreat. And after retreat, I knew that I wanted to learn how to do this. So I said, okay, fine. I don't have any idea what I'm doing. I'll just come in and keep doing this. That was five years ago. And it seems that there's been a lot of things that, because we've seen it through, it's pretty easy to know what's going to help the devil's feet of hands. So it hasn't been something that I've felt like my seminary exposure has been a factor in really great into. But just being a sort of hurt has given me some of the tools that I need to know how to do this. I continue to take classes at the seminary, not because it was a joy. I don't think in the ways that seminary teaches, and what Sarah was saying is absolutely true. An art theater person just doesn't sit still well in the library, doesn't feel well, feel quiet. It's really beyond my stretch to be about taking my class at night. Even this morning, I called the registrar's office to see how much my wealth event I dropped the class at night right now. This is how desperate I am to get out of seminary. Okay, so I don't know whether or not I have to stay in seminary to be better equipped to put it. What I do know is that open door has only been placed with a disability pastor. I think I'm not going to be the only person to see that it actually has been passed through the world with my own women. I don't know if that's true. But that's who my constituency is. 30% of the people that are in my senior kids are full-time dads. You know, you think that moms always have kids. That's not true. And I have had people ask me questions as to what I am doing in the ministry. Sometimes that's about my personality more than it's about my family. But that's so feisty. And I'm just not a kind that does teaching. I teach you. But I don't ever know. Every child that never calls me to do that. I don't know. What I know about Open Door is I have felt the ramifications of them embracing me. I'm a person who is raising him in the next week. Barry, when he was here, was the most influential person. He'd been doing what I was doing because I felt like I was in it in my head. Oftentimes, because the complexity of doing ministry with civil rights sometimes, are things that no one could figure out where I'm in the creation of. And I have felt support from the people that I've been in history with. I have felt support from the staff. And it's really been a great experience. I haven't noticed that I was a woman. But yes, I am a woman in history. And it's been a great experience. So I don't think I've saved my story so much. I'm wondering if I'm staying with you. I don't think I've ever been to the end. Thank you.
