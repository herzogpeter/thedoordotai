Let's pray. Well, God, what I want to pray for this morning is a clear, laser-like, compelling word from you that would drive through the chaos and the confusion and the violence and give us a clear invitation into who you are and who we are. We don't need to talk, God. We need your word. Amen. Okay, if you were not with us last week, then you don't know that we jumped back into the book of Colossians. We jumped into Colossians 3, verses 18 and 19. Two very boring, very tame verses. I would like to read them to you. If you have your own Bibles or your iPhones or Droids or whatever you have, you can feel free to use them without shame. unless you're playing Angry Birds and then you want to put the mute on. So, okay. Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord. And husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. And I talked about last week how this topic can be one of these three things. It can be a theological argument that we can strap on the boxing gloves and we can go at it. and we can line up all the reasons why we believe what we believe over on this side, and we can believe all that, and someone else can figure out all the reasons they believe on that side, and we can bring in two people from two different sides to have a big debate, and we're not going that way because we're talking about actual marriages and actual lives, and marriages don't function well. We're going to have a theological discussion about it. That's important, but we're not going to have a theological argument about it. You also may come in as it relates to men and women in marriage, and you have a foregone conclusion. You know what you believe. You're great in what you believe. You do not need help in what you believe. Thank you very much. So Steve, you can lay out some interesting homiletical theories, but I am where I am, and I'm not moving. Thank you. More likely, when we talk about men and women in marriage, whether you're married or single or were married and aren't married anymore, it's a huge reservoir of pain for people. And I think this is the most true of most of us as we dive into this subject, that whether you're a man or a woman, there's just all kinds of pain, either that you've received or that you've doled out. And the pain is so crippling that I think there's a part of you that just wants to get up and go, just get up and run, just run for your life. get out of the room and go to a church that's talking about a tamer topic. And so it's one of the things I love about Open Door is that we just go there. And so we're going to go there into our pain and into our identity. And my prayer for all of us is that we would receive an invitation from God about who we are. So last week, Jen and I looked at Colossians 3. It has a parallel passage in Ephesians that goes into more depth in it. So we jumped over there, and Jen primarily was talking to women about submission, and she read these verses, Ephesians 5, 21 and 22. Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. And that's speaking to all believers everywhere. The call is to submit to one another. It's not just the wife's job. It's not just the cousin's job. It's everyone's job. If you call yourself a follower of Jesus, then you're called to submit to one another. And then wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. And Jan, I think in such a beautiful way, kind of pulled the question behind the question back and said, you know, what this really is for most of us is an invitation to let go of our need to control. Remember that? She talked about being confronted with this reality that it's so hard for her as a woman being married to a man to admit that sometimes what's important for her, what's most important for her is to be in control. And she has this, remember she said this, I have this theory that I am right. All the time. And the first invitation to submission is to put that down. To trust that God is a God of wholeness and God is a God that can bring people together. And we looked at the husbands. Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. And we even looked at this Greek word kephale, which is translated head for husbands are the head of the wives. And that's just another boring and tame verse, which we could write books and books about. But we found that kephale does mean head, but it means head in the sense that the head is the extremity of the body. That it's the tip of the spear, it's the top of the wall. And so what I called the husbands of Church of the Open Door to is to think about your marriage in a much different way than thinking about the question, who's in charge? that I said husbands, the picture of being the head in your marriage is to be all in, fully engaged. Whether it's fighting or whether it's moving toward, which can be one and the same thing, it is you are in, you are engaged. You are the first person to lay your life down for your wife. That's what it means to be the head, as Christ was for the church to be the first in. And so the invitation, husbands, was to think about it in a much more sacred way than the question of who's in charge. The question is not about authority. It's about unity. And then we looked at the questions that husbands ask of their wives. And this basic question that most husbands are afraid to ask their wives is, are you keeping a scorecard on me? Because it feels like you are, and it feels like I'm failing. And remember, I shared a story about my trip to the grocery store and my trip home and all these decisions that I make in life that are, you know, somewhat big. And here I was standing in front of the two bottles of olive oil freaking out because they didn't have the olive oil that my wife put down on the list. And what am I going to do? I'm texting messages to Mary with pictures of the olive oil because if I get the wrong olive oil, I will have failed completely as a husband. Well, that's a small picture of what goes through our insecure minds as males. Am I getting it right? And so I asked you wives that if you could have the grace to sometimes look at your husbands in the eye and say, Honey, I love you. Thank you for doing what you do. And we looked at the question that I think most wives are afraid to ask their husbands, and it's this question, do you really see me? And I got a message, that is so cool. This one husband, I'm not going to mention his name, Phil Halverson, but I got a message from his wife, and what he'd done was he'd put like dozens of post-it notes all over the house in places like the garage door opener and the light switch saying, I love you. I see you. I like you. I'd pick you again. And I mean, I was like, you know what? I heard messages about men doing it. I didn't hear one thing about a woman, you know, doing. So we won, men. We won. No. But I was so proud of, I was proud of the husbands at Open Door. I think that's just very sweet. So the movement in marriage is from this picture of two candles, which are very far apart, and one always has to be on top of the other, in authority to this picture right here. One united heart. Two distinct people, one united heart. And so we started with some invitations last week as we move into this series, which could be weeks and weeks long. This is week two. Invitation number one, search my heart, O God. Let me do my verse. We said this is going to be an elbow-free zone if you're sitting next to your spouse. Do your own verse. Let them do their verse. Search my heart, O God. And then invitation number two, what needs to be healed in me as we talk about this stuff? No matter where I'm at, there's probably things that need to be healed, so that's a good question for you to bring to God in your quietness. Also, as it relates to your spouse, where do I need to listen? Where do I need to just listen and shut up, frankly, and listen to their experience? And then, fourthly, to hold the mystery, that this is such a complex topic, and we're not going to cover everything in a couple of sermons. To hold the mystery. And we also just noticed, we noticed the single folks among us, and we said, listen, some of you married people need to understand that a person that is single is not in some way deficient. You don't need to spend all your time caring about whether or not they are going to get married or not. That some of us who are single are totally fine being single, thank you very much, that have a beautiful relationship with God. And getting married would be great or not, but that doesn't define what it means to be a whole person in any way, shape, or form. And so in some ways we said, hey, listen, let's celebrate the single people among us. And we are all a part of the body of Christ who can move toward one another and help one another. So I want to recommend this resource, Holy Sexuality by Becky Patton. Helped me in my talk this week. You can buy it in the bookstore of Becky Patton. It's been open door for many, many years. She's a good friend of mine. And I would say if you are interested in taking a step deeper in this topic with a study group or with your spouse or just by yourself, Holy Sexuality, Becky Patton would be the number one thing that I would recommend. Okay, that was review. Now we're diving into this week. In order, the question that really is, I'm going to try to answer this morning is, what is a fully alive man and what is a fully alive woman? And to answer that question, you have to go back to the beginning, back to Genesis, back to the garden. And before anything was created, before man and woman was created, before mountains were created and oceans and streams, there was this wild expanse of space, nothingness. And the Hebrew word is tohu vavohu, which is my absolute favorite Hebrew phrase in the entire Bible, because it sounds so amazingly cool. It could be the name of a band that I would play in. Tohu vavohu, it means wild nothingness. It means chaos and swirling masses of energy without any substance or harmony. And out of that swirling mass of chaos, the Lord God spoke a word and brought into existence a man and brought into existence a woman. Out of the chaos of nothingness, harmony and wholeness was created. That's what the word of God can do to your life, to your marriage, to your conflict. A siren, thunderbolt, word from God brings what you can't bring by yourself. Into your chaos, into your tohu vavohu, into your mess, the word of God comes with power. so let's look at how human beings were created Genesis 127 we read so God created human beings in God's own image in the image of God he created them male and female he created them so the question is what is the image of God if we are both created in the image of God male and female alike in the image of God the picture that most of us have is this. This is the image of God. Standing on high, passing out judgments, cold and stern, and definitely having a beard. You cannot picture God without a beard. But if you go back to this verse, If you notice it, what do you notice? In the image of God, males were created. And in the image of God, females were created. Females were created in the image of God. Males were created in the image of God. And so we move from this picture to this understanding. God is not one gender. Now that blows some of you away. I realize that creates all kinds of tension in some of you. Some of you are freaking out right now. Some of you want to run right now. But it's right there in the text. And it makes sense. Like God is not a male. You understand that, right? God is Father. God is Wonderful Father. But God is not only male. God is also not genderless. It's not right to say God is neither male nor female. No, God is genderful. The very best of male is what God is. The very best of female is what God is. And in that image is how we were created. In the image of God. Wholeness. Holding the very best of what is male and the very best of what is female. So let's jump with that understanding in mind. Let's jump into how the male was created. Genesis 2, 7 and then verse 18. And the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground. Awesome. now I got something to work with and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living being and the Lord God said this is so great I like this guy this guy's great but it's not good for the man to be alone so I will make a helper suitable for him but for Adam no suitable helper was found so the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs. Bizarre. Did he have a white lab coat on? And then closed that place up with flesh. And so as I was studying this, and the way I study the text is when I don't get something, I just read it over and over and over and over and over and over again, and I wait till words start jumping off the page. And this is a great way to read the text. Number one, with questions. What does it mean to have dust? What does it mean to have breath breathing in his nostrils? Does that really happen? I mean, what—and just to ask all your questions. And three words jumped off the page for me. These words, formed, took, and flesh. The word for formed in the Hebrew is very rough. It's like a piece of sheet metal and a blow torch that just—you're just taken something out of a matter and there you have this rough piece of sheet metal or a piece of wood that's carved out. It's very intense and rough. That's the word that's used when man is formed. So there's this sense that man has rough edges and a man is formed without, you know, tons of complex precision, but with edges that are going to need to be formed and shaped later on. And so it speaks to the journey that a man will need to go through in a man's life. And then this word took. It's so interesting. Why didn't God just take some more dust to make the woman and breathe into that woman's nostrils, the breath of life. Why was it necessary to take from what was in man? And so there's this picture of, you know, and this is getting weird, but God's having this conversation with Adam. And Adam, I know you've enjoyed your life here in the garden. It's been great, but you've been lonely and you've been doing some great work. Man, you named all the animals. That took a long time and it was awesome. He did an awesome job. I liked someone that was great, rhinoceros. That's very creative. But I'm going to cause you to fall into a sleep because we're going to do some surgery and you're never going to be the same. You're going to have to give something of yourself away so that some other life could come. And this life's going to be your partner, but you're going to have to submit to me and something that's, you don't know what's going to happen. But trust me, you're going to wake up and when you wake up, you're going to feel different and there's going to be a gift, but it's not going to feel like a gift at first when you're falling asleep. It might even feel like death. So this being taken, having man, having something taken from him is very crucial to understanding who man is. And then this word flesh, when God says, when I take this piece from you, I will close that up with flesh. And the word for flesh is very interesting. It literally has all kinds of generative meaning to it. It means to be red and rosy and life-giving, as if cells are dividing and multiplying within that space, life can come. The flesh in this term means to be generative. So from the very place that I take something away from you, life will come, man. So here's what I think it means to be fully alive as a man. A fully alive man is formed and shaped by God. He's learning that God brings life to others from the very place where he gives something of himself away. This is what it means to be a fully alive man. Formed and shaped by God, he's learning that God brings life to others, and frankly to himself, from the very place where he's willing to give something of himself away. And this goes completely countercultural to the tohu vavohu of our culture, which tells men to go and get whatever you want. And the great men that are lifted up in our culture are these isolationist, heroic, I am a rock men. I'm an island. I don't need anyone else. The picture of the ideal man in the scriptures is very different from that. Can you think of a time in your life when a man showed up in your life and gave something of himself away, maybe even himself being diminished, so that you or someone else around you could be lifted up? Remember last week, Jen Linwall and I spoke, and Jen spoke, and she told this story about when she was in college. And remember, it was like they had got into this debate, the guys and the girls in the class, about whether or not it was in the Bible that women should cook their dinner for their husbands. It's in the Bible, one of the guys said. And the reaction of Jen was to go out into the hallway and cry for 25 minutes. Now, when you go out into a room and have to cry for 25 minutes, as Jen noted, you realize it's no longer about cooking, right? is the thing behind the thing. This would be a good question for you always to ask yourselves, what's the thing behind the thing here? There's a huge reaction that I'm having, and it's not just about this conversation. It's about something way deeper. Well, after this service, this guy came up to us, and Jen and I were standing together, and one of you came up and just came right to Jen and goes, all right, I got three things for you. I mean, my first reaction was like, to stand, you know, like, bring it to me first, brother. but I you know I did kind of get a little closer you know to Jan but the first thing he said was he goes now was this college was it this one college she goes yeah he goes oh tears fill his eyes he goes I work at that college and then he leans in and he goes on behalf of all men I am so sorry that you experienced that. And I mean, that was just such a small thing, but it was like the fabric of the universe just kind of shifted a little bit in that conversation. Because a man, in a very small way, was willing to say, you were diminished in that moment. And it was from a man. And that was wrong. I'm sorry. When a man says he's sorry, I mean, it's chuckling because it's like, yeah, once the last time I heard a guy say he was sorry. Well, if we're going to understand what a fully alive man looks like, we have to look at what man is at his worst. What man is at his worst, controlled by selfish desire, unwilling to give of himself. He uses his power to either passively withdraw or violently take from others in order to get what he wants. There's a story in the scriptures that just terribly and beautifully illustrates this. It's found in 2 Samuel 13. In the course of time, Amnon, son of David, fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom, son of David, which means that he fell in love with his half-sister, which is disgusting. Amnon became so obsessed with his sister Tamar that he made himself ill. She was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do, not for him to do anything for her, to do anything to her. And the story goes on. He gets her alone, and his intentions become clear about what he's going to do. And she says, no, my brother, don't force me. Such a thing should not be done in Israel. Don't do this wicked thing. And so the man, Amnon, had the opportunity to be a fully alive man right there. But instead, he refused to listen to her. But since he was stronger than her, he raped her. And Amnon hated her, so interesting, with an intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. And this is what happens, men, when we choose to not give ourselves away, when we choose to use our power to dominate women. The result is women are hated. And a culture of misogyny is perpetrated every time a man decides that because he's stronger, what I want is what's important. Now, the interesting thing is the word tamer, the name tamer, you know, names matter in the Hebrew. The name Tamar means palm tree. It speaks to that which grows at an oasis. A palm tree grows in a place that is designed to bring restoration and rest for someone. So this is a question for Amnon. What does it mean to approach something that is meant to bring restoration, but instead you destroy it because you want to possess it rather than simply be restored. Men of Church of the Open Door, in the strongest way that I know how to bring, When you use your power to get what you want from women, you are causing death to yourself and death to women. So my strong invitation to you is get down on your knees and repent to the God that created you. and loves you. And God will lift you up. And God will forgive you. And God will set you on a path where redemption and restoration can happen. But you have to fall on your knees and ask God for forgiveness, man. And that will be your first act of giving yourself away. and bringing harmony to the tohu vavohu that is your life. Now, the good news is this can be done. It just requires incredible strength. But you have it within you to do. Let's look at women. How a woman was created. the Lord God said it's not good for the man to be alone thank God God noticed that thank you very much but then we read and let's notice what's in the room right now is silence and let's respect it and man you're doing your work and I I respect that and honor that and thank you for that So, as women are created, it is not good for the man to be alone. And then God says, I will make a helper suitable for him. Now, again, if you read the Bible with any kind of, you know, interest, helper suitable, suitable helper, does that bug anyone else? Really? That's the best language you could come up with for woman? A suitable helper? The picture I get is this. now i'm sure she's a lovely woman i'm sure she's a wonderful woman but this is not the picture of the woman that god created so let's dive into it genesis 2 20 and 21 for adam no suitable helper was found and the ironic thing is that that statement was made after the original statement was it's not good for man to be alone and then it said god looked at all the animals for any suitable helper. And then he said, I didn't find anyone for you. So I got to make one. So it's hilarious. A little comedy in Genesis 2. So the Lord God caused the man to follow him to a deep sleep. We read that before. And while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and then closed up that place with flesh. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken from the man. And he brought her to the man. And the man said, this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. and she shall be called woman for she was taken out of man. And you can just picture this. God brings woman to man for the first time. And his eyes were like, whoa. I mean, this was a huge gift. So what is woman? What does it mean? Well, first of all, the word made, God made woman, is very different than the sheet metal picture for males. It refers to that which is built requiring intricate details and complex construction. Banah is the Hebrew word. So females were made with complexity. Beautifully, intricately designed as complex beings. This is how God made you. Shouldn't be made fun of. Shouldn't be sarcastic about that. shouldn't be made to feel like you are deficient because you are complex. God made you that way. Now this phrase suitable helper, two words, ezer and konegdo. Ezer means help. It does mean help, but it's almost always used in the scriptures as a reference to the help that God brings. So that's pretty powerful help, right? I mean, it's when you're sitting down there in the middle of an absolute battle and you're like, I'm about to die. Someone better help me right now or I am going down. That's the kind of help that Ezer refers to. Psalm 121 talks about this help. I lift up my eyes to the mountains. Where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot slip. He who watches over you will not slumber. So the Ezer that the woman is in her name is a powerful, life-saving help that comes at the point where death is about to happen. And then kinegdos, this beautiful word, three parts to that word, keg, and then o, and ke means like or as, it's a conjunction in there, and then o is the man. Negged means face to face, corresponding to or opposite to, not like opposite as if you're completely opposite from me, opposite to, we are standing face to face, eye to eye, not even shoulder to shoulder, but face to face, eye to eye, we're in this together. Azerkonegdo means a face-to-face companion to man bringing strong, life-saving restoration. That's what woman is. That's a picture of strength that I love. A fully alive woman is this fashioned by God with intricacy and strength. She's learning to open up and provide a life-saving environment in which people can grow and be restored. I want to say that again. Fashioned by God with intricacy and strength, she's learning to open up and provide a life-saving environment in which people can grow and be restored. This woman came up to me after last night's service and she said, I think I have a story about what it means to be a woman. She goes, I work at this adult daycare and these older people who need help and these two older guys were about to get into this huge fight. I mean, one guy, his face was all screwed up, his fist was going back, and I stepped right in between them. I prevented the fight, and then I had to leave the room. And then I came back in, and I saw the guy that almost hit the guy, and his eyes were wide as saucers. And I could tell she said something went down in this room. And she came up to him, and she said, what happened? And he said, well, after you left, I hit him. And in that moment, she felt all the pain that was in that room, but not just from the person that got hit. She felt the pain of the person that did the hitting. And she sat down and looked him right in the eyes and started to drill down into why that happened and what the pain was that caused him to do that. And she validated him as a person, not taking away the violence that happened, but validating his existence so that he could grow and be restored. A tremendous picture of life-saving strength. That is what it means to be a woman. Amen? Now, men and women are a mixture of both. So it's not all one and all the other. Men are called to do that as well. Women are called to give of themselves. but the question of what is woman at her worst if that was a fully alive woman women at her worst rather than using her strength to open up and provide a life-saving environment she closes down and either consumes people or starves them and we've all met a woman like that that is inapproachable. And that when you're around her, it is not an environment you want to be around because you feel like, I'm not going to grow at all here. I'm going to get torn down. I'm going to get made to feel smaller than I am. And I'm going to either starve or be absolutely consumed. And that is women at her worst. And so the invitation for women is, Women, some of you need to hear the strong invitation from God to do the vulnerable thing and open up to God. That you need to understand that some of the pain that made you close down will only be healed, not at the hands of another man. It will be healed by the loving look and touch of God. The only way you will learn to open up is by listening to the God that has the strength to take care of you. And so you need to get down on your knees, women, And say, oh God, I have not trusted you. I've made it be all about myself. All about what I can control. I've shut people out because that's what I needed to do at one point in my life. But now I've shut you out too. So God forgive me and help me to open up. That's the invitation. So that you can be fully alive. A woman who opens up and provides a space where life can grow and be nourished and be restored. Or you can be the azer kinegdo that God called you to be. Now, after the work of creating, on the metaphorical sixth day in Genesis 1.31, we read this. It's almost as if God kicks back on God's deck. Looks out at all that God has made. And this is what God says. Now God saw all that God had made, and here it was exceedingly good. You, created in God's image, are exceedingly good. You need to fight the lie that you are worthless. You are exceedingly good. And there was setting and there was dawning the sixth day, the day that human beings were brought into the world. The only thing that God called exceedingly good was the man and the woman. But most of us would characterize the sense of our identity and maybe even our marriage as tohu vavohu, chaos, disharmony, and conflict. and so what is the journey from tohu vavohu to exceedingly good, back to exceedingly good? Can you go there? And this is what I want to say. Just like harmony and creation was only brought from the word of God, you getting back to exceedingly good can only begin by a word from God. So I want to lead you in a prayer. And I want to invite you all to stand for this. And if you, in your heart, want to move toward the image that you were created to be, this fully alive person, this fully alive man, this fully alive woman, then you just, I want to invite you just to put out your hands like this in this form of submission. As I read these words from Isaiah 58 over you, this is, I think, what God wants to bring you men and you women, and then I will pray for you. And the Lord will continually guide you and satisfy your desire in scorched places. and give strength to your bones. And you will be like a watered garden, like a spring of water whose waters do not fail. Those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins and you will raise up the age-old foundations, the identity of who you are. And you will be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of the streets in which to dwell. This is what God longs to do in your life. And now we pray, come Holy Spirit, into our woundedness, into those secrets that we have not told anyone. Give us the courage right now, God, to come to you exactly as we are and not as we should be. No pretending and no hiding. Our souls are laid bare to you, God, right now. And into that, come, Holy Spirit, and create a safe place for you to land. Men, some of you have used your power. All of us have used our power in one way or another to harm and we're controlled by our own lust. And right now, right now, man, you ask God for forgiveness. You bend your knee and submit yourself to the God that wants to make something new out of you, man. God sees you and you are exceedingly good. God will raise you up to become the man that God wanted you to be. And now women who have been so, so hurt and stepped on and made to feel as if you did not count, here is the Lord. Looking into the place of your deepest wound. And with a smile on God's face, God says, come to me. I am safe. I am raising you up. And you can ask God for forgiveness. for not trusting God, for closing yourself off to God and to everyone else. And you can, in this moment, ask God to help you to open again. And the word from God to you right now is you are whole. You are no longer broken. I am making you whole. The Lord God says to you, women. Now God, into our chaos, bring harmony. Into our death, bring life. because of the strong name of Jesus who died, descended, and also ascended because death could not hold him. Because of that name, we pray boldly and confidently that we can be forgiven and move into our true identity. Praise God. In your name, amen. you
