I'm picking up our study in verse 23 today. We've been in this chapter, the 18th chapter, for some weeks now. And what we're learning in chapter 18 is some powerful lessons. The overall theme, I would say, of Matthew 18 is simply this, that every one of us who are redeemed are like children. And like children, one of the things we need to realize about ourselves is that we are absolutely dependent on the Father. That was the lesson of the first few verses. But right after that, we found out something else, and that was this, that like children, we are not only dependent, but we are cared for. We have a father who fights for us. The word in that one was that if any of you would cause one of my little ones, and that's a father speaking about you and a father speaking about me. If they would cause any of my little ones to stumble, that is to stumble away from dependence on me to getting their life from something else, it would be better if a millstone was hung around their neck and they got thrown into the middle of the sea. My father fights for me like that when people mess with me. That's what the picture is. Not only are we protected, but we are cared for. The picture there was that of a shepherd, and that being, again, God our Father, who when we wander away, not wanting to get lost and ruin our life, but because we get distracted, we wander away. He comes after us and gets us. Like children, we are cared for. We are also disciplined. Spent a couple of weeks on that whole dynamic. In the last couple of weeks, we've been dealing with the fact that not only are we dependent, protected, cared for, and disciplined, but just like children, we need to be forgiven. We need to be forgiven over and over again. As we come to verse 21 through 35, the issue we've been dealing with, however, is not just forgiveness in general, as many of us have come to know forgiveness, but genuine forgiveness from the heart. What is that? Many of us know a lot about forgiveness when we just say the words and they come real quickly and the I'm sorry, I'm sorry business, I forgive you, I forgive you, but often we don't feel release, we don't feel restoration, we feel kind of obedient because we said the word, but there isn't that life juice flowing again. Forgiveness from the heart. The whole thing began with a question in verse 21 when Peter came to the Lord and asked, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? When is enough enough? Where do I draw the line? And then you might remember that he answered his own question with what he thought was a wonderfully magnanimous answer up to seven times. And there was reasons that he thought that that was a big figure. That was really a neat thing to say seven. We are recalling the fact that he grew up in a Jewish tradition and also there was scripture that indicated an approach that said basically this. You give somebody three chances and after that you nail them. Even in Amos chapter 1, the word from God was, forgive the offender three times, But on the fourth, you shall not withhold punishment. Even in Matthew 18, there seems to be a pattern as we dealt with the discipline. If they sin, you go after them, then you go again, and then you go again after you tell the whole church. If they still don't listen, you let them go. There's kind of a pattern there. Three strikes and you're out. And so it is that when Peter comes up with seven, he's taking kind of what was for him the normal pattern. I give him three chances. He doubles it, adds one, and comes up with seven, feeling for sure like he's going to get the Kingdom Guy of the Week award for being so wonderfully graceful. He's absolutely shocked with Jesus' answer. And Jesus' answer isn't really an answer. It's a confrontation. Jesus isn't coming and saying, you know, the real number is 490. When he says no, it's not seven times, it's 70 times seven. He's not giving them, and we dealt with that last time. Some ultimate expression of kingdom forgiveness. What Jesus was really doing here was destroying or dropping a bomb on Peter's view of what forgiveness was. He was designed to bring him up short. It's designed to bring us up short. It's designed to make us stop and think, what is real forgiveness anyway? Peter, Church of the Open Door, real forgiveness is not about a number. It's not about doing it seven times. It's not even about doing it 490 times. You could do 490, I forgive yous, and never have release. What we're looking for is forgiveness from the heart, Peter. And this bomb that Jesus dropped was designed at least to make Peter and to make us stop and think, what is genuine forgiveness from the heart anyway? And one of the things that dawned on us was, at least as I processed it in my own spirit, that genuine forgiveness from the heart is something I don't know that much about. I have experienced it and I know about it and I'm not saying it's never a part of my life, but very often we settle for these cheap things where we just say the words because we know that's right. I forgive you, but there's no release. And so what we did last time was instead of trying to plumb the depths of what real forgiveness from the heart is, we picked up a piece that we were a little more familiar with, and that is false forgiveness. And we began to talk about and reveal some of the realities of that. And I don't have time to review all of that. But I just remind you of this, that we left two weeks ago with an awareness that genuine forgiveness from the heart is more than just words. It's more than just saying it out loud. The magic words, I forgive you, but rather genuine forgiveness from the heart might actually involve a process. It might actually take some time. It might actually require some hard honesty in looking at the wound that was inflicted. And like physical wounds, we compare it to a physical wound that very often when I get a physical wound, I would just as soon leave it alone and not let the doctor touch it. Because if the doctor touches it, he might have to cleanse it. He will have to cleanse it. He'll put some medication on it. I love it when they come at it with that iodine stuff. It's wonderful. It feels great. And then they stitch it, and I don't like any of that, and I sometimes treat my emotional wounds the same way. It'll go away. It'll heal on its own. And it doesn't heal on its own. And it gets infected, and we go through our lives emotionally and spiritually being infected people with all sorts of venom because I don't want to go through the process of really restoring because restoration is involving a process of going and seeing and cleansing and it hurts and it feels like going to Jerusalem where we're going to suffer many things and maybe die but that's where resurrection comes. The question we left with was this. Okay, if we're not just going to slap band-aids on our wounds and on our broken relationships and call that forgiveness, if we are going to give ourselves to this painful process sometimes of real forgiveness, what is it that can give me the strength to do that? What is it that can create for me an atmosphere where I'm willing to enter into that process and open myself up to it? The answer to that is in the parable. Let's begin to read verse 23. For this reason, the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a certain king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. And when he had begun to settle them, there was brought to him one who owed 10,000 talents. But since he did not have the means to repay, his Lord commanded him to be sold along with his wife and children and all that he had in repayment to be made. The slave, therefore falling down, prostrated himself before him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will repay you everything. And the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave the debt. But then that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him 100 denarii, that is 18 bucks. And he seized him and began to choke him, saying, Pay back what you owe. And so his fellow slave fell down and began to entreat him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will repay you. But he wasn't willing to forgive, however, and sent him and threw him to prison until he should pay back what he owed. And then some of the servants of the Lord went to the Lord and said, this is incredible, we're grieved in our spirit that this happened. The Lord was then stirred, verse 32, said, you wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt because you asked me. Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you? And his Lord moved with anger, handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him. So shall my heavenly Father also do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from the heart. Forgiveness from the heart. Let's pray as we begin. Father, again I come to you and I ask that you do what we cannot do. Father, I think there is some very, very important teaching here. For people who are redeemed and in your family, there is powerful truth here of reconciliation and forgiveness that we need to hear. But there is a powerful word here for those as well who are outside the kingdom and may be very, very close. And I pray that you would energize the words. And Father, as we think of things like forgiveness and repentance, we can hear the truth and even be stirred somewhat in our spirit. But unless your spirit is released with power, genuine change doesn't take place. And Father, we just ask your spirit would come, minister forgiveness among us, minister repentance, do your work even as we hear the truth in Jesus' name. Amen. I want to break the text down into three parts real quickly. First of all, I just want to look at the parable. The second thing I want to do is reveal the problem of the parable. That's going to start in verse 28 and then simply make the application of the whole thing as we tie it together with the 35th verse. The picture of the parable is established in verses 23 through 27. It sets the situation up for us. Let's hit it verse by verse. For this reason, the kingdom of heaven is compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. This is a picture that would have been relatively common in the land of Palestine. The king here simply would have been a large landowner, a ruler of a nation. The servants or the slaves would specifically here be called set traps. They had a specific name, that is set traps. And a set trap was a person who was commissioned or appointed by the king of the province to handle the province for the king. He would be set into this piece of land, and his responsibility would be to rule that land, to care for it, and to work it. Now, from time to time, what would happen is this. The king or the landowner would move on that particular set trap, that servant, who had been given authority over the land, and there would be a settling of accounts. And the settling of accounts would simply be, from time to time, the king coming and going, How are you doing? How are you spending your resources? How are you spending your life? What are you doing? Just real quickly to get the spiritual parallel for all of this. God is the king. The servants are men. I'm talking about all men. I'm talking about all of humanity. What we've got here is an incredible picture of God's relationship with all men. His relationship with all men is that of a god or a landowner to set traps. And he has placed us on the earth, his earth, his province, and he has given us authority over it to rule it for him, as it were. And we have been called to rule and subdue and multiply and care for it. It's a stewardship. From time to time, the landowner, that is the king, that is God, moves on the people, his human creation, and basically has a time where they settle accounts. It's the proverbial day of reckoning, and basically what God does is he moves on men and women, And the question is posed that is this, how are you doing? How are you spending your life? Now, one of the things I want to just kind of pull you back from right away here is this. There is an impulse when you hear that day of reckoning, settle accounts, that you would automatically think we're talking about the last day. We're talking about that final judgment when we're going to settle accounts. That is not the picture here, and it's important that you pull back from that. What this is is a normal flow of life. It happens to you even if you're a believer. Every once in a while, God moves on you, and there is a day of reckoning, as it were. What direction are you going? Where are you getting your life from? But it also happens, and this is a thing I think you need to know as you go to work tomorrow, it also happens in the lives of every human being on the face of the earth. Your boss, that cranky person you work with. Every once in a while, the landowner who made that person who doesn't know God or serve him, God moves on them with a proverbial, again, day of reckoning, where for one reason or another, he or she slows down long enough to just start thinking about his life or her life. How am I spending it? What are my values? What are the directions that I am going? Now, there's a number of things that kind of can bring that settling of accounts or that day of reckoning to the fore. Sometimes it's trouble. Things just aren't going well. Pain. It's that well-known foxhole experience where the mortars of life's pain are exploding all around, and all of a sudden people are going, Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God, I've got to have them. The foxholes we find ourselves in like that are sometimes the business beginning to fail. I kind of didn't think much about God. I was raking in the money. Everything's going great, but all of a sudden that happens, and I start thinking about what is this life thing anyway. Maybe the marriage starts to crumble and you had no idea she was going to leave you or you had no idea he was going to be gone and all of a sudden things you counted on are gone and you start to think. Some way in which your life is threatened brings these issues to the fore. And again, we kind of go through our life. Otherwise, we go to school, we get married, we get our job, we get our career, and we just kind of skip through life and every once in a while we think. Sometimes it's not a negative thing at all that brings it to the fore. Sometimes you go on vacation. You know, again, we just are madly involved in raising our families, doing our careers. We don't think about life. You go on vacation. You sit in a nice, easy chair. You read a book. You look at the sunset. And then you do a very dangerous thing. You start thinking about your life. It's a scary thing. And you go, what am I doing with my life? I want you to have this picture in your mind that not only does that happen to you, it happens to every person. Every once in a while there is that time when your boss, your colleague, your friend is asking the right question. And those are the times that they're open and ready to hear the good news about the kingdom of God. In verse 24, that was happening to this particular person only. He was having a very intense experience, to say the least. You see, in verse 24 it reveals that this guy owed the Lord a debt of 10,000 talents. it's an enormous debt let me give you some perspective on it what is 10,000 talents? was that like maybe 10,000 bucks? not even close 10,000 bucks as much as that might sound to you or me is something you could still somehow find a way to work that out 10,000 talents to give you some perspective the entire tax revenue collected from the regions of Edomia, Judea, Samaria and Galilee all of them put together equal 900 talents this guy's in deep trouble he owes 10,000 talents if he could have the tax of everybody in those regions he wouldn't even a tenth he wouldn't even come close when the tabernacle was built in Exodus 38 they built the entire tabernacle for 29 talents the temple and the temple was overlaid everything was overlaid with gold remember that? incredible thing 3,000 talents this guy owed 10,000 talents fact is this that the word 10,000 in the greek is simply the highest greek numeric term that there is 10,000 is as high as it goes merion is the word revelation chapter 5 verse 11 is speaking of the second coming and angels are all around at the second coming and their numbers numbered 10,000 times 10,000 because they couldn't go higher than 10,000 so they just multiplied it and basically what that is saying there's a million zillion, hundred billion, trillion, gillion, million. You just make something up. It's bigger than you can imagine. What's the point? The point is this. This guy had a debt he couldn't pay, and at this time in his life, he was aware of the fact he had a debt he couldn't pay. Now, I want to just intersect something here. Everybody's got a debt they can't pay. Most of us are living their lives in such a way that we're not aware of it. From time to time, the landowner comes to subtle accounts, and either because of pain or just you stop to think, you begin to realize there is something grievously wrong with my soul. And if you can just keep on buzzing through life, you'll never have to think about it, but everybody does from time to time. Everybody does. Again, the spiritual parallel, I've kind of already made it. Spiritual parallel for this picture is the picture of sinful man in relation to God. And the debt of sin we owe is hopelessly beyond our capacity to pay it back. The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Who can know it? And again, you can skip through your life being unaware of that, avoiding that, calling it something else. Everybody's really okay. But the truth is this. The heart is deceitful above all things desperately wicked. And from time to time, you're going to have an awareness of that. And those are the times that we are going to start asking for grace. Those are the times that the door of the kingdom is beginning to be opened to you. The sum of our sin is 10,000. It's numbing, it's past counting. We're not just sinners, we're people who are dead in our sin before Christ. Before we entered into relationship with Christ. The bad news just gets worse in verse 25. But since he did not have the means to repay, his Lord commanded him to be sold along with his wife and children and all that he had in repayment to be made. Now, there's a weird thing here. He's got a debt he can't pay. So what you're going to have to do to make repayment is I'm going to sell you into slavery. There's an irony here that you need to catch. If I sell you into slavery, you know what you can no longer do? As a slave, you can no longer earn any money to repay the debt. So you're between a rock and a hard place real bad. I mean, I've got a debt I can't pay. I'm being sold into slavery. And now as a slave, I can't do anything to earn anything to pay the debt I couldn't pay anyway if I could pay it. it's debtor's prison is what it is that's what debtor's prison is debtor's prison is is where you are thrown in prison because you have a debt but when you're in prison you can't do anything to pay the debt back so you stay there forever this is a picture of hell this is a picture of hell a lot of times the pictures of hell are fire and that's what's supposed to scare us well I got something here here's the ultimate debtor's prison you go to hell to pay for a debt that you couldn't pay even if you could somehow pay for it. But when you go into hell, which is the ultimate debtor's prison, there isn't one thing you can do there to do anything to pay off the debt. So a person could spend an eternity in hell. At the end of eternity, he's not one more bit fit for heaven than he was when he began. The debt still isn't paid. That's a pretty grim picture, isn't it? Aren't you glad you came to church today? You know, you're sitting back there going, I just wandered in. I mean, I didn't know, you know. I didn't expect this. If it's a grim picture, what you need to hear is this. It's supposed to be a grim picture. And the grim picture is supposed to be so grim that it doesn't elicit in you a response that says, boy, I better clean up my act. I better try harder. Boy, I'm glad I heard this because I don't want to go to that debtor's prison. I'm going to straighten up and fly right. If that's your response, you're going to be in real serious trouble because the debt you need to see is beyond your paying. You need to see that. The appropriate response to this debtor's prison you're going to get thrown into and the debt you couldn't possibly pay is to fall on your knees and cry for one thing and one thing only, and that is grace. My only hope is grace. My only hope isn't even you being nice to me. It's not a second chance. My only hope is grace. It's Jesus who would somehow forgive this because I couldn't pay it off in a hundred lifetimes. That's what brokenness is. we come to verse 26 and things look real good the slave therefore falls down prostrates himself before him saying stop right there I don't want to get to what he says just look at the picture this is a picture of someone who's just gone through what I call pre-conversion conviction okay isn't that a neat word pre-conversion conviction I like it when there's kind of a ring to it Jeff goes crazy when I do that I got all P's today too by the way the parable problem and the point anyway he falls down on his face and it's looking good the picture I have in my mind is even someone maybe you've dealt with before and you're sharing your faith and you see him go through trouble and you share with the gospel just share the gospel with him and there's tears around your kitchen table or they come forward and your heart is just singing because they're ready for the kingdom and they know their life is a mess this guy's prime time ready for the kingdom him. It's ready to go. All you got to do is open up the four spiritual laws. We'll go to the back of the book and just sign it right now. It's ready to go. Ready to go. And he's falling on his face and he's crying. And boy, that's the real thing right there. But there's a glitch. There's a fly in the ointment. It's something I hear that I don't want to hear. And I'm kind of going, I kind of heard that, but I didn't hear it. And who knows what he really meant. And I don't know, because he says this after he falls down on his face he says this have patience with me i will repay everything what happened to an awareness that he had a debt he couldn't pay now he's not asking here something's changed he's not asking for grace he's asking for time you see that give me some time i can do it all of a sudden i don't know maybe i kind of see him straightening his tie going it's not that bad. It's not that bad. I'll do it myself. We're going to find out in a minute that you can do it yourself if you want, but you're going to pay. And you can pay it yourself, but you're going to pay. Forever you're going to pay. And the torturers in verse 34 are going to extract the payment from you. the fact is this you've dealt with people like that and so have i and and when you're done this green light that look like brokenness and repentance all of a sudden it turns yellow it's not red i don't know for sure i don't know that this guy you know so what he says the wrong words let's give guy a break okay i don't think people when they get redeemed have to say the right words they don't have to say my evangelical words god knows the heart but what i gotta know and what i gotta give you on this particular verse is this. After this wonderful experience, I don't know what I've got. We don't know for sure what we've got. You know, we're kind of with them. They prayed to prayer. They signed in a dotted line. We pat it on the back. We give them a hug. But then as they leave, you just kind of wonder what is here. Come on, Dave, some foxhole conversions are real. Are they? Absolutely. God meets them. I think every time people cry out in pain, every time people cry out for help, God meets them. To the level that they want it, they get it. But where was this guy? Well, we don't know. Let's move on to verse 27 as this drama continues. With the question mark left on him, there's something needed in this next verse that isn't a question mark. There's something in the next verse we know for sure. And the Lord of that slave felt compassion. Stop right there. Before we get involved in all the intricacies of the theological dilemma that this kind of thing can pose for us, meaning was the grace extended really received, one of the things I want you to see here, whether or not he received grace and forgiveness, I want you to understand that the knee-jerk reaction of God to anybody in pain is what? Compassion. Every time people cry out to God, he comes. And he released him and forgave him that, now that sounds like it happened. That sounds like it was a done deal. What I would call this is grace extended. Grace extended. And again, without getting into all the intricacies of theology yet, we'll get to that. I want you to know on the front end that this verse reveals something about God. It reveals that he's eager to forgive. He's eager to forgive. He delights in that. He loves to lavish grace and mercy. He runs to people who are in pain. And when there is even a rumbling of repentance, God moves to it. You need to know that about your God. The picture I have is the father of the prodigal son. The father of the prodigal son saw the son returning, repentant. Before the son ever saw him, the father saw him. And the text says that he ran toward his son. But the Greek verb indicates that it wasn't just running, it says he raced. That's an important distinctive distinction. The reason it's important is because I think you can run with some dignity. You can kind of jog and kind of keep it, hey, looking okay and not being... When you race, it's elbows and knees and like that, it's like that. Doesn't look real graceful. You're all out. He raced toward his son. Picture the man. Again, we're going to take the man and then project him on God. The man is a man of some age. He's got a son of some year, so he's got some age. He's got some level of dignity and nobility. And what he does is he wraps up his robes. You know, when I think of guys of some age, not old, but of some age, their dignity, they've got nobility, I don't see them racing. You know what I mean? It's like an incongruent picture. I don't want to embarrass him, but all week long, I've kind of had the prodigal father looking like my friend Leroy Toth. Now, he's here today, and I haven't mentioned this in any of it, but I picture him with his big, long robes. He sees his son, he picks his robes up, and he races. Leroy, don't run. Don't do that. It's weird, but he wants to be by him. I picture God. And in my mind's eye, Revelation chapter 5, Revelation all through Revelation, God is pictured as regal and powerful and standing and white and robes of regal splendor. And when we see him, we're going to bow down on our faces and worship him, and it's going to be a glorious time. But that same God who is with dignity and wonder and holiness when he sees someone of his humanity, one of his creation a rumbling of repentance he picks up the robes of his regal splendor and he runs to it that's good news that's who God is loves to forgive he loves to heal he loves to do that I've got a ludicrous picture in my mind I hope it isn't irreverent my pictures are weird this week I got a picture of a reporter as it relates to God loving to forgive and running toward it. The reporter's interviewing God. I know that's weird. It's irreverent. But the reporter's going, God, I know you've got a big job. You're running the universe here. All sorts of things you've got to do. You've got to do this and that. Just tell all the people here, they're all listening here, what's the favorite part of your job? And God would instantly say, favorite part of my job is to forgive. I love to forgive. I love to heal. I love to restore. I love to pour out grace. I just love to do that. And so when there's a rumbling of repentance, he feels compassion. He extends forgiveness. He extends grace. And to the degree that the person wants it, they get it lavished on them, but there's a problem. The grace is extended, but that slave, verse 28, and this is point number two, the problem. He went out and one of his fellow slaves who owed him 100 denarii, $18, seized him, began to choke him, saying, pay back what you owe. Roman secular writers speak of men dealing with debtors. to them by wrenching their necks and squeezing their necks until the blood begins to flow from their nose and mouth, meaning they killed him. Verse 29, So this fellow slave fell down and began to entreat him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will repay you. You heard that speech before? It's the same speech this guy gave just a little bit ago. Ironically, this debt that this guy had, he could have repaid. Again, you've got to keep this in context of relationships. and our relationship with God, the slave and the landowner, I had a debt I couldn't pay. He forgave the debt. When I go out here in my relationships with people, no matter how grievous the debt, it's one that could be maybe made up somehow. It'd be nice to you the rest of your life. I don't know. We'll make it up to you. And in verse 30 it says this, He was unwilling, however, to forgive, went and threw him in prison until he should pay back what was owed. He pinned him to the wall like a bug and said, you're stuck. I will not forgive you and I'm going to have that power over you the rest of my life and no matter what you do, you won't be able to get out of it. One of the struggles we've got when we're dealing with scripture is taking stories like this that kind of don't apply. I mean, we don't have pictures to deal with with that. There aren't any debtor prisons today that we know of. So how do we make an application? You know what the truth is? There are debtor prisons. Every one of you, myself included, have at one time or another thrown someone into our private little debtor's prison, right in my mind or right in my heart, where I stick that person who offended me and I withhold forgiveness and I keep him in that debtor's prison and no matter what they do, they're never getting out. You ever do that? Sure. You ever had it done to you? Sure, you feel like a bug stuck on a wall. debtor prison is a very real thing it happens every day between people the problem that this exposes is very clear we have an altogether incongruent picture it is absolutely incongruent that someone who's been forgiven won't extend forgiveness that doesn't fit there's actually two aspects of this incongruence the first one is the one I just gave Let me give you that again. The one who is made aware of the debt they had, being forgiven of the debt they had, now not being forgiven, that just doesn't fit. That kind of pattern, that kind of response, just violates every kingdom pattern that we've seen since we began Matthew. Go all the way back to the Beatitudes. Not only did Jesus delineate the aspects of kingdom life as being those who are broken into the kingdom, meaning brokenness, meaning absolute dependence on God. My only hope is Jesus for salvation. I saw the debt I had. I realized I couldn't pay the debt. I begged for grace. God gave me grace. Brokenness is what enters you into the kingdom. Brokenness is what allows you to move in power in the kingdom. In order to be sanctified, I don't get sanctified by trying real hard. I get sanctified by realizing my only hope is Jesus to be sanctified. That's brokenness. My only hope to serve God and be empowered to move in the kingdom, in the gifts, is if Jesus empowers me. My only hope is Jesus. that's the first step of kingdom reality the second one was mourning remember that? blessed are those who mourn who get out here what is in here? their sin, their pain blessed are those who quit pretending about what's going on on the inside but we notice not only the little details brokenness and mourning but there was a progression you remember that? it's amazing how broken people automatically mourn I've never met a broken person who kept on pretending broken people start to mourn the third beatitude was what? blessed are the gentle and the exhortation wasn't everybody go be gentle you'd be gentle for a day you'd be gentle till you got home with your kids that's how long it would last the truth is this that gentleness flows from brokenness and mourning i've never met a broken mourning person who wasn't gentle it is incongruent that someone aware of their sin broken over their sin, receives forgiveness, wouldn't forgive. The pattern of kingdom life is that that flows. Luke chapter 7 verse 37 is a vivid picture of this. A woman who was called a sinner in the text, what she was was a prostitute, had an overwhelming sense of gratitude toward Jesus because of the forgiveness that had been extended to her. And so she, knowing that Jesus was having dinner at this Pharisee's house, crashed the party, walked into the dinner place, had a vial of alabaster, tremendously valuable commodity, something that would take months, even years for her to earn enough money to buy. She took that vial of alabaster, broke it, poured it on Jesus' feet, and with her tears and with her hair, washed Jesus' feet in gratitude for the forgiveness that had been extended to her. From her flowed mercy, from her flowed gentleness, because it came to her. The Pharisee named Simon was sitting off at the distance looking at this, and the Bible says he was thinking to himself. He didn't even say this out loud, but thinking to himself. He goes, this guy's supposed to be a prophet. How could a prophet not know what kind of woman this is? She is a sinner, and prophets don't mess with sinners. He's obviously not a prophet because he's having something to do with her. And Jesus, being able to discern his thoughts, said, Simon, I've got a question for you. I've got a confrontation for you. Here's the word. Who forgives the most? The one who's been forgiven much or the one who's been forgiven little? And he said, I suppose it's the one who's been forgiven much. And Jesus said, that's a true thing. You got it right. And here's the principle. He who has been forgiven much loves much, and that's this woman. And he who has been forgiven little, Simon, loves little, and that's you, Simon. Simon might have heard that this way, like maybe many evangelicals would have heard it. I am forgiven little. of course I haven't done very much I've been forgiven little because I've done little of course he needed to be forgiven a lot is that the true thing? no his self-righteous pride was a far more vile sin than this woman's prostitution any day the sin that fills churches is a more disgusting sin to Jesus than that of this prostitute believe me because self-righteous pride is the thing that keeps people out of the kingdom more than this because these people know they have a need. These people know they need grace. These people are aware that they got a debt they can't pay. He needed forgiveness. He didn't repent. He didn't get any forgiveness. And the pattern is this, that people who have never been forgiven don't forgive. And maybe if you see a constant lack of forgiveness, maybe the problem is you better forgive. No, maybe the problem is they've never been forgiven. or, and this is more common among redeemed people, you don't know how forgiven you are. And you need to be reminded, you really are forgiven. And when redeemed people get in touch with how forgiven they are, the forgiveness begins to come. What we've got is an incongruent picture, though. One who's received grace, you'd think grace would flow. The other incongruent picture here is the picture we get of God. You know, it says that he was forgiving the guy. It says in verse 27, he forgave him the debt. He released him. It says in verse 32, you wicked slave, I forgave you. I did it. It's done. So this isn't maybe a picture of an unredeemed person. It is a redeemed person, and I forgave you. So if it is a redeemed person who got forgiven, I got another problem, an incongruent problem. And that is this, that if he really did forgive him, if he really did pour grace on him and give him mercy, what is this in verse 34 where it says he handed him over to the torturers until he should repay what was owed him? because what he owed was $10,000 and that sounds like he sent to hell. That almost sounds like he forgave and then he saw what he did and he changed his mind. He withdraws the forgiveness. I'm in big trouble. What is going on here? Two explanations for this. And it's kind of just following the flow of everything we've done already. There's two ways to play this. You can play this out in the context of this guy being an unredeemed person. You can play it out as if he were a redeemed person. Let's first of all look at the explanation of this whole text and find the integration of it by looking at him as if he were one who got extended grace to him, extended forgiveness to him, but it wasn't completed by his reception. If you have a problem with that, what do you mean? You know, this sounds like God touched him in verse 27. He gave him something that was an encounter with God. It is possible, beloved, to have an encounter with God. It is possible to come to a place where you are aware of the debt you owe, to fall flat on your face, realize you need some help and still not come in the kingdom. And if you need some proof of that scripturally, Galatians 4.11, Paul went to the Galatian provinces, preached the gospel. People were wonderfully saved. And then he saw a vile legalism move among them. And he began to preach to them and untie the legalism. And at one point he said this, after I've said everything I've got to say, I have a fear. And it's this, I fear that perhaps I've labored over you in vain. If you've been at open door at all, you're aware that that word labor is not just working hard with you. It's a child-bearing term. It means this. I was with you. I saw you come forward. I saw you prostrate yourself. I saw the hand of God move on you. I saw grace extended. I saw what looked like your reception of it, but I feared that perhaps I labored over you, a child-bearing term. The baby came, but it was stillborn. You're a spiritual abortion. That's my fear for you. This possibility of someone coming that close, God moving on him, and still not moving into the kingdom because of absolute dependence. I need grace, not a second chance. I need grace. They didn't go to that part. They were still trying to work it out themselves. They never came in the kingdom. Another parallel of this, another picture of this, could be the rocky soil. In the parable of Matthew 13, four soils, one's good, bears fruit. Weedy soil, choked out. Hard soil, the word doesn't even implant. But then there's that thin veneer of receptivity, rocky soil, remember? Thin veneer of good soil. underneath the bedrock of resistance. The Word is implanted. Forgiveness is extended. An act of God is there. The person receives it gladly. The life begins to come. Isn't this wonderful? Tears, joy. Right underneath is the bedrock of resistance. I'm going to do it myself. I've got my pride. The death's not that bad. Dies out. The picture is also seen in the picture of the ten lepers. Remember? ten lepers all got a healing from God. They came forward as it were. Jesus extended his hand on them. They received a healing. They experienced the energy of God in their bodies. Jesus told them, go tell the priest. They all told the priest. One of them returned into relationship with Jesus and said, you are my only hope. And Jesus said to that one, he said, you have been made sozo, not just physically healed not just a neat experience with God but you have been made whole you have been saved, you alone it is possible to come this close and to not enter in and it happens like this somebody does indeed become aware again that something is very wrong with their life again pre-conversion conviction God moves in with extended grace they do indeed have an experience of some kind with God. They experience some sort of forgiveness. They feel free. But somewhere along the line, what's really moving in their heart is this. I don't really want grace. I don't even like that. I have my pride, you know. I'll pay it back. I don't want charity. I'll make my way. And all of a sudden, incomprehensibly suddenly, the debt that a moment ago had caused them to fall on their face and was absolutely beyond their capacity to handle, All of a sudden, it looks manageable. I'm going to do it. They straighten their tie. I'm going to do it. I'll kind of use God to help me along the way, but God won't be my life. I'll just keep going this way. Verse 34, he hands him over to the torturers until he should repay all that he owes. You want to pay? You want to figure it out? You want to work it out your own way? You can. You will. And you will pay. You will pay forever what you can't pay because of self-righteous pride. I wonder if you see, and this is just a side light, that the sin that most consistently sends people to hell and locks the door to the kingdom to people is not the sin of adultery, murder, lying, theft, and homosexuality. Those are all grievous sins. But ironically, some of the people involved in those sins become real aware real fast that they have a debt they can't pay. And they aren't even deluded into thinking they could ever pay it back. It's so bad, they realize my only hope is grace. The thing that keeps people out of the kingdom isn't just that. It's a self-righteous religious pride that says, I'll pay it back myself. I'll work it out myself. And the fact is this, to those people, if you're here, what you need to hear God say is this, you're absolutely right, you will pay it back. Every last cent, forever, but you'll never pay it back. The other way to play this out is that this person is indeed redeemed. And textually, the text would lean that way just as easily as it leans the other way. That's why this is kind of a dilemma theologically, this passage. I mean, it says in verse 27, He released him. He forgave the debt. So that answers whether it was extended and received. God gave him forgiveness. This is a picture of a redeemed person possibly. Verse 32 affirms the same thing. I forgave, past tense, the debt because you entreated me. I had mercy on you. Verse 33. But if this is a believer, And this is a picture of a redeemed person. We've got a problem with the tortures. What does that mean? Does that mean that God pulls back forgiveness and now you're going to hell? What is that? A couple things. I'll get to the tortures in a second. Not only can I affirm the fact that from the text this could possibly be argued to be a believer, but you know what? From your own life we can argue that. From my own life. It is a true thing that from time to time you have been a person who has been forgiven much and been unable or unwilling to forget for whatever reason. You've found yourself, and maybe what we need to do in order for brokenness to come to us about this is that we need to stand in the parable, every one of us. We need to stand as that man in the parable. As uncomely as that looks, I've done that. So the possibility for a redeemed person to be doing this is there. You've done it. I've done it. But who would be the torturers for you or for me? I mean, does he withdraw his grace and now you're not saved anymore? That would be a very dangerous heresy to perpetrate. That isn't what it means. What are the torturers? You know what? If you're a redeemed person, ironically, I think you know who the torturers are. What do you mean I know? Well, not that you've ever thought of it this way, but in your experience, you know what the torturers are like. Let me explain it to you. Start with a question. Talking to redeemed people, have you ever set your spirit against somebody? You ever done it? You know how it feels? Have you ever set your mind against forgiveness towards somebody? You've put that person in your private little debtor's prison. You ever done it? Of course you've done it. Remember how that felt? You know how that feels? On the front end of that thing, when you set your spirit against that person, you actually did enjoy it for a while because you're kind of getting even. It's a way to punish. There's a certain power that you enjoy of having it over this guy or over this girl or over your husband or wife or your kids or your parents. and you do indeed use it to punish. But after a while, you know what happens? The torturers come and you know what they are. The torturers come and the torturers for you could be a variety of things. It could be that you can't go to sleep at night. It could be that you can't think straight. It could be that you have an overwhelming sense of anxiety all the time, a sense of strife in your spirit. It could be that the torturers are a dried up life. It could be that the torturers for you are just a constantly at war spirit. The torturers are those late nights when you're having a conversation with somebody who isn't even there and you're just nailing them to the wall, but it doesn't bring any freedom, it doesn't bring any joy. The torturers have come, that's what that is. You know, in fact, the torturers work almost as well as applied to a believer as a non-believer. A non-believer, the torturers would be hell. For the believer, the concept, what does the torturer do? They don't just inflict pain for the fun of it. Some of them do. But a torturer, theoretically, inflicts torture in order to get you to what? Confess. I'm going to keep on pushing pain on you until you go, all right, all right. Now I picture the discipline of the Lord moving on his children who, having been fully forgiven, are sticking other people in a debtor's prison, and he brings the chastening of his spirit upon his children, and he can dry up your spirit. He can bring anxiety. He can move on you. I don't have to elaborate. I think you know what that feels like. Hebrews 12 talks about the discipline of the Lord. He chastens and scourges every one of his sons. If you don't ever get scourged by God, you're not a son, that text says. It's a true thing in the life of believers that you get that. Let me just apply this as we close. Verse 35, So shall my heavenly Father also do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart. Forgive your brother from your heart. How do we wrap this up? Just by going through those two points again real quickly and apply it this way. If you are here and you're not redeemed, you're not part of the family of God, here's the word you need to hear. Somehow the weight of this word has to hit you full force. I don't want to water it down one little bit. You need to know this morning that you have a debt you can't pay. Now while you're sitting here this morning, you might not be aware of that debt. It might be that you're in a part of that life that you're just kind of cruising along and your job's going well and you're not in one of those times when the Lord is moving on you to settle accounts. But you know what it's been like in the past when that's happened and I can guarantee you pretty much, unless you die tomorrow or something, that in the course of your life there is going to be another settling of accounts when God moves on you. Something's not working and you're going to have to think about your life and what you're going to become aware of is that you have a debt you can't pay. Whether you're aware of it today or not, it's a true thing. The heart is deceitful above all things. You are not just a sinful, you are dead in your sin and you need a resurrection by grace. You're separate from God and alienated from the covenant. And you need to see something else that all of your well-intended appeals for time to clean up your life and all of your well-intended promises to do better are not noble. In our way of human thinking, that sounds like God must know my heart because I'm going to try harder. I got religion, and that's basically what people mean when they say I got religious. They swept their house clean. They straightened up their act. Those kind of promises are not noble. Those kind of promises are absolute self-righteous pride that says I want to pay it myself, and God says to you this morning, if that's your posture, I will let you do that. But you need to know this. You're going to pay for it in a debtor's prison where you'll never be able to pay for it. And that's the truth. And it needs to be as grim as it is. Your only hope is grace. And the hope of the Holy Spirit and the moving of the Holy Spirit on you this morning, if you're among the redeemed, is that you would see you have a debt you can't pay, that your response would not be, I'll try harder. And even that you would fall on your face prostrate and say, I'm going to try harder. but that you would fall on your face, prostrate before God and say, God, I need more than a second chance. I need grace. My only hope is grace. I can't promise to straighten my life up. I need life from you. I need you to pay the debt. I realize you did pay the debt. I receive it and God runs. He runs to you. There is regenerating power in this truth. My heart is that somehow, right amid this other lesson that is for redeemed people, those of you who aren't redeemed would be being energized by the Spirit right now to receive the gift of grace, salvation before you leave. But this verse, and this passage applies as well to redeemed. As we apply this, I talk a different way to you. I'm going on a different track if you're redeemed. The fact is this, as uncomely as this is, every one of us have acted like this guy. But if you are among the redeemed, I'm not going to give you this passage the same way as I would to an unredeemed person. I'm not going to sit here and yell at you and scream at you and you ought to be forgiving. That's not the way I'm going to go. That's not appropriate. I'm not going to shame you. You know what I do need to do, though? To every one of you here who are redeemed, I need to remind you. I need to remind you. And I need to let this come to my spirit, too. Let it come to me first. David, you need to be reminded, you had a debt you could never pay. And grace came to you and fully forgave you, and right now you stand in it, and you enjoy it, and you relish it, and you know it. Could you maybe consider, knowing that you're fully forgiven, could you maybe consider, instead of all these false I forgive you's, begin to move into the lives of those people, and clean out the wound, and extend the forgiveness, that I gave. That kind of forgiveness costs. That even makes me think of Jesus' forgiveness. When he died on the cross, the forgiveness that he extended costs. He could have maybe done it cheap. I forgive you, I forgive you. He went to the cross. Give it to you. Those of you who are redeemed, you need to be reminded of something this morning. You had a debt you couldn't pay. But more than the debt you couldn't pay, the place that gratitude comes from is not knowing you had a debt. It comes from knowing you had a debt that has been fully forgiven. Sometimes the reason we can't forgive is because we never have been forgiven. Sometimes the reason we can't forgive is because we have forgotten how fully forgiven we are. And I just want to give you a gift. If you're redeemed, you have been fully forgiven. The grace of God has been lavished on you. Your standing before Him is right. And I just have this sneaking suspicion that as God's people begin to let in the fact that they have been received, that they have been made new, that they have been forgiven, that maybe, just maybe, the fact that that is so real could begin to issue not only to them, but it could begin to issue from them to those people that they have in their little private debtor's prison and that people can start getting set free. And we enter into healing. And then in that process we begin to realize what it means to forgive from the heart. I think this is truth today. But as I said at the beginning when we prayed, I don't think the truth has enough by itself to bring a change. I want to have you stand in just a second, not yet. And I'm going to pray again as I did at the beginning of the sermon that the Spirit of God would just come. and minister to us forgiveness, a spirit of forgiveness. Again, the kind of forgiveness we're looking for, first of all, is that you would know you're forgiven if you're redeemed, that he would just saturate us with a sense of our having been given grace and that God would come right behind that with a spirit of forgiveness that would flow through us, that there would even be a spirit of repentance that would come and God would just bring his breaking and healing to you. I want to also let you know as we sing, we're going to sing a song, and it's just real appropriate for this message, that those of you who need prayer, that you come. And if you come and find your way to this overflow area, that there will be people who come and pray for you. But I want to affirm again that while we believe in laying hands on and exercising the gifts of the Spirit in that way, God can meet you right where you are. I would even encourage you. This is not a gimmick or a game, but sometimes when we're asking for gifts, this is something I do, And I just share it with you and take it with a grain of salt. But like a child, just lift your hands up and say, give me what I need. Some of you want to forgive and you don't know how. You really do want to forgive, but the wound is so deep. You need to know how fully forgiven you are and then ask for an energy of the Spirit that would allow you to do what you never thought you could do. Forgive your dad, forgive your mom, forgive your husband, forgive your wife. Oh, what would that kind of forgiveness do to your family? Not, I forgive you, that's over forever here, okay? That's over forever. But from the heart that cleansed the wound, that looked at the pain, that had to sob a little bit, it's about healing. It's about the extension of grace. It's real. Let's stand and pray. Jesus, stand. We're all standing here tonight, this morning, as your children. And we've heard the truth, and the hearts of the redeemed want to respond to this. It's one of the marks of the redeemed. We hear your word, and our spirits say, yes, that's what we want. But in our flesh, we need to acknowledge again our brokenness, because we can't even do this, even though we want to. And so in Jesus' name, I ask the power of your healing to move among us. I pray a spirit of grace, first of all, would just powerfully descend upon your people here. A spirit of grace would just move through these people. God that you would first of all just reaffirm and reconfirm in our spirits that we are a group of people who had a debt we couldn't pay but you have marvelously forgiven Father come right behind that would you? to us who are scared to forgive the wound is so deep we're afraid if we if we would go to that person and bring the real kind of healing we need it would be a painful process and it would God I pray that you would just release the spirit of forgiveness and a power to go through the process not just say the words we rebuke our forgiveness that's just about words but God an ability to go through the process and God I pray for a spirit of repentance too just move among us with genuine I'm sorry bring healing to your lambs in Jesus name
