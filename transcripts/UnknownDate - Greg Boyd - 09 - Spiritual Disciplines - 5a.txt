The extent to which God is the purpose for our being is the extent to which we're free and the extent to which we're whole. The extent to which we experience that, not just say it, but experience it. What we can do is take a phrase like that and chew on it and allow the Holy Spirit to begin to cultivate it into the soil of our mind and cultivate it in the soil of our heart so it begins to be a reality. What I want to do is open up this class with a short meditation. and I'm not it always happens with me where if I have a good experience with something I try to get other people to experience it and I learn that you can't do that but I want to invite you to take a truth and to for the next three minutes or so to just recite it over and over again maybe to say it back to the Lord to try to explore the meaning of each word and to experience the meaning of each word. I invite you to take this phrase, you are the reason for my being. You're the reason why I live. And just chew on that for a while. This is what meditation is. It's rumination. It's chewing on something. And as you do that, maybe have a list before you or however you do this in your mind of things that try to be the reason for your being, the purpose for your living. And as you recite what the true reason for your being is, feel a release from each of those. Release it. There's an incredible sense of freedom, of lightness that comes from letting go of these things of the world as being our ultimate priorities and reestablishing the one who is our ultimate priority, the one who, when all is said and done, is the only reason for our being. So take that. Let's chew on it. Think about it. Shut yourself in. You may want to go to your inner sanctuary, go to the recesses of your mind, the private place where you meet Jesus, and just meditate on this and feel the freedom and the release that comes with it. So let's just spend three or four minutes doing this, and then I'll close in prayer. Select your glory. And that's a good thing to have happen, to mirror yourself, But it's also good for us. Because when we mirror you, we reflect, and therefore we share in your joy, and we share in your peace, and we share in your love. We share in the blessedness that you have. You bestow it on us. You created us for yourself, Lord. You're the only reason why we exist. the only purpose for our being. So many other things, Lord, like leeches, try to suck that truth out of our life. Leeches of relationships, leeches of wounds. God, we have leeches of our jobs and ambition, and leeches of religion, and leeches of our image, and leeches of our achievement. Lord, they're all over us. but you are the reason for our living, Lord. Through the power of your Spirit, Lord, rip these leeches off of us that we can see you clearly, Lord, and live for you clearly. Lord, there's such, such incredible peace and there's such incredible joy when you are the reason for our living, the reason for our being. When we're single-minded on that, when that saturates everything we do from morning to night, Lord, there's freedom there. There's joy there that nothing else could ever give. And to know that, Lord, and to experience it makes us the richest people in the world. Our health could fail us. Our life could end tonight. Tragedy could happen to us. The future could be dismal. People could leave us. We could be maimed, but yet we'd be rich, Lord, if we just know that you're the purpose for our living, the reason for our living. And next to you, everything else is dwarfed in significance. Help us to experience that, Lord. In you, there's fullness of joy. All that we'd ever need is found in you. All that we ever crave is found in you. And it's not found in anything else. Oh God, grab our chins, look us in the eyes and keep our attention on you, our focus on you. We have many other responsibilities, Lord, many other things to do, things we've got to take care of, we've got to work, we have families, and those are gifts from you, Lord. But help us to have our motivation even for doing that, even for parenting, even for loving others, Lord, to be an aspect of the one thing that does matter, and that is you. You're a reason for being, God. Bless this time we have together, Lord God. Make it productive in our lives, not just in our minds, but in our lives. Change us, transform us, Lord, we pray in your name. Amen. Amen. Okay, I'd like to talk shop for a couple minutes. Some of you, as I said earlier, are on the end of a two-day fast. Maybe you're on the end of a one-day fast. Some of us are a little hungry. And I'd like to process that, but I don't only want to process that. I want to also open the floor for the other things that we've been talking about, the other meditations, the centering prayer, the resting in Christ, and see if you have any feedback on that or questions that arise from that. What kind of lessons are you learning? What's happening? What's happening? Anyone? Yeah, well, it's still physically good for you probably, but it's probably not worth the sacrifice if it's not making any spiritual gains from it. That's why it is really good to try to, when you fast, choose a time of fasting when you'll be able to set aside a special time for prayer and to reap the benefits. That's why I like to do it in times like where I have a service that night or something like that where I'm really going to get blessed with it. But also, the focus doesn't have to be limited to a special time. Now, depending on what you have to do, how much attention, If you're a computer operator or if you're an air traffic controller, you need to have quite a bit of attention. But you can work on being aware of the presence of God and reaping benefits from fasting, even if you don't have a special time, in the midst of all that you're doing, to be working on your project, to be working on your relationship with God, no matter what you're doing. But you're right, if that's lacking, then whatever benefits there are are largely physical. Although I would say that even apart from the spiritual benefits, it is spiritually good for you to tell your body, no, you're not going to get what you want for two days. I think even if you're miserable and you don't have any blessing from it, that in and of itself, just the fact that you took charge for a couple days, is for most people a good thing. For some people, where eating is not an issue at all, or their bodily cravings aren't an obstacle at all, maybe it's kind of passe. But then fasting wouldn't be that hard. But for a lot of us, we need to periodically assert our ownership over our bodies and that it doesn't own us. And so even without the spiritual benefits, it can be a good thing. Good, yeah. But you're a lot more desperate than you were two days ago. and that helps you empathize. It gives you a point of contact between you and other hungry people in the world. One third of the other people in the world are always in the state of being. And just to deny yourself two days puts you at least in empathy because to you, this is big stuff because you're used to eating all the time. So that's good. Anyone else? Yeah. Yeah, good. It's kind of a metaphor for life itself. I find sometimes that there's a tinge of, this is what happened with you, but this is what happens to me sometimes when I'm with people, go to a restaurant or something or walk through the Bethel lunch thing like I did today, and you look at people eating and stuff, and there can be a tinge of self-righteousness there. For me, it's not so much, I'm not eating, I'm sacrificing, but it's kind of like, Do you really need that food? Do you need to eat so much? Think of what we could be. Imagine, this is probably my mother talking here. When I didn't belong to the Clean Play Club, people in India are starving for that. Well, good, mail it to them. But it's like, do we need to eat as much as we eat? And maybe there's kind of a martyrdom thing that comes into the play there. Okay, good. Yeah. Well, the Bible is against mediums, talking to mediums or like seances of that sort of thing. But if you understand that we're talking, what you're talking to, like when I spoke with my grandmother and say, I forgive you, I'm speaking to my past wound. I'm speaking to that. And that's no different than thinking about her. I mean, the same logic would say, all you're doing is having spirit-inspired thinking about her. And it's not like an apparition or something or going to a seance or anything like that. you're just you're thinking about it, you're taking the thought of her into captivity into Christ but this person sounds like they really had a genuine concern and stuff and I don't know what if anything you'd say in response that would placate them or if you need to say anything I don't think you have to try to validate your experience to anybody it's good to listen and to say is this biblical and check it out. Check it out. Is this unbiblical? Is my intention to glorify God and is my intention to become more Christ-like? And is this bearing fruit in my life? Those are the criteria that you use. And if all those apply, then a person can say that the experience isn't valid, but it's kind of like, oh, okay. I've had people tell me that too, that that is not valid. I mean, there's a person I knew whose life was revolutionized by talking to Jesus in person. And, I mean, the breakthrough was incredible. We're talking about a person who had so many callous layers of bitterness and hatred and concealment, and his life was incredibly dysfunctional. And God broke through all this by making prayer more personal or whatever, because he was raised in a real formal kind of a church. And his pastor said, no, that's all bunk. And here this person is. Under his ministry, this guy was actually in prison. But now he's really discovering God. And what do you say about that? I just say, okay, you can have your opinion on that, but share with them what you can. Okay. Anyone else want to give any feedback? Were you done? Or did you want to process some more stuff? All right. I found out in the fasting thing today and yesterday that the body is like, and I think a lot of flesh strongholds are like this. They're like stubborn little kids. That there are periods where you go and you're okay, but then there are periods where it just throws a tantrum. And it says, I want, I want, I want. And it's very insistent. and just really puts up a fight. It's just like you go through about a half hour where it's just really, really miserable. But in time, it gets the message that you're not going to give in. And it gives up. It quits. It says, oh, this battle's not going to work anymore. Tries all of his little tricks and all of his little tactics, but if you just stick with it, in time, it knows it's fighting a losing battle, so it just gives up and subsides. I bet a lot of our life is like that with regard to growing in the Lord. There'll be times of fighting, but in time, it gives up, because it sees it won't win. That's where the single-mindedness comes from. Double-minded man is unstable and is all his way. If you give it a footing, it takes over. But if you just stay resolute, you're in the clear. Okay, anything else anyone wants to say? All right, let's go through it. One other thing that I felt about this, and I felt this before in fasting, and this is one of the things I like about fasting, but it's this. There simply is, maybe this isn't the experience of everybody, but it's been my experience, and it's been the experience of others throughout church history that have practiced this, but there's simply a feeling of rightness about having things in proper priority. It's like, and maybe this is just me, because maybe my body is more of an issue, but when I get my body in subjection by doing this, It's like everything else tends to line up. And there's a sense of joy there and a sense of wholeness that I don't normally experience. I'm sure I could experience it. I have experienced it apart from fasting. But fasting really helps me just put all the things up in the right line. I feel much more spirit-controlled. I feel like my mind has preeminence over my body. And it tends to get everything else kind of in order. And there's a sense of wholeness there. It's like I'm more, I am more being and I'm more integrated the way God created me to be and the way God created me to be integrated. It's like there's a proper prioritization here. It's like when you get one thing in your life topsy-turvy, it tends to infect everything else. But if you just take it and turn it right side up, then it tends to, you know, balance itself out. If you talk with people who have addictions, it tends to have repercussions on the rest of their life. It's very hard to be addicted to any one thing, however minor, and not have it in different ways affect and screw up the rest of your life. Okay, thought control. We talked a little bit about this. We got this far, I believe. Oh. Thought control. The importance of it. The Bible talks about fighting the fight of faith. 1 Timothy 6.12. One of the central fights we fight, maybe the central fight we fight, is the fight of... It's not a fight so much about our behavior, it's a fight to believe. It's a fight of faith. Believing that what is true about you is true about you. Believing that who you are, who the Bible says you are in Christ, is really what's true about you. It's a fight of faith. James tells us in 1.8 that the double-minded person is unstable in all their ways. A lot of the instability, the ambiguity, the compromising nature of our behavior and of our attitudes comes from the fact that our mind is torn between two different poles. It's torn between the old self and the new self, like we said last week. The old self, which Paul says is conformed to the pattern of this world. The pattern of this world being all, in various ways, simply a replication of what the serpent told Eve in the Garden of Eden. You can do it on your own. You don't need to depend on God. You can improve your state of being by something you do, by something you get. And then that plays itself out in a lot of different ways. It's the old self. You probably can't read this. But the old self tells us, the old self, the voice of mom, the voice of dad, the voice of friends, the voice of the media, the voice of everything else outside of Jesus Christ, usually, says things like, I'm a failure, I'm addicted. That's just the way I am. I lust, I hate, I'll never, and you can fill in the blank, I'll never succeed, I'll never live for God, I'll never get this right, I can't, I can't be more than a conqueror. All of that is kind of part of the pattern of this world. But the Bible says a lot of stuff about who we are in Christ. When we're saved, the Lord doesn't just rescue us from hell. He gives us a completely new identity. A completely new identity. We are, the Bible says, new creatures in Christ Jesus. Behold, old things have passed away. All things are new. You're new. You're recreated. As much recreated as when the Lord created the earth in Genesis. In fact, 2 Corinthians 4 uses that parallel. God who said, let there be light, when he created the light, also said, let there be light in your life. He spoke a new reality into your being. This self is dead to sin. Paul says we are dead to sin. That's what's true about us. We have died with Christ. We've been resurrected with Christ. Ephesians 1 tells us that in Christ we are loved. He loves us as we are in the beloved. The Bible says that with our new identity we're more than conquerors. The Bible says we can be free from all forms of bondage. The Bible says we have peace. The Bible says we're filled with the spirit of God. This is God's word fighting against the pattern of this world. But when we are torn between the two, to the degree that we're torn between the two, and to some degree we're always torn between the two, our life, our walk is ambiguous. It's partly spirit, partly flesh. It'll be a mixture of the two. See, the difference is this. when you can ask yourself, well, if I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus, if I really have a new identity, if behold, all things are new, then why am I so much like the old Greg Boyd? Why do I still have the thoughts and the feelings and the emotions of the old Greg Boyd that are totally against God? Why is there any fight? The answer is that when God spoke his word in the beginning, there was only void, there was nothingness. There was nothing to combat it, nothing to confront it. But when God said, let Greg Boyd be a new creature, There was already an existing Greg Boyd, partly conformed to the pattern of this world, a participant in this fallen order. And God doesn't want to just destroy Greg Boyd and create ex nihilo, a new Greg Boyd. He wants to transform me, not just create me out of nothing. The process of transformation is a process of God's word confronting, conflicting with, and overcoming the pattern of this world. The central ingredient in that, yes. Okay, there is an irony here. You see, the problem is that our thought has been controlled. I don't know if there's any that you're getting at, but that our thought has been controlled, and now we need to bring every thought captive into Christ, and it needs to become Christ-controlled. When I say thought-control, I'm meaning you control your thoughts, how to get control on your thoughts. Because centered to the whole thing, central to the whole process of transformation, is what we think in our mind. And you find that centrally played out in Scripture. I asked you to read some of these verses for this week. 2 Corinthians 10, 4, and 5. Does anyone know what that says? Okay, let's just run through these really quick. Would you read 2 Corinthians 10, 4, and 5? Would you read Philippians 4, 7 through 8? Would you read Deuteronomy 6, 4 through 9? Would you read, do you have a Bible? Romans 8, 5, and 7? Would you read Colossians 3, 2, and 3, and also 9 and 10? Got a Bible? Would you read Ephesians 4, 22 through 23? Anyone else have a Bible? Would you read Romans 12, 2? What version do you have? I don't think it'll work. That's why I put a question. I'll forget that one. And then I'll read Philippians 1. I mean, Psalms 1. okay 2nd corinthians 10 4 and 5 what does it say i just just see how central what goes on in the mind is to what goes on in our life that's the point of this it's really interesting i think that i'm not going to give a commentary on these verses but i will in this one because this is so central it's interesting when paul's talking about spiritual warfare he's saying we're in a battle and our the weapons of our warfare aren't carnal it's not like missiles or anything like that weapons of our warfare are spiritual and then he specifies how they're spiritual they're spiritual to the tearing down of strongholds every thought and every imagination every picture you got in your brain that is contrary to Christ and in tearing down those strongholds it brings every thought captive unto Christ the implication of the passage I think is clear that at least a primary place where we have demonic strongholds in our life hooks that the enemy has on us is in the mind because if you get the mind you got the person I mean they can have a regenerate heart and you've known people like this. Maybe you're one of these people that you have a regenerate heart, a sincere love for God. You know, you love the Lord with all your life, but your life is all screwed up. It's like it just never seems to come around. And other people say, well, how can you be a true Christian? But you know you really believe. And yet there's all this other dysfunctional stuff. Well, you got strongholds there that's preventing the reality that's there in your heart from becoming a manifested reality in your attitudes and in your behavior because the transitional point is in the mind. So our spiritual warfare, We'll talk more about spiritual warfare later on tonight. But the spiritual warfare is principally about tearing down strongholds in the mind, healing the mind, getting it out of the pattern of this world and getting it in line with God's Word. Philippians 4, 7 through 8. You want to have peace that passes understanding? Learn what to think about. We normally don't talk about what we think about. What do you think about during the day? We normally just kind of let it go free-for-all. But if you let it go free-for-all, you're going to be subjected to all the other influences in the world. If you're not intentional about your thought life, there are others who are intentional about it, and they'll get to sway. The question is, what's going to go on in your mind? And what goes on in your mind, whether we know it or not, determines how we see ourselves, how we behave, our attitudes, and everything else. Okay, Deuteronomy 6, 4 through 9. Okay, this is really good instruction here. This is really good instruction. That's Deuteronomy 6. What the Lord is really saying is, take my word and just make it a part of your entire life. Remind yourself of it constantly. Get a band around your forehead that reminds you of it. Tie it to your fingers. Put it on your doorpost. Put it all around. That's why I think sometimes it's good. We'll talk about this shortly. But on your refrigerator, things that you're working on, affirmations, things that are true about you, what the Word says about you. Put it all over the place. You know, just talk about it at the supper table. You know, just begin to make your ongoing living reality of the Lord Jesus Christ. What you talk about, what you think about, part of every area of your life. Okay, Romans 8, 5 through 7. Okay, that's good. If you want life and peace, set your mind on things of the Spirit. to the degree that our minds are preoccupied with things of the flesh, to the degree that we think in terms of the pattern of this world, there's destruction, there's death, there's hostility to God. Your heart can be regenerate and yet you can be very influenced by, have a stronghold in your life of a thought and imagination, a way of seeing yourself that is absolutely antithetical to God, which is why it brings forth fruit that's antithetical to God. What usually happens is we bark at the behavior, but the behavior is not the problem. The behavior is simply the shadow. of what came out, what's going on in your mind. If you're going to be transformed, it's going to have to go deeper than behavior. It's going to have to go into the mind. Okay, Colossians 3, 2 through 3. Okay, set your mind on things above, where your life is hid with Christ. What you do with your mind is all important. And he goes on to say we're being transformed by the renewing of our mind with the knowledge of who we are in Jesus Christ. The mind is central. Ephesians 4, 22 through 23, listen to this one. you guys this is so crucial here this is this is really getting to the heart of what we're talking about what we're dealing with in this class transformation put off the old self paul says now how do you put off the old self that how do you put off all this stuff that old self that old nature the pattern of this world how do you do that he goes on to say by being transformed by the renewing of your mind. The battle is the fight. It's a fight of faith. And it's because we're double-minded that we're unstable in all of our ways. To the degree that we are intentional and committed to being transformed in our mind, to thinking about ourselves as we really are in Christ, and not as every other voice in the world has told us to be, to that degree, we're going to be transformed. The behavior follows naturally and even inevitably out of the transformation that takes place in your mind. The issue between the old self and the new self isn't the issue of behavior. Trying hard to do this, trying hard to get this. There's effort involved, but the primary place where the effort is directed is what goes on in our mind. Again, we are just taught not to pay attention to this. It's just not there. Because it's not public, and we are in our culture so publicly orientated that there's a working assumption that what people can't see isn't important. What's behind the scenes isn't important. Biblically speaking, what's behind the scenes is all important because it is what produces what people do see. What people see isn't the issue. It's what they don't see. Okay, all right. I didn't think I had this much energy. Romans 12.2. Okay, Paul says, Don't be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed. How? By trying hard at your behavior, by working at your behavior, by shaming your behavior, by preaching and motivating people to change their behavior. No. Don't be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. the renewing of your mind, renewing. What do you chew on in your mind? What do you chew on? What do you think about in idle moments? What is there? What do you go to sleep with? What do you wake up with? What goes on in the mind determines everything else. And yet we're sitting ducks when we are unintentional about this. We walk around and we think the issue's out here and we just sort of let our mind be a vacuum. And that's how strongholds get in there because our minds are absorbing something. Our minds are sucking machines. is they just absorb. It's like, what does that show? Input. The robot keeps saying, input, input. I know you guys didn't see it, did you? Short circuit, yeah. Input. And, you know, whatever he sees, he wants to just take it. That's how our minds are. Our minds are always absorbing. You know, they're made that way. That's how we're wired. So the question is, what's going to go into your mind? If you're not intentional about it, there is a force out there that is intentional about it, and there'll be strongholds that you're going to have to be dealing with. Okay, Proverbs 23, 7. the reason I put a question mark there is because the translation is ambiguous but at least the older translations say as a person thinks in their heart so are they as a man thinks in his heart so is he but the word for thinks in his heart there can mean a couple different things so the RSV is something that's totally unrelated okay let me read one other thing here you find this throughout the Psalms let me just read one Psalm and I want you to see how intentional David was about what goes into his mind. 119. The red here is verses. You can't possibly read those. Why I put them down there, I don't know. I think it was just for me. But listen to verse 13. 119, 13. With my lips I recount. Okay, with my lips. I'm going to recount. I'm going to go through. I'm going to just recite all the laws that come from your mouth. Okay? 15. I meditate on your precepts and consider all your ways. The word meditate is to ruminate. I chew on all your precepts. I'm going to consider with my mind all of your ways. 23 and 24. Though rulers sit together and slander me, your servant will meditate on your decrees. Your statutes are my delight. They are my counselors. What's interesting here is that David probably only had a portion of the Torah. I mean, it was debated, but at the very most, what he was talking about was the Torah, the first five books of the Bible. and whatever oral traditions there had come from with the prophets up to this point. But he was in love with this stuff. Your statutes, your commands to me are my delight because they're my counselors. These aren't burdens that I carry. This is freedom. To follow your ways is the highest form of freedom. Look at verse 27. Let me understand the teaching of your precepts. Then I will meditate on all your wonders. My soul is weary with sorrow. Strengthen me according to your word. Keep me from deceitful ways. Be gracious to me through your law. I have chosen the way of truth. I have set my heart, my inner being, on your laws. I hold fast to your statutes, O Lord. Do not let me be put to shame. I run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free. This guy was in love with God's word. When you take God's word, the truth of God's word, and begin to mesh it into your mind and mesh it into your heart, there's freedom, absolute freedom. Let's go on. Verse 43. Law is freedom. Lift up my hands to your commands, which I love, and I meditate on your decrees. You get the impression that this guy really had the word in his heart. Let me just read a couple more. May the arrogant be put to shame for wronging me without cause, but I will meditate on all your precepts. And again, verse 98. Your commands make me wiser than my enemies, for they are ever with me. They're ever with me. I got him with me all the time. This guy's mind was formed by God's word. I have more insight than all my teachers, for I meditate on your statutes. The Bible has a lot to say about hiding the word of God in our heart, making it a part of our lives. Our minds are awake for, actually they're awake even while we're sleeping, right? They're always taking in. They're always taking in. The question is, what do they take in? As you think in your heart, so are you. This is a principle which modern psychology is just beginning to realize. Not just beginning. I'd say for the last hundred years they've been talking more about this. They can try to take credit for discovering this, but it's been a biblical principle from the start. That as you think in your heart, as your mind is, so are you. In psychology, they talk about core beliefs. Adler talks about core beliefs. And what he's discovered, but it's been around since the Bible, what he's discovered is that all behavior is a manifestation of some core belief. Not necessarily what you believe, what you think you believe in your cognitive mind, but core convictions that you have that maybe you don't even know you have, but that is what you ruminate on when you're not conscious of what you're thinking about. And these core beliefs, he says, determine our entire behavior. There's a lot of talk nowadays in pop psychology about self-talk. It's just a fancy word for thinking. When you think, you're talking to yourself. So they call it self-talk. And they're realizing, and to the degree that they conform to the Bible, it's true. They're realizing that how you talk to yourself, how you converse with the conversation that goes on in your head, and all thinking is a conversation. Think about it. See, you just had a conversation. Someone's talking and someone's listening. It's a conversation. Well, the nature of that conversation is the nature of your mind, and the nature of your mind determines what goes on in your life. They realize the truth of that. I mean, you look at successful people. They think they're successful. That's the conversation they had, and it's far more likely that they're going to bring forth successful behavior. The problem with pop psychology is not that, because that's biblical, being transformed by your mind. That's biblical. The problem with pop psychology is that it's based on a wish. It's based on a nothingness. There's no reality to it. It's just you wake up one day and think, I wish I was a top salesman. I'm going to think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it. Well, that might even do some good, but it's not based on any kind of reality. It may be that in truth you're a pretty lousy salesman, And maybe you should wake up to that fact and get a job cleaning cars or something. The problem with it is that it's not based on reality. In Scripture, we're to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. But this isn't wishful thinking. It's the farthest thing from it. We're not trying to just dream up what we wish we could be someday and think hard about it. We're trying to look at what is already the case, what is already true, what is real. And we're trying to not escape reality, which is what I think a lot of pop psychology is about. We're trying to discover. We're trying to realize in our life what is true about me. It's not wishful thinking. John Bradshaw and others, in fact, Jeff Van Vonderen talks about a shame grid, talking about the kind of interpretive device we have in our mind that interprets what goes into our mind in a shameful way. If you're with a person with a shame grid, anything you say will be interpreted as a shameful thing. You know, I like your shirt. Oh, you don't like my pants? or, you know, something like that. You know, but you've talked to people where you say something, and what they heard was a million miles from what you said. But what they hear, see, they don't really hear you. They hear themselves interpreting you. They hear their own conversation. So they may have, what they hear is that, whenever I talk to a male, I get shamed. Okay, they're always telling themselves that. That's their self-talk, pop-scizacology. That's their shame grit. so when I say something like let's say a male says something like what am I going to say well it would be good to see you at church what they hear is why aren't you at church or you're a lousy person for not going to church and then they get all this anger and rage you're just another male or something like that it could be a million different examples but you don't hear what the person is saying you hear what you think they're saying they're realizing the centrality of the importance of what goes on in their mind So the question is, how can we be transformed by the renewing of our mind? Yeah. Are you all familiar with positive confession? Okay, positive confession is a school of thought that comes out from Kenneth Hagen, Kenneth Copeland, Rhema Bible Institute. And a lot of times churches that have the word, word, in their titles are churches that more or less affiliate with positive confession. So I don't want to slam all churches that, you know, word of faith, speak the word. those kind of churches oftentimes are to some degree affiliated with the positive confession movement. What the positive confession movement says is that as a child of God, I don't want to get into this too much, okay, so I'm going to try to censor a lot, but the essential belief is that it's called a blab it and grab it theology. If you just speak it with your mouth, then you can grab it, then you can have it, all right? The main problem with that theology, though, is this. I think there's an element of truth to it, as there usually is to about everything. The element of truth is that what you think in your mind determines a lot of what you are. And the goal of our transformation is to get our thinking to line up with who we are in God's word. Where I think the movement goes wrong is in what it thinks God's word says about us. For example, they believe that every Christian has a right to be rich. And so you should go around confessing that you're going to be rich, always saying that you're going to be rich. And the result of that is that there's an indictment on you if you're very poor. They just think every Christian should own a nice car and all those other kinds of stuff. Financial hardship is not of God. I've always wished that they would preach this message in Calcutta and see if it works. And if it did, I'd begin to pay attention to them. But it only goes in America because we're already much richer than the rest of the world. They also believe that every Christian has a right, a right now, to never be sick. So if you're sick, you should never acknowledge that you're sick. That's just an illusion. That's a symptom of the devil. Don't ever say that. And so the indictment is that if you are sick or if you're handicapped or anything like that, there's something wrong with you. You lack faith. You lack a good relationship with the Lord. I've had a well-known positive confession preacher tell me about a girl that I know who was in a wheelchair that if she really believed God for it, she could get up out of that wheelchair. In other words, you don't believe enough. So not only are you crippled, but now it's your fault that you're crippled. Okay, so it's really damaging. They go off on some other areas too. But the principle of speaking to yourself the truth of God's word is a true principle. You guys have to be careful that what you're speaking to yourself is really the truth of God's word. And this could be another debate, but I really don't think that the Bible ever says that we're going to be free from being in poverty sometimes, being sick sometimes, going through trials and tribulations, maybe even being martyred. In fact, I've got to promise in another direction that you're going to suffer. Yes, but one thing that can happen is that a person who believes that can die unprepared. I think it's good to believe the Lord for healing and that he can heal you, and to believe that and pray for it. At the same time, start preparing for death. Because that's a process, too. At least it can be. I knew a lady in a very similar situation with cancer. She was the mother of a daughter in a church that I was the pastor at. And she was going to this church that was teaching this. And I'd go to visit her. And she would say the same thing. Oh, I'm claiming God's promises. I don't believe these lying symptoms of the devil. I'm healed. I'm claiming my healing. I'm just in here because my kids say I should be in the hospital but I just stay home it's really Christian science all over again but she was gradually getting worse and worse and worse her last words were and this was partly the result of her minister but she thought that if it must be sin that she's not being healed there's sin in her life that's why she's not being healed and the same sin which is preventing the body from being healed will prevent the soul from being healed so if she doesn't get healed she's going to hell that was her conclusion and her last words were my god i'm going to hell and she died and it was so sad because this is a believing woman a believing woman who uh um just died a tragic tragic sad death because she was misinformed uh she's held the wrong ideas about things i did my first funeral and she was my first funeral i ever did i was just a young minister my first funeral and this is just a little antidote but in this funeral this maybe will explain a little bit my antipathy towards this group, but she crashed the funeral. The minister crashed the funeral, who had caused her to die like this. The family was enraged that she had inflicted this pain on their mother. She crashed the funeral with a guitar and a bunch of her groupies, and came in there right in the middle of the sermon and started singing, and singing these upbeat songs, and all this other kind of stuff. I'm telling you, I finally had to get the ushers to take them out. It was kind of sad. Now, that's not norm for positive confession churches. I'm not trying to say that. Go ahead. Yes. You get a vending machine view of God. I've heard them say, God, I command you to heal me. Whoa. There's no idea, there's no place for saying, not my will, but thine be done. What if you misinterpreted the scripture? you know or that's not a possibility for them someone else had their hand up right exactly and what happens is that you know it's like with a kid if you always give them what they want right when they want it because they think that they know what's best they never mature in ways that they can enjoy and they can experience joy that they never would have had had they never been denied there's joy in denial there's there can be a profound joy through suffering and hardships, whatever. But if God's your vending machine, that's not going to happen. If God was a vending machine, in this case, then when it doesn't happen, they beat themselves up for it. I know a guy, honestly, I went to school with a guy at Princeton who for four months went without his glasses. He's legally blind, but he went without his glasses, almost flunked out of college, gotten three car wrecks. But he was confessing that, not when he was at Princeton, this happened beforehand, but he went to this Fremont church in Illinois where they've been sued because they've had a couple of babies die because they didn't take him to the doctor. He used to go to that church. But he wouldn't confess that he had poor eyesight because how could God will poor eyesight on a person? So in Christ, I can see just straight. And then he rams into the guy's back. His dad finally committed him to a psychiatrist, and that's how he got straightened out. Okay. I'm going to just run through quite briefly some suggestions on thought on how to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. A couple of suggestions, very practical. And if you have others to add to it, I really would like to hear them. These are largely things that work for me. What is scriptural memorization? Scriptural memorization. You can do it in a general way or you can do it in a specific way. By general way, I mean just decide to start memorizing the Bible. And you start with the book of John, maybe. Start with Leviticus if you want, but that probably won't work. And you try to memorize it. It's good to do. You're hiding the Word of God in your heart. When you get to the genealogy stuff, it might be a little tough. But you just go through, and there are people who practice this. And that's a good discipline to have. I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. At one point in my life, I had the Book of Romans memorized. And I'd get up in the morning, and I just would go through the chapters of it. And that was really good to have. I mean, it's good to have there. What I found, however, is that the only things that stick long range with me are the things that really intersect with issues in my life. And that's what I mean by specific. I don't have time to try to memorize the Bible now. Luther had the entire New Testament memorized in its original Greek. Man, that guy was sharp. But by specific, I mean this. Take scriptures which jump out at you when you're reading the Bible, and we'll talk about that next week, about reading the Bible devotionally. Scriptures that the Holy Spirit highlights, scriptures that really pertain to issues that you're going through, and memorize those. It may be that if you're going through a particular kind of struggle, or you're experiencing a particular kind of pain, or you're going through some real anxiety, to, in your concordance, look up verses that deal with peace, and memorize those. Write them down on a piece of paper, tack them to the refrigerator, Put them on the headboard of your car. Paste them on the top of books. Do what Deuteronomy 6 says. And memorize those. Hide them. And as you're going down the road, to just begin to recite those over and over again. I find that sometimes if you do this and you emphasize a different word every time you recite it, it brings out different meanings, different nuances, and a different experience than you would have had if you just would have read it in a normal fashion. You know, I shall give him perfect peace whose eyes are stayed on me. I shall give him perfect peace, whose eyes are stayed on him. I shall give him perfect peace, whose eyes are stayed on him. I shall give him perfect peace. You see, you emphasize different words, and that helps sear it into your mind. And that becomes part of your thinking. You're now giving good input. You're giving good input into your mind. That's part of being transformed by the renewing of your mind. You'll find that as you do this, it begins to affect your behavior. It begins to affect your attitudes. It begins to affect your self-disposition.
