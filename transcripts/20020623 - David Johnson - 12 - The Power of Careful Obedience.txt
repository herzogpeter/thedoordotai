I miss my friend Kim. She was small, but to many of us, she was a giant. And Kim had felt distinctly called, and you know this has to be a call from God, to be an intercessor for me. So she took me on as her project. And while she would sit in most services, like right back there in that location, if I were ever speaking, you would notice she changed her place. She would always be sitting right next to me in her chair. And as the musicians would be playing their offertory before I would come up here, she would always put her little hand on my shoulder, and she would pray for me. And then she'd push me out of my chair. And say, get up there. So when she passed this week so unexpectedly, I mean, and having to think of preparing for this message in our funeral and facing that loss and things like that. I was driving my car and I was like, you stinker. What a week to pull this shenanigan on me. You know, I just can't believe you do this to me. And there was this little voice and it wasn't hers, but said, don't worry, I'll help you with this. And she has. I know she had been praying for me because she left me a voicemail message. Actually, shortly before she died, saying, thinking about you, praying for you, that God will work in and through you this weekend. So she's already prayed for this service. And so hang on, folks. And in a strange way, she's laid her hands on all of us. And we are the recipients of her gifts to us. Father, we are grateful to be here, and Kimmer has already prayed for this place. she's already gone ahead of us and I ask that you will open our eyes open our ears to hear what you're saying to us in Jesus name amen last week David explored that ugly passage that we had stumbled into in Jericho or around Jericho and in Joshua that he could no longer avoid which I'm glad he couldn't and that was simply that amazing command that said go in and destroy everything every living thing destroy it men women animals everything except that which is devoted to me which is the gold and the silver the bronze and the iron you're to bring to the treasury and when you look at that passage you go that is so harsh that is so severe but it is that testament to us and that reminder again to us that God is absolutely unchanging, that the wages of sin always has been and always will be death. Justice demands that the guilty be punished. The law that is broken cries out, and justice says the guilty must be punished. And it's at that point that many of us, rightfully so, turn and say, but God is a God of love. But we misunderstand that God's love is not tolerance. It isn't as if his law cries out for punishment and his love goes, I'll just smile. You'll get away with it. It's not tolerance. His love is a righteous love and it agrees with justice that there must be punishment for the guilty. But in between those, God has put this mediating facet of his character. Mercy. Mercy. And so God's love, agreeing with God's justice in the middle finds mercy. How do we find safety? God is not really safe. But he's always good. He's always merciful. He's always gracious. He is not willing that any should perish. The Ark of the Covenant itself speaks to this tension. That box that the children of Israel carried around the wilderness area and brought eventually to the wonderful temple was about four feet long, two and a half feet wide, two and a half feet high, and inlaid with gold and overlaid with gold. And in it was the law. In it was the law. And above it were these cherubim with their wings. And God said, I will dwell among those cherubim. My presence, my loving presence, my righteous loving presence will be right there among the wings of those cherubim. Love, God, looking down at love that demands that the guilty be punished. But in the middle was the mercy seat. And once a year, the priest would take an innocent animal on the Day of Atonement, and he would confess the sins of the people over that animal. That animal would be sacrificed, and he took the blood from that innocent animal, and he sprinkled it on the mercy seat to atone for the sins of the people. God is not willing that any should perish. And if you have any doubt about that, as severe as you think the dealing of God is with Canaan, look at Rahab. Rahab was a Canaanite and she was spared. When the spies came across, they talked to her and they found their hiding and shelter in her home and at night when they were getting ready to go to sleep, she came up to the rooftop and said, all of us, all of this land has heard about the greatness of your God. How long ago was that witness known to the Canaanites? She recites their history. We know how he opened the Red Sea. That was over 40 years ago that the Canaanites knew about the greatness of God. And after she recites that history, she says, Your Lord is the Lord indeed, and surely he will give this land into your hands. But will you remember me? And God did remember her. We know how that came out. When Jericho was destroyed, Rahab and her family, she's the first real live witness. Her family was saved. God's power is always in dynamic tension here. He is always working to destroy the works of the enemy, and he's always working to restore a people, both at the same time. And this is the story of biblical history. God is looking for a people that will obey him, that will follow him. when I say that word obey it conjures about as much warmth in us as a suicide bomber you know it's kind of like oh yuck you're going to have to talk about obedience here no one's going to tell me what to do obedience obeying is really a gracious thing that God allows us and permits us to do it's coming into a place of right relationship with God it's aligning ourself and agreeing with God it's saying yes to what God says yes to and no to what God says no to. If God says it's evil, I agree and say it's evil. If God says it's good, I agree and I do what is good. That is what obeying is. I'm simply responding and agreeing with God. Look at the people of Israel. Let's just recap their history for a second. They were in bondage, enslavement in Egypt, and it was not a good scene. And they had been praying a prayer that Jesus actually reiterates a long time afterwards. Deliver us from evil. and God does. Miraculously he delivers them. They walk out of Egypt and they come to the place of the Red Sea which would have been the place of the end of their journey right there and God says, stand here, watch, I will do something for you. Never again, no more, forever, will you ever see the people that had enslaved you and held you in bondage and as Moses extends his arm over the Red Sea, The water splits and divides and walls up on either side. They go across on dry land and in the process the water closes. And never again, no more, forever did they see what had enslaved them. Deliver us from evil. And their prayer was answered. God says you were brought out on eagles wings. You are my treasured possession. You are a holy nation of priests unto me. and Moses in that process gives people some general directions and instructions and with one voice they respond we will do everything the Lord has said. Read Exodus 19, 20 carefully on forward and you're going to see the gracious gift of God given in the law to his people so that they could live in alignment with what he said was good and right and they're experiencing an amazing thing. Those people were standing on the threshold of the very throne room of God. the cloud descended thunder and lightning God was among those people and not very long after their prayer has been answered delivered us from evil that they have stood on the very threshold in fact they're standing on the threshold as it were of the throne room of God they disobey God remember they worshipped the golden calf they made their image to bow down to we have a power struggle that is represented there that is as old as the garden of eden itself am i created in the image of god or am i created like god it was the very temptation that that satan threw at adam and eve it's the very problem that satan had in the beginning i will ascend i will be like god no you're not goodbye you're out of here then he comes down to the garden here are these wonderful people and he comes up and says has not God said oh no no no no don't be afraid go ahead eat of that fruit you will be like God oh what would be wrong with that if I think I'm created to be like God I decide what is good what is evil I run my life according to what I think is best. Satan's problem becomes my problem. I do life my way. I may even try to blend a little of my way and God's way all at the same time. If I determine that I am actually created in the image of God, I will know the power of God. I will live in the blessing of God because I will walk in his ways and I will learn to live in reliance and dependence and obedience upon God and the blessings will follow. Of God, or in the image of God, blessings. Like God, curses. All you have to do is read Deuteronomy. The last chapter is when Moses is giving his amazing last sermon to the people of Israel and he says, if you will obey, if you will respond accordingly to what God has commanded, you will have, and he lists these amazing blessings, you disobey. You think you're God, and you disobey, boom. All these curses will befall you. This generation could not get beyond that struggle. In the wilderness, everything was about them. I'm thirsty. I'm hungry. I'm tired. I'm hot. I don't like Moses. I don't, I mean it's just I, I, I, I all the time God goes fine I'll feed you fine I'll give you water fine I'll give you shade fine I'll give you a night light fine I'll give you, no your clothes won't wear out on and on and on he goes and then he says go out and spy out the land that I promised you you will be able to take this land but just come back and give a report and those spies come racing back Caleb and Joshua are like yes we're on our way God can do this The others are like, no, no, no, we're like grasshoppers. We'll never be able to do this. Which report did the people believe? Here's a little truth. If you want to be a person that is able to stand in faith, which is a growing thing, you have to live as the image of God, in obedience to God. Because what God will eventually do, if you think you're like God and you can just run life on your own, he'll bring you to a place where something is too big for you to do. And when they looked inwardly at themselves they knew they could not take that land. That it was going to be a place of conflict. Where they had been delivered from evil from one sense of the world's domination they were now going to be brought to a place where they were going to have to face their enemies and rather than trust God and believe that he was able to do that through them they were like we can't do that. He's right. They couldn't do that. But they couldn't even believe that God could do that if they obeyed. and God just said fuck everybody 20 years old and over you're going to die here in the wilderness the wages of sin the wages of disobedience is death may not be instant in God's own time so they were not going to be able to enter the promised land except for two Caleb and Joshua and their families who believed and trusted God that it could be done. Now, I cannot imagine what it must have been like for Caleb and Joshua. Everyone now knows they're going to live. And they're all going to die. That builds relationships. That's tight. I think that at that point, Caleb and Joshua went, we're moving next to each other. So they bring their tents every morning. flunk. The tribune, the wilderness tribune flopped outside their tents. Joshua would go, scoop it up, flipped immediately to the obituaries. And look, then walk over to Caleb's tent and Caleb would say, I know, it was a bad day, only 16 died. How is it like to be the last one of the generation? Caleb and Joshua are here to visit you. That'll be a gas. How's your cost? You're not getting better, I hope, are you? Finally, the last old codger kicked off, and they went, woo-hoo! This is good news. We're out of here. Their bones are scattered around the wilderness, bleaching in the sun. Let's get ready. We want to take on the land. It's a pivotal point. It's a pivotal point. God gives Joshua some very clear directions. Be strong and courageous. I love that. Oh, be strong and courageous. Yes, yes, yes, that's good. That's really good. Be careful to obey everything I have commanded. Be strong and courageous. Be very careful to obey. Joshua, in other words, if you want to experience strength and courage, obey. you obey and the strength and the courage will be there for you we're at a very pivotal point in the history of these people are we going to see the Israelization of Canaan or are we going to see the Canaanization of Israel Joshua calls the people to consecrate themselves he says for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you and they do consecration was a form of ritual where they were cleansing themselves on the outside but it was not the washing on the outside remember even Jesus talked about this don't just be concerned about washing the outside of the cup the idea was to do this external work that was to bring you to a place of openness where you were doing the internal work with God where you were bringing yourself where you would set yourself apart wholly onto God where you would say whatever is on the inside that would be a roadblock to your working, wherever I am in disobedience, I will to live in obedience to you. I will agree that your ways are right, oh God. It was the bringing of the head and the heart together. So many times we know, but we don't do. And it was to bring them into alignment with one another. It's no wonder that God did amazing things among them Because where a people walk in obedience, the power of God will be there. A consecrated people have put down their own self-will, their own selfish desires. A consecrated people have taken their power, the power that they would use for their own advantage, and yielded it over to God so that he can work through them. A consecrated people can trust God regardless of what the circumstantial evidence shows, and they can take a step of risky obedience into a flooded river. when the people of Israel were going to be delivered from their enslavement, Moses stretched out his hand you read how this is different we just think, oh, water divided and water divided there's a huge difference this time this time God is leading his way through the water pick up the ark stand back people, get back God is leading the way Joshua is not extending his hand God is going to do this work carry me towards the water. And if you were looking at the circumstances, you would say this makes no sense whatsoever. That ark is a goner. They're down in the bottom. Gold, don't float. And when their feet touched that water and they started to walk in, boom! And instead, where it says that the water piled up for Moses, it was if God just, boom! He pushed that river back. And you look geographically at where that water would have gone, they say it was anywhere from 19 to 30 miles that he just, boom, pushed it back. That's a lot of space. That water disappeared from the visual sight lines of anybody who was standing there. It was gone. Huge witness to Canaan, by the way. You don't think anybody spread the word around there? Whoa, big trouble. Water, boom, bang, you know. Another call to repent given to those people. They're coming across. God's leading the way. It's a marvelous picture. Those of you who are being baptized, those of you who have been baptized, those of you who haven't been baptized, you need to wonder about this. It's not just getting wet. It's a huge picture. I am crucified with Christ. I've gone into the place of certain death. I am buried there. And I come out on the other side resurrected in newness of life. The old has passed. The new has come. What I was there, I leave behind. I am separated from my ancestral bondage. The places of the wilderness in my life, the places of my own selfishness are gone. and I am now empowered to live as a new creation. And because of that, they took 12 stones that had been by the feet of those priests who had held that ark in the place of death, carried them out, placed them as a monument that said, You are a new people. You have gone from the place of death to the place of life. 1 Peter 2.9 captures this in reference to us. Peter was capturing that Old Testament image when he said, You are a chosen people. You are a royal priesthood. A holy nation. A people belonging to God that you may declare the praises of him. Who called you out of darkness. Out of the wilderness. Into his marvelous light. Into the place of promise. Through his resurrection power. Old things passed away. New things. King God. made a way where there was no way. And there on the other side, the knife of circumcision is applied to mark a new generation with a covenantal mark that they were a people separated onto God, that God keeps his promises and that through them all the nations would be blessed. And then God says, take Jericho. Well, Jericho may not have been a large city, but it was a fortified city. These people were not warriors. They had no idea of how to do siege against a walled fortress. And anybody who knows the history of the ancients knows that a fortified city was almost undefeatable. There really were not a whole lot of ways except to march and stand and wait, and hopefully you could outlast the people inside with their supplies of water and their supplies of food. But given the environment, most armies just usually went, I'm out of here. They baked in the sun for so long and then said, we can't do this any longer. So God brings them to this stronghold. God didn't tell them, sharpen your swords. He said, consecrate yourself. Go through. Come through the waters. Bear the mark of my promise. They had done the spiritual preparation. And they were a people who were now filled with the resurrection life and power of God. They had obeyed. They had followed God on the path of a risky obedience. And they were identifying themselves with God. Their spiritual preparation was far more important than any form of military preparation. And they took the simple directions and obeyed God and walked around the stronghold. which made no sense. Walls just don't fall down when you walk around them. No visible circumstantial evidence that anything had changed except the people standing on the wall going, na-na-na-na-na-na. I mean, you know, nothing. And Joshua says, this is it, folks. Blow the trumpet, give the shout of victory. And I don't know if I've been walking there, and I think that's why one of the commands was, and be silent when you're walking around, because I would have been mumbling going, what in the world are we doing this for? This makes absolutely no sense. I can't figure this out for crying out loud. Did you just hear, he said, shout, yeah, woohoo! Like that's going to make a difference. I think that's why he told them, be quiet. Because we grumble a lot. And they shouted, they blew the trumpets as if something was really going to happen, and it did. When they followed in obedience to God, I think God all of a sudden looked over the very portals of heaven and went, oh, I love those people! Amen! Push the walls down. They rush into the city. They do exactly what God had commanded. They kill everything. The wages of sin is death, except for Rahab, who had acknowledged the living God, and they bring her out with her family. She winds up, by the way, in a very significant lineage. Look at your scripture. Pretty amazing. And there they came. Gold, silver, bronze, and iron. They took that out. It was to go to God. to the victor belongs the spoils. Who was the victor in this case? God was. God had done the victory for them. And they come. The men are carrying these items. And I can just imagine, there's Joshua, some of the leaders, and they're saying, bring it over here for the temple treasury, for the treasury of God. And they go, okay. And they're singing, I surrender all, all to him I freely give. I will ever love and trust him daily in his presence live. Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink. Okay? And this guy, Achan, is doing the same thing. He comes along and he goes, clink, drops a little in. Of course, in his tunic, he's got a little gold, a little silver, and a Babylonian robe. So everybody's like, this was a good day. Yeah, it was. Hey, Achan, what did you think? Oh, God's great. Isn't it amazing? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Have a good day. Ducks in his tent. And he's like, look at this stuff. And then he hides it under his tent. You know what? Sin is stupid. I mean, there's just no getting around it. Sin is stupid. Where did he think he was going to wear this robe anyway? Everyone had been wearing for 40 years the same recycled clothes. And at the next bar mitzvah, when they're all wearing basic black, He shows up looking like a Canaanite. And everybody goes, where'd you get that? I don't think you've ever been to Babylonia. Oh, like, hello? Didn't you guys get this robe? I mean, it was stupid. You couldn't enjoy it. There's a good message here. You can't live within the context of the community of faith and enjoy sinning. It's just a miserable place to be. If you want to sin, you've got to get out there with Canaanites. It would have fit in out there, but not within the context of the community of faith. Well, it's time to conquer another city. Let's take AI. Let's take AI. Now, why did they pick AI? You have to look at what the name AI means. It means heap. This was like one major town. Heapville. You know, if your town is called Heap, you haven't got a whole lot going for you. It's already kind of like half gone. And they decide, if we send 2,000 to 3,000 men over there, we'll just overpower. I mean, this was going to be overkill for this thing. But they wanted to have victory, and they wanted to be assured, and they were kind of novice at this thing, so off they go. Well, we know what happens. 36 of the Israelites die. And they put to flight a few farmers with a couple of little sticks, essentially, put this entire 2,000 to 3,000 army to flight. And so the score is Heapville, 36, Israel, nothing. Joshua gets word of this. He falls flat on his face, rips his clothes, puts dust on his head, and he does what many of us do when we face defeat. God, this is your fault. What did you do? What did you do? Were you just bringing us out here to destroy us? Instead of pointing his finger at God, he had a memory lapse. Be careful to obey, and when you do, you will have success. He should have been looking to point out, where's the sin God pointed out? And God is very gentle with Joshua. Read the passage of scripture. God looks down and says, Stand up! Exclamation point. What are you doing down on your face? Israel has sinned. They have disobeyed. They have taken the devoted things, the gold and the silver that was to be to God. They have stolen. That's an interesting perspective. I mean it was a robe that was destined for destruction and God says no it was stolen it should have been left there and they have taken and they have put the possessions of Canaan in with their own stuff and they're hiding it and you know what until it's out of here I'm not going with you and you will face the destruction of yourself you will never be able to stand against your enemies find this stuff and destroy it Well, I have no idea how this worked. But Joshua calls the people to consecrate themselves. Come on, folks. Let's get into a place of right alignment with God. Let them search our hearts. See if there's any wicked way in me. Try me. Know me. Cleanse me. I say yes, God. I say yes to your way, to your will. I will respond. I will obey. Consecrate. And then the searching process begins. I don't know. they brought all the tribes by Judah they brought all the clans by there's the clan they brought all of the tribes by and clans and families and ultimately as they started to go by by family there's the family now bring all the men by boop boop boop boop ooh Achan you are the weakest link goodbye God will not be mocked. Whether in the present moment, but in the timing of God, the wages of sin is still death. Go get the stuff from his tent, bring his sons, his daughters, every living animal, and we're taking them out, and we're stoning them, and we're burning it. the judgment of Canaan came upon Achan because he possessed Canaan even in little measure. You go, well, that's pretty severe. How severe was it when you think that because of his sin 36 of his brothers died? Sin has a community impact. It has a community impact. Sometimes other innocent people bear the consequences of something we have done and hidden on the inside. The power of God was directly related to their obedience. Their pathway to power was very simple. Obey. It wasn't a formulaic obedience. simply doing the right thing because it was the right thing. It was an obedience that was to be flowing out of being a transformed people, a people who would come through the place of death into resurrection life, who were empowered by God for good works. And this is what Jesus was confronting in the scribes and Pharisees when he looked at them and he said, well, yeah, on the outside you look like an Israelite, but on the inside you're a Canaanite. You're full of dead man's bones. If you love me, Jesus said, keep my commandments. He didn't say, if you love me, tell me you love me. He said, no, keep my commandments. Love for God will willingly put to death anything of the unholy, those places of disobedience, and will say yes to the ways of God. Do you know what? I find that there are times when I'm just like Achan. I hide some of Canaan in my tent. I hold it there. And yet I want to live within the kingdom of God. I want the kingdom blessings and a little bit of Canaan at the same time. I know I'm not alone because over the years as a pastor, I've prayed with people who come and they say, I really would like you to pray with me about something. And in the process, they actually wind up confessing some things that are sin. And I'll look at them and I'll say, this is sin. Well, I know, I know. But you kind of have to understand my past. I mean, I really did not have a good family of origin. I had no good models. And I'm like, have you given your life to Christ? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, then you've been empowered to walk from the place of death in your past to newness of life. Oh, I know, but just kind of, would you just pray for me? And they want me to somehow ask God to bless them on this side while they still hold on to Canaan on this side. it just doesn't work that way and then they wonder why they experienced defeat and death in their life when the people of God lived in obedience to God they were undefeatable nothing stood in their way however if you want to see what the canonization of Israel looks like all you have to do is turn to judges it is hell in fact Canaan looked better than canonized Israelites they were a mess and we look at one of the judges Samson I used to love him as a kid I was like I love the way he tied the foxes tails together and he set the fields on fire and he took down oh wow you know he's kind of a superhero and he's no hero folks the bottom line the bottom line in the story of Samson is this he was better off dead than alive that's how God felt about it are we sinless no we have sinned do we need to allow God to search our repent? Yes. To confess? Repent? And when we do, we will experience the appropriate resurrection power that gives us the ability to obey because we're being transformed from the inside out. Remember David's vision of a church filled with light that he keeps talking about? And we know that the light is actually coming from the people, but there are people who are devoted to obeying God who walk in the light as he is in the light who have true fellowship with one another who are allowing their tents to be cleaned by the blood of Jesus who has purified them from all sin in and among those kind of people God will dwell and he will do amazing things remember I mentioned Kim Kim was in the singles ministry here at Open Door and that's where I started when I first came so she was a part of the leadership team and I got to know her as a person who was gifted and loved God and had a passion to pursue God and one time she said would you be willing to come and visit me at my apartment now if she were sitting here she would never want this illustration said not because of embarrassment but she would go never single me out but she's not here right now so she's over dancing somewhere So I said sure I'll come over and I'll visit you So I went over to our little apartment in Robbinsdale And we sat and talked She wasn't much for idle chit chat That's for sure And all of a sudden she says I have some things I would like to confess I went what? What? I have some things I'd like to confess Oh Things that I've held inside That I know do not honor God And they're doing me no good I would like to get them On the outside okay and so she went through a confession of bringing some things out of her tent exposing them see there's a big difference Achan got caught it's a big difference there he may have had regret but you can confess and repent you can bring it out yourself and she prayed this prayer of repentance and then I prayed this little prayer and something happened. It was just like God came down and we were just sitting there going Doug, look, he's here. I mean the hair stood on the back of my head it still does to this day it was like whoa it was amazing power when people start to consecrate themselves and it was like I'm out of here bye looked at her and tears were just streaming down her face I said, Kim, what was that? Did you see anything? She goes, yeah. I saw me dancing. He who the Son sets free is free indeed. It started a process in our relationship of confession and repentance. We were in a church plant situation together where the love of power, which really brings disobedience, the love of power brings disobedience. The power of love brings us to obedience. We were in this situation where the love of power was bringing disobedience. It was just shredding people alive. And I would walk into the office because she was there and she was working, and I'd say, I'm so angry. I am so, and I would just kind of fume. And she would go, Scott, I think you have something to confess. there is resentment and bitterness and thank you, thank you, thank you, Kim. Thank you, thank you. And I would sit down and I would confess and repent and she would lay her little hand on my shoulder and she would pray for me. The most dangerous words that Kim Fisk ever said were I will pray for you. that could be good or it could be bad depending on your definition and this morning I'm going to invite you in a moment to simply respond the worship team is going to come they can make their way now I'm going to ask the altar team to come forward and if you were at PCM over the past couple weeks and a part of prayer teams I'm going to simply ask you to come as well and stand along the front the worship team is going to play some music and then eventually they're going to start to sing. And I want us to stand and be in a place of letting that music wash over us, bathe us. And I want you to say, God, you have access to my tent. Your ways are right, oh God. Is there anything of Canaan in here that I've buried that's underneath that I need to get rid of? And you may be able to just even stand here or sit down and do that process with God, but you may feel the necessity to have someone speak those words over you that says you are forgiven, you are in the place of resurrection power, you can walk from your past. You don't have to be held under the curses of defeat of Canaan and live in newness of power and newness of life. If that's the case, these people will be here for that. And we're going to do that for a few moments, and then I'll come and I will close the service, and the prayer team will still be here. The worship team will sing for a few more minutes, and you can bring anything at that point forward. Stand. This is a time when many times shame grips our life. We say, what would other people think? Pride, the gigantic eye in there, can hold us and enslave us. we may need to break the silence in some way it may be something that you even need to process later with other people but let's let God search our tents and do his work Father I pray this morning that you would first of all break the stronghold of shame that would come over our lives right now even sometimes we have this fear of confessing to you alone but your ways are right and you are gracious and compassionate God, not willing that any should perish, that we should be able to live in the newness of life. And so I ask that you would break the stronghold and that you would search our hearts and do your work among us in the next few moments. In Jesus' name, amen. God, we want to be a people who are wholly devoted to you. Your ways are right. They are life-giving ways. and we ask that you will continue to work in us to be a people of the light in Jesus name Amen Amen.
