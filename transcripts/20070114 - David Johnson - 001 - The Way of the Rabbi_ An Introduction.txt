Amen. I'd like us to pray as we move in now to the ministry of the Word this morning. Father, my request, my desire this morning is this, that you would be well pleased, indeed, that your heart would sing as we talk this morning about your Son, as we actually boast of your Son, Jesus. And I ask that in the name of your Son, Jesus. Amen. Well, today we are actually doing something that we don't do very often here at Open Door, in case you're visiting or something. We are actually beginning a new series of sermons. It's kind of a rare occurrence. The last time we did this was two years ago today, actually, when we began what we were calling for two years, a journey with the Holy Spirit. And prior to that, we spent almost a year and a half on what we call the journey of the heart using the life of David as the basis for our study. So it's kind of a big deal, I think, that today we're beginning another journey, beloved, that will bring us on what we will be referring to for as long as we're on it. the way of the rabbi. And our rabbi is Jesus. Jesus. Is to us many things. He is Savior and Lord. He is Redeemer. The writer of the Hebrews calls him the radiance of God's glory. The exact representation of God's nature. Who upholds all things by the word of his power that's Jesus. But 2,000 years ago, to the people who knew him best and walked this earth with him in incarnational ways, in human ways, also knew him as their rabbi. 14 times in the Gospels alone, he is referred to as such. Luke 7, Matthew 22, Matthew 19, Luke 12, Luke 19, Luke 20. The Sadducees, the Pharisees, sometimes people in the crowd, the rich young ruler, his disciples as well, all of them at one time or another referred to him as rabbi, and some of them called him my rabbi. Forty times Jesus was called teacher, several times he was called master, but he wasn't called in Jesus' day master the way we might think of Jesus as master in the context of his deity like Lord and master, though that's a fine thing to say. They would call him master because that's what a rabbi was, a master of the Scriptures, a master of life, rabbi. Brian McLaren, in his book, The Secret Message of Jesus, says that Jesus was master at making the music of life, not just with wood and string, tuners and frets like a musician, but with skin and bone, smile and laughter, shout and whisper, time and space, food and drink. And then he invited his disciples, his students, to learn how to make this life music themselves, to become masters of life themselves. So they watched him, and they watched him live and play and laugh and interact with people and with life until his disciples began to have the same spirit of his style and power of his performance. They were actually becoming like the master, like their rabbi. Now, I don't know how the effect of this series is going to land on you. I don't know how it's going to affect us as a body, though I think it will. But my desire is this, that those of us who already know and love Jesus, and maybe have for a very long time been walking with him, will, through this series, come to know Jesus as rabbi. And in coming to know him that way, may come to know and love him in a whole new way that is fresh and alive and invigorating and even somewhat disturbing in the analogy I have. It's like a couple who's maybe been married for a very long time. And, you know, if you just kind of go on the way you are, you'll be married for a very long time and you really do love each other and you really do know each other. But after all this time, all of a sudden, you look across the room and you go, whoa, whoa, there's more in her. There's more in him that I ever knew. And then the discovery, after years and years, of being with this person that you know and love, all of a sudden there's this awareness this person's more complicated than I knew, more intriguing, more exciting than I ever dreamed I'm inviting you into that kind of thing as we start this journey with the rabbi. Because I'm here to tell you, everything you ever believed about Jesus is true, but there's more. I'm not kidding. I have another desire, and I'd ask you to pray with me for this to be fulfilled by the power of the Spirit that those among us who don't know our rabbi at all would through this series not only come to know him but would choose with us to follow this rabbi like an apprentice would follow a master, the master of life, this Jesus who we call rabbi. Now, to get the ball rolling today, by way of introduction, I want us this morning to begin, just begin, to get a picture of how it was in Jesus' day that, first of all, rabbis were formed. In other words, how a rabbi became a rabbi. I think you'll find this fascinating, and it's going to tell us a lot about Jesus. And in that, I also want to establish why it is that I'm so convinced that Jesus actually was a rabbi and how it is that rabbinic students called Talmudim actually became the Talmudim. That's a word you're going to become familiar with. It's going to be on the screen there because I want you to know how to pronounce it. Talmudim, that's the Hebrew word for disciple. Talmudim is actually the plural. Disciples, when you ever hear me say Talmudim, I'm speaking of disciples. Talmid is the singular of that word and that's on the screen as well just for you to see it, learn how to pronounce it. You're going to become familiar with this. Now, to do that today, what we're going to do today, and for actually some weeks to come, is to plunge into the first century world of Jesus. In many ways, today is going to be like a history lesson before we're able to get to the text. And particularly today, what we're going to get into and get a picture of is the educational system of Jesus' day that will explain a lot of this whole rabbinic thing and why it is so exciting, quite frankly. Now, I'm aware that as we get into this historic piece of this that a number of you are going to be fascinated by this history. When we've done this kind of thing in the past, many of you have come up to me and really have wanted, where do you get this stuff and how can I follow up? And so, because of that, we're going to make available a list of all the resources that I've been kind of tapping into for almost a year and a half. I've been kind of sniffing this stuff out for quite a long time. It actually did begin for me, this series, and the idea of doing it about a year and a half ago when kind of randomly it ended up on my desk. I don't even remember how a tape that I listened to by a guy named Rob Bell, which got me interested in a book that Rob Bell wrote that is on my list of resources and I recommend you read as well, called Velvet Elvis. And as I read the book and I listened to this tape, both of which kind of framed Jesus as this rabbi, I'd never heard this stuff before. I began to wonder, where is he getting this stuff? Because I wanted to know more, and as I began to do some research, I found a guy named Ray Vanderland, and you're going to find it. He's on our website as well, and you can click onto his website and get the information. He's quite a significant... In fact, he's the guy that I'm quite sure Rob Bell gets his stuff from. Authors over the next however long we're in this, Obery, Hendricks, N.T. Wright, Brian McLaren, Dallas Willard, David Biven, and a number of fascinating websites that you can just check out on our website And as we add to that list, we'll make that available to you. So just know about that. Now, let's begin this morning by understanding this about the educational system in Jesus' day. That in Jesus' day, education, particularly the education of children, was of utmost importance. But it wasn't math and science that they taught. It was primarily the Torah. Because to a Jew in Jesus' day, and this would have also been true of Jesus, so dial into this, the Torah was a source of life. Because it told them how to do life. And the Torah was central to their identity as Jews, as a people of faith, as a people of culture. Particularly, the Torah was central to them and important to them in the context of where they lived. in Jesus' day in this oppressive system that was embodied in Rome, Rome posing a very real threat to snuff out the cultural reality and the spiritual reality of the Jewish people as they were in bondage to them and overpowering them. So Torah was central. Now, some of you may know what Torah is and others may not. Torah was and is, as many of you know, the first five books of the Old Testament. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. They are referred also to as the five books of Moses, the Pentateuch. Sometimes they are simply referred to as the law. The law, which for some of us carries negative and restrictive connotations. When we think of the law, we think of things that are legalistic and something that needs to be fought against in some way. But dial into this. You really need to do this for a first century Jew, including Jesus. Thus, the Torah contained for them the words of life. The Torah, in their mind, was a wonderful gift from a loving God. In fact, the fact that they had the Torah was an indicator to them that God did love them because God was providing for them, his people, the best possible information on how they could experience life to the absolute fullest. Now, some admittedly took the Torah and messed it up with their interpretation of the Torah. And sometimes interpretations of the Torah in Jesus' day had become so burdensome and so heavy that people were under an incredible weight. And it didn't feel like life, and it didn't feel like joy. In some ways, it had begun to even minister death to some of them, not because of the Torah, but because of people's interpretations. And heavy weights were being put on people. Jesus, a rabbi, came and said, let me give you another interpretation of the law, of the words of God to lift this burden off of you. But you just need to dial in again to the fact that a first century Jew, to a first century Jew, Torah was sweeter than honey. Torah was the bread of life. They were the very words of God. Common question in Jesus' day relative to education would be a question like this. At what age do you begin to teach your children Torah? One rabbi answered it this way. Under the age of six, do not receive a child as a pupil, but at the age of six, accept him and stuff him with Torah like an ox. I like that. Because they believed that if the text, if the Torah did not get into the mind and the heart and the soul, the mefesh of a child, that they were one generation away from losing their identity as a people, as a faith community. They would just get absorbed by Rome. They would get overwhelmed by the culture of the Greeks. One rabbi put it this way, the world subsists through the breath of school children. So if you go, the rabbi would say, into a synagogue or a school and you find there the voices of children uplifted, singing and chanting the Torah, Our existence as a people is secure. I don't care what Rome does, how much they oppress us and kill us. If you hear the voices of children singing and chanting the Torah, there is hope. But if those voices grow silent, the end is near. Now, Jesus was from Galilee. You remember that, I'm sure. And there was an assumption because of that that Jesus had little or no education. It's an assumption that's based largely on a number of disparaging passages of Scripture, statements in Scripture, from people making comments about Galileans. And you may remember some of them. One is in John 1.46 where people are responding and trying to figure out who this Jesus is. And the question arose, can anything at all good come from Nazareth? Nazareth being in Galilee. The assumption was that if you're from Nazareth, you're from Galilee. What are you? What do you have to offer? Same kind of thing. You get in John chapter 7, verse 15, and the Jews were amazed and asked, how did this man, and they were speaking of Jesus, how did this man get such learning without having studied? They're scratching their heads. Well, the answer was this. He didn't get his learning without having studied. He studied a lot, and you know how we know? Precisely because he grew up in Galilee. One of the sources I told you that I have been using, and it was especially in the front end of this series, this guy is going to be very, very critical to us. This guy's name is Ray Vanderlyn, and he's got one of the websites you can click onto off of our website. And also a guy named David Biven. Both of them kind of collaborated in separate articles to indicate this, that the people of Galilee were in fact, in Jesus' day, the most religious Jews in all the world. This is quite contrary, both of them said, to the common view that Galileans were all simple, uneducated peasants from an isolated area. Fact is, it just wasn't true. I mean, they were peasants, but they weren't uneducated. Indeed, they go on to say, more famous Jewish teachers came from Galilee than anywhere else in the world in Jesus' day. These negative statements, therefore, actually reflect a Judean bias at the time against Galileans. Judeans saw themselves as cultured and cosmopolitan and looked down their noses at Galileans who they saw as coarse and unrefined. And I tried to go, what would that be like? And I think it's very much like someone who maybe grows up in the big city. And because they're from the big city, they think that's the biggest and the best and the coolest and the smartest and the toughest. And assumes, therefore, that if you come from Podunk City, Iowa, you just can't possibly have much going on. So when you meet someone from Podunk, Iowa, who actually does have something going on, you act all surprised and say really brilliant things like this. Where'd you get all that learning? Well, I got it in Podunk City, Iowa, you idiot. I got it in Galilee. Now, in Jesus' day, particularly in Galilee, there were three levels or stages of learning. And we have that kind of thing now. There's elementary school, then you have junior high, high school, college, graduate studies, on and on. These three stages were stages that Jesus undoubtedly went through. And this is where it just becomes fascinating, which means that we actually do know some things about Jesus and his childhood. A lot of things we don't know, but I think there are some things we can now assume, and it's going to fill in a lot of blanks for you relative to this. So let me tell you about the three stages and what it means to the whole rabbinic thing and what it meant to be the Talmudim and all of that kind of stuff. Stage number one was called Betsephir. And what Betsephir means is the house of the book. Betsephir began at the age of six and usually went until about the age of ten, kind of like an elementary school process. It was usually taught in a local synagogue by a local rabbi, because every village would have a synagogue and have a local rabbi, kind of like even in little towns you're going to find a little, even the history, you see this little church and stuff like that, and some presence and teaching. Now the primary objective at this level, at Bet Sefer, with kids from 6 to 10 years of age, was to, in the words of that rabbi, stuff them with Torah like an ox. And the fact is this, they literally would memorize Scripture. You want to know how much? The first five books of the Bible. They would memorize the entire thing from age 6 to age 10. Most Jewish children in Jesus' day had completely memorized it by the time they were 10 years old. Now keep in mind why they would do this. Remember, Torah was central to their identity as a people. In Jesus' day, and this is things you would know without me telling you, they had no printing press. There were no Bibles in every home. You couldn't just go to the bookstore. There was usually, if the town or the village was lucky, there was one scroll in the entire village, and it would be in the synagogue. But that would be all there that they would have. And the only way they could continue to preserve what the words of God to the people of God were, the only way they could perpetuate this thing and protect this thing was to memorize this thing. So it's just kind of part of an expectation. And they would, in fact, memorize it. And by the way, if you think your kids could never, my kids could never do that, well, they might not ever do it, but they probably could. How many 10, 12-year-old boys or girls do you know who know just about every word from movies like Dumb and Dumber. I mean, you just kind of can do it. But understand this, that when you think of teaching young kids like this, the entire Torah, the Pentateuch, all first five books of the Old Testament, you need to understand that rabbis were good. They were skilled teachers, and they could make it fun for the students. one of the things I dug up in terms of the research search, in terms of what rabbis would do, is they would do things like this. I mean, picture the kids, first day of class, and then they would do this several times in the course of the year, but they would take the children and take the tablets upon which they would write their lesson, and they would cover the tablet with honey. Before the lesson even began, they would just cover it with honey, and honey in those days was like ice cream. This was like a special treat. And then the rabbi would begin to sing and dance up and down the aisles and among the children, and he would sing these songs and chant these truths and tell these stories of Ezekiel. And he would sing a song of Ezekiel who tasted the scroll and said that it tasted as sweet as honey. And then he would sing a song and tell the story of Jeremiah who said, thy words were found and I did eat them and they were to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart. Oh, children, he would say, taste and see that God is good. and they would taste the honey and they would connect the taste of honey to the words of God and then they would begin to eat the words and devour the words and sing and dance and laugh for joy. Rabbis were passionate and quirky. They were funny. They got angry. They ranted and raved. They all had their quirky little mannerisms that their Talmudim inadvertently would just pick up and end up looking just like them. With all of that in your mind, just ask the Spirit of God. In fact, as you're asking the Spirit of God to enter into this whole series, ask the Spirit of God to quicken and awaken your imagination. With everything I just said to you, now imagine Jesus as a 10-year-old boy. Can you picture him? As a 10-year-old boy sitting in Bethsefer. Do you think his eyes were bright? Do you think his spirit was eager? Do you think his heart was full? And in addition to that, have you ever thought of meeting his rabbi? Have you ever thought that Jesus had in Bethsefer what we would call a Sunday school teacher, an anonymous person that no one knows but they're in heaven? Do you ever think of getting in heaven one day and talking to Jesus' rabbi? What was he like? Were his eyes bright? Were his spirit eager? was his heart alive. This rabbi, think of that, teaching 10-year-old Jesus the very words of God, his Abba, in Bethsefer. Now, at the age of 10, most kids were done. Bethsefer was all there was. And if they were done, they would then go home learn the family trade, often prepare themselves for marriage. You may recall that in that culture at that time, young girls were often given in marriage as young as 13, and that makes us cringe. But you also need to remember that in Nazareth, the life expectancy of men and women in Jesus' day was about 35 years old because of poverty, which we're going to go into and look at how that shaped Jesus and his message, blessed are the poor. And nutrition and lack of nutrition, Their teeth would often fall out in their late 20s. But they would go after Bet Zephyr and they would learn the family trade, prepare to marry. But if you were really good in Bet Zephyr, the rabbis would notice the ones who seemed to have maybe a special gift. They would advance then to the next level called Bet Talmud. Bet Talmud, which means the house of learning. And this stage would go from about 10 years of age to 14. In Bet-Telmud, the memorization thing would continue, believe it or not. They would then memorize the rest of the Hebrew texts. From Genesis to Malachi. Ray Vanderlyn, again, indicates it's interesting. He did at least part of his PhD, his doctoral work in Israel, and was part of a rabbinic school. And he indicates that he was the only American, the only Christian, the only evangelical Christian. He was also the only one in the class of 22 who had not memorized all of the Old Testament. So this is still true in many places today. But beyond the memorization thing, at this level, the kids would begin to learn the rabbinic art of questions and answers. But it wasn't the kind of questions and answers that we're used to in our Western educational system, where you're fed a question and your job is to spit back the answer, and it's always about making sure you get the right answer or the wrong answer. Like we would ask this question in our system. And it's not a bad thing to do, but the question would be, what is 2 plus 2? And the answer is 4. Any other answer is wrong, and what you say is 4. In Bet-Telmud, if a student was asked what's 2 plus 2, they wouldn't ever say 4. Because the whole thing was about asking questions and answering a question with another question. So if the question in Bet-Telmud was something like, what's two plus two, which they never would get asked that question, but if it was two plus two, the way they would answer it would be with another question, maybe something like, what's 16 divided by four? And then the teacher would come back with another question that would be the same thing. The answer was four. No one would say four, and round and round and round. They would go questions and answers back and forth. Do you recall how many times in Scripture, I'm sure you do, as you're maybe connecting to dot yourself, Jesus would answer a question with a question. I mean, we've talked about that before, and I kind of always thought he was doing that just to be difficult and evasive, which is something I liked about him. Well, there really was part of that going on, and we will in the next few weeks see some real cool evidence of that. But the bottom line is you need to understand that answering questions with questions was not evasive. It was rabbinic. Everybody did that. It's just that Jesus did it better than most. I mean, you've got to know everybody thinks this way. Everybody's trained this way. And Jesus would get to the point with coming back with questions to other rabbis and to the Pharisees in particular. And there are several texts where it says the Pharisees wouldn't ask him any more questions because he'd tie him in knots. See, at this level, they didn't want their kids just to spit the answer back. They needed to learn how to think. Not just what to think, but how to think. How many of you know people who have all sorts of information? They have all, but they don't know how to process that stuff, connect it to life in any way at all. Bethelmur was about getting them to interact with the information, and the information was the text. They taught them to get behind it, underneath it, to look at it from more than one perspective. Rabbis would talk about the scriptures being like a jewel. And you look at it this way and you see this incredible beauty. But all you have to do is turn it. And when you turn it, you see more. And when you turn it again, you see more. And it just keeps going and going. This is our God. These are the words of God. You had to learn that sometimes there's more than one right answer. And that bugs us in the West. There's right and there's wrong. There's black and there's white. You had never made it. in Pet Talmud. They had to deal with things that seemed to contradict and to see that sometimes things that contradicted were both true. How many of you ever see Fiddler on the Roof? Remember the rabbis would go on the one hand and everybody would go oh yeah that's true and as soon as everybody was going yeah that's true the rabbi would go but on the other hand and then they would just mess with their mind and both of them were true. and it was all about teaching them how to think not just what to think they were full of the text I can't wait to get to parables when we get to know who our rabbi is we're going to let our rabbi teach us some parables and we'll hear the parables of Jesus and part of the point of parables was not to figure out I've got to slow down part of the point of parables was to confuse people, to knock them off center, and to make them consider the possibility that what they think and how they see things is wrong. Very disturbing. And if you don't like that, you're going to hate this series. And they were doing all of this, dial into this, in Jesus' day with kids between the ages of 10 and 14. But like today, not everyone in Jesus' day could do it. Talmud had the best of the best. The kids in Beth Talmud were sharp. In fact, some of them might become rabbis themselves. Now, with all of that in mind, let me remind you of a story. You may even be thinking of it right now when I talked about Jesus at this age. It's found in Luke's Gospel, the second chapter. Remember the story of Mary and Joseph? The parents of Jesus had gone to Jerusalem for Passover. as they did every year. This year, Jesus is 12 years old. It says in verse 42, and in verse 40, just previous to 42, it says this about Jesus, I love this, that the child had grown, he was 12 years old, he had grown and become strong, increasing in wisdom, 12 years old, increasing in wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. How do you think he increased in wisdom? I can tell you how. One way, it wasn't because he was God and he lived in a pod like the Matrix and he was just being fed, downloaded, I will give you all, he was in Beth Talmud. At 12 years old, he would have been right in the middle of Bet Talmud, growing in wisdom, becoming strong in his mind and in his heart. For three days in Luke chapter 2, he became separated from his family. They were frantic. They went looking for him everywhere. When finally they found him where? You know where. In the temple. Verse 46. Sitting in the midst of the teachers. Can you see it? In the midst of the rabbis. That's what teachers are. both listening to them and asking them what? Questions. And he wasn't asking them what's two plus two. Or even what's the meaning of the world. He was listening to them and asking and answering their questions with questions, and they were answering with questions. And round and round they were going, verse 47, and all who heard this 12-year-old kid were amazed at his understanding and his answers. because even for a kid in Beth Talmud and everyone in Beth Talmud was sharp, this kid was good. And I start to love him in a whole different way. Jesus was brilliant. Well, at the end of Beth Talmud, there was a third possibility that very few ever made it to. It's called Bet Midrash Which means the house of study And this is where it gets interesting Relative to rabbinic stuff And whether Jesus was a rabbi At 15 years of age The best of the best of the best A very elite group Would get approval You had to get approval first And then they would After they got approved to do this They would have the right to choose And then approach a very powerful rabbi. I think a pretty easy corollary here would be kids who go to high school and they want to go on to college. And you just don't go on to college. You have to have a track record in high school. And the better you did in high school, the more prestigious rabbi school can you apply to. And the best of the best of the best, this would have been the Harvard and the Yale. I mean, these were the elite, the cream of the crops. And they would then apply, depending on their ability, to a greater or a lesser kind of rabbi with the hopes that they would be accepted as one of their Talmudim, their disciples, their students, their apprentices, so they could become masters of the scriptures and masters of life. Now, this process of acceptance was grueling. Rabbis would meet with these young students applying and ask them questions like this. In the book of Habakkuk, what are the 17 references to Deuteronomy? Give them to me backwards. And they would do it. Vanderlin talks about a rabbinic technique that's called the remez. R-E-M-E-Z. Remez, it kind of means hint. It's where you would use part of a scripture passage. Now remember, these kids have been in the scriptures their whole life, So the scriptures are in them. So they would use part of a scripture passage, assuming that the student that they're talking to knows the part that they left out. So they would, you know, Isaiah something or other and do the verse and leave a phrase out. But the part you left out was the point you were trying to make. It's called a remiss. How many of you remember times when Jesus would be talking and maybe quoting some scripture, and the next verse says that the Pharisees wanted to kill him. And you're going, huh? These guys are really touchy. What's the deal? Vanderland says there were as many as 22 remesses in the Gospels where Jesus says a scripture, but he leaves out the part that says, go to hell. But guess who knew what it was? Guess who knew what came next? Guess who knew what Jesus left out in this remez? The Pharisees. And they wanted to kill him. One of the more intriguing remezes and poignant ones was one he did with John the Baptist. Remember John the Baptist was in prison, didn't know if he would live or die, and he came to this place where he said he wanted to know if Jesus was Messiah or not. Are you the one that we've been waiting for, that I've been talking about? So he sent his disciples to Jesus. Jesus sent him back with this message. And the message was right out of Isaiah 35. He quoted Isaiah 35, tell John that the blind see, the lame walk, and the poor are having good news preached to them. But he left something out of Isaiah 35. You know what he left out? That the prisoners will go free. That was a message to John. John knew what he meant. He left it out. John, I am the one, but you're going down. Now the reason this process was so grueling was because what the rabbis were actually looking for when they were looking for their Talmudim was not just Talmudim who were smart. They were all smart at this level. They were looking for people who they believed had the capacity to actually perpetuate their legacy as a rabbi, their interpretation literally of Torah. And every rabbi did indeed have their own interpretation of Torah. It's part of what made each one of the rabbis distinct. And their distinct interpretation of Torah, we've talked about this in the past here at Open Door, their interpretation of the Torah was referred to as their yoke. An easier way to understand it is it was their way of interpreting the scriptures, of knowing God. It was their way indeed of living. So as the process began, what the rabbi is actually looking for was someone who he believed had what it took to carry his yoke, to deal with the text, and to embody this rabbi's way of living and to bring it into the next generation. Indeed, this rabbi was looking for someone, and this is the key, this is critical. He was looking for someone who could and who would become just like him. Luke 6, 40, Jesus said, No disciple, no talmid is above his master, above his rabbi or teacher, but every talmid, after he has been fully trained, will be just like his rabbi, his teacher. And that was the point. And part of why the rabbis were so picky in their choosing, because the question is, does this kid have what it takes? Will he make the cut? Now, if he did make the cut, and you notice I keep saying he, just remember that, because it was just he, and Jesus is going to blow that up too. I love this rabbi. Because if he did make the cut, the rabbi would say these words to a student that I just got to know, they sounded like music to their ears. The rabbi, at the end of the process, would say, lehacharai, come follow me. And follow him, they would. So I'm telling you, sometimes to extreme and ridiculous levels. I mean, if the rabbi was walking down the road, they would follow. If the rabbi picked up a piece of grass and began to chew on it, they would pick up a piece of grass and begin to chew on it. They would follow the rabbi into the bathroom. I'm not kidding. I'm not just trying to be gross, though I don't mind it. Because I'm a little, you know, goofy myself. No, but it's true. They would. They would follow him into the bathroom because they wanted to do everything the way the rabbi did it, including that. Sorry. Rabbis had blessings for everything. I mean, picture a rabbi. This is a true blessing. Rabbis coming out of the bathroom, his talmudim are kind of following him, bumping him. I mean, it had to be a bit comical at times. And the rabbi would say something like this, a natural blessing. Blessed are you, O God, ruler of the world, who created man in wisdom with numerous orifices and spaces. It is known before you that if one of those orifices should open when it ought to close, or closes when it ought to open, we would cease to exist. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And all his talmudim would echo, blessed be the name of the Lord. And the rabbi would smile. A mischievous smile and just think, these guys will say anything I say. And the rabbi, the talmudim would just kind of thrown off all the time. is he serious? Is he not? I don't know. Just do what he does. Fact is you would want to pray like your rabbi and you'd watch him pray and you'd say I want to pray like him. And you'd want to memorize the scriptures like he memorized the scriptures. You'd want to study and speak and act and walk and talk just like your rabbi to literally be covered with the dust of your rabbi. I use that phrase because Ray Vandelin talked about the fact that that phrase was actually a blessing that would be conferred upon people from time to time. It was just something that sometimes a rabbi would say to his own Talmudin or other people who knew them. But often it was spoken for the first time when they were accepted into Bet Midrash. It was kind of like an ordination. And what was spoken over them, among other things, was this. as you begin to follow this, Rabbi, may you be covered in the dust. Rabbi, may you follow so close that what he kicks up from his sandals would just get all over you. Don't you like that? But the harsh reality is this. Not everyone did make the cut. So rabbis would inevitably have to say to some, indeed to most, I'm sorry, it's just that you don't have what it takes. You're a good person. You love God. You know the Torah. So go home and learn a trade. It's an honorable and a noble thing. Make babies and pray that your babies become rabbis. They would actually say that. Now, with all of that in mind, come with me to Matthew chapter 4. As I wrap this whole thing up, at least for this morning. Verse 18. A verse you've heard many, many times before. It says this, And walking by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus, the rabbi. Got to keep that in mind. Saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting his end into the sea, for they were fishermen. Stop right there. Why were they fishermen? What does it mean that they were fishermen? Well, it doesn't mean anything. It just means they were fishermen. Well, that's what I always thought. You know whatever else it means? It means that Simon, who was called Peter, and his brother Andrew didn't make the cut. They didn't make the cut. And Jesus, the great rabbi, said to them, verse 19, Come follow me. Those words that sounded like music to the Talmudim. And now these guys were hearing it from this rabbi and immediately, now I know why. Immediately, it says, verse 20, they left their nets and followed him. Verse 21, and going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, in the boat with Zebedee, their father, mending their nets. And he called them to Lachachari, come follow me. And immediately they left their boat and their father and followed Jesus. Kind of already giving it away, but have you ever wondered? Why? Have you ever pictured it in your mind, this scene? I'm sure you have. And growing up in church and seeing these dopey movies that people made of Jesus and the disciples, I've always kind of had this space alien kind of vibe going on in my mind when Jesus came to the disciples. He would come and there would be like music in the background. And he was always blue-eyed and blonde-haired and, you know, spoke with a British accent. And anyway, anyway, and he would come follow me. And the disciples, it was like they got in a trench. It was like they were on drugs or something. Okay, we will follow you. Can't, you know, feature it any other way. No, this, the reason they left, you know now, was because a rabbi, a rabbi, and next week we're going to find out the kind of rabbi he was, and he was good. A rabbi, among the best in that day, came to us and said that he believes that we have what it takes to be his Talmudim. And what that means is he believes we can become like him and that we could carry his yoke, his way, his interpretation of the scriptures and of life and that he believes that we could perpetuate his cause. You can hear where this is going. Ever wonder about Zebedee? Rob Bell does some hysterical stuff about Zebedee the father. You know, Peter comes up to the boys and says, follow me and the boys. And what happens to Zebedee? There's nothing in there. And Bill just does this hysteria. I can't do how he, but he goes, you kids, where are you going? You know, he goes bankrupt the next day. And he's all downcast. He goes home and goes, the kids, they left, whatever. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You got to get it. You got to get what this meant in this culture. I think you do get it. If Zebedee goes into the town the next day because this rabbi had called his sons, he would go into town and meet his buddies and say something like this. You may notice I do not have my sons today. You know? Because a rabbi, a rabbi came and told them they were first-round draft picks. I want you. By the way, remember the age? How old were these kids when they went to Bet Midrash and applied to become the Talmudim? Remember the age? 15 years old, 15, 16, 17 years old. which means that quite possibly we don't know this for sure but most of the stuff i'm reading right now most of them are kind of in agreement that probably these guys except for peter was probably older and that was another pattern a rabbi jesus was about 30 would have younger kids as the talmudim and one would be a little older peter was the only one married he was a little older but most of these kids picture them in your mind as late high school early college, and these are the kids who he called out to change the world. And so you kids in late high school and early college, you listen to this. And Church of the Open Door, when we talk about the next generation, this is huge. In all of history, there have been only two rabbis who ever called or recruited the Talmudim. Because everybody else, you had to go to them and you had to be approved. There were only two that called Talmudim. One was a rabbi named Hillel who said, I believe God can make a disciple of anybody. I think we like that rabbi. The other rabbi, the only other rabbi that we know of was Jesus, who would sometimes say things like this to his Talmudim when they were discouraged and afraid, not doing very well, wondering if they had what it took to keep on following. He'd say things like this from time to time. You need to remember something that you have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, which was not Jesus saying, I'm a Calvinist. What he's saying is this, I am not like other rabbis. I am not like any other rabbi. He's got Shmiha. I'll tell you what that means next week. I am not like other rabbis. See, you didn't have to prove yourself to me for me to choose you. And in my choosing you, in the very act of that, I was saying something to you that you can never forget. It's this, that I believe you have what it takes to follow me. Indeed, I believe that you can become just like me. I believe that you can carry my yoke. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light, but it will cost you everything. There's your paradox again. I believe that you can perpetuate my cause, but you've got a lot to learn. And it will require everything you are and everything you have. Lechachorai. Come follow me. Guess what? They did. Here's the good news. I close with this. That this rabbi, whose name is Jesus, this rabbi is still alive. Some more good news. This rabbi, whose name is Jesus, who is still alive, is still calling his Talmudim. Men and women who he believes can become just like him. And among the fascinating things about our rabbi is this. While he'll take anyone, he really will take anyone, our rabbi takes special delight in going out of his way to call the not good enoughs. The people who think they have no chance with God or with his kingdom or with his purposes because they've just blown it too often and too badly. He takes special delight in going to fishermen and tax collectors and prostitutes and women at the well who have more husbands than they can even remember. He did indeed call women. And I said I would get back to this. And again, it sounds, you know, he had women. It sounds almost condescending or something. You need to know what an un... It was like Jesus as a rabbi. They would never call a woman. It was all men. It says in Luke chapter 8 that Mary the Magdalene was one of his Talmudine. Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward, was one of his Talmudine along with Susanna. Among his... It's like Jesus said, you know, I really don't care how anybody else does it because this rabbi had shmeha. I'll tell you what that is next week. Oh. See, our rabbi would call men and women, and he would say things like this, Lechacharai, come follow me. Here's my question as I close. Can you hear him saying it now? Because he is saying it now. He is alive, and our rabbi this morning is saying this as we begin this journey on the first day of our journey, Church of the Open Door, Lechacharai. Come on. come follow me. It sounds like music to me, the fact that our rabbi believes that ordinary people like you and me can not only follow him, but that we could become just like him. So I close with a question, and it's a question I'm going to begin with next week. Who's your rabbi? who's your rabbi because you have someone in your life you've probably given authority to and you follow them and you pay attention and you think boy they're so smart and you may not even have acknowledged it who's your rabbi I would invite you to pay very close attention to this one we'll pick it up right there next week would you stand with me as we close Father I just want to say this that I am and we are very grateful that your son is the firstborn of all creation he is the exact representation of your nature and holds all things by the word of his power but we are also grateful Father that your son became a man and in his humanness became a rabbi who now by the power of your spirit calls us to follow him as his Talmud Dean. I pray Father that you would move among us in ways that change us forever. Not only in our understanding of who you are but how it is that we live and follow you. It's Talmud. Pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
