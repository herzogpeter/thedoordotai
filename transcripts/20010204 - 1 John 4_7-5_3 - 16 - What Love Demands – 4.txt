Father, we thank you for the life of your spirit, the work of your spirit among us and in us and through us as we worship and celebrate and feel our spirit soar as we hear truth. And we just celebrate it. I pray, Father, now that as we open your word, that your spirit would be strongly active as well. And our spirits would rise to meet the truth. And desire to have worked in us the works of your spirit and your kingdom truth. We pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. I'd like you to open your Bibles to 1 John 4. I think most of you know that we're in the middle of a series of sermons born of our study kind of broadly in 1 John, but specifically these last few weeks in 1 John 4, that is making it abundantly clear that the centrality, priority, and necessity of love is indeed at the very heart of God. Verse 21, John says, And this is the commandment we heard from him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. But John heard more from him than just love your brother. Not just your brother in faith, but love people in general. Your neighbor in particular, your enemy as well. Indeed, John goes so far as to say this in verse 8, that the one who does not love does not know God. For God is love. In other words, how could God, John is thinking. who is love, live in someone without in some fashion manifesting through that someone who God is. And God is love. But the key verse around which we've been camping in this section of chapter 4 has been verse 12, where John said, Now what we noted a couple weeks ago, and I think it's very important to connect these dots, is that phrase, no man has seen God at any time, is a phrase that John used one other time. But he used it in his gospel, and he was speaking of the incarnation. In other words, it went like this. I think it was in verse 19. No man has seen God at any time, he says in John 1, 19. But then the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory. Jesus, the incarnation, revealed to us the face of God. Well, what he's saying now in his epistle is this, that love that's come to you, now flowing through you, born of God, has the power to do the same thing. to reveal the face of God to people who have never seen the face of God and do not understand who he is. We've been saying it this way for the last couple of weeks, that nothing has more power on earth to reveal the face of God and to declare the truth about the amazing grace of God than when the people of God demonstrate in tangible ways the love of God. Jesus said it this way, By this shall all men know that you are indeed followers of me, if you live a life of love. The manifested love of God, having come to us, now flowing through us, is more compelling than a sermon. It's more moving than a song, more convincing than a creed. It has the power to change people, to open and disarm people. It is precisely why Paul said in Philippians 4, verse 5, that we are to let our forbearing love be made known to all men. Let that be the first thing they see about you, the first thing they know about you, because love is a language that the dumb can speak and the deaf can understand. But the opposite of this is true as well, we have discovered. For nothing has more power on earth to distort the face of God and confuse the message of amazing grace than when the people of God who claim to know the love of God do not demonstrate that love in any tangible way. Thomas Cahill in his book Desire of the Everlasting Hills gives testimony to that when he says this As we stand now at the entrance to the third millennium since Christ We can look back over the horrors of Christian history Never doubting that if Christians had more often put kindness ahead of devotion to good order Theological correction, theological correctness and our own justifications if we had followed more closely the simple teachings of the master or the humble footsteps of the hated Samaritan who was willing to wash someone else's wounds rather than the self-regarding steps of the priest or the immaculate steps of the Levite, the world we inhabit would be a very different place. I got a letter this week. In fact, I got a lot of letters this week over the last couple of weeks in response to this word we've been kind of sitting in for a while. It says the same thing that Thomas Cahill just said just a different way. A lot of letters have said this to me, but this one kind of brought everything together. I've got permission to read a good part of it. Listen to her words. Think back for a moment to the delicious joy of your first experiences of God's amazing love and grace. Ah, that amazing love and grace. We then became spurred on to love good deeds and righteousness, not because someone was quoting scripture verses at us, but because we want to do these things with every fiber of our being. We do them because we dearly love the shepherd who has ruled our hearts. And then she says this. After working in a Christian organization for many years ministering to Christians, I was excited to go out into the secular workplace and share the good news of the gospel, the joy of an intimate relationship with a loving God to those who did not know him. But I was dismayed by what I found. Bonds of friendship had been growing day by day with these new people I worked with. One by one, a number of these people began to share with me their experiences that they had had with Christians. They were not good experiences. Michael grew up in a solid, respected denomination. He is a kind-hearted and thoughtful individual. His parents are Christians, and he knows the Bible better than many pastors. But what he learned about Christianity as a child was that it was all about rules and judgments, very spiritual rules and judgments. He growled her, recognized the emptiness of it all, and walked away from the church and wanted nothing to do with God either, at least the God that he had seen in the church he went to. Tricia is a woman who cares deeply for her clients in a way few people dare to risk. She is frustrated, however, by the hypocrisy of Christians, disturbed at how Christians can talk so much about love and yet demonstrate so little of it. She is amazed at the capacity Christians had for gossip, No interest in joining that. Little wonder. Amber. Brilliant, highly educated, atheist. Tough as nails on the outside, but deep down she's a marshmallow. Sadness and anger spill out as she shares story after story of being told she's going to hell. She was also told the struggles she was having in her life were due to demons possessing or oppressing her. If Amber doesn't enter into a relationship with Jesus, she may go to hell. And maybe her struggles were influenced by demonic forces. I don't know. But these Christian messages told to Amber, Michael, and Tricia were motivated by radical love to them. What I am deeply grieved over regarding each of these co-workers is that no Christian ever bothered to care about their lives, to hear their stories, to celebrate their victories, or weep with their struggles. They never actually became a friend. She goes on. Not one of my peers told me a story about a Christian who had showed love, kindness, or mercy. Why? Where have we gotten so off track that our witness to others has become handing them a rule book or judging them if they don't follow it? What is happening in us that Christianity is a repulsive thing rather than something that reflects our shepherd's love and draws others to his heart? I am quite humbled, she says, that these people would risk pouring out their stories to me or that they would dare to befriend a Christian. Perhaps their hearts still will have some degree of openness to the gospel if they see it loved out, not just lived out, but loved out. John Stackhouse, in a recent article of Christianity Today, said this, our problem with evangelism is not lack of training. The problem with evangelism is that we don't love. Do we need training to talk about our grandchildren? Do we attend seminars that teach us how to talk about our favorite hobby? Our problem isn't primarily training or learning to say it right. Our problem primarily is love or lack of it. Philip Yancey, in a book I've recommended several times from this pulpit and referred to over the last couple of weeks a few times as well, entitled What's So Amazing About Grace, interestingly observes this. Now when I ask my airplane seatmates, what comes to mind when I say the word evangelical Christian? By the way, there's a little assignment for you. Next time you're on a plane, just going to do that if you're looking for a way to ruin your trip. They usually respond, Yancey says, in political terms. Interesting. You see, the gospel of Jesus was not primarily a political platform. In all the talk of voting blocks and culture wars, the message of God's amazing grace and relentless love tends to get lost. It is difficult, if not impossible, to communicate the message of amazing grace and God's furious love from the corridors of power. The church is becoming more and more politicized. And as society unravels, I hear calls that we emphasize mercy less and morality more. stigmatize homosexuals, shame unwed mothers, persecute immigrants, harass the homeless, punish lawbreakers. I get the sense, says Yancey, from some Christians, that if we simply pass enough harsh laws in Washington, we can turn our country around. One prominent spiritual leader insists the only way to have a genuine spiritual revival in this country is to have legislative reform. Could he have that backwards, wonders Yancey. I think he has it backwards, said Johnson. I love that cartoon in the Wall Street Journal that appeared some time ago. Man is calling home for his wife. She isn't there but leaves this message on the recorder. To find out what's for dinner, press 1. To apologize for something you said, did, or did not do, press 2. You just kind of do that on general principle, just wake up and say, you're sorry. To say, I love you, press three. Beloved, people are dying for someone to say, I love you. Someone to press three. People will respond to someone who presses three. People might just see the face of God if we press three. But what if they don't? See, while some of you may be hearing this stuff and just going, this is so true, we just need to love each other Some of you are hearing this and something might even be rising up you resentment-wise Going, this all sounds really nice, but it just sounds like fairy dust to me It's very naive, pie in the sky See, here's the truth, not everyone is sitting out there, Dave, waiting to be loved, ready to respond Some people, quite frankly, are hostile, publicly ridiculing our faith, not because we don't love them, but because they don't like us, primarily for what we believe. So shouldn't we, in situations like that, defend our faith? Shouldn't we do something? Yeah. I think we should do something. But what? And how? should we do something? Leonard Sweet in his book, Soul Tsunami, tells a story of a man named Andre Kodrescu, a commentator for the National Public Radio Service who did a satire on Christians' view of eschatology on a public radio special entitled All Things Considered. Now, not only did it ridicule the varieties of millennial views held by Christians, there's the post-millennial, pre-millennial, amillennial deal, but those who believed in the rapture of the church, followed by seven years of torment for those left behind, became the very special object of his scorn. As far as he was concerned, and now I quote, he said this, the evaporation of four million people who believe such nonsense would leave the world a better place. Well, that sounds kind of hostile to me. The NPR has since apologized to the Christian community, but Kedrescu has not apologized. In fact, he's more convinced than ever that he's right, says Sweet, because he got letters. Lots and lots of letters, all of them from Christians. None of them sounded like this. And then Leonard Sweet kind of gave a possible letter that you could write that might confront what he's doing, but at the same time express some sort of love. He said this is the kind of letter he postulated. Dear Dr. Kedrescu, I can certainly understand why someone not familiar with Christian theology might be confused and even bemused by the bewildering views on Christ's second coming. But if you would give me a moment, I would love to tell you what it means for me and for my family to say Maranatha and what this doctrine of hope has done for my life and for my family and for my faith and for my hope. That's not the kind of mail he got. He got hate mail, death threats from people identifying themselves as Christians, convincing him even more that the evaporation of people from the earth who believe such things would leave the world a better place. As far as I'm concerned, says Sweet, the only thing worse than Mr. Kodrescu's commentary was the reaction of Christians to Mr. Kodrescu's commentary. But then Leonard Sweet warns this. What we need to realize, church, It's that the hostility of our culture against Christians may become far more intense than the rotten eggs and tomatoes of an Andre Kodrescu commentary. More and more, post-moderns are not just throwing rotten eggs and tomatoes. They are throwing sticks and stones and other things that can break our bones. There is a rising host of Saul's breathing threats and murder on the road to Damascus. You may recall that a few weeks ago I indicated that we were no longer living in just a post-Christian era. In many ways, our culture was becoming a pre-Christian era. Sometimes, in certain quarters, we were experiencing a pretty significant anti-Christian reality, all of which raises this question. When post-modern culture spits nails at us, can we spit nails back? What does love look like then? How do we negotiate hostility? Well, all those questions and questions like them bring me back to what I said last time. We would talk about this time, and that is this, that in order to negotiate well the demands of life, we need the demands of love, we need at least four things. Number one, we need the right spirit. Number two, we need the right soil. Number three, we need the right model. And number four, we need the right depth. At length, we dealt with the first three last time, leaving the fourth for today and probably a few weeks to come. to navigate well the demands of love, it requires of us the right depth. Let me say it this way. It requires of us the right depth of understanding and the complexities of love in different contexts of life because authentic love doesn't always look or feel or sound the same. Now, at the risk of sounding like I'm contradicting what I just said in the first part of the sermon, we need to understand this, that love is not a one-size-fits-all proposition that can be uniformly expressed as a warm and gooey feeling for the whole wide world. We need to understand clearly that there are different kinds of love expressed in different ways at different times. And if we are going to be God's people in this culture, And if in this culture we are going to love well, we need to acknowledge and understand the complexities of love. So come with me now and think. Plunge with me into the mystery of what love looks like. John says in chapter 4, verse 7 of 1 John, let us love one another. But what does love look like? Instinctively, I think all of us know that there are different kinds of love. I love my wife. I love my kids. I love my friends. But I love all of them differently. I love fast cars. I love nice meals. I love long vacations. I love getting stuff for free. I love that. I love getting my own way. I love that. I love people who do what I want. I love people who agree with what I think. But what about people who don't? What about people who disagree? What does love look like then? Is it still warm and gooey? Syrupy sentimentality. Jesus, in Matthew 5, pressed this need to love past people who just don't agree with you to people who don't like you, who are hostile towards you. Matthew 5, 44. You've heard it said, love your neighbor. I say, love your enemy. Here's my question, Jesus. What does love look like? I know I'm called to love my enemy, but what does it look like? What does it feel like when I'm dealing with an enemy? What does it feel like inside of me when I'm trying to love someone who does not just oppose me? They're trying to hurt me. Is it warm and gooey? Am I failing at love if I don't feel syrupy sentimentality for an enemy? Or is there a different kind of love required for God to work in me when I'm dealing with an enemy that may be very separate from warm, gooey feelings, but still be marked as love? Here's the deal, beloved, and I just want to pull you into this. If you have a one-size-fits-all definition of love, you could really stumble here when the complexities of love press themselves upon your spirit. Indeed, if you have a one-size-fits-all definition of love, I hope to this morning confuse you a little bit. Just shake it up. I hope to disturb you just enough to maybe call you to a deeper love, a clearer understanding of what love looks like. So for the sake of deeper understanding, I'd like to confuse you just a little bit. Just kind of think with me here. You ever write a love letter? What does it look like? What does a love letter sound like? Well, it's easy. One size fits all. Everybody knows they're full of intimate secrets, romantic mush, warm and wonderful things. You can't believe you wrote and hope your buddies never see. Without a doubt, one of the most humiliating experiences of my life. I mean, it's just bizarre that I remember this so well. But I was 12, maybe 13 years old. I think early junior high, in there somewhere. I went to camp. There was a girl there, another 12-year-old. Unbelievable. She was unbelievable. I fell in love one week. End of the week, I went home. She stayed at camp. I don't remember why. She was working something. I wrote her a letter. And I'm telling you, everything in me that I ever felt that was positive came out for her in this letter. And there were things on the outside of the letter that indicated it might be worth reading in public. And they picked up the cues. I found out later that that letter I sent to this girl got read in public. It was hysterical. I changed my name. You didn't know this. My name is not really Dave Johnson. It was Elmer Fudd back then, and now I changed it because it was so humiliating. See, if you find a love letter and read it, you're not wondering what you're reading. It's a love letter. One size fits all. But what about a letter? from an adult child written to an estranged parent dealing with painful issues, never discussed, left unresolved maybe for years, those unresolved issues that now stand in the way of a real relationship. And if I write them down and say them out loud, it's going to cause pain. But it's love. That doesn't look like a love letter to me. what about a letter from a friend to a friend about directions that are dangerous and choices that are wrong and behaviors that are hurtful and if i say these things out loud to this person i really love because i think they're moving in a direction that's going to damage them terribly it's not going to make them feel good in fact they might come back at me and say i thought you were the one who preached about pressing three this letter doesn't feel like you pressed three to me. Is that a love letter? It tells a friend out of love the truth. Well, I think it's a love letter. In fact, it may be more an expression of authentic kingdom kind of love than the syrupy, sappy, 12-year-old thing I was doing at camp. But it's a different kind of love, requiring a depth of understanding into the complexities of love. See, when John, in verse 7, calls us to love, beloved, let us love one another, I mean, we say, okay, okay, we will, we just, you know, just drop. You better know that when you're getting called into that, We're being called into some things that are very complex and are going to require incredible depth and substance. There is romantic love, intoxicating and powerful. It's wonderful. Who doesn't love that? There is committed love that sticks around when the bloom is off the rose. There is intimate love that knows and is fully known. There is courageous love that opposes evil, that stands against, that stands alone if need be, that brings a judgment, and then is willing to bear the backlash of reproach for telling the truth. I'm telling you, parents, it could be that among the most loving things you will ever do with your children on those times that you intervene on their behavior. And I have been with some of you, gotten calls from many of you at times when you felt like your world was crashing down because you found that your kids were involved in something that you knew was going to be very damaging to them. And you had a choice to kind of just kind of gloss it over, to walk away, to just ignore it and let it continue or to wade into that thing and maybe even bring them into some sort of intervention, some sort of treatment for their drug issue or their anger issue or for whatever the issue. And you wade into that and rather them going, oh, thanks, Dad, I really needed the help. What you get is rage. But you loved them enough to stop them. You loved them enough to intervene. You loved them enough to even risk their rage. Sometimes that's what love looks like. See, if we have a one-size-fits-all, saccharine-sweet definition of love lacking depth, We may be seen by some people looking at us who are always saccharine sweet. Aren't we just this wonderful people? You may look like the sweetest person on earth, so nice and agreeable. But in some instances, your saccharine sweet definition of love may in fact be the enemy of love. Because sometimes real love says no. Sometimes real love says stop. I disagree. Sometimes it brings a judgment. Sometimes it imposes a consequence. Always it tells the truth. But what if the truth doesn't feel good? What if the truth doesn't feel like you're pressing three? Dan Allender, in his wonderful book, Bold Love, tells the story of John. John, whose father was a cruel and violent man, tore his son John to shreds emotionally for three decades. When John got married, his father then turned his abuse to his new daughter-in-law. As that became apparent and John's wife began to experience these things, John decided to do what he had always done with his father's rage, ignore it, and call his response to his father's rage love. In fact, berating his wife for being so sensitive and maybe not loving as much as he did. And we shouldn't say anything to dad. We shouldn't confront that at all. You need to be more loving of my dad. And just understand, that's the way he is. Well, it took years, but eventually John began to see that what he was calling long-suffering love was, in fact, cowardliness. He had tuned out his father's abusive words. He had not, and this is critical here, he had not anguished and wrestled with what it meant to protect his wife and to truly love his father. He just avoided his father. His one-size-fits-all, saccharine-sweet definition of love in this situation was, in fact, the enemy of love. Marilyn Chandler McIntyre, in the November issue, just this last November issue of Christianity Today, wrote an article debunking the idea that love always looks nice. In fact, it was entitled, Nice is Not the Point. Here's what she says. Indeed, as Christians, we might strive less for niceness and more for loving rightly. I like that. One of my husband's finest moments in parenting came one day, when after he had uttered an unwelcome word of correction to our disgruntled child, he leaned down, looked her in the eye, and said, Honey, this is what love looks like, which at the moment looked to her like a far cry from nice. You're not pressing three, Dad. In church communities, she goes on to say, as in families, too much niceness may actually mask conflict that needs to be healthily aired, carefully mediated, patiently negotiated. It's a rare congregation that knows how to tolerate deep differences, But stay in conversation about them without retreating to safer ground where everyone can be nice and just put on a happy face. But love is not always and not only nice. Love is patient. But patience is not the same as passivity, she says. Love is kind, but being kind is not the same as placating. One reason to reread Paul's epistles is to learn something about love from a man who gave up a great deal, including the cheap grace of congeniality for the sake of the gospel. Paul was not out to win friends and influence people, though he had both deep friendships and profound influence. He also had disputes with Peter. He argued and admonished erring churches and named their sins without an excess of tact. The energy of his love went far beyond mere diplomacy and took a kind of courage that's hard to develop When niceness offers so much safety, affirmation, and good feelings all around. The Apostle John, in 1 John 4, verse 7 says, Beloved, let us love one another. But before you just melt down into a little pile of goo, thinking that's just warm and sentimental, you need to ask the question, what is love? What is he calling us into here? not one size fits all it's going to take some depth this is going to take some substance this is going to take some divine formation inside of us profound deep understanding so what is love? what does it look like? Jesus picked up a child one day and said let the children come to me that looks like love I like that picture Let me just preach that text. To a woman taken in adultery, about to be stoned, he said, Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more. That looks like love, too. And it is, in fact. To Peter, after his cowardly betrayal as a friend, denying that he ever knew Jesus, he said, Peter, feed my sheep. That looks like love, too. And it is. But the same Jesus who said and did all that said and did this as well to the same disciples. Oh, you have little faith. Oh, unbelieving and perverted generation. How long will I put up with you? Boy, I'll tell you, that doesn't sound nice. It doesn't sound like he's pressing three here. But is it love? I believe that quite possibly, beloved, two of the most loving things Jesus ever did were recorded in Matthew 21 and Matthew 23. Matthew 21, you know the story. He picked up the whip, drove the religious charlatans out of the temple. Basically, what they were doing were setting up a religious system that was so confused that it was making it hard for people who were coming to the temple to meet with God, to meet with God. And so he was just kind of driving out all of the religious junk. and though his action was aggressive and looked quite furious it revealed, this action revealed the face of God to the blind and the lame a favorite verse in Matthew 21 I think it's in verse 9 it says this, that after he drove the charlatans out of the temple and made it easy to get to God it says the blind and the lame came to him and he healed them all why did the blind and the lame come towards someone who had just expressed something that looked kind of violent Here's why, because it looked like love to them Somebody was standing up for them Somebody was saying the wounded people are what we're going to be about Broken people are going to be healed And we're going to fight for that Matthew 23 He confronted and exposed the sin of the Pharisees And I think you all know that the sin of the Pharisees was their religious pretense It was a confrontation. He knew that when he made it, he would get killed for it. And the fact is this. Matthew 23 comes at a place historically where three days after that event, he was hanging on a cross. And that confrontation was the final straw for these Pharisees. It kind of gave them the last push they needed, the energy emotionally to do what they needed to do to get rid of Jesus. And Jesus made this confrontation knowing that it would probably, in a physical arena, cost him his life. It was also a confrontation that he knew was their only hope to see their sin. It was their only hope to repent. It was their only hope to come to life. No one else would confront the Pharisees because everyone else thought they looked good. Here's my question. When he confronted them, did he love them? I believe his love for them was the primary reason he confronted them. If he hadn't loved them, he would have ignored them. Well, I'll just put that in the hopper of how we deal with people. See, sometimes the reason we don't confront sin is because we don't love enough. We just let something go in our friend's life or our kid's life or something in our marriage. we just kind of turn a blind eye because we're afraid of the tension it's going to create, the experience of possible rejection. Sometimes we just don't have the energy to do the kind of work it takes to speak the truth one to another in love. So we look away. It's not that bad. It's not that big. But the problem is this. In some certain situations where we're talking about something serious, our friend or child or parent or spouse is headed for destruction. Sometimes the reason we just let that go is because we don't love enough, and we put, but we're nice. But now just flip that over and become a Pharisee. Did Pharisees confront sin? I mean, Pharisees hearing me encourage you to confront sin are going, amen. Yeah, tell them to confront sin like me. Pharisees confront sin all the time. They love to confront sin, most notably other people's sin, most viciously the sin of people they didn't like, but it had nothing to do with love. It's a great delight in laying people bare and exposing their frailties for all to see. And their motivation would often be this. If I saw a fault in you, to put a light on, that makes me feel superior to you. Pull that all together. Here's the deal. Sometimes the reason we don't confront sin is because we don't love enough. And sometimes the reason we so boldly confront sin is because we don't love enough. So which is true? Fact is this. Both are true. I'm confused. What a great way to end a sermon right there. You think I'm joking. I'm ending a sermon right there. I want to close with this by saying this. I'm aware that I am doing today a strange thing, especially the second part of the sermon. Because more than providing answers, I am raising questions. Indeed, if I have a point at all in this, it's this. to invite you to participate with me in the mystery of what love really is. And John invites us, commands us, let us love one another, to wonder and be drawn into the mystery of what that is and how it looks different in different situations and how in different situations, with different manifestations, Rightly ordered love has the power to reveal the face of God. But it isn't always warm and gooey. I'm inviting you, beloved, for the rest of the day, for the rest of the week into our study time next week together, to do what John in the story I told you from Allender's book finally was willing to do. I'm inviting you to anguish and to wrestle with what it really means to love your brother and your sister from the heart. I'd like you to stand with me as we're dismissed. Father, I pray in your name that the power of your spirit would be released among us. As I prayed at the beginning around this word, that you would open us up wide to the things you would work in us, call from us relative to what it really means to love our brother and sister from the heart. And a willingness and a courage by your spirit to walk into the complexities of that. To allow ourselves to be a bit befuddled by it. To have the courage as you call us out. To even recognize the places where we're failing badly. At love. I pray, Father, that you would form these things in us and use our community life together to call these things out and clarify and bathe it all with grace and your ferocious, furious, tender, relentless love for us. I pray all these things in Jesus' name. All God's people said, amen. Amen.
