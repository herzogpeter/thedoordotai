Are you all as sick and tired of the free publicity being given to That Donut Shop in Maple Grove? I personally have, I will not use their name anymore. And I think that we would do well to enlist endorsement rights for our announcements. What do you think? These announcements have been brought to you by, well, never mind. I'm also troubled by what I see in the bulletin, and I'm going to do something about it. I have two tickets for tomorrow night's game for the Atlanta Braves right behind home plate, and I'm going to give these to the first person that comes up with $15,000 for the softball fields. I think it's a shame that the softball fields are down there with the shed what is the shed? storage building, the maintenance and storage building they are available to the first person that can use them twins have been very gracious the last two years they've given those of us who are alumni season tickets. And I think that's a principle at work, they're a kingdom principle, you know, give and it shall be given to you. That's why the twins have been doing so good the last two years. They've decided to give it away. Well, I am anxious to be a part of this. So one of the things that's going to make it possible for me to do my new job description, which is evolving, is the fact that Peggy Lang is going to be taking over the supervision of the prayer ministries. and she's going to do a wonderful job. Those of you who know Peggy has been in leadership and she's going to be working as a lay person. Yes. She would be here with me today if she wasn't down in Wheaton at the PCM conference. So pray for Peggy. She'll do a fabulous job of supervising and leading the prayer ministries in our church and I'm grateful to her. But my job description actually began to change last fall and over this time that has taken me to get to where I am now, Something has been growing in me. It's been growing in me for a while now. It's been growing in me for a number of years as I've been doing some ministry work overseas. But as I have spoken to a number of different groups over the last couple of months, I've had the opportunity to dialogue more interactively than I can do in a group this size. But what I've discovered is that probably 60% minimum of our people, you, have not grown up in what would be called an evangelical fundamentalist church. And that means about 30 to 40% of us have. Now, I don't know whether you realize it or not, but we are what the world would consider an evangelical fundamentalist church. And I don't know what that feels like to you. You've joined or you're part of an evangelical fundamentalist church. But one of the things I have done is I have asked people interactively, What do you think of when I say that word, when I say those two words? What kinds of emotions come up? How do you respond when I say you're part of an evangelical fundamentalist church? And as I've received feedback, I've had one word that's been given back to me, positive. All the rest have been negative from us. And so I suggest, you know, let's go on a two-block trip down to Brookdale and start interviewing people on the streets and ask them what they think of when we say evangelical fundamentalist. And I think you know what they'd say. The really sad part about this is these are the very people that we say we care about. That we've been called to love. And we've been called to share our faith with. And they don't want to have anything to do with us. they see us as narrow minded bigoted intolerant arrogant indifferent irrelevant that's who they see us as these are the people we say we love that God so loves and has called us to reach. We've done a really lousy job and I think if we're honest, we have to admit it. I know that some of you are out there knocking it out of the park in terms of giving it away out on the streets, but for the most part, we as a church have done a really, really lousy job of doing what God has called us to do. I have gone to three ball games this year and I've parked each time on the south side of Metrodome and I've walked up across the corner of 3rd and Chicago and all three times, I don't know if he's there every game, but all three times there was a guy on the corner with a big white vinyl banner behind him with a bunch of flames and a scripture verse basically saying that everybody's going to hell unless they know Jesus. And he's standing there screaming at the top of his lungs. I'm sure he thinks he's preaching, but he's screaming at the people as they go by. And, you know, after you get over the first shock of having that intrusion on you, I've kind of sat back and watched the response of people as they've gone by this guy. And I have not seen one person stop. I've not seen one person give any time or attention to him. They just walk on by. Now, I haven't even stopped to listen that much myself. Because I don't like being screamed at for one thing. But the second thing, I'm going to the ball game. And maybe his theology is great. Maybe he's got it all straight and he's right down the line in terms of what the Bible teaches. But it's almost like it doesn't matter. Because nobody's paying any attention. And I think this is a great picture of the church in our culture. We have chosen, for whatever reasons, and I'll try to get into that in a minute. We've chosen to get behind our pulpits. And as the church in our neighborhoods, do we get behind our picket fences or what now is our privacy fences? And we're screaming across the fence and we're screaming across the pulpit and we're screaming out into the world, you are really bad people. You're going to hell. Come over here and be just like us. And the world is saying no thanks. We don't want to be just like you. In fact, we don't think what you are is very attractive at all. And it was never meant to be that way. So the question is, what went wrong? What's happened? How did we get here? Is there any hope? I hope so. Because you see, it didn't used to be this way. The early church, many historians believe that the reason the early church exploded the way it did is because it cared about the needs of the people around them. And it did something about it. Rodney Stark is a Princeton University sociologist. And he writes in Christian history, just this brief phrase from an article he wrote there. and dealing with the speaking specifically about the powerful proof of the early Christian church, specifically around two times in the history of the early church when the Roman Empire was experiencing a plague. They experienced a plague in 165 and 251 A.D. Now this was no ordinary plague. Plagues were pretty bad back then. In this particular case, one-third of the Roman Empire was wiped out in each plague. So one-third of the population died. Got the attention of the people. And he writes, the willingness of Christians to care for others was put on dramatic public display. Pagans tried to avoid all contact with the afflicted, often casting the still living into the gutters. Christians, on the other hand, nursed the sick, even though some died doing so. Christians also were visible and valuable during the frequent natural and social disasters afflicting the Greco-Roman world. Earthquakes, famines, floods, riots, civil wars, and invasions. Even in healthier times, the pagan emperor Julian noted that the followers of Christ, or followers of the way, supported not only their own poor, but also ours. It didn't used to be that way. Fast forward now. A couple hundred years, the last couple hundred years, and we begin to see that not only was this true of the early church, but what would be called the evangelical fundamentalists of the last couple hundred years cared about the needs of society as well and got out there and rolled up their sleeves and did something about it. Evangelical fundamentalists led the way in gaining the much needed reform in the prison systems that were horrible and abusive and torturous. They helped abolish slavery. They built and staffed orphanages. Hospitals and healthcare were born out of the desire of Christians, evangelical fundamentalists to get out there and make a difference to the suffering that people were experiencing in the world. Juvenile delinquency and aimlessness in the cities was addressed by the church in the forming of the YM and YWCAs. Homelessness and hunger were addressed in the formation of the Salvation Army and Goodwill Industries and the inner city missions that we have seen all over the country. This was the church. This was the evangelical fundamentalists. Alcoholism was addressed by evangelical fundamentalists that got tired of seeing it destroy families and came up with the 12 steps of recovery basically born out of the Beatitudes. that's what the church has done and in those days evangelical fundamentalists weren't seen as irrelevant or indifferent how did this happen? how did we get to where we are? well to think about that there's a number of very complex reasons but John Stott who is a former pastor an author basically a theologian and philosopher out of England I've had the privilege of hearing him speak He's in his latter stages of his life right now. But John Stott points out at least four reasons why the church became distant, of our age, generation became distant from dressing directly the needs of our community, our culture. The first was creeping liberalism. Liberalism was coming in and rubbing shoulders with us as we were out there doing this stuff. And we kind of got spooked by them. And we kind of pulled back. So the liberal wing of the church began to press in all the more. second thing was world war one as evangelical fundamentalists were out there doing the stuff of the kingdom world war one came along and blew everything up the war to end all wars at that time millions of people died man's inhumanity to man on display dramatically and people said you know if this is where it's going if this is all the better it's going to get with all the effort we're putting into it it ain't worth it and right alongside that was a theological teaching that came out of the Plymouth Brethren Darbyism movement in England that hadn't been popularized at all. Nobody picked up on it, but Schofield put it in notes of his Bible. And around that time of World War I, when evangelical fundamentalists who really believed the Bible were getting sick and tired of what was going on in the world, along came the rapture of the church before the tribulation theory. And people began to say, well that's it. Things are getting worse. That's the way it's supposed to be. And the worse they get, the quicker Jesus is going to come. So let's just hang on until Jesus comes. Let's get out of here. And the thing that I'm going to focus all my time and attention on is I don't want to be left behind. And the fourth thing Stott points out that perhaps is the most convicting is the gospel began to reach the middle and upper classes. As the middle and upper classes came into the church, the middle and upper classes were, for the most part, only concerned about getting their needs met. what can a church do for me and we became more and more isolated more and more like an island with no bridges to the mainland more and more like a group of people that began to just take care of ourselves and if an occasional stranger walks in great they came to us but there's something fundamentally wrong with island mentality when it's disconnected from the mainland. And that is fiction begins to grow up in the minds of people when they aren't connected with reality. And we begin to create all kinds of monsters in our head about what life is like out there on the mainland that we're disconnected from. And because they're disconnected from us, they have the same thing going on. And suspicion breeds fear. And fear is the soil in which prejudice and bigotry grow up. And all of a sudden, we begin to look at this culture in which we happen to be living in, and we don't know what they are doing out there. By the same token, they don't know what we're doing in here. And we become increasingly isolated. And that's where we're at. That's what's happened. And I wish it was different. But that's what's going on. Well, what's the solution? How are we going to change it? I mean, it's an overwhelming task. Is it even possible? well maybe what we ought to do is just crank it up and scream a little louder maybe if that guy on the corner of 3rd and Chicago would just get a bullhorn maybe that would do it maybe if he'd just be out there at night maybe if he'd just get some more strategies and techniques on how to turn conversations from secular conversations to spiritual conversations maybe we could begin to manipulate the culture into believing in Jesus maybe our strategies and techniques and events and stuff programs not all bad inherently but when disconnected from the kinds of things that really make a difference begins to look just like what it is a bunch of manipulative technique and strategy to get somebody to do what you want them to do maybe we need to stop maybe we need to go to the book a friend of mine once said the pattern's in the book I wrote it on the inside of my Bible the pattern is in the book stop and just take a look and see Jesus our master teacher how did he do it? how did he care about the world? how did he do it? what did he do? one of the things we do is we need to listen to his words and we need to look at what he did and one of the things we notice is he never built a building the other thing we notice is he went out into the streets and the cities of his world. He befriended and he loved people that the religious system and the political system said weren't okay to befriend and they weren't okay to love. And he began to connect with people on their turf, not his own turf. He didn't expect them to come to him, he went to them. and what he did is he in not avoiding these people but engaging them he listened to them he listened and he spoke to them and he touched them and he healed them and he believed in them and he made some of them his disciples and then he washed their feet and then he told them to go out and wash others feet and it would be good for us to put a bookmark in this and just begin to wonder who are those people in our culture today if jesus was here in our midst where would he go who would he talk to who would he touch to those group of people that he gathered around him he said i've got a new command i'm giving you that you love one another as i've loved you and this is the way everybody's going to know that you are who you say you are not by your techniques not by your strategies not by your words but by your love and maybe your words are consistent with love but be sure be sure and be sure they're not disconnected from love in action Jesus taught us to love unconditionally and he demonstrated he demonstrated it in action that amazed people if you look in the scripture you see how many times this says the people were amazed and they wondered and they asked questions. And that's really what God is calling us to do is to go out and to be amazing people who do amazing things. Amazing, simple, everyday, ordinary things. And you do things in such a way that people begin to wonder why you do what you do. Why do you love someone or care for someone that's not like you? Why do you do that? And then they begin to ask questions because they figure that you don't have an agenda and you're not trying to manipulate them. Well, as I think about this, I think this whole overwhelming task of the church feels overwhelming and it certainly is overwhelming if we don't utilize the resources that he's provided. And one of the things Jesus also said is, don't you dare, disciples, even though you've spent three years with me and you've listened to me over and over again, you've really messed it up a lot and don't even think you can go out without being empowered from on high, with the gift of the Father. Stay in Jerusalem until you've received power. And power for what? What is the purpose of the power? Power to be my witnesses. Power to be my witnesses. And the word witness, most of you know, who've grown up in the church, the word witness there is the word that we get martyr from. Power to be my martyrs. And I looked up martyr in the dictionary, and nothing profound, but it said something like this. one who dies or suffers for principles or sacrifices everything for a cause. That's what a martyr is. So if we lay that over what Jesus said, power to be my people who will give everything for a cause. Well, what's the cause? The cause is the thing he gave himself to. He gave everything for a cause. What is that cause? To love the world, to demonstrate love in a tangible, practical way. in my opinion that the solution to this is that we as the church become the martyrs of jesus the people who are willing to give our all to sacrifice and to suffer for the sake of those who need to know for the sake of those who jesus loved now as we build a building and i'm really excited about the building i think it's an amazing thing that god has provided it's a miraculous provision of God, and he wants us there for whatever reason, because we didn't pick the land, he picked the land, and he provided, the story hasn't been told, and may never be told completely, in terms of all the things that have happened, in terms of God orchestrating this, so we know he wants us there, but my biggest fear, our biggest fear, is that the church will be a place, that will become a fortress, will become an island, and we'll want everybody to come, To us. It's never been intended to be that way. Nothing wrong with a building. We need a building to do this. This is good. But if this is all it is folks. If this is why we. If we're excited to come to church. And we should be. Come and gather with the other saints. Then we've got it all backwards. We should be excited to get out of here. We should be excited to be out there. Doing what he called us to do. We need to come together to give us the strength. And the resources that we need to get out there. but the purpose is not to get here. The purpose is to get out there. And my fear as we go to Maple Grove is we're going to be all excited about getting to the new building. I hope we become a people that want to get out of that new building and can't wait to get out of that new building. We're grateful for the building, but it ain't about the building. I hope that's what we become. Because if we don't, then we're just going to reinforce the reality of how the world views us. And we're just going to give the world that much more ammunition. To disregard what we have to say. We're called as a people to walk the neighborhoods and the workplaces just like Jesus did. To get out where the people are. And to bring his kingdom to them. Eugene Peterson does a wonderful job of translating John 1.14. And he does it this way. He says, the word became flesh and moved into the neighborhood. Can't capture it any better than that. That's exactly what Jesus came to do. As his martyrs, as the ones who are willing to lay it down, We are called to be the good news. We're called to bring the good news as we are the good news to a world that is desperately wanting good news. And the way we're going to do that is varied and great. It'll be different for every one of you. God's going to call you in different ways than he calls me to be good news to those around us. But there are some common denominators I'd like to suggest that I think will be true of all of us if this really is going to happen. One is a passion to follow Jesus and to follow his example and allow him to be our teacher and to do it like he did it. Second is a humility born out of our dependence upon God, recognizing that we don't have within ourselves the capacity to do this. It depends on his power, his spirit. But a humility born out of that dependence that recognizes that he's called us to do it. Generosity. This is going to characterize it. Sacrificial acts of kindness. are willing to embrace suffering for the sake of Christ. We don't like to suffer. We're a culture, where our whole economy is driven by convenience and eliminating pain. That's how you make a buck in this culture. Help somebody's pain go away. We don't like suffering. But suffering and love cannot be separated. Sacrifice and love are synonymous if we understand love rightly. A vulnerability allowing us to own our own sin and our failures when we sin and fail and we will and to ask forgiveness and be honest about it. Bumper sticker says Christians aren't perfect just forgiven. Well, I don't particularly care for that. I'd like to say Christians aren't perfect but they deal with their imperfections the right way. an honest way a transparent way we don't pretend we're perfect we know we're not but we deal with our imperfections when they show up in a way that's respectful and honorable and honest and open that owns when we mess up and asks forgiveness when it's appropriate we haven't done a very good job of that either that's why they think we're arrogant a willingness to forgive others when they've done something to hurt us and then loving others who are different from us even though we don't accept their values or their lifestyle. Those are characteristics that are going to mark I think they're common denominators if we're really going to be good news. And you know what? That last one about loving others different from us even though we don't accept their values and their lifestyle. You know what? They know we don't accept their values and their lifestyle. You don't have to tell them. They already know. What's going to blow them away is if you begin to love them even though you don't accept their values and their lifestyle. That's what's remarkable. Well, what do you think of when I say we're going to just launch out, you know, Tom's got a new job description, so now we're going to help him do it. So, I hope it's much bigger than that. I hope it's more than a good idea. Do you think it's possible? Do you think it's possible to change the spiritual climate of Maple Grove? How about the Twin Cities? How about the state of Minnesota? Do you think it would be possible for the governor of Minnesota to award us and maybe other churches together with us the number one top award for volunteerism and community service? Do you think that's possible? Well, it happened in Little Rock, Arkansas. We're going to watch a video, a three-minute video, of churches that got together, over 100 of them. spearheaded by one primary church in that area and a group of pastors getting together to pray. I want you to watch the news media. This is just a compilation of things that showed up on the news media in Little Rock, Arkansas. ShareFest, which is now going into its third year, has mobilized thousands of people in our community to work together for the betterment of those in need. This weekend, more than 100 churches, the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the Marine Corps Reserves, and a lot of other organizations will attempt the largest community service project ever in Arkansas, and you can be a part of it. Yes, it's Saturday, so you're probably asking why these kids are hanging out at school. Well, the bigger picture tells the story. They're all part of ShareFest 99. This group is from the First Assembly of God in North Little Rock. They chose Pikeview Elementary as their project, and the improvement process began on Friday. I think it's the most fabulous day of my life as far as education is concerned because I've been in this 29 years and this is the first time a community, a church project has come through for us. It's so exciting. Work! Clean it up! Do whatever it can! All my freaks and science seeks a rationale. A child excuse his strange behavior. It's called ShareFest, a charity event sponsored by local churches and today's THV. There'll be events all weekend long, including a food coat and toy drive. You can bring your non-perishable foods, children's coats, and new toys to War Memorial Stadium. Shine, make them wonder what you got. Make them wish that they were not on the outside looking board. Shine, let it shine before men. Let them see good works in them. Let them glorify the Lord. Shine. Sharefest 99 concludes here tonight at the Alltel Arena with a huge service. Shine. The Sharefest rally was held at Alltel Arena tonight. Excitement loomed in the air as the final numbers were announced. This weekend, more than 4,000 volunteers helped refurbish 26 schools in central Arkansas. It's estimated 21,000 meals will be served to those in need this Thanksgiving. Shine. Make them wonder what you got. Make them wish that they were not. On the outside looking boy. Shine. Carefest may be over, but the giving is still going on tonight. Thousands of volunteers performed good deeds this weekend, including financial contributions of more than $200,000. Well, today that money was split between four local charities, each getting a check for $58,000. That's an amazing thing. Sherpas is just such a great idea. One of those ideas that you say, you know, what took you so long to do that sort of thing? Great question. What took you so long? What took you so long to do this? I was 110 some churches that got together and worked with other organizations in the middle of Little Rock area, but didn't start that way. They've been doing it for three years, but it was a number of years before that that a group of pastors got together and they were praying, and they were wondering, what's going on? Are we making a difference in our community? And they admitted that they weren't. And they recognized that this was something they needed to repent of, because that isn't what Christ called us to do. And so as pastors, they recognized they had contributed to the isolation of their churches from the community. That they didn't even know what the needs were. They didn't even know what the community needed. So in prayer they confessed that sin of self-centered focus in their ministries. And they confessed giving in to the fear of connecting with a world they didn't understand or know or basically care about. And they confessed their lack of love in not caring. And this repentance that went on among the pastors then began to infect the congregations. And the congregations were led to respond in a similar way to the leadership that they demonstrated. And slowly, over time, one heart at a time, one situation at a time, people began to live out this example of Jesus to where they finally got together and decided, let's do it. Now, I'm always apprehensive about big things. Big splashes. Last a week and then they go away. So, they've done it three years in a row. They've got a pretty good track record. they have been awarded the top community service award in the state of Arkansas by the governor. They've let their light shine in such a way, strategically, so that they could be seen as doing good works, not for ulterior motives, but just doing good works. And people get amazed, and they wonder, and they ask questions, and they begin to glorify God. I could go on. I've had the privilege of visiting that church and I've heard the stories that are coming out of there, amazing stories you wouldn't, it's hard to believe. And out of Modesto, California, and even out of here, Minneapolis, some of the things that are going on are just mind-boggling. They send chills up and down your back as you begin to realize the church can actually be mobilized to be who Christ called us to be in the world. But as I think about the big stuff, I want to stop and I want to say, you know what, it's time for us to quit looking out there at what others are doing and start listening to what God is calling us to do. and I don't know what it is. I really don't. As I stop to think about it and I consider where we are in this place in our church's history, I have to admit my own failures and my own sin. I don't feel up to this task. Admit that I'm afraid to engage the culture. There's plenty of fear in me that I have to overcome. And I've got to admit, I've got a new job description. I've never done this before so I don't even know how to do this. I don't know where to go. what to do. But at the same time, I identify the fears that are in me as I take this step. There's a growing excitement in me. There's something that's building in me that says, I think it can be done. And I think we can do it. And I begin to wonder, what stories God wants to write through us? What videos does he want to make of what ends up happening through us? But better yet, better than stories, better than videos, whose lives does he want to change for eternity, for the kingdom, through us? That's what Jesus prayed for. That the world would know that God loves them by the way we live our lives. Did you hear that? That's in Jesus' prayer in John 17. He said, pray that the Father, that they would be one, that the world would know you sent me and that you love them just like you love me. That's our challenge. to let the world know that God loves them. We have done a really lousy job overall. We struggle with trying to figure out whether God loves us. And without demeaning that struggle, I want to say, get over it. He loves you. And if you're struggling to connect with that, we've got some great resources here to hold your hand and to walk you through the kind of deep prayer and healing that can cause you to connect with the love of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. It's time to get out there and let people know God loves them by the way we live our lives. So we need to get going. We need to figure this out, And we need to get about the business that he's called us to. And the way that starts is it starts one person at a time. It starts with you and me, individually, to let our forebearing spirit be known to everyone. And what I'd like to suggest in some practical terms as to how we do this is I would suggest you don't do one single thing different than you're doing now. Just do everything you're doing now differently. What I mean by that is begin practicing the power of God's presence all the time. At the grocery store, at the bank, when you get your gas, when you go to work. Realize that he is in you. And he has given you the power to be a martyr. And a martyr is one that begins to give it all up. To listen, to learn, to wonder, to understand. that's love love isn't preaching at somebody love is listening to somebody that isn't love isn't preaching love is sacrificially doing something that meets a need they have with no strings attached and then when they figure out there's no strings attached they begin to wonder why did you do that and they begin to ask you questions now there may have been a time in our culture when it was okay to preach when people are willing to listen to our words regardless of how we lived our lives but that time is long gone folks we have a culture if we're wise to what our culture is looking for we have a culture that where the church needs to put up or shut up we need to start doing it first and preaching later and once we get that order straight maybe there will come a time again when we can preach. But we can't do it now. So begin practicing the disciplines of practicing the presence, of learning to see God in everything. And at this point, I'll just talk about a paradigm shift. You know, evangelism in the past, as I've grown up in the evangelical church, has always been taught basically from the point of view of me. I'm kind of the starting point. God has said, you know what? It's your job to save the world. So get out there and do it and figure out how to do evangelism better. But I've come to understand that that's a faulty paradigm. And I need to shift that paradigm, that mindset, to where it starts with God, not me. And God is at work in the world. He loves the world a lot more than I'll ever be able to. He's working in people's lives in complex and wonderful ways a lot more than I ever will be able to. And so when I bump into somebody in the grocery store, or I'm rubbing shoulders with somebody at work. God's already there. He's already working. He's already doing something. He's already trying to bring them to himself. It's our job not to preach at them. It's our job to wonder where's God at? What's God doing? And the only way we're going to find that out is if we listen. If we ask questions. If we listen to the Spirit. Another little paradigm shift for me that has really helped is the fact that he has placed within us the light of the world. He said, not only am I the light of the world, you're the light of the world. And he's put that in us, and that has an effect when we go somewhere. As we're practicing the presence, as we're bringing our forebearing spirit, something happens, something mysterious and wonderful happens that doesn't need words attached to it. It's an amazing thing. Someone once put it this way to me just recently, and I felt like it was a word from God for me as it relates to evangelism. They said, you know what happens? Sometimes the physical reflects the spiritual. He said, and that's true. Sometimes the physical world reflects what's going on in the spiritual world behind it. Think about that later. I don't have time to talk about that more than that. Just take my word for it. And they said, what happens when someone walks up to me and I'm staring off in the distance? And they walk up to me. They look. They look, what are you looking at? Well, what happens? What interpersonal dynamic, interspiritual dynamic happens when my spirit encounters another person's spirit? And their spirit comes up and bumps into my spirit. And physically, on a physical cognitive level, I'm not even aware of anything going on. But my spirit is fixed on Jesus. It's focused on Jesus. It's practicing the presence. And their spirit comes in contact with my spirit. I suspect it's much like what happens in the physical world. Their spirit begins to look in the direction my spirit's looking in. and my spirit's looking at the Jesus in them and the Jesus around them and the Jesus who created them and something inside them happens a warming happens something begins to happen in them that we couldn't put words around but may one day lead to them asking a question that would open them up to the reality of God's love for themselves I hope you can sense the excitement that is growing in me alongside the fear and the risky risky steps that it's going to take for us to get out of our comfort zone and risk the possibility of failing if this was just another good idea we could just dismiss it but I really sense that this is a time for us as a church it's a time for us as a church to begin moving in this direction more intentionally, more aggressively than we ever have. And the reason I say that, and the reason I'm hopeful that something actually could happen, is that I look at the history of our church, and I say, you know what, it is such a time as this, that we have been brought here and put in Maple Grove, and I don't know where it's going to go, and I don't know what's going to happen, but we spent 10 years focusing on healing. We became known as Church of the Open Soar. And then the last 10 years, we've been focusing on growing deeper, and going into him, and discovering what it means to do the disciplines, and begin to caring about transformation, and building the character of Christ in us, till Christ be formed in you became our verse on our letterhead. But two years ago, something began to stir. Alpha became real for us. Dave picked 1 John to begin to teach us through 1 John. And 1 John, if there's a little summary statement of 1 John, it's this. Don't talk about loving God who you haven't seen if you don't love your brother who you do see. That's nonsense. It's inconsistent. It's disconnected. It's not reality. And now, we're going to a new building. There's going to be new people all around us. We're going to have our own place for the first time in 16 years where we know God wants us there. So it's time, folks. It's time. It's happening. praise the lord it's going to be painful because sacrifice and suffering is painful but the reward is incredibly good and worth every ounce of pain and fear we have to overcome because it's going to be about him and it's what he did for us we're just starting so be patient. Haven't figured this whole thing out. Don't know where God's going to lead us so be patient. Pray for me, pray for us. Pray for yourself. Let's figure it out because he's given us the creative energy of the universe inside us and he's going to show us and reveal to us how to go. But one of the practical steps that you can take with me as we start this journey is Maple Grove Days is coming July 11th through the 13th and we want to be good. We want to go out there as servants and as we looked at the opportunity to be volunteering in Maple Grove Days the 11th through the 13th, we asked them, what could we do? How could we mobilize our people to help out? And we began to get a report back from them. Oh, you can do this and you can get paid for this and you can do this and get publicity. Let people know you're coming. And as they began to list the different places where we could engage, we as a task force began to pray and we thought, no, that doesn't feel right. We don't want to let our light shine in such a way that people think that we're doing it for ourselves. We want to let our light shine in such a way that they see good works, sacrificial good works, and know we're not in it for ourself. So we went back to them and we said, no, you know what, we don't want any of those. How about if you tell us what are the things that you have the hardest time recruiting people for? How about picking, what are the things that you really end up doing it yourself because you can't get anybody to do it? What are those things? And so they said, well, cleaning up after the parade on Thursday night and coming out on Saturday morning and hauling stuff out to the booths and then cleaning the grounds all day long. And we said, we'll do that. We want to go in letting our forbearing spirit be known that our heart is to serve that community, not to take from it. And so I'm hoping we'll mobilize about 400 or 500 people. And they said, well, what happens if we have more than you need? They said, well, put them to work. And so I hope we have people all over the place letting our light shine in that place. And when somebody out there in Maple Grove bumps into one of you and they say, well, who are you and where are you from? You say, I'm from Savage. That'd be cool. What do you think the next question is? That's how it works. We're not going to leave any tracts. I'm sick of tracts. They might have a place somewhere in the world, but they end up in the trash. We're the tracks. I hope you'll join me. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for the presence of your spirit that's got everything under control and you've got a timetable for everything. We sense you're moving. We sense you're stirring. And we ask that you would, we're going to trust you to be our guide to lead us through this journey that we've never taken before. And we are trusting you to do that. But Lord, first and foremost, we have to take stock of where we've been and what we've done and what we haven't done. Forgive us, Lord, for the ways in which we as leaders have contributed to the isolation of the church in this community. I thank you for the individuals who are out there doing a great job. But I ask forgiveness for the ways in which we as a church have been dragging our feet. And I pray, Lord, that you'll forgive us for the ways in which we've shrunk back from what you've called us to do and who you've called us to be. And as we ask you to forgive us, and as I ask you to forgive me, I pray, Lord, that you will help us to do the good work of repentance, to change our mind and turn around and begin to move into the very things that we're fearful of because they're unknown. and grant us the grace to exercise faith to follow you. And if we do, Lord, we know it's not going to always be painful, and we know it's going to be messy, and there's going to be that kind of stuff to deal with, but Lord, we trust that as we do this, you'll be pleased, you'll be glorified, and you will attend to our good works with signs and wonders that will amaze us and amaze the world. that you love so much. In Jesus' name, amen. Thank you for your patience. You are dismissed. God bless. Thank you.
