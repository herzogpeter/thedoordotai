Father, in light of the word that I'm about to bring, I'm mindful of Peter's words when he said that you have called us out of darkness into your marvelous light. And my request is this, that through this word this morning, the light of your reality and your truth would indeed to us look marvelous, and indeed that it would be to us irresistible, and that people who may be in hiding in some way would come out of hiding and begin to to walk in light, maybe for the first time, maybe to begin to walk in light again. I pray that in your name. Amen. I'd like you to open your Bibles to the first epistle of John, beginning this morning in the fifth verse for our second week of study in this section, extending from chapter 1, verse 5, to chapter 2, verse 2. Last week, I presented this section to you, this word, as being, in essence, an invitation into the light, an invitation to live in the light of what is real and true about life in general, but also what's real and true about my life, your life in particular. In verse 5, John begins to set the stage for this invitation with these words. And this is the message that we have heard from him and announced to you, that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. There is no illusion in him, no trickery, pretense, no shadow, no shifting shadow. And if we say that we have fellowship with him, that word fellowship, important to keep this in mind, is partnership, participation with. If we say we are partnering with God in the living of our lives and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus, his son, cleanses us from all sin. Last week, we came to understand that to be walking in the light is to be allowing the light of God's truth to do what light does, and that is to reveal, to expose things about us. It is to be resisting the instinct that every single one of us in this room have. It's an instinct we got from the garden when Adam and Eve sinned and wanted to do this. The instinct is to cover and to hide our real selves and to cover and hide our real sin from God, from each other, and from ultimately ourselves. walking in the light we discovered last week is to be walking open-faced with god the good the bad the ugly all of it just out there exposed where god can see it where he can then heal and forgive it and pour his grace upon it walking in the light is to be authentic it's to be transparent it's to be living our lives in the spirit of the psalmist who said search me oh god and know my heart try me and know if there be any wicked way in me. It's continually living with an invitation to God, as it were. I invite, Lord, the light of your truth to reveal to me what's real about me. Walking in the light in a word is open. Walking in the darkness is exactly the opposite. It's closed. It is living in such a way that we cover and conceal, and that has become our way of life. In the dark, we hide what is real. and true about ourselves and about our sin. We learn to live in the shadows, to create shifting shadows with insincere smiles, with half-truths, with blatant lies, with inflated stories. And as I indicated last week, maybe the best way to create shifting shadows in a religious context is to use religious God talk, to constantly shift the shadow and take attention away from what's really going on inside of us. bottom line in the darkness is that we hide. In fact, we use the darkness for that purpose to hide. The darkness, therefore, referred to in this text we discovered last week, is not just a reference to sin alone, but to living in denial about our sin as well. The darkness is the hiding of the sin. It is the concealing, blaming, even redefining so that we, in fact, lose touch with the fact that there might even be some sin that needs to be dealt with. We're in the dark. With that understanding of darkness and light, the text reads this way, back to verse 6, if we say that we have fellowship with Him, if we say indeed we're partnering with the Father, and yet our whole manner of life is to cover and conceal and to hide, we lie. What are we lying about? We're lying about the fact that we're actually partnering with God and living our life. We couldn't possibly be partnering with God and living our life if we're covering because God is light, and what light does is reveal. And if what we're doing is covering, we are working at cross purposes to who God is and what He does. Verse 8, if we say we have no sin, if we're deluded about our sin and deny that we have sin, we are deceiving ourselves. To be deceived is a very dangerous place to be. In her book, My Father's House, Sylvia Frazier tells of tributes that were being paid to her father at his funeral. These are the things she heard. He was a man of proper and regular habits, a Christian man who didn't smoke and didn't drink, who helped with the grocery shopping, who never took the Lord's name in vain, a polite and neighborly man. He kept his snow shoveled, his leaves raked, and his bills paid. But what Sylvia knew about her father was this, that he had sexually molested her since she was four years old, threatening her with the loss of her toys, then the killing of her cat, and then with sending her away to an orphanage, if she ever brought into light what was hidden in the dark. If we say we have fellowship, he's a Christian man. Rick didn't smoke, didn't drink. Is he a Christian? I don't know if he's a Christian man. That's not my call. But I can say this for sure. If he says he's partnering with God and living his life, and his whole posture of life is to hide what needs to be revealed, what God calls sin, then he is a liar. He's not partnering with God because God is light, and what God does is reveal. And if he was partnering with God, all of that would come out so people could be healed, himself included. To be deceived about things is a dangerous place to be. Cornelius Plantinga, in his book, Not the Way It's Supposed to Be, says this about being deceived, and I quote, self-deception about our sin is a narcotic, a tranquilizing and disorienting suppression of our spiritual central nervous system. What's devastating about it is that when we lack an ear for wrong notes in our lives, we cannot play right ones or even recognize them in the performances of other people. Eventually, we make ourselves so spiritually unmusical that we miss both the exposition and the recapitulation of the main themes that God is playing in human life. The only way out of deception, according to the text, is this. If we confess, if we agree with God about what He's shining a light on, that can break the deception, and that can bring us out of the darkness and the hiddenness we're in. If we confess our sin, He is faithful and just to forgive our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Chapter 2, verse 1, My little children, I am writing these things that you may not sin. And if anyone does, we have an advocate. We have a friend with the Father, even Jesus Christ, the righteous. What I want to do this morning and also next Sunday morning is to continue to extend this invitation to you to come out of hiding and to live in the light of what is real and what is true about life and about your life. And I want to do it by painting a picture for you of what walking in the light is really like, of what its benefits really are. In fact, I would be so bold as to say this, and I don't talk this way very often, so it's kind of a strange place for me to be. I'm going to promise you something. I promise you that if you have the courage and faith to come out of hiding, to begin to live in the light of what God says is real and true about life and about you, that you will begin to experience levels of kingdom life and joy and peace, that you may have never known before. And this word, that promise applies to some of you who don't know Jesus as your Savior. You've never entered into a relationship with Him at all. But that promise I just gave applies to people who would name Jesus as their Savior, but in areas of their life they remain hidden, even to themselves. I promise you that there are specific, significant, noticeable things that will happen to you if you begin to come out of hiding and walk in the light of what is real about God, life, and you. I thought of six things, actually, that I think I can promise you that will happen to you. If you begin to come out of hiding and walk in the light, the first is this. If you do this, you will find freedom. You will feel clean. You will experience grace, and you will know forgiveness. Now, I mentioned four things. Those four things are just one point, so don't get too excited. We didn't make a lot of progress there. the operative words and what I just gave to you are these find, feel, experience and know it's very important because what I'm promising you and calling you to is past and intellectual understanding and a theological grasp of freedom cleansing, grace and forgiveness I am talking about you being able to find freedom to feel clean to experience grace and to know forgiveness. And the reason this is important to do is there is a problem. It's a problem in people who don't know Christ, but it's also a problem among large numbers of Christians. People have accepted Jesus as their personal Savior. They believe He died on the cross for their sins. They believe that He rose from the dead to make it all a real thing. In fact, they would get in great debate with anyone who didn't believe that and feel very strong that they are wrong and the other person is wrong and then they are right. These are people I'm speaking to who've heard hundreds of messages of God's amazing grace and that they are loved for free, accepted and forgiven for free by His grace. But for some reason, even though they believe that and know that and even can say it, they don't feel those things. It doesn't get inside. They can't taste it, don't experience it, don't seem to be able to touch it. Now, there can actually be quite a number of reasons that people, even Christians, have a hard time feeling amazing grace and experiencing this kind of freedom other than the one I'm going to point out and the one that John is going to deal with. In fact, I got a letter this week from a very good friend here I have at Open Door. She's been here in our church for many, many years. That makes one of the reasons that people sometimes have a hard time experiencing grace and feeling forgiven clear. She writes this, and this was in response to my sermon, and she compared it to an experience she had with light and her ability to see it physically. Last January, she says, when the LASIK vision correction procedure was attempted on my right eye, the machine malfunctioned, incorrectly and severely cutting my cornea. The accident left the surface of my eye flat and rough. Makes all of you want to go out and get this surgery. Anybody's here, you know, we're going to sign up tomorrow. You're going to cancel it right now. Anyway, as a result, when light would enter my eye, it would be deflected by the rough surface and bounce away in every direction, distorting my view. Because my eye was not round and smooth, the light could not penetrate the cornea. It could not find its natural point of focus. My vision became extremely blurred, and it was painful to look at the light. The light was no longer her friend. She just liked the light. Now she gets away from the light. As I reflected on your sermon last week, the thought occurred to me that sometimes we are willing to see the things God's light reveals to us, but our souls have been too damaged to see it correctly. I think that's absolutely true. And that needs to be said that one of the reasons we sometimes don't see the light, don't experience grace, don't feel forgiven, is because our vision is distorted by deep wounds. And what we need is healing, profound and deep healing. And that kind of thing is available and real. And many of you have experienced it. Many of you have yet to experience it, but it is real. But there are other reasons, beloved, why even people who name Christ don't find freedom and feel clean in their everyday life. And one of them is this, because we choose not to see what the light of God's truth reveals. Sometimes the reason we don't find freedom and don't feel clean is because we choose to hide, cover, conceal, deny, blame other people, even redefine what sin is. And here's the bottom line relative to this text. Until we are willing to pull what's hidden in the dark into the light, including, actually, even our wounds that are horrible, and so horrible we can't even speak of them until those things are brought into the light, you're not going to feel clean. Experience grace or taste forgiveness. Jesus said it this way when he said in Matthew 5, verse 4, Blessed are those who mourn. Before I explain what mourning means, I want to set the context for you because it's very important as it relates to 1 John 1. Just before he said these words, Jesus had introduced the beginning of his ministry, and he introduced it with a proclamation. This was the proclamation. The kingdom of heaven is within your reach. The experience of God's kingdom on earth by me bringing it is something that you can taste and touch and feel and experience, which is the message of 1 John. The things I've heard, seen, tasted, heard, handled with my hand, proclaim I now to you so that you can handle these things as well. All of it started when Jesus said, I'm bringing the kingdom and an experience of God that you can experience, taste, touch, know, feel. And then he went on to demonstrate that the kingdom that he was talking about was not just one of words, but of power. He healed all sorts of sick people. Multitudes came. He then withdrew and sat down on the hillside with his disciples, began to teach them, saying, and this is my paraphrase at this point, I've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is that kingdom life that I just put on display that you can experience is real, and you can feel this. The bad news is this. None of that kingdom life is going to come to who you think, and it's not going to flow through who you think. Let me give you an example of the kind of person who's going to be happy in the kingdom. Mourning people. Blessed are those who mourn. And all God's people said, huh? Sounds like happy are the sad. Blessed are the bummed. This does not compute at all. Until you do a little study and study the Greek word and begin to realize that in the Greek there are nine Greek words for the concept of mourning or being sad or being grieved, and this specific word chosen by the Spirit of God to come out of Jesus' mouth to describe the kind of mourning that yields a real kind of health is the Greek word penthos, and what it means is to externally express the reality of an internal sadness, which means this. Just to get the picture here. It is possible to be sad on the inside. It is possible to be hurt, discouraged, in deep sin, but on the outside, look great. You're not doing penthouse. You're not doing mourning. Mourning is when you have all that stuff going on on the inside, but it starts to come to the outside. In other words, blessed are those who get out here into the light. What's going on in here in the dark. Blessed are those who quit pretending about their pain, who quit pretending about their fear, their anger, their hurt, and their sin. They are the ones who get the comfort. They're the ones who get the freedom. They're the ones who get the cleansing and the grace. They're the ones who will feel forgiven. Now, I'm going to just leave that thought there for a moment and pick another one up. There's kind of a controversy, and many of you may not be aware of it, so this really is, I'm kind of wading into something that doesn't matter to you. But for those of you who are aware of it, this does matter. And the controversy theologically is a little bit around the ninth verse, 1 John 1, 9, if we confess our sin is faithful and just to forgive. There is what is known as redemptive forgiveness, what some people call positional forgiveness. That is that on the cross, Jesus paid for and forgave all my sin, past, present, and future. That is true. Redemptively, my sin, your sin, if we've accepted Christ as our Savior, has been forgiven past, present, and future, I am forgiven. Well, that positional truth, that redemptive truth, creates some confusion when you come to a place like 1 John 1.9. It says, if we confess, He will forgive. Well, I thought He already forgave past, present, and future. So if He forgave, Why should I? I mean, I thought I was already forgiven. In fact, I had a guy come up to me last Saturday night, not yesterday, but a week ago Saturday, and asked this question and wondered. He even thought that it was wrong for him to ask God to forgive him because he was doubting that he'd already been forgiven. You know, that was the kind of dilemma he found himself. And I thought it was a great question. What you need to understand is that we have been forgiven. If we're in Christ, redemptively, positionally, you are in grace, you are forgiven. God's posture towards you is yes. 1 John 2.12 says, your sins are forgiven already for his namesake. You are his child. But you need to understand this. Also, John is not in 1 John 1.9 making reference to redemptive or positional forgiveness. He is talking here about relational forgiveness. He is talking about how you and I in our living can experience, how we can taste, touch, see, and know these things. Here's how you can continually tap into and experience the forgiveness and grace that is already there. Bring it out into the light. That's how you can experience it. Bring out into the light what you're hiding in the dark. Confess it. Agree with God about it. Quit minimizing and denying it. And when we do that, guess what? You feel clean. You find freedom. You experience grace. You know forgiveness. And now your testimony, as you begin to move into those kingdom ways of living, your testimony begins to sound a little bit more like John. You start saying things like this, the things that I have seen and heard and experienced, handled with my hands, declare I unto you. Not just the theological truth I have memorize and can explain to you, do I declare unto you, I have experienced this forgiveness. And I experienced it when I brought out into the light the things that I was committed for so long to keep in the dark. Listen to David's testimony around this in Psalm 32. He had done some awful things that we might even consider unforgivable. They weren't. They were awful. Entered into an adulterous relationship with a woman that was not his wife, deciding even after the adultery that he wanted her for himself forever. He managed, because he was king, he could do this for the certain death of her husband by putting him in a position of battle where he would surely die. And then he began to live in this kind of denial about anything being wrong. And he went on being king and being very benevolent to people and kind of making sure everybody still liked him. But this over here was hidden and denied. And then one day through the prophet Nathan, he got nailed to the wall and he saw his sin in a way that he could no longer deny it. The light came on real hard. He could have continued to weasel and shift around some way, but he didn't and he came out of hiding. And in Psalm 32, we hear his words as he begins to come out of hiding. Here's his testimony. When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away through my groaning all day long. Day and night your hand was heavy upon me, and my vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer. Boy, I wouldn't have known it. You know, when I was looking at David, he looked like he was having fun. But this was the testimony of his life. I was dying on the inside. but when I acknowledged my sin, my paraphrase of that for our study would be, but when I brought into the light what I was trying to hide in the dark, and my iniquity I did not hide, when I finally said, I agree with you, God, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, then he did forgive me of the guilt of my sin. Forgiveness was always there. What I got was the freedom from the guilt of it, and in that coming out into the light, what he had hidden in the dark. David found freedom, felt clean, tasted grace, experienced forgiveness. I'm not talking about positional forgiveness. I'm talking about relational forgiveness, the kind you can feel. See, that's the kind I need. Let me explain it this way. If one of my kids chooses to do something that they know is wrong, Now, I know this is a real stretch for you to believe that my kids would ever do anything like that. So just go nuts with your imagination here for a second. And when they do what they know to be wrong, their normal instinct is to hide. And they give to that instinct. What they do is they hide and they deny it. When they do that hiding, they are no less my child. They are no less my son. They are no less my daughter. They are no less objects of my love. Nothing has altered in the universe of how I, they are still in my family, but at the level of their hiding, they have separated themselves from me. Doesn't mean they're not in the family, but they've separated. Now, it might be a little tiny thing, and by the way, I'm talking about kids here, but you do this. This happens in marriages, and you just hide. You have this thing, and you just section it off. You put it over here, and all of a sudden, there's a real nice way to even kind of mask that there's this little thing hidden in the little fire. You just start being really nice, too. That's, okay, I don't know anything about that. Somebody told me that that's a way to do it. And all of a sudden, the kids start acting, oh, hi, Father. How are you today? I'm happy that, yes, yes. What are you doing? What are you hiding? They begin to hide. And they separate. A relationship changes, whether it be with my child or with my spouse. The relationship changes around the hidden thing. And the person you're hiding it from may not even know, but they will feel it. Parents have radar. It's just bizarre. I have it. My wife has it even better than me. And I'm looking, and they're shifting. And when they shift, I push. And when they push, when I push, they deny. And when they deny, I press. And when I press, they run. And when they run, I can't even get them anymore. I can't even grab them anymore. There are people who are separated from their kids and parents think it's all their fault. You know what? Your kids might have started to hide. I'm sure we've all made mistakes. I'm not trying to say it's never, whatever. But they tried to hide and they wouldn't come into the light. There are marriages that are split right down the middle with some little thing that you decided to hide. It happens with parents and kids. It happens with parents. Some of you parents have sinned against your children, and you can deny it and you can hide it, but you have wounded their soul, and until you bring it into the lights, this thing that's happened in the dark, you will never feel clean, and you'll never know intimacy with your kids. Let's face this, though, just head on. Coming into the lights when we've been hiding it in the dark is a terrifying thing to do. And quite frankly, I just would acknowledge The longer you have lived in the dark with this hidden way of living, the more terrifying it is to come into the light. But with that acknowledged, I want to appeal to you with another truth. However frightening it is to you to come into the light when you've been hiding something in the dark, it is much, much more difficult and damaging to you and the people around you to try to live in the dark and to try to stay there. if that's your way and you are just kind of stubborn in your decision even today i'm gonna stay in the dark there's no way i'm coming into the light i'm gonna keep hiding and concealing if that is your way i just need to tell you you are choosing a very difficult life and you are also choosing a very lonely life because you will know intimacy with no one it is impossible to really know in an intimate level anybody who is hiding. You have chosen a hard life. You have chosen a lonely life. In his book, again, not the way it's supposed to be by Cornelius Plantinga, he writes this. In late 1992, 16 women charged a U.S. senator with flagrant sexual harassment. The senator's response to this charge was typical and revealing. He first denied the charges. He then attacked the credibility of his accusers. But when that didn't work, he then issued this extraordinary apology. Get this. Faced with irrefutable charges that he had for years been groping and kissing his staff members, sometimes standing on their feet while he was attempting to remove their clothing, the senator declared that he had never intended to make anyone uncomfortable. That's good. Still, he told the media that he would seek professional help to see if his alleged behavior was related to his use of alcohol. Then Plantinga writes this. This is an apology of major, almost metaphysical elusiveness. According to the senator, nothing happened, but in any case, he meant nothing by it, and regardless, he might have been drunk at the time, so he missed the significance of the non-event in question. Huh? To a sober observer, all of this is a little hard to follow. The senator's apology brings to mind the time Winston Churchill sent a pudding back to the kitchen complaining that it lacked a theme. I like that. I remember when that story happened in 1992. I remember the name of that senator. I'm not going to mention it. It doesn't matter. I lost track of that story. He might have kept his Senate seat. I don't know. He might have, with all of his kind of maneuvering and shifting shadow behavior, he might have avoided some lawsuits. I don't know. I mean, for all I know, he might even be sitting in church this very Sunday, might even sit in the front row. I don't know. Here's what I know. I know that until that man brings into the light what he is hiding in the dark, he will never find freedom, feel clean, experience grace, no forgiveness, and that is a hard way to live. That is a lonely way to live. Which leads me to the second thing that I can promise you, if you begin to come out of hiding and live in the light of what is real. The second promise is this. You're going to find some new friends. You're going to find some new friends. You're going to discover, especially if this happens, well, actually only if this happens in an authentic kingdom context, you're going to discover that you're not alone. You begin to come out of darkness and begin to come into the reality of what's true, and you will break out of your self-imposed exile and isolation from authentic and intimate relationship, and you will experience, here's the buzzword around here lately, and I love this word, community. You will experience community maybe for the first time in your life. It says that very thing, by the way, in verse 7. You maybe never framed it this way. It says this, If we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we will have fellowship with one another. If we, there's a key word, we. So this isn't just you and me doing our faithful thing with God coming out of hiding. Although it doesn't, this is a we thing. This is a corporate, if we walk in the light as he is in the light, if we are doing it, I'm not the only one, you're doing it too, and you and you and you, if that's happening, here's the promise. We will have fellowship with one another. it's not just me it's we here's the deal you got to get the dream here this is god's dream god's dream and design for his kingdom community is simply this i'm not the only one and neither are you we are the ones trying to come out of hiding i'm not the only one just trying to learn how to bring what's in the dark into the light and neither are you you're doing it i'm doing it so are several others, all of us is the dream. And if it's true that you're not the only one trying to come out of hiding and live in the light, but your wife is too, and your husband is too, and your kids are too, you're going to experience the kingdom. I promise you. And if you're not the only one, you know what you're going to discover? You're going to discover that you're not alone. And all of a sudden, this is going to feel safe. And confidence will begin to grow to come out even more into the light. And all of a sudden, before you know it, we didn't even know the theology about this, but we're walking in the light. And we're finding freedom. And we're feeling clean. And I'm not pretending about anything anymore. And I'm experiencing community. I'm feeling connected. And it's not just because I joined a small group. It's because of what's happening in the group. See? Let me ask you a question. What I'm trying to describe here, have you ever experienced it? some of you have some of you maybe haven't I'm going to assume that you maybe all have at some level maybe in a small group a Bible study some support group or recovery group and if you experience it might happen something like this you know you're in a Bible study and it's good and you're with people you like and you have some things in common and so it's feeling kind of safe but one day instead of just saying the right thing this guy or this girl across the way this time says the real thing. They come out with something that they had been struggling with that nobody knew about, and they were afraid to talk about, and as soon as they do it, you can't believe they did it. And when they say this thing, you feel a little uncomfortable. I can't believe this. I don't know why they said that. But after you get past that initial discomfort, it gives you hope that maybe if they did it, maybe I can too. And in the group, as one person comes out and another person comes out and another person comes out and they start to share not just what's right, but what's real, they start sharing what's real. You know what the people in the group start feeling? Freedom. Clean. You know what they start experiencing? Grace. Community. Walking, here's the deal, walking in darkness cuts us off from the experience of God, relationships with people, and ultimately, as I said last week, it cuts us off from ourselves. Walking in the light is the only chance we have of breaking through our isolation to have authentic relationship with each other and a joyful reality of God's presence in our lives. Dietrich Bonhoeffer said this, He who is alone with his sin is utterly alone. It may be that Christians, notwithstanding corporate worship, common prayer, and common service, are in many respects still left in their aloneness. The final breakthrough to authentic fellowship never comes, because although they do have fellowship as believers and as devout people, they do not have fellowship as sinners. The pious fellowship permits no one to be a sinner. So everyone who is a sinner or is struggling with something like that must conceal their sin from themselves and from the fellowship. And so we must decide, says Bonhoeffer, are we going to be a fellowship of pretenders living in darkness and denial, horrified when a real sinner is discovered among us, or will we walk as children of light, who with humility and authenticity as the normal course of life bring into the light what is hidden in the dark so that God can heal it and grace it, forgive it and transform it. we talk about community so important community is right at the core of what kingdom life is about in our search for community we look for things we have in common that's normal there's nothing wrong with that we maybe we live in the same neighborhood so that's the basis of our community or our kids are the same age we have something in common there our socioeconomic status is the same and so we're where there are interests around sports or art or music that's that's just a very normal. No rebuke in finding community around that. But would you try this one on for a basis of community? I'm talking kingdom life here. How about this? We're all a bunch of sinners whose every instinct from the beginning of our life was to hide, conceal, and deny. Acknowledging all that, however, we really want to learn how to bring into the light what's hidden in the dark. Let's say that's true about you, about us. Let me make you a promise. If what I just said is true about you and it's true about us, the promise is this. Verse 7, if we begin to walk in the light, we will have fellowship with one another. If I do it by myself, it's not going to happen. If you do it by yourself, it's not going to happen. But if we, if we begin to get authentic and come out here with what's going on in here, we will have community, intimacy. You will taste the kingdom. You will feel it. You will experience it. It will be more than a theology that you know. You will be living the kingdom life. But who's going to go first? you know that's the big question are you going to go first you know what in all seriousness I think leadership needs to go first Paul did 1 Timothy 1 15 he says this and I love him for this listen to these words from the apostle Paul it is a trustworthy statement deserving of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners among whom I am chief Paul said. I'm not above you in this, says Paul. I'm in no less need of this than you, says Paul. Me too. Isaiah the prophet in Isaiah chapter 6 verse 5 said a most amazing thing, especially for a prophet. He said, I'm a man of unclean lips. Can you imagine that? I mean, we read the verse, so yeah, we can imagine it. But what had happened, he saw the glory of the Lord. and the glory is pretty bright, and it shined a light on something in his life, and he saw his lips as being not near as clean as he thought they were, and he was already a prophet. And he stood in front of these people. I mean, picture me, a pastor or somebody else, some prophet-type priest or guy. And the first thing I said, I have an announcement to make. I have a man of unclean lips. Why on earth would you listen to me? I mean, it's like, that's a disqualifying statement, isn't it? Maybe. Let me ask you a question. Did that disqualify him from being a prophet? No, the fact is that made him a prophet. That gave him his credibility. Because when God, here's the deal, when God shined the light of his truth on what was true about Isaiah, Isaiah said, I see that. I will not deny that. I'm not going to try to cover that. I'm going to confess it. And you know what I'm going to do, God? I'm going to cooperate with you. When you say it, I'm going to call it what it is. And it is unclean. And I will confess that. And I'm going to partner with God in that. And guess what God did? God transformed his lips. You know what? I don't think there was anybody in Isaiah's life prior to that vision and that confession of his unclean lips. I don't think there was anybody in his life that would have said, yeah, you know the word on Isaiah? It tells a lot of lies. No, he was a prophet. He was a well-respected prophet, but God shined a light on a deeper level of what he wanted from this man. And when God asked for more, Isaiah said, okay. That's called participating, having fellowship, not just getting along, partnering with God. You say, do it, I'm going to do it. I wonder if Isaiah was embarrassed when he stood in front of other people and said, I don't know if I can keep being a prophet. I got unclean lips. That's what made him. Sad reality for many of us, however, is this, that the last place on earth that we would bring into the light what's hidden in the dark, for many of us, sadly, is church. See, far more likely that we'd do that kind of a thing in a place like maybe Alcoholics Anonymous or something like that. Alcoholics Anonymous, I want you to think about that for a second. It's an organization started many years ago, maybe you don't know, maybe you do, by a devoutly Christian man, and the reason he started it was because of the awful failure of the church to go beyond moralizing when it came to the alcoholic problem. He wanted to offer helpful help in some way that would bring real transformation. Lots of Christians take shots at that organization, and I am very sure that in some ways that Alcoholics Anonymous has drifted from its founder's original centrality on God. But you know what I want you to do this morning? As I just pull this, I'm going to use this as a way to pull this to a conclusion. I want you to wonder with me. what would happen to the church of Jesus Christ worldwide if we would admit that we were powerless over sin and our lives had become unmanageable? These are just the 12 steps, and I'm going to rewrite them a little bit. I want you to wonder with me what would happen to the church of Jesus Christ worldwide if we would come to believe that confidence in a power greater than ourselves, namely God through His Son Jesus Christ, could restore us to sanity. What would happen if we made a decision to turn our will, really, not just to say this with religious God talk, but to really turn our will and our lives over to his care, made a searching and fearless moral inventory of our lives as they really are. Meaning, if we would come out of hiding and let it be in the light, what would happen if we admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs? We're entirely ready to have God remove all those defects of character. were willing to humbly ask Him to do just that, what would happen if we even went this far to make a list of people we have harmed and be willing to make amends and then continue to take personal inventory, continual to take personal inventory, meaning I'm going to live this way, I want to walk every day in the light, and when we're wrong to promptly admit it, what would happen if we sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious awareness of of and partnership with God, praying constantly for an awareness of His will and the power to carry it out. What would happen if we did that? Well, first of all, you need to understand that if we did that, we would be doing 1 John chapter 1. And I'm going to make a promise to you. If we do 1 John chapter 1, I promise you that we will begin to find freedom. And we will begin to feel clean, experience grace, know forgiveness, experience real community. We're going to make some new friends. How do you know? Here's how I know. Because if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we will have fellowship with one another. I promise. One more promise. And I'm closing with this. I will unpack it next week. I just want to speak it and give it to you. If you begin to pull out into the light what you're hiding in the dark, I just want you to know that as you do that, God will be gentle. God will be gentle. As I said, I'm not going to unpack it, but you need to know that. And here's why you need to know that. If you've been living in the dark for a very long time, and your manner of life is to hide, coming out into the light, especially on the front end, is the most terrifying thing that you can think of. God is light, Satan is dark. Satan does his best work in the dark. If you've been living in the dark, even if you're a Christian and you have this place of your life that's walled off and it's just in the dark and hidden and concealed, I just know that I know that the one who is about the darkness is going to do everything he can, even in this room as you sit here right now, to throw flares and throw up fog and to terrify you to not come out of hiding. And I just want you to know that as you come out of hiding, even if it's just a little thing today, if you come out of hiding and you say, God, I want to walk in the light, I want to live this way, God will be gentle. There will be amazing grace for you. You can begin to feel free. And you can begin to find grace, experience forgiveness. And feel clean. not just know about this positional theology. This is about a relationship where we're looking eye to eye with God, nothing hidden anymore. Next week, I'm going to give you some more promises that will compel you to respond to this invitation, but some of you need to respond to this invitation today. Would you just bow your heads and close your eyes just quickly? I'm not going to make a big thing here. I just want you to be alone with God for a few moments. Father, as your light shines in your people in this room, I'm just positive that you are shining on some real specific things for some people. And some of the light that you're shining has to do with coming into relationship with you for the very first time. Some of it has to do with behaviors or patterns that we've walled off and hidden away. and I just pray that your, yes, that your marvelous light that I prayed about at the beginning, that Peter says we've been called out of darkness and that your marvelous light somehow by your spirit right now would look marvelous. That it would look like what it is so much better and a more free way to live than in the darkness and that, Father, those who are afraid in the dark would buy the marvelous light that they see. have the courage to come out. Lord, as we close, I'm just going to trust you to unpack this in all of our lives and where this needs to go. I pray that you will seal it and bear fruit from it. Help us find people to talk to so we can walk this thing out. Give courage where that's necessary. Bind fear where that's necessary. Do your work. Bring us into your kingdom in every aspect of it in Jesus' name. Amen.
