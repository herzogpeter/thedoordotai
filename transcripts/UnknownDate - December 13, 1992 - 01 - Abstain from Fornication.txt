Open your Bibles with me to the book of the Acts of the Apostles, the 15th chapter, the 20th verse. Acts chapter 15, verse 20. Two weeks ago, having dealt extensively with the verdict of the council at Jerusalem, and having seen the response of the brethren to that verdict, a verdict which included a word to abstain from four things. I told you in my closing remarks that I felt a very strong desire at that time, indeed a need to, spend more time and examine more closely one of those things from which James was calling this church in Antioch, Syria to abstain from. Abstain from fornication. And though that phrase is not the preoccupation of the text we've been dealing with, it is certainly part of it, but it will be our preoccupation for the next several weeks. Now, I need to clarify one thing about what we're doing the next several weeks. We are in the middle of and recognize the fact that Christmas is coming, And abstain from fornication is not the best Christmas sermon, you know. So we're going to cut some slack here. Next week, we're going to be really focusing on the coming of the king in a festive, family, wonderful way. And then we'll get back to this boring stuff, hard stuff. I just want you to know that we'll break. Abstain from fornication. The Greek word there is pornea. I want you to know that throughout the series, however long it takes, I will be using that word interchangeably with fornication. The word defined not even in the Greek, simply in Webster's Dictionary to start this week with a basic understanding is simply this. Voluntary sexual relations between a man and a woman outside the context of marriage. Now that would clearly include extramarital sex. That would obviously include premarital sex. But it would also embody more than that. It is broader than that is pornea. But that definition I gave you on this Sunday is a good start. Verse 20 says abstain from that. Verse 29 repeats it saying abstain from among other things that pornea. And at the end of verse 29 it says this. For if you keep yourselves from such things, you will do well. You will do well. Let's pray as we begin. Father, once again, I come to you at this time and ask that you would do what no human can do, that your spirit would come and move among us. I pray first of all for physical energy for myself and a mental capacity to remain clear in my thinking to deliver this again. But far beyond that, even if my words become muddled some way, I pray the work of your spirit would be powerfully evident among us. To save us from the devourer. And bring to us wholeness and health and healing in this arena where the enemy has done grievous damage. Even to your precious people. I pray you just release. Release your spirit. To do your work. Accompanying your word. In Jesus name. Amen. Today, I'm going to do something that I rarely do. That is, without specifically working a text, I want to share with you my heart related to this issue of pornea. But most specifically, what I want to share with you today is why it is that I feel so strongly about stopping long enough to spend significant time on this particular issue. And the reason, at least in part, that I have this energy and feel such a prompting to do it has to do with the set of assumptions that I have made for several years that I do not believe I can afford to make any more. In fact, I do not believe these assumptions that I'm going to share with you are assumptions that we can afford to make any more. There are three. The first assumption that I believe I cannot make and I believe we cannot afford to make anymore is this. That among us there is an automatic understood consensus about what sin is. That there is among us an automatic understood consensus about what is right and about what is wrong. Now, there may be among us a consensus about what is right and wrong. But I do not believe we can afford to assume that anymore. And I have in the past. Assumption number two, that I do not believe we can afford to make anymore, is this, that among us there is an automatic and understood consensus relative to what grace looks like when it gets fleshed out in our lives. What grace translates into in our living. That there is among us an automatic understood consensus about what that looks like is something I do not believe I can, I do not believe we can afford to make. Third assumption is this, that I believe we can no longer afford to make. That among us there is an automatic understood consensus relative to what holiness is. and that there is an automatic understood consensus relative to whether or not we would even embrace holiness. I want to say this again. There may be a consensus among us relative to these things, but to assume there is is something that I believe is wrong, indeed dangerous. Let me tell you why. By simply backing up and sharing my views and my perspective and what I think it is that God has given me relative to every one of those assumptions. What sin is, what grace looks like, and what holiness is. Let's start off with assumptions about what is right and what is wrong. Ten years ago, I would have stood in this pulpit and read verse 20, come to the part that said abstain from fornication, and made an assumption. The assumption would have been clearly this, that all of us know and agree that porneia is wrong. All of us know, obviously, it would be a given to me that sexual relations outside the context of legal marriage between a man and a woman is porneia, that there would be agreement among us that that would be morally wrong. I would have, ten years ago, spent no time arguing that. I would have assumed that. I might have even said, abstain from fornication, and then said, but we all know that, and gone on to what is indeed a deeper work that we need to do, and that is, how is it, as men and women in this world, as redeemed people, we can indeed, by the power of the Spirit, not just white-knuckling it, but with the power of the Spirit, do that. That would be the question I would move to, assuming we agreed what pornea was, and that It was indeed wrong. Ten years ago, I would have read Matthew 19. I'm going to read Matthew 19 now. Just a couple of verses. Jesus is saying this. Have you not read? Do you not know? I assume that you did. But here is the pattern. that God who created them from the beginning made them male and female. And he said to them this, For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. Ten years ago I would have read that passage of scripture and made an assumption. And the assumption would have been this, that we are all in agreement that the God ordained from the beginning of time created pattern for healthy, happy, holy sexuality is one man, one woman, leaving, cleaving, one flesh, no options. I would have spent no time arguing that. I would have made the assumption that among us there would be agreement, obviously, about that. And I would have, again, moved on to, how is it in this world, by the power of the Spirit, not white-knuckling it, but with the freedom that the power of the Spirit gives us through brokenness and mourning and the life of God, we can honor our marriages. The assumption would be that we would all agree about what sin in that would look like. I do not believe it is wise to make that assumption anymore. There are numbers of reasons. Among them are these. In the last ten years, our society, our culture, has gone through radical change as it relates to moral perspective. Radical change. Such that I do not believe we even know ourselves how fast things are moving. Now when I speak of moral perspective and change, the change that I am speaking of is not so much in the culture's attitude toward or the nature of our culture's attitude toward morality. Our culture has never been marked by godliness or purity. But I am speaking of massive change as it relates to the extent and to the sheer volume of what I would call immoral. I believe, and this is my personal belief, that the day is coming, indeed it has come, where verbal and visible stands for the sanctity of human life. Verbal and visible stands for the sanctity of holy matrimony. Verbal and visible stands for the exclusive, exclusive design of God in creation of one man, one woman. Leave, cleave, no options. Verbal and visible stands for those things in our culture will be met with more than scorn. It will be met with violence. It will be met with rage. I believe, my opinion, is that the day is coming, indeed has come. We are living in it now where verbal and visible stands against abortion. Verbal and visible stands against homosexuality as a viable alternative lifestyle. Verbal and visible stands against sexual promiscuity will be met with more than scorn. It will be met in this day and in days to come with violence, with rage. Our culture has changed, and we need to notice it. Ruth Graham, the wife of Dr. Billy Graham, in a recent interview with Charles Colson, said this. If God does not soon bring judgment to our country, he is going to owe Sodom and Gomorrah an apology. I believe the floodgates are open. I believe that the dam of restraint in the United States of America, that's too big. Minneapolis, Minnesota. The dams of restraint have been taken away. So much so that to come against the flood, the torrent of public opinion relative to morality and any sort of purity, reflected powerfully, by the way, in the media, To stand against that feels, quite frankly, more than futile. It feels suicidal. Who in the world wants to stand up with these issues on your lips in a secular context? It is my profound belief that in our culture, good old Minneapolis, want to raise my kids here place. Anything short of massive, mind-boggling, unprecedented in our lifetime revival, anything short of that has no chance, none, of turning the tide. Our culture has changed. And as a church, we must notice it. not only must we notice it, we must respond to it. We must be awakened. Not only has our culture changed, but our church has changed in 10 years as well. Why do you say that? Well, there's a number of reasons. Let me just kind of backtrack and tell you a perception that I have. You ought to know this. 10 years ago, 12 years ago was when I came. In fact, a couple weeks ago was my 12th anniversary. 12 years I've been here. 12 years ago, the way I would describe it, the church I came to, using terminology out of Acts, is that we had what I would call a Jerusalem church. And the wars we fought in those days were the kinds of conflict they had in Jerusalem. We would be fighting about legalism. We would be fighting about religious pretending and hypocrisy and a lot of good-looking stuff on the outside, but no life on the inside. And we went to war in the Jerusalem church and brought about a work of grace and freedom and the reality of the Spirit on the inside. Ten years later, I believe that we do not have a Jerusalem church anymore. I believe, and I'm glad, I had a harder time in that church than I'll ever have in this kind. I think we have an Antioch Syria church. I think we have an Antioch Syria church where people are coming in contact with the raw life and power and redeeming work and wonderful grace of God to meet them in some of the most painful situations of life and they're finding healing by the hand of God. And it's a wonderful work, just like it was a wonderful work in Acts 15. But I will never forget when I first looked at this text where James says to them, abstain from fornication. It just, it made me scratch my head. I thought, you have to tell them that? You know, when we were in the Jerusalem church, you never had to tell anybody that. They knew that. we went on from there. In a Gentile church, you do have to say that. Because everybody doesn't know. And it doesn't mean you're bad if you don't know it, but we need to tell you. And he needed to tell them. Our church has changed. I believe it would be hopelessly naive for us to think that given the changes in our culture, that we haven't changed, that we haven't in any way been elevened. It would be irresponsible of us to think that changes could take place like they have in our culture and to think that we could not have ever been affected by that. I have been affected. You have too. We have. In ways that I don't think we even know. I know I don't know all the ways I have been leavened. We have been affected. I want to read a letter that illustrates in a rather graphic way, ways in which we may have been affected more than we know. It's a letter that I have some hesitation in reading, except for a couple of things. Number one, it's an anonymous letter, which means I have absolutely no idea who wrote this. None whatsoever. Another reason I'm moved to read it in spite of my hesitation is that I do not believe that this is isolated. And the third is that there is, in fact, in the letter, an invitation to read this. Dear Pastor Johnson, I've been praying that you would read and address this letter somehow in your upcoming sermon on fornication. I would like to hear your definition of homosexuality and would like the subject to be treated with more than a sarcastic monologue on how we all know it's wrong and would never choose it. I don't believe it is wrong, not a lifetime of monogamous marriage. I do choose it. I am a happily married woman to a wonderful woman. We serve the Lord. We love the Lord Jesus first and most. To avoid being a stumbling block, we have only told close friends and family. We believe the Lord has led and blessed us and will continue to do so. I look forward to hearing you continue to challenge us to know our scriptures in full, complete truth. we need to talk we need to talk we need to talk recently it has come to my attention that a very well developed theology has begun to emerge around this issue of homosexuality presenting homosexuality as a God-blessed, ordained of God style of life. This is a fairly recent experience for me having this come to light. And I'm going to tell you something. I don't often feel old. It made me feel old. I don't often feel totally out of touch with what's going on in terms of trends. But when I read this theology and what evidently has taken root in some significant areas, I felt real out of touch, totally naive. But a well-developed theology. Beyond that, what has come to light for me in recent days as I began to share this newfound theology I never knew existed with some colleagues and friends of mine who are in academic circles, Christian academic circles, I discovered that in significant numbers, evangelical scholars, professors at some evangelical schools, again in numbers that surprised and deeply distressed me, are beginning to embrace that theology. Beloved, as I begin to move into this issue, and I'm not going to go deeply into this issue of homosexuality today, but I want to tell you something. I would like to think that we as a church, by the working of the Spirit with spirit eyes, would be on the cutting edge of caring for people who are in bondage to homosexuality. That it consistent with the message we started in Acts 15, where Peter and the rest of the church in Jerusalem were holding herself aloof from the Gentiles, thereby not getting to the Gentiles, and we indicated powerfully, I think, That the word of God to that church then and to our church now is this. In every people group there are men and women who are ready to hear of the redeeming, saving, liberating word and work of the Spirit of God. And do not dare hold yourself aloof or self-righteous as if you are above anybody else. Ever. But you do not reach people by changing definitions about what is right. and what is wrong. What brings redemption is brokenness over sin, mourning over sin. Grace begins to flow and healing begins to come. Our culture is changing and we have got to know it. Our churches are changing and we have got to know it and our church is changing and because of all those things changing our assumptions and my assumptions are changing. We can, I can no longer afford to believe that among us there is an automatic understood consensus about what sin is, about what is right and what is wrong and so it is I will do work here that I have never done before and yes I will address this issue that was raised in this letter from this dear woman. And no, I will not be sarcastic. I will not be sarcastic. Assumption number two, that I do not believe we can afford to make anymore, is this, that among us there is an automatic understood consensus about what grace translates into as it relates to our living. I have, in fact, had a long-held assumption that we all know and understand pretty much that grace experienced issues into love. That's what grace looks like. That liberty lived in issues in obedience, not license. That faith that is genuine issues in good works. Long-held assumption that among us there would be consensus automatic understood that love, obedience, good works, service and giving is where grace is going. We preach grace because the only way to get to real obedience is through grace. But obedience is where it's going. We preach grace because good works is the only way to get there. It's through grace. and service and love is where grace is going. And we all know that, right? Ephesians 2, 8, 9, a very familiar passage of Scripture, says this, For by grace we have been saved through faith, and that's not of ourselves, not of works, lest any man should boast. We all know that. Verse 10, for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works. What that means is that's where grace is going. It's going to good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. Walk in what? Walk in good works. How did he get there? By grace. That's why we preach grace. But it's going to good works. We're his workmanship created in Christ Jesus that we should walk in them. We all know that. Don't we? Titus 2, 11 to 13 says this. For the grace of God has appeared to all men teaching us. The grace of God taught us. The grace of God was going to this. Teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. That's what grace taught us. So we start with grace. And out of grace, all of those things flow. We all know that. That's safe to assume, isn't it? I don't think it's safe to assume that among us there is an automatic, understood consensus that that is true. Is there a consensus? Maybe. Is it automatic? Is it understood? I think it's dangerous to assume that. The fact is this. I have a growing concern that among us, there are some, many, I hope not, most, I don't think so. Some, yes, who believe that because of freedom in Christ, abstaining from anything is a violation of liberty. that because of grace obedience is optional that because of grace fundamental understandings of and affirmations related to any moral absolutes are no longer binding why? because we are not under law we're under grace not under law we're under grace therefore Therefore, the law of God is of no effect in our lives. Moral absolutes do not apply. There are at least two things, in my view, that lead people to believe that kind of thing. Number one is that we have been leavened by the spirit of the age. And the spirit of the age, beloved, if you have not heard the message, this is the message of the spirit of the age. No moral absolutes. what is right and what is wrong is absolutely relative and that is the message that is pumping out of every single talk show from Geraldo Rivera to Phil Donahue to Oprah Winfrey who's to say what's right and well he said this person moral relativism no moral absolutes no one can say what's right and wrong you couple that with what I think is painful misunderstanding of the gospel of grace and terrible terribly inadequate knowledge of the word of God and you come up with a perception that says because we're not under law but under grace there are no more moral absolutes applying to me so it is I can sleep with my boyfriend. I can sleep with my girlfriend. I can dabble with pornography. And I can get drunk on Friday night. And because of grace, there are no consequences. Because Dave, even if I do get drunk on Friday night, nothing can alter his yes toward me, right? And I would say, right, nothing can alter his yes toward you. You got drunk Friday night. If you're in Christ, his yes toward you didn't change. Good deal. And nothing I can do could ever change my standing. And I will say with my last breath, yes, that's true. And nothing can separate me from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus. That is true. And I am forgiven of my sin even before I do it. Because in Christ I have been forgiven past, present, and even future sin. And I will say to you, yes. But if you believe that because of that, which is absolutely true, your sinful behavior results in no consequences, you are wrong and you could be dead wrong. the moral law of God how can I explain this best way I can come up with is by likening it to the law of gravity think about the law of gravity if I jump off a cliff say two people jump off the cliff one is born again filled with the spirit loves Jesus from his toes the other one is an atheist Which one hits the bottom first? No, that's another joke. I just ruined this whole sermon. Don't get this tape. Both of them are falling. Both of them are going to fall. Because there's this law. It's called gravity. And if they jump off the cliff, they're going to fall. And when they fall, they are going to hit. And if they hit, they are going to hurt. Both of them are going to pay the consequences for jumping off the cliff. And that is why a loving parent, a loving father or mother says, Children, God says to us, children, do not go near the edge. It is not because I do not want you to have joy and joy complete. It's because I want you to have joy and joy complete. don't go by slippery places because if you go by slippery places you will slip and if you slip you will fall and if you fall you will hurt and if you hurt I will come to you and bring you my grace and bring you my mercy but you will have pain and I can't spare you that so don't play in the road and abstain from porneia as much as I ever have if I could appeal to our relationship that we have as pastor to congregation, if I could be shepherd to sheep, if I could be father to children, I would speak to you thus, saying things like this. Beloved, words from God that say to us, don't do that or do do that are not given to us from our Father to spoil our fun and steal our joy. Let marriage be held in honor above all. It is not given to us to restrict our joy. It is given to us that in the context of working that out, sometimes very painfully, our joy would be made complete, that there would be brought to us genuine fulfillment that we would be kept from harm, prevent needless pain. We're sharing this with a number of our elders, this whole concept and fight with how to present this and how to say this. And one of them gave this illustration that I thought was good. He said, you know what we need to understand is that God does not put a cookie on the counter and say, don't eat that cookie like maybe a human parent would just to see if they eat the cookie. It's really a good cookie. Wouldn't hurt you at all. But I just want to test you to see if you'll obey. God doesn't do that. If God, our Father, says to us, Don't eat the cookie. There's something that I know about the character of God in my relationship with Him. If He said, Don't eat the cookie, it is not to spoil my fun. It's because there's something very wrong with that cookie. I don't see it. I don't understand it. In fact, if I put it in my mouth and tasted it, it would on the front end taste sweet. But if he told me not to, it's because there's poison in that particular cookie, and I will pay the consequences. And some will be able to look at that cookie, hear the word of the Father, said, no, I believe and trust in you that that is not okay. I don't understand why. I'm going to figure out why. I'm going to do that, but I'm not going to eat that. But others, like many of us, need to eat the cookie to find out what's wrong. And we pay the price, and when we pay the price, and when we get hit by the truck, And when we get run over by the car, and when the consequence comes, God, our Father, runs to us. He runs to us. Our Father, human Father, might look at us and go, you idiot kid, I told you. That is not our Father. Our Heavenly Father, when we as children decide to play in the road anyway and get run over, our Father runs to us, picks us up, desperately desires to minister His healing to us, but we will bleed and hurt and pay. A consequence. And God will sob in silence. As the judgment He has worked into the universe, I reply, when trucks hit you, you hurt. When you move into porneia, you will hurt. So don't. If God says do, if God says don't, it is because in the doing and in the not doing, there is value, benefit, great gain, protection, and health. To use the text, you will do well to do what he says and not do what he says not to do. You will do well. Will he love you more? No. Will he love you less? Never. settled issue weeks we have spent on that never again are you a Gentile the residue you are the brethren but if you jump off a cliff you're going to fall abstain from pornea why? because in pornea there is great pain there is great consequence there is a high price over the next several weeks into the text we will go and from the text we will hear the word of God concerning our sexuality. But I want to share today, just from my perspective, scratching the surface, what some of these consequences are without even going into the text. Among the consequences for porneia are these. 14-year-old children raising children. Is there grace from God and mercy from God poured out upon 14-year-old children who are in a position, because of choices they made, to raise children as grace, buckets of grace, oceans of mercy, open the floodgates of your healing. Yes. But 14-year-old girls and boys should be trying to figure out what to wear to the basketball game. They shouldn't be trying to figure out how to raise their child. It's a consequence. Here's a consequence, men, of porneia, that abstaining from feels like it's spoiling our fun. Here's a consequence. Trying to explain to your wife how it is that she has contracted genital herpes when she's been faithful to you. That's a consequence. Some of you have probably had to pay that consequence. Fraternity suits, that's a consequence. A couple of weeks ago when I was just beginning to wade into this, I was reading the paper, my antenna was up for this kind of thing. I saw this article in the paper. I have a feeling I would find an article about this today and tomorrow and the next day as well. But in this particular thing, there was a twist on it because a man had come to a woman who 16 years ago he had had a one-night stand with. He is now bringing to her a paternity suit claiming that because of that event, he is the father of her 16-year-old boy. She is now married with a family. And he shows up out of the blue saying, I'm the father. and I want custody, at least joint custody, at least visitation rights. So 16 years later, there is a consequence for an event that this woman I'm sure now would say, I can't believe I did that. A foolish thing, a nonsense thing. It is now a very painful thing because now I've got this guy coming that I haven't seen in 16 years and now I've got to go explain to my son and talk about whether his father is really his father. And now I've got to talk to my husband about whether his son is really his son. Is there grace for that? Is there healing for that? I'm telling you, that's why we're so excited about this gospel that we preach, because there is grace for that. Buckets of grace and oceans of mercy open up the heavens for your healing. But are those consequences painful? Beloved, we could have a parade of people stand in this pulpit with tears streaming down their cheeks saying, I want to tell you first of all about how grace came to me. Person after person, I am convinced, would come and say, I am sitting here today in this congregation with my wife, and we're holding hands. And my mind can just replay the pornea of my life and how it cost us a home and how it cost us a job and how it cost us our family. But God has brought some healing and some wholeness, and we're together, and I can't believe it. But could I tell you about the price? Could I tell you about the pain? And others would be able to talk about healing, but you know what? My family never did come back together. The kids still won't talk to me. But in here, I have found rest and peace. There is grace. There is hope. But could I tell you about the consequences of pornea? We would have a parade of people. it's very costly it does indeed cost people their house their car their families, their reputation it costs money it costs people their health it costs some people their lives I haven't even mentioned AIDS I saw an interview a couple of weeks ago with Magic Johnson being interviewed by Bob Costas one of the things he said that caught my ear and then I kind of tuned everything else he said out because I just kept rolling this around trying to figure out this is what Magic Johnson said all of my sexual fantasies have been fulfilled and I thought that really just caught me I thought really? No kidding all your sexual fantasies have been fulfilled first question was this did the fulfillment of your fantasies include losing your career? include that? Did the fulfillment of your fantasies include contracting AIDS? I began to think about fulfillment. Fulfillment. I didn't even look it up. I just played with the word. Full. Full. Fill. Fill means everything that is in the cup of what sexuality can give you, he got. And I began to think of fulfilled sexuality. Biblical fulfilled sexuality. And this is the thought that came to me. Fulfilled sexuality within the parameters that God has given to us is expressive. And wonderful and powerful and binding and holy. But fulfilled sexuality doesn't make you sick. Fulfilled sexuality, what is in the cup of God's design for sexuality, doesn't kill people. And then I thought, Magic, you got it wrong. You have not experienced sexual things fulfilled. You have experienced pornea fulfilled. You have experienced the full experience of what porneia gets you. That's what you have gotten. And if he were here and he cared to hear, what I would say to him is this, there is grace for that too. And mercy for that too. But not in pretending behavior like that is anything less than porneia. The price is high and that is why God our Father has said abstain from fornication. Don't play in the road. Thought occurs to me at this point that there may be some among us who say, you know, I've heard all these consequences. And it's like watching those movies they show us in Driver's Ed to tell us not to drink, to drive drunk. All these cars smashed and all these mangled bodies. And, you know, I'm just pretty sure those things are never going to happen to me. So we go ahead and we do what we want to do. And the mentality of this person would be one, I see these consequences, I even see them in other people, but they've never happened to me. And if the consequences have never hit you, in other words, if you've been playing in the road and you've never gotten hit by the car, even though somebody right next to you did, you get this feeling that you're not going to get hit. The consequences aren't going to come to you. The thing, by the way, that I think about this is that the younger you are, the more likely you are to think like this. because the longer you are in the road, the longer you are moving in pornea, the higher the likelihood is that you have been hit. The younger you are, the less time you've spent in the road, the more likely you are to think, no consequences. But here's the piece I want to give you about thinking there are no consequences to pornea if right now you think you're getting away with it. Here is the consequence. You're already living with it. You have become a person who believes there are no consequences. Therefore, it is safe to play in the road. That's your consequence. You think it's safe to move into pornea. Because maybe you haven't paid the consequence. You've even got some friends who think that too. And maybe you've got a little brother and sister who thinks that too. But here's the word to you. Your consequence is already in. You think it's safe. That means you're not going to stop. But here's the word from God about that. Galatians 6. Be not deceived. God is not mocked. What you sow is what you grow. Beloved, I can't say it enough. When we begin to feel the consequence of behavior that violates the moral law of God, and we feel pain, and we come up broken, there is grace, and there is mercy, and there is healing. But not in pretending. that what is right is not, that what is wrong is not. It comes in repentance, changing our mind about our sin, changing our mind about who the king is and who gets to decide. Third assumption that I don't think we can afford to make anymore is that among us there is a consensus that is automatic and understood relative to what holiness is. Holiness to many of us, and we've all maybe struggled with this, maybe not all, but many, I think, have struggled with the idea of holiness being some dried up self-righteous thing. We have spent years here establishing the fact that self-righteousness is the antithesis of holiness. Holiness defined most simply is this. It is wholeness. Let that word sink in. Holiness is wholeness. Holiness for the believer is congruity. Holiness for the believer is health. Holiness is a moving away from the schizophrenia that sometimes we live in. Let me explain that. Because I have bent my knee to Jesus as my king, we have spent weeks in Acts 15 saying that those who by faith receive Christ have a cleansed heart. They have the implanted spirit with a cleansed heart on the inside, with the implanted spirit on the inside. If there are behaviors out here that violate my new identity in here, that's almost schizophrenic. It's unhealthy. It's not congruent. It's fingernails on a chalkboard. It's turning my head all the way around. I was not built for this head to go all the way around. And when you try to make it do that, I will feel pain. Holiness in the life of a believer is living out here consistently with what God has planted on my inside. A call to holiness for God's people from my mouth would be a wonderful gift. It would be like saying, I have the best. I wish the best for you. Holiness is saying, I hope, I pray, God come upon us for wholeness. Wholeness. Congruity. Let me illustrate this with 1 Corinthians 6. A text we will be spending time with in weeks to come. It says a tough verse in verse 9 of 1 Corinthians 6. Do you not know? I can't assume that you do know, Paul is saying there, so I'm going to quit doing that. Don't you know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? I thought you knew that. Do not be deceived. Fornicators, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, By the way, these sins are not greater than each other. They're all the same. Fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of God. That's a hard verse. Those people who have as their identity drunkard, liar, thief, homosexual, adulterer, fornicator, identity. That's who you are, not in the kingdom. Not in the kingdom. Then he goes on. Incredible verse. And such were some of you. But you have been washed. You have been set apart, sanctified. You have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the spirit of our God. Now the thing that's interesting about that verse, you have been washed. you have been set apart, justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, is that these people he here is declaring have been washed and set apart were still doing some of those behaviors I just said were consistent with people who aren't in the kingdom. They were still doing the behaviors. But he was calling them washed. He was saying, such were some of you, you aren't anymore, even though they were doing the behaviors. in fact the reason he wrote this letter to the Corinthians was because they were acting out some of these things some of them were acting out adultery, fornication, homosexuality drunkenness, they were getting drunk at the communion service 1 Corinthians 11 but now because of their new identity those behaviors if they were indeed in Christ those behaviors now are totally inconsistent with your new identity you are no longer these people you are now washed but if you decide to go ahead and do those behaviors you are living incongruent you are living disjointed you are living dissonant and you will be sick there will be consequences in 1 Corinthians 11 it says because of such things as these some of you are sick and some of you are dead God's yes toward them less? no God's acceptance of them as sons less? no you play in the road get hit by a truck, God's going to run towards you. I will say this. If behaviors such as fornication, adultery, idolatry, homosexuality, thievery, covetousness, drunkardness, reviling and swindling is in harmony with your deepest heart, hear me, If those behaviors are a match for your heart, you are not one of His. Romans 7 speaks of the struggle that we have sometimes with a new identity. Paul said, Joyfully I concur with the law of God in my inner man. That's the mark of a redeemed person. The spirit implanted, heart cleansed, new desire. now we move past that and to talk about what we talk about all the time how is it that I live free from sin and yet not doing it by white knuckling but by the power of the spirit through brokenness and mourning and transparency and truth calls to holiness fidelity and chastity are calls to harmony hear that calls to holiness fidelity and chastity are calls to wholeness, congruity, joy, and fulfillment. Abstain from fornication. Why? Well, to start with, here's why. You will do well. You will do well. And I am trying to spare you pain. But you know what I'm aware of? As you give a word like this, a word that I think is incredibly necessary, given the culture we live in, given the changes in our church because of the culture we live in, there are people who have already been harmed by pornea. In one form or another. Many of you. This is a hard message to hear, maybe for everybody. For many, there's a breath of fresh air. But to those who have been wounded by porneia because you played in the road, this could be particularly hard. And that is why it occurs to me that if we are going to aggressively take the lid off of this kind of thing among us, we are going to need amazing grace. We are going to need to preach and offer and ask the Spirit to come with buckets, buckets of grace and trainloads of mercy and the heavens to open, dear Jesus, for your healing for your people who have wounded themselves by crossing the line, thinking maybe because of grace that there would be no consequences. As a father to a son, I would say abstain. Don't go on the road. And if you do, I will come to you. But you may walk with a limp for a very long time. Would you stand with me? No closing song today. I would encourage you to do this. Let's be a little extra quiet today as we leave. I want to encourage you to, if you need to, to just stay and listen to God relative to these things. I want to encourage you to come for prayer if you need that. I want the altar ministry to come right now even as I speak. And I just want to pray. Holy Spirit of God, it does occur to me that as we take the cover off of this, we need buckets of grace. And I can't speak that into being. I pray that you would bring it. And train loads of mercy and open the heavens for your healing. God, I pray that you would do a work among us for wholeness. Oh God, come to us with a spirit of holiness. Maybe it starts, Lord, with a spirit of repentance. We need to change our mind about buying the lies of the spirit of the age. And the lies that the spirit of the age comes to us with saying, Maybe in light of this word, oh, it's okay to play in the road. I pray that we would even be able to see that those who tell us that don't care about us. They don't care about us. And if we get defiled, there's none of their concern. But it is our concern, Father, for the little ones, for the children, and for the believers in you who are being wounded by the lies of the enemy. The devourer has come to the flock of God. and we have been and are being devoured by the lies of the evil one and I pray in Jesus name that your spirit would come and fight for us that you would be the lion of Judah for us as it relates to vanquishing among us the devourer be the lion of Judah for us fight for us expose among us what the lies are that we have been buying but I pray Father as you are a lion against the devourer that to those who are left like little piles in the road that you would be the lamb that you would come like the lamb that you would bring your healing and your grace so we wouldn't have to hide anymore even in our denial we hide in denial even in our redefinition of sin we hide in that Father you would unmask it not for our harm but for our healing bring harmony and wholeness to your people I call for holiness to flow I pray in Jesus name Amen
