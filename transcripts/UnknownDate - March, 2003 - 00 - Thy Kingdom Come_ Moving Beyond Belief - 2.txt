Let's pray as we move to our time in the Word. As we pray the way Jesus taught us to pray when He said, Pray this way, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, right here, right now, through this Word. And if you do that, that would be enough. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Last week, in what amounted to the beginning of a State of the Church address that is still connected to, indeed, it is being birthed out of and it is flowing from our series of sermons these weeks and months on the kingdom of God, I introduce to you a statement of ministry focus and direction that we think embodies what God is saying to us at Open Door these days, where God is calling us to these days, a statement that will serve as the theme for this season in our church's life. The statement of theme is this, moving beyond belief, thy kingdom come, because we believe that it is one thing to pray, Thy kingdom come. It is quite another thing to move beyond belief, to move beyond what we say we believe and desire about the kingdom of God into actually acting on those things we say we believe. For it is in the doing of the kingdom of God, acting on what we say we believe, That we will begin to see and experience supernatural inbreakings of the kingdom of God, of the rule and reign of God, the power of God in our actual lives in ways that really are beyond belief. Let me say it this way. God is calling us, I believe, to become the kind of people here at Open Door who are learning to live and move beyond belief and that as we do that, we will begin to see outpourings of God's power, supernatural power, that really are beyond belief. Dream come true kinds of things. And so we pray, thy kingdom come. Lord, help us move beyond belief. But, as I indicated last week, all of that energy and desire actually raises a question. The question is this, how? How do you move beyond belief? Particularly, how do we as a church move beyond belief? I kind of get it as an individual, and most of us even respond to that individually. But how do you? Is it even possible to think in terms of a body of people, corporately, together, moving beyond belief? Do we have a plan for that? Is there a strategy of any kind to actually pull this thing off? Actually to at least try to pull this thing off of as a body of people moving to a place that is in fact beyond what we say we believe into doing the kingdom of God where we will see things beyond belief? Well, the answer to that, I think, is yes. Well, it is yes. We do have a plan. I don't know if it's always going to work. And I began to share with you last week the two philosophical and theological underpinnings upon which that plan of direction is built. And all of it, these theological underpinnings, all of it is born of this fundamental belief here at Open Door, that if we at Open Door are not providing ways for people like you and people like me to enter into and authentically experience a progressive transformation of our actual lives into the character of Christ, where you and I are actually becoming more loving, more forgiving, compassionate, graceful, more generous than we had ever thought we would ever become, then we may be putting on a good show here on the weekends, and we may be able to draw a really big crowd. But if we are not doing those things I just described, we as a church are not accomplishing anything of eternal or substantial kingdom significance. Therefore, foundational underpinning number one of what it takes, we believe, to move as a church body beyond belief is this, that we are committed not only to creating an environment, but creating mechanisms of training and support whereby authentic transformation can take place. Key word around this whole thing is this, transformation. and while how we're doing at that is up for debate and behind the scenes we're constantly talking about that and wondering if we're really doing very good at all make no mistake about this one thing that this issue of authentic personal transformation and how it actually takes place in people's lives is what we're aiming at it's what we desire it's what we're planning and programming for at every single level of ministry here at Open Door. It is the why, in other words, of everything we do. It explains why we pick the songs we pick for a worship service. It explains the why of why we do children's ministry, the way we do children's ministry. Behind it all is this fundamental commitment. And we see this as absolutely critical, central to any hope we have of realistically becoming, as a body, the kind of people who are learning how to move beyond belief, which leads to the second foundational underpinning for everything we do here at Open Door that drives the plan we have to move beyond belief. It's this, that born of this transformation that people like you are experiencing and I am experiencing, we would begin on personal levels and on corporate levels to intentionally spill over and rub off on the community we live in and the city we share with hundreds of thousands of people, and to do that in practical, tangible, visible ways that reveal and reflect the life and light and love of God by simply serving people. Foundational pillar number one of what we think it takes to, as a body, move beyond belief is personal transformation. Foundational pillar number two is to be giving it all away by loving and serving people. Now, some of this transformation stuff that's happening in your life and in my life and in our lives, and the servanthood stuff that flows from that transformation is already happening in wonderfully significant and visible ways. Indeed, I am quite sure that some of you don't have to go any further than the workings of your own heart right now, this morning, to know that God is changing you. You notice it. It's not where you necessarily want to be, ultimately, but God is doing something in you, God is changing you. And born of his changing you, you can sense that he is calling you. Maybe in ways you've never heard it before or sensed it before that he is calling you to give it away, to give it away in loving service. And that right in the middle of his changing you and his calling you, he is moving you beyond belief, beyond belief. A lot of this kind of stuff happens spontaneously. This working of God in you that spills off on other people, it just happens in the flow of life where from the outflow of your being formed in God, you enter into people's lives in life-giving ways, in what I like to call naturally supernatural ways. That's a phrase, by the way, it was coined by John Wimber years ago. That we would be a people who are becoming more and more the kind of people who would move in the supernatural workings of God's Spirit and His power in very natural ways. I think we have a paradigm of when the gifts of the Spirit come and how the power of God flows, that it always has to be in the context of a great big event. And I think God moves powerfully and supernaturally, signs and wonders, in great big events. But I would have you invited into a whole different paradigm that out in the natural places of the living of our lives as God is forming us and changing us, as that spills over, we become the kind of people who are moving supernaturally in natural ways. In natural ways. Give you some examples of that. I'd like to tell you about a woman in our church. Her name is Sherry. Sherry's a teacher of a local, in a local, yeah, she's a teacher. Let me start over. In a junior high school here in Maple Grove. Sherry happens to be one of those kinds of teachers who happen to believe like a lot of teachers that I know believe in fact I have a very strong feeling for teachers I have a family of teachers who believe that you can have an incredibly powerful kingdom effect particularly in the public schools it's not even just about yelling about whether we can pray in school It's about bringing the kingdom to school by the formation of God and you spilling over on other people. Sherry happens to be one of those kind of people who believes she can have an impact on kids' lives that goes beyond math and science and biology. She noticed one day, because Sherry has a tendency to notice these kinds of things, a student in one of her classes who wasn't doing very well, she was at risk. She was in trouble at home. She was in trouble at school. She was in trouble. Sherry noticed her. Sherry's not a theologian. She did this incredibly. She noticed this kid. That's what she did. And she befriended her. And she talked to her and she listened to her. And then one day she said to her, you know what, I know a place where you could go and if you go there, you will get loved. You know what she was talking about? She was talking about our youth group here at Open Door. And I want you to stop and let that in to your spirit, the way it came into my spirit. What an incredible thing to be able to say. Basically, you know what I mean? She's saying, you know what? I don't know what the program's gonna be on the Wednesday night. I don't know what songs they're gonna sing. I don't know what skits they're gonna have. I don't know anything about the program. But I know enough about what God is doing in our group and what our kids want and what the leadership around our kids want and what the focus of their ministry is that I know a place where you could go and if you go there, you'll get love. well one day she came and guess what she got she got loved i got a feeling she doesn't remember the song they sang that night i don't know she got loved and she began to change and she began to soften and she began to open her heart to the life and the light and the love of god and before you know it the change in this young girl became so apparent that her parents noticed and they started coming to church. Here. Because they noticed the change and they were just curious. Teachers noticed it too. This girl who was disturbing their classes and failing their classes began to pull A's. What's going on there? She wants to be a missionary, you guys. All because a junior high school teacher began to move beyond belief and did something. You know, I believe that God cares about the least and the lost. I believe that. and then when you move beyond belief and you touch the least and you just do something profound like notice them go toward them engage them invite them into your life we talked a couple weeks ago about inviting them to the table of your life and God begins to do things that are in fact beyond belief last week I heard the story about a 29 year old wife and mother who lives in St. Paul, who with her husband was involved in a ministry to international students. They're very excited about this. They felt like this was something God was calling them to do. They had passion for it and even a way to do it. One of the first things they did to bring this dream about was they bought a big dilapidated house in St. Paul with plans to refurbish it and convert it into a boarding house where they would bring these kids in, let them live, share their lives with them, and in the process of just doing life together, share with them the life and light and love of the God who prompted them to want to minister to international students to begin with. Well, before that project could get very far along, they bought the dilapidated house, and he had all sorts of, the husband had all sorts of capacity to rebuild and build things. Her husband got Hodgkin's disease, and just like that, he died. Just like that. so here's this young mom dealing on one hand with her grief two little kids a dilapidated house no means or skill to fix the house not even enough to fix it so she could sell it she was stuck with it so she calls her friend brenda brenda goes to open door brenda went over and did what a friend does they sat and they cried and they prayed and they wondered what in the world they could do. Brenda didn't know what to do. Brenda called Gail Doer, who heads up our Helping Hands ministry at Open Door. Gail wasn't sure what to do. She called George Lee. George Lee called Jack Quick. Jack Quick called Todd Bertelsen, called a lot of people. Those three guys were involved in a ministry that's going on here at Open Door on Tuesday nights called Kingdom Warriors. A bunch of guys that are meeting on Tuesday nights just to be together. It's an incredible ministry. It's growing from what I hear by leaps and bounds. Kingdom warriors. I'm not sure all of what they do, but I think among other things, they get together and just go, kind of, kingdom warriors. Actually, I'm pretty sure they don't do that, but you know what? The truth is, I think in a spiritual sense, as God is calling out of them rightly ordered masculinity and strength that would want to build and heal and use their strength to lift, there is a kind of spiritual coming out of that group. Well, these guys went to that group a couple weeks ago with this particular need. They told these guys about the trouble, and before you could recite to them the verse that says, true religion and undefiled cares for widows and orphans, 22 guys signed up to help her. And they began yesterday to do this, and there's going to be consecutive Saturdays where these guys get involved in this, doing everything from tearing down walls to building them back up again, drywall, taping, painting, replacing a water heater, helping her with her taxes, fixing a car that needs to be sold but can't be sold until it's fixed. She didn't have a clue how to do that. The picture I actually had of these 22 guys signing up for this right away was like a bunch of guys in the locker room. We talk about our church being a locker room, but it doesn't happen here, it happens out there. That's where the real game is played out there. I have this picture of these guys in the locker room in the window room over there meeting on Tuesday nights waiting for the game to start, and they were coming up with all sorts of energy. It'd be like pumping up the team before the game and telling them what we're gonna do, and they're all going, I'm ready to play. And when they heard about this need, it was like the ref came down at that time of the day and said, you know, it's time to start this game. Have you ever seen a football team that's ready to play, like they just got this pep talk and it's time to go? I mean, it's like they ripped the doors off. Get out of the way. That's the picture I have of these guys busting down the door because you can only sit in the locker room so long. Truth is, just weeks before, these guys in Kingdom Warriors had begun to pray, Lord, show us how to give this thing away. Because this can't just be about us coming here and feeling good. And you know what? It feels really good. And it's good to feel good to be with guys who are going to take off their mask and show the real deal and be who they really are before each other and before God. And there's something that feels really good about this, but something stirred up in them that said, God, it can't just be about us coming here and feeling good. Need to give this away. They call it Project Leslie now. And I'm here to tell you they have moved beyond belief into doing something. sometimes it happens like that spontaneously i love the spontaneous stuff you feel so authentic to me but sometimes it's strategic and sometimes it needs to be strategic because sometimes without a strategy without some structure or direction a lot of our heart's desire to serve never gets out of the locker room because it doesn't know where to go. I mean, imagine those guys never having that energy hook up with an opportunity. They would just have all this energy, and after a while, it just kind of, it just pours out on the floor, and you get tired of getting up again for a game that nobody's playing. There needs to be strategy, which is why as a church, we're trying to put our money where our mouth is, as it were, and staff for this. Most of you know Tom Johnson. Tom often does the announcements here. Tom is the pastor of outreach and evangelism. He's been on our staff for a long time. It's not so recently that he became the pastor specifically of outreach and evangelism because we want some direction. We want some strategy around this. What it means is he spends the majority of his time along with the team that he's been forming praying, planning, wondering, researching, and implementing the best possible ways that we can use the resources we have as a church to serve this community we live in so that they can maybe get a glimpse of the life and light and love of God through us. And as more and more that ministry takes shape, and as more and more we do that stuff, we more and more move beyond what we say we believe into the life of the kingdom of God where God, in partnership with our doing the kingdom moves in with supernatural power landing on what we do in ways that are beyond belief. Now, with all that said, I need to get even more specific this week into the nuts and bolts of what it's going to take to continue as a body to move beyond belief. Indeed, today it is my task, my assignment, actually, to share with you, to introduce to you three bold kingdom moves that we see as being absolutely critical, central to our ability as a church to step into the future God is calling us to, as he is so clearly calling us to move beyond what we say we believe into doing what we say we believe. Kingdom move number one is probably not the most exciting of the three, but it may be the most important of the three because without this move, without this first move made well, there's nothing else to talk about. Kingdom move number one is this. We need to pay our bills. Not very glamorous. I warned you about that. see now that we're in our new home we need to pay for our new home we need to finish our new home let me unpack this this way about three years ago in fact it was exactly three years ago this very month because this week I pulled out the notes and looked at the date I preached the sermon that spoke to a critical issue in our church's life at the time that needed to change if we were serious about building a building three years ago we didn't have a building obviously and the fact that we would have one was not kind of guaranteed by any stretch of the imagination three years ago. And the necessary change I identified in that sermon three years ago was this, that we needed to go from seeing ourselves as renters to seeing ourselves as owners. It came to be known as the renter-to-owner talk. Because renters have a fundamentally different approach to issues of their life than do owners. and while owners are not necessarily better people than renters. You need to know that if you're renting. This is just an analogy. The fact is this, that going from a renter to an owner involves a fundamental shift in how I see myself, in what I understand my role to be, and how much I even care about the property I own, the neighborhood I live in, the neighbors that I have. Now, this analogy of renting and owning applies to things actually that go far beyond even property. Some of you are dating right now, maybe even married. You maybe care about the person you're dating, might even say you love them. You're a renter. Now, I need to clarify what I mean by that. I do not mean you're renting the person you go out with to go out with you. Speaking of a mentality, and there is a mentality. There is a renter's mentality. And some of you are maybe sitting next to someone. You're feeling some energy rise up in you. Six years, we've been dating, no marriage, you're a renter. Married people aren't renters. They're owners. They have a fundamentally different level of responsibility, accountability, commitment, and investment in their relationship than renters do. Now, three years ago, it was pretty clear that if a significant number of people in our church did not make that internal shift from being a renter here at Open Door to being an owner of what God was doing in this church, we would not be in this building. The very fact that we are here in this building, the very fact that this building exists at all, indicates that at a pretty significant level, that shift, in fact, has been made. I asked the question at the beginning of this service. I understand how transformation can take place in individuals. How does it take place in a body? You're looking at a symbol that a transformation of some kind has. We wouldn't be in the building if we had not been, as a people, transformed in this very arena. It can happen corporately. I think we even need to notice when it does. We became, as a church, a different kind of people. We became the kind of people who were capable of actually entering into and accepting the responsibility of what it takes to build a building like the one we're in. And the truth is, 10 years ago, we were not, as a church, that kind of people who were ready, able, even willing to accept that kind of responsibility. See, part of the joy of this building is not the building. It's a symbol of something that in some pretty significant ways we have, as a body, grown up, been transformed in at least this particular arena. Now, sticking with this renter-to-owner analogy, how many of you remember when you bought your first house? Some of you don't because you haven't, but if you did, if you've ever bought that house, that first house, it's an exciting experience. You sign the papers, you made the deal, you agreed to the terms. It's dream come true time. You're walking out, you see the house, you can't believe it's yours. When some spoiled sport, like your husband or your wife or somebody says, it isn't yours, it's the bank's. And there's something to me that just goes, you know, I know that. Don't tell me that the first day I'm here. Let me just enjoy being here and look around and just say those words. It's ours, it's ours. I know it's the bank's. It's ours. Okay, okay, enjoy. We won't talk about the bank thing. see it's really not till about six months after you live in this it's ours house that you begin to actually feel what it really does cost to live here how many of you know what i'm talking about i think you do see just getting into that house was not the end of the story and you're you're suddenly faced with a deeper awareness now this deeper awareness is something you can handle, but it's more than you originally thought it was. You become aware of a deeper awareness of what it really does take to move from a renter to an owner. It's a little, there's more involved than you, and you had to feel it, and you couldn't feel it for a while. Well, borrowing from that analogy, in a very real way, that's where we are right now as a church. Getting in to this building felt great. Dream come true stuff. It was time to celebrate. Everybody's saying congratulations. If you're here the first day, we had these videos, and it was this really cool thing, and everybody was saying, congratulations, open door. Congratulations, open door. We had guys from KTIS saying, congratulations, open door. Pastors from the community, congratulations. The mayor, the police chief, congratulations. You know when people say congratulations to me, to you, at the end of the game. When you won, congratulations, you won. Did we win? Yeah, we won. Are you done? No. It's not over. The game's not over. But you said congratulations. That's what you say at the end of the game. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. See, now is the time that we need to sit down into and come to grips with what it really takes to be an owner and what it's going to take to move beyond belief as a church into the future that God is calling us to. As I think most of you can imagine, we spent a lot of time behind the scenes and the message team and speaking to various members of our staff talking about this talk I'm giving right now, trying to determine what we wanted to communicate and how we wanted to communicate it. And among the things, we wanted to be careful not to communicate when we began to talk about what it really costs to be here now in the financial situation. We didn't want to communicate panic. And there's a real important reason for that because it's not time to do that. If it was time to panic, I would say, it's time, time now. But it's not. What we do, however, want to communicate with this talk is urgency so that quite possibly this summer and maybe this fall, we don't have to panic. We don't have to talk about and do things that we don't want to talk about and we don't want to do. And so it is with a sense of urgency, I share with you this morning that the first kingdom move we think we need to make is simply this, take care of the home base. We need to pay our bills. Now, without turning this into a business meeting, and I'm not going to do that, let me tell you what it's going to take as quickly and as clearly as I possibly can. First of all, our elder board is recommending an operating budget of $5.5 million. What that covers, basically, is simply what it costs to do ministry here at Open Door. It's the programming, the staff, the programming and the staff, by the way, over the next year is getting a very minimal raise. That's not the big impact on the budget this year. As you can imagine, the big impact on our budget this year is the house payment. Again, borrowing this analogy of moving into a house. That's the biggest jump. Now, another thing you need to note in order to get the picture of where we are and what it's going to take is that last year, the general fund, the operating expenses, and the building fund, what it cost to actually get here, were separate kind of entities, which means that most of you gave that way. That was your giving weekly to the ministry of the church, and over and above that, you gave to the building fund. In fact, we started a kind of a campaign calling on heaven for a home, and we called you to think of ways that you could give over and above your normal giving so that we could kind of come up with a down payment. That's one way to look at this and get into our new home. But they were separate things. You gave to the general. You also gave, in addition, over and above that to the building. Next year, here's what you need to know. That's changing. This building fund is no longer going to be over and above. It is now merged into the general fund simply, so it's kind of bringing what we've been raising for the building into the general fund so that the building now is simply what it costs to live here in our new house. And all of that results in an overall budgetary increase in the general fund of about one million dollars. That's a big jump. Raises a question, a big question. How do we get that done? What's it going to take? Is it doable? Well, to answer that, I would direct your attention to the insert in your bulletin. It's this brown little thing. Pull that out if you have one in front of you. It's the portion, not the side that says draft, but this portion at the top that says, moving beyond belief, thy kingdom come. And I'd like you just to kind of follow along with me as we answer this question, what will it take? What will it take for us to reach our annual ministry budget of $5.5 million? Very simply, it will take generous and regular giving by all who call open door their church home. The chart below shows that if each person gives according to their ability, our entire ministry need will be met. For example, if 200 people give $5,000 a year or $417 a month, that's a million dollars. Please consider which level is consistent with your ability and the biblical values of regular and generous giving. Bullet point number one. If you are new to Open Door, we encourage you to take the step of giving to what you now consider your church home. A little word about that. This is the key to that particular statement. If you've come to see this as your home, we encourage you to now participate with us in moving beyond belief in this very tangible, important arena of our church's life. For some of you, determining that this is your church home was a real quick deal. I've talked to some of you who came here, and you were in the process of your own spiritual journey, what God was calling you to and saying to you, and we were in the process of our journey, and we moved here, and you tried it out, and there was an instantaneous match. Some of you knew the first day you were here, this is where I belong. What God's doing here is what I've got a hard four, you knew. That is exciting. It's probably not the norm. Most of you take time, and I think that's fine. It's important to take time. Well, we've been told, I told you last week, that we've increased 50% over the last five to six months. Somewhere along the line, if we're going to move beyond belief, that 50%, whoever in that 50% is saying, this is where I belong. This is where I want to put my roots. We want to call out your participation with us in this particular arena. And that's one of the ways it's going to get done. Second bullet point. If you have given sporadically in the past, we urge you to take the step of regular giving. A word about that. This is very important. Do not underestimate the power and value of giving something, and here's the key, regularly. And you know what? This is far beyond how your regular giving will help us pay the bills of this ministry. This really is a vitally important step, I believe, in the spiritual journey that anybody has developing, hopefully, what we would call a habit of trusting God. To regularly give. something regularly. You know, if the economy was booming right now, this would be a much easier talk to give. But the economy is not booming right now. Some of you have lost your jobs. Some of you, friends of mine that I know about, have taken significant pay cuts in their jobs. Others have not lost their jobs or taken a pay cut, but there's just a kind of tension around the economy right now that doesn't lend itself to a sense of confidence. There's security around our finances. And some of you, because of the things I just mentioned, can't give what you want to give. Can't give what you used to give. It's just the way it is. I think, however, a very important spiritual discipline right now for all of us is to be in a place where we are giving something regularly. Maybe it's not what we wish it could be. Maybe it's not what it used to be. But the regularly is what brings me into a habit of trust. I would even speak to kids. So at some level, kids, to be giving something regularly. I remember talking to my son Chris once and saying to him, Chris, I need you to consider somewhere along the line of giving something to God out of what you're stealing from my dresser. I gave up thinking he wasn't going to find it. Okay, anyway. That's another talk. You're welcome, Chris. Some of you are sitting here, that's so abusive, he's talking about it. My kids love it when I talk about them. Can I tell you a story? I can tell you, I don't want to tell you. I was doing a sermon years ago on lying, and I was going to tell a story about Caleb and how he got caught, and it was wonderful. And I went to Caleb, and I asked his permission, and I would always do that, and I asked his permission, and he said yes, and I made him look good ultimately, except what he got in trouble for was stealing a pack of gum, And he says, well, could you tell him I stole a car? Okay. Something big, you know. And then Chris wanted to know why I wasn't going to tell a story about him. And I said, Chris, it's a story about lying. He says, my lie? Okay. Okay. I got to get back to this. Third bullet. Third bullet. If you are a regular giver but not at a level of blessing to you, we encourage you to take the next step. Take the next step. It's really about your transformation, the next step in your own transformation. Your commitment can be a significant milestone in your own spiritual transformation. It's not just about paying the bills of this ministry, but at a very significant level. Part of our transformation includes becoming a generous people. Of all the things I dream about relative to what God is calling us to and desiring to see us become as a people, One of the things that is very high on my list is that God would form in us a spirit of generosity like we have never seen before. That's a kingdom thing, beloved. Fourth bullet says this. If you've been giving to the building fund during the last three years, please consider merging that giving with your regular general fund giving for at least one more year. Now, I realize when I talk to the group of people who that applies to, I am speaking to probably the most committed and sacrificial givers in our body. This one's really big, and it needs to be understood. I hope I can explain it in a way that makes sense, because the possibility exists that if enough people who've been giving to both the building fund and the general fund quit giving to the building fund because the commitment's over, and it is over, that three-year commitment we were making, that if enough people do that, however, instead of making progress this next year in terms of where we need to go financially, we could actually go backwards. And I think you understand why. Some of you have been giving to the building fund and the general fund. Your commitment's over. That drops off. But now this is being merged into here. And if people aren't continuing to give to that, we're making less, not more. And our needs have gone up. Now, some of you can't do that. Some of you were giving beyond belief, in a beyond belief way. And when your commitment is up, it was up, and you can't do more, and you can't do it still. But some of you, over these last few years, these last three years, have discovered that in giving to both the general and the building, you actually found yourself capable of giving more than you thought you could. Our request is that you prayerfully consider continuing that. In fact, we would like you to take this thing home with you and use this over the next couple of weeks as a matter of prayer to remind you to pray and just become even more familiar with the issues by looking at that little card there. Now, all of that is just the first move. Here's the second kingdom move we believe God is calling us to do. That while we're being careful to bring financial stability to the home-based ministry, we are at the same time, we believe, being called by God to reach out into our community and into our city in tangible, practical, visible ways. The most visible being this. Our church's involvement in and partnership with a wonderful collaboration of people that you are going to meet next week, some of the key leaders, the key players you're going to meet next week, who are in the process of establishing a multi-ethnic outreach base in North Minneapolis, embodied in a church they're going to start, that believes, like our church, that when the kingdom of God comes among men, it touches every single aspect of their life. Therefore, this community outreach endeavor embodied in this church that's going to start is committed to not only reconciliation in some symbolic way, but it is committed to community and economic development, to health care and housing, and to the feeding of the poor, thereby doing that kind of serving of a community, earning the right to share the gospel with the people we are serving, the people we are loving. Beloved, God did not give us this home base just for us. In fact, what stirs up in me is this word from Christ who said, to whom much has been given, much is required. And I absolutely believe, we absolutely believe that as we do this and as we do things like this in the future, More and more and more, we will be a church, and we will be a people who are moving beyond what we say we believe into workings of the kingdom of God that affect people's lives in practical ways, and God lands on that in supernatural ways that are beyond belief. We believe that. Now, you're going to hear more about this, as I said, next week. Ephraim Smith is going to be the guy who comes and shares with us this vision and explains to us what it will mean. And I don't say this very often, but trust me about this. Trust me that next week is a week you just don't want to miss, especially if you're interested in being part of what God's doing here in this church. But while I'm not going to go into great detail as to what it is, because we'll have more of that next week, I want you to dream with me just for a minute. What if? What if a people like us, a church like ours, in collaboration with some other churches who've got some of the same vision, in collaboration with a guy like Ephraim Smith, could really, really go into North Minneapolis and make a difference? Picture in your mind's eye West Broadway. That street, the actual street at West Broadway. Some of you can picture it because you've been there or you go there on a regular basis. Now picture West Broadway from North Memorial Hospital all the way to the river. Now picture God's people moving into an arena like that, and by the power of God and by resources released, we begin literally to renovate West Broadway from North Memorial Hospital to the river. So in such a way that when people look at that, somewhere along the line they got to go, God, through his people, did that. And what that means is the kingdoms come. And so we pray thy kingdom come. And so we pray thy kingdom come. Jesus said, let your light shine in such a way. Let it shine in a specific kind of way so that men and women in the world can see your good works and by the good works you are doing, born of the transformation you are experiencing, they can by that then glorify God who is in heaven. You know what that verse is? That's a strategy verse. Figure out, stop and think about how we can put the good work of God that he is doing to us and throw us in a place where people could see it. And it would really affect their lives and make them open to the life and light and love of God. Third move that we feel God is calling us to do will be a corporate response to and an involvement in doing something about the AIDS epidemic on the continent of Africa. I think some of you know President Bush mentioned this issue of AIDS in Africa and the State of the Union address is one of the critical needs in the world today. Again, like the other move, you're going to hear more about this in the month of April. So let me wrap this up by responding to a question that some of you have already asked as you've kind of heard where we're going with this stuff and that may have even been stirred up by what I just said. Here's the question. It's a really good question. Why are we extending ourselves into the inner city and all the way into Africa when the need right here at Open Door is so great? My answer to that is this. If we reach out to the neglect of the home base, that would be irresponsible. And the parallel I have to that is I grew up in a pastor. My dad's a pastor, and I'm a pastor. And sometimes we pastors have this tendency to reach out. We're going out and doing the ministry, but we're not taking care of our own family. To reach out and do this ministry stuff, give it all away, when you're not taking care of the home base. Your home base, that's irresponsible. That is not a kingdom way to live. But if you take care of the home base and neglect to reach out in significant, sacrificial, and stretching ways, we will, in my opinion, be even more at risk and at the risk of stirring up unnecessary anxiety or fear. I believe that if we don't respond as best we can to both of these things, home base, stability, and reaching out into the community at the same time, we could lose it all. And by lose it all, I do not necessarily mean we would cease to exist. By lose it all, I mean that we could become a big, fat, boring, rich, suburban church. And I just can't hardly think of anything more boring than that. Amen, amen. By the way, another reason we feel so strongly about doing both of these things at the same time and feeling really strong about both things at the same time is because we believe at a very important level, it models something about how life in the kingdom of God is lived. see it's not all about me it's not all about taking care of me neither is it all about giving it all away you can do either one with a tremendous lack of balance how many of you know it's hard sometimes to live life in balance how many of you know you can do so much taking care of me that you give nothing away how many of you know that you can start giving it all away and if you're not taking care of your own base, your own heart you got nothing to give life in the kingdom of God is about daily learning how individually and corporately and we're so committed to this to learning how together to receive first of all the life and light and love and the amazing grace of God and at the same time out of that supply give away what God has given us becoming by that a city set on a hill. And as we learn together as a body, sometimes doing well, sometimes stumbling, but as we learn together to live that way, we will find ourselves moving beyond belief. And we will start experiencing things that I promise you will be beyond belief. And so we pray, Thy kingdom come. I'm worried this week with a talk like this about our visitors coming. you know this is kind of a family talk today fact is I hope we have a whole bunch of first timers here today because now you know who we are and now you know why we're here and maybe you want to sign on for the adventure of a life as we learn how to pray the way Jesus taught us to pray when he taught us to pray this way thy kingdom come right here right now as we learn how to move beyond what we say we believe and to do the kingdom of God in this church, in this community, in this city, and then watch God land on that in ways that are beyond belief, signs and wonders beyond belief. And so we pray. Let us pray. Fathers, I give a talk like this. Among the things that stir up in me is memory of all the times that in the pulpit at Open Door, not in this building, but in this church, I have brought talks like this at critical junctures in our church's life. And what stirs up in me is this amazing gratitude to your faithfulness. Because as over the years, we have discerned what we need to do next, where we need to go next, where the weak spots are, and say them out loud, and call your people to faith and to action and I just see your faithfulness all over it. I see your faithfulness. And so, Father, in this place, in this hour, for such a time as this, as opportunities to bring your kingdom in ways that really are beyond belief, are at our doorstep, I pray for your faithfulness, and I pray that you would empower us, ourselves, to be faithful as well as we move with you in places that are beyond belief. And all God's people said, Amen.
