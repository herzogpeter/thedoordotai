1 Corinthians chapter 14. Good stuff, Maynard. Dealing with the issue of tongues. Let's read the first five verses and then begin. Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God. For no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries. But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation. One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but one who prophesies edifies the church. Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy, and greater is the one who prophesies than the one who speaks in tongues. Let's stop right there and pray. Father, I feel just because of the information I just gave, I'm not focused on this, and I just ask by your spirit that I would be, that we would gather together right now and draw our attention to your revealed word to us, that you would use it to clear up what is foggy in much of our thinking. And God, use it even though we're not talking about unity. Use it to bind us together in love. In Jesus' name, amen. As I said, we're dealing again this week with the issue of tongues. We have identified the fact that it is controversial. Because of the fact that it is, the last time we met to deal with our study in 1 Corinthians, we took some effort to establish some things so that we would have a foundation from which we could operate and come to grips with some sort of stability on this whole issue of tongues. The first thing we established was this. We established the problem at hand. We identified that the problem is twofold. One, the issue of tongues is a theological problem. What I mean by that is simply this. There is a theology that says tongues is not for today. Under any circumstances, it ceased, it has passed away, and it does not any longer apply to the church in any way. And anyone, therefore, anyone who is involving themselves with anything that they would call tongues is either operating clearly in the flesh or even induced by Satan. Okay? Those are fighting words. Over on this side, you've got another theology that says the gifts of the Spirit are functioning and are available to the church today, and we do indeed believe that tongues is operative today. It's a theological problem. The other thing we established right off the bat was that it's more than a theological problem. It is also an acute personal problem. And that is, even as I give those two positions, some of you might have reactions in your spirit, you know? You just have a real problem with these people who close the door on the gift of the tongues. And there is a sensitivity, there is a tendency rather, sometimes among those who believe that the gift of tongues is for today and they might even have the gift of tongues, to feel a little bit superior to those who don't, who have, quote, closed the door on the work of the Spirit and they really don't know the fullness of God and all these kinds of things, feeling superior because they do speak in tongues. On the other hand, there are those who feel superior because they don't. And those people who believe in tongues are at best gullible, shallow, uninformed people. And you know the argument. And all of a sudden, tension is there and division happens. Now, knowing that, we made an effort to go on past that and find out if there was any foundational stuff that we knew for sure. And so after we established the problem, we began to work at identifying what do we know for sure. And I'm going to affirm again what I affirmed last time in that as I affirm what we know, I need to acknowledge that it is not something necessarily that we will all agree on. So I'm going to say it differently. It is what I believe. And I have reasons for them. Very quickly to review what we had last time and reestablish our foundation. I believe, first of all, that the gift of tongues was and is a legitimate gift of the Spirit to the church. The reason I believe that, quickly, is because the text says so. In chapter 12, verse 28, it says, God has appointed in the church all sorts of gifts. He has placed them in the church for their edification. Among those gifts and gifted people are apostles, prophets, I'm in verse 28 here of chapter 12, teachers, then miracles, gifts of healing, helps, administrations, and among all the gifts that God has placed in the church for its building is various kinds of tongues. We also affirm the fact that tongues will cease. The reason we know that is because the text says so. Verse 8, love never fails, but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will be done away. We even know when it will cease. It will cease, according to the text, when the perfect comes. Verse 10, for when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away. Don't, you know, if you're visiting, I feel sorry for you because I'm just nailing these things on you and going on. You'll have to get the tapes for the past several weeks to kind of follow where we're going. There is this foundation, though, upon which we're operating. There's something else we believe, that there are a variety of tongues. There is more than one kind of tongues. Again, the reason we believe that, or I believe that, is because the text says so. Again, in verse 28, it says various kinds of tongues. Back in the other verse, verse 10, it has the same designation, various kinds of tongues. Also, one of the things we acknowledged was that while Acts chapter 2, where we have Pentecost in the first example scripturally of anyone speaking in tongues, while at that place it was what was called dialecto, a discernible language for the purpose of getting people's attention so that they later could hear the word of God from Peter, It is dialectal. While that is one form of tongue in chapter 14, we hear reference to a different kind of tongue. In chapter 14, verse 14, he is speaking of praying in a tongue, of singing in a tongue in verse 15, of a tongue that blesses, of a tongue that gives thanks in verse 17. Now, whatever that kind of tongue is, this tongue that prays, this tongue that sings, this tongue that blesses and gives thanks, Whatever it is, it is different than dialecto in chapter 2 of Acts. Acts. Point. We believe that there are a variety of tongues. There's different kinds. The other thing we also affirmed is that there are counterfeits. While we believe that there is the gift of tongues, and it is legitimate, while there is a variety of different kinds of tongues, there are also counterfeits, and we cannot afford to be naive concerning this. We'll acknowledge the fact that long before Acts chapter 2 kinds of experiences where the Spirit came and people spoke with tongues, there was an experience known to the human animal as an ecstatic language. Plato in his writings, you'll remember, 400 years before Christ was describing pagan worship and the ecstatic languages that attended their worship. You remember that the mystery religions were a group of people who believed that there was a limitless number of gods and goddesses. And my intention in any form of worship or any kind of worship service was to somehow leave the body, short-circuit the brain, and connect with one of these deities. And one of the signs that I had indeed connected with one of these deities was that I would begin to speak in what they called the language of the gods, ecstatic speech. we also remember that jesus confronted that kind of ecstatic speech in matthew chapter 6 verse 7 he said this when you pray i don't want you to pray the way the gentiles pray the way pagans pray who pray with meaningless repetition do you remember that a couple of weeks ago meaningless repetition was the word bata lageo it wasn't just memorizing a praying say prayer and saying it over and over again. Bata lageo. Lageo meaning to speak. Bata being an onomatopoeic word. Remember, a bee goes what? Buzz. And a zipper goes zip. And a plane goes whoosh. And Jesus is saying, I don't want you to pray the way the pagans pray when they come together, try to experience some supernatural experience by just taking words and repeating them over and over again. And then saying, boy, I reached the God. I don't want you coming to God saying, buzz, buzz, buzz, zip, zip, that whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, praise the Lord. Doesn't work. And I do, by the way, see that. If you need to know what I mean by that, I think that's a direct confrontation on those who, believing in the gift of tongues, believe that everybody should have the gift of tongues, would bring people forward and coach them. Say blood, blood. Say it faster, faster, faster, faster. I believe that is meaningless repetition, and it is not good. I'll tell you another reason why I don't think it's good. Because of this. because the one who dispenses the gift of tongues, just like the one who dispenses any gift, is not a high-powered evangelist or someone who's trying to manipulate someone else to have some sort of supernatural experience. It is the Spirit that dispenses and distributes the gifts. How? Just as He wills. Thank you. Chapter 12, verse 11. Again, this is coming right out of the text. It is the Spirit that dispenses the gifts. It is the Spirit who distributes them individually just as he wills. The other thing I want to say that I believe, and again, this is part of the foundation from which we are going to operate, I do not believe that everyone has the gift of tongues. And again, right out of the text, it says, in speaking of several gifts, administrations and apostles, he says in verse 29 of chapter 12, all are not apostles, are they? What's the answer? No, of course not. All are not prophets. All are not teachers. All are not workers of miracles, are they? No. All do not have gifts of healing, do they? No. And all do not speak with tongues, do they? No. That's our foundation. That's my foundation. Those are the presuppositions that I will come to this study with. Now let's go to the text. Hang with me, and I encourage you to take notes. This is one of those issues that is going to be grappling with this text. Lots of teaching. I think you're going to be gratified if you hang with me. Okay? I'm going to break the text down, the whole chapter, from verse 1 to verse 40, into three parts. The first part is this. The place or the priority of tongues in worship, verses 1 through 19. The place or the priority of tongues in worship, verses 1 through 19. Secondly, the purpose of tongues, verses 20 through 25. The purpose of tongues. And third, the procedure of tongues, in verses 26 through 40. That is a three-point sermon. It's going to take four weeks, probably. Point number one. Point number one today. The place or priority of tongues in worship. I'm going to tell you right off what the place of tongues is in worship. The place or priority of tongues in worship is fundamentally, and first of all, secondary. Okay? Get that. Write that down. It is secondary. Especially as it relates to or is compared to something like prophecy, it is inferior to other gifts. in the context of worship. Okay, where do we get that? How do we come up with a conclusion like that? Well, let's just start reading through here. Verse 1, pursue love. I understand that. Yet, earnestly desire the spiritual gifts. Again, they're a desire on Paul's part to keep them balanced. In your pursuit of love, I don't want you to abandon spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. Just stop right there. That word especially is a key word. All that does is communicate to me that Paul is establishing the spirit. the superiority of prophecy over something. He is establishing and placing a value on prophecy over something, especially that you would prophesy. When we go down to verse 2, we find out that he is comparing prophecy to tongues, for one who speaks in a tongue. And then in verse 3, he goes on with the same kind of thing. It's even clearer that simply there is this general sense of superiority of prophecy over tongues, therefore rendering tongues a secondary thing, inferior in verse 5. Look at 5. It's more clear here. Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues. That's fine. There's nothing wrong with tongues. But even more that you would prophesy, and greater is the one who prophesies than the one who speaks in tongues unless he interprets. I don't think anything could be more clear that we have a definite distinction here by Paul rendering tongues in a secondary position specifically to prophecy. Please note here too, as I go through this, He is not blowing up tongues and saying tongues are lousy. They should never be participated in. I wish that you all spoke in tongues. Nothing wrong with tongues. But in the corporate worship, there's a priority. Verse 18. We see it here too, even more clearly, I think. I thank God I speak in tongues more than you all. How many of you wish that verse wasn't in the Bible? Okay, moving right along. I speak in tongues more than you all. However, in the church, I desire to speak five words with my mind that I may instruct others rather than 10,000 words in a tongue. I need to clarify something here. The clarification is this. It's found in those three little words. In the church. Very clear in verse 18. There is nothing wrong with speaking in tongues. I speak in tongues more than you all. However, in the church. The point I'm trying to make, and I think the point that Paul is trying to make is this. There is a context within which the prayer language is not appropriate. And prophecy is superior. I do not believe that Paul is saying that in general, tongues are inferior to prophecy. That in general, and in every circumstance, prophecy is always superior to a prayer language. Let's just say for a minute, I don't know for a minute, by the way, that you all even agree with me that there is a legitimate prayer language. But just humor me for a minute. And let's just say together, there is that which is a legitimate prayer language, and that is part of, and one of the aspects of a gift of tongues. The purpose of the gift of tongues, that is a prayer language, is to edify myself. Now, let's say I'm alone by myself. Thank you. I got stuck on the uh. Let's say I'm alone by myself, and I'm having my devotions, okay? And what I start to do, just by the work of the Spirit, I begin to prophesy. The Lord has said in Jesus' name. You know, my wife thinks I do that when I'm practicing my sermons. I'm walking back and forth, and I start talking to myself, and I'm prophesying. Isn't that a wonderful thing? Nobody's there, though. There's nobody hearing what I'm saying. It's profitless. And in that context, I dare say that the gift of prophecy is probably inferior to the gift of tongues if I were to just sit and worship the Lord in a gift of tongues that was worshiping him when I'm by myself. Do you understand? Okay. I don't believe that he is saying tongues in general are inferior to prophecy. I do believe he's saying in the church, when we come together, we come together for a certain purpose. And when we come together, Corinthians, what we come together for is to be edified and to be built. And you need to know something. That tongues don't do that to the body. It might happen when you're by yourself. But when we come together, I want to hear clear truth from God. that I can understand. Let me say it again. The gift of tongues is secondary. It is limited. And there are three reasons why it's limited. I've already said one. One, because it is limited in its ability to edify. Okay, let me catch you back to the outline if you're trying to follow this. Tongues are secondary. That's the principle I'm giving you. There's three reasons why it's secondary. One, because it's limited in its ability to edify. Why is it limited in its ability to edify? Here's why, verse 2, okay? Now we're kind of getting with the flow a little bit more. Here is why it's limited. Because when you speak in a tongue, you do not speak to men. What you're doing when you speak in a tongue is you speak to God. For no one understands when you're speaking to God and when you're speaking in a tongue, but in your spirit, you're speaking mysteries. And because you're speaking to God and you're not speaking to men, and you're speaking mysteries, nobody can understand it. But one who prophesies does a different thing. He is not speaking to God. He is speaking to men. And the result of his communication is that men are edified and exhorted and consoled. It isn't, again, that tongues is superior to prophecy all the time, but in the context of worship, it is superior. Because prophecy has the priority, because it speaks to men, speaks to them clearly, directly, the truth of God. To prophesy, what does that mean? I don't want to spend a lot of time here because we've spent time here before. But to prophesy is to simply do this, to speak forth clearly the truth of God, the truth about God. Prophesy, word, means simply to speak before. Not beforehand as in time, sometimes that's in view. but it means to stand before people and speak before the truth, the clear, delineated, understandable truth about God. Last Sunday, when we had communion, those of you who were in this service, one of the things we did, do you remember that? We opened it up in the middle of our worship time to people who had passages of scripture that would just honor the Lord. And it just seemed like it wasn't going to stop. one person after another would stand with the passage of scripture and speak forth clearly the word of God. It was words about God. They were words that I understood. They were words that I could comprehend. And they did things to me as I heard those words. And I sat in those pew because that, that pew, that bench there, one of the things that happened to me as I heard this truth about God that I could understand, I was edified, built up. I was exhorted. That simply means encouraged to good behavior, and I was consoled. It brings comfort in affliction. Teaching the word of God does that. Even our preaching and our teaching and our commitment to that. And I believe, by the way, that is why God has placed in the church people, apostles, prophets, this is right out of Ephesians 4, by the way, evangelists, pastor, teachers, who will dispense prophetically and clearly God's words to us. 1 Peter calls it the very oracles of God so that God's people can hear clearly what God says, what he thinks, how I should respond to him, and what direction I should go. We've been talking a lot about church growth. My whole introduction here this morning was our elders getting together and having some time to organize and talk about administration and all these kinds of things. and we need to organize. But one of the things that we need to constantly be aware of, and by the way, our elders acknowledge one thing, the problems we're having right now are good problems. It's because there's life here and there's excitement and there's growth. But one of the things you need to do with an organism is you've got to put it on a skeleton so it has some sort of form. The problem is that many times as Christians and as church growth kinds of people where we're trying to figure out how to make a church grow, we actually begin to believe that organizing will make it grow. You know, we can just get so many programs and make it happen somehow that way. We need to always remember, always remember, that there is only one scriptural guarantee that will bring people to growth. You know what it is? It is the teaching of the Word of God. Listen to this. 1 Peter 2.2 says this, Like newborn babes long for the pure milk of the Word, that by it they may what? Grow. Guaranteed. Guaranteed. Now that is not enough, by the way. We need relationships, and we need intimacy, and we need all those other things, but one thing guaranteed will even move us to relationships is hearing clearly what God says. It charts our course. It corrects our course. It deepens our walk. It makes us grow, and guess what? Tongues won't do that. That's why they're secondary. in the context of worship. Tongues are great in their place, but, verse 19, in the church, I'd rather hear five words that I can understand than 10,000 in a tongue, and I don't care how well you're praising. You may be giving thanks well enough, verse 17, but the other man is not edified. Now that concept kicks me into verse 4. Look at it. One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself. Two things I want you to note about that. The first thing is we could approach this and say, that verse reveals to us the nature of the prayer language. It is a dynamic that when I involve myself in it, it builds me up. It is something I do and it builds me up. That is a true thing. There is also something involved here that I think we also need to catch. And that is this. I think Paul, by saying that, is confronting the Corinthians. Why do you say that? The reason I say that is this. The only thing the Corinthians cared about at all anyway was edifying themselves. The only reason I would do anything is so I can get built up, so I can feel better about myself. And the reason I'm going to just blow off and do tongues whenever I feel like doing it, wherever I feel like doing it, is because the only reason I do anything is so I can feel better about myself. Look at verse 12. so also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek to abound for the edification of the church, of the body. Hear me. If the Corinthians had had that attitude in their minds and in their living, if their main concern as they gathered together was, what can I do to serve? What can I do to build? What can I do to edify? Tongues would never have been an issue in this church. Would never have been an issue. I don't think the Corinthian problem was a theological one. We have a theological problem with tongues. I don't think the Corinthians did. They had an attitude problem. Tongues edify me. When I go to church, the purpose is to edify me. No, it isn't to edify you. It's to edify the body. Therefore, when we come together, we are going to do whatever it takes to build the body. What does that? Well, one thing does that. We know. What? Prophecy. Speaking clear. Speaking clear. so we can respond appropriately. Let me pull this together. Giving you a barrage of things. Two things I want you to leave that section with, and that is this. One, tongues do have value. Tongues do have value. Where do you get that? Verse 15 and 16. They have value for singing. They have value in praying. There is value for praise. There is value for thanksgiving. Verse 2. it speaks to God it's valuable for that it's speaking to God mysteries and it's valuable for that it edifies myself it edifies an individual in fact in certain contexts when it does appear in the church if it is interpreted it can indeed edify the body but only when it's interpreted we're going to get into that when we deal with the procedure so I don't want to get in on that right now the problem in Corinth though is it was just happening like this and there was absolute chaos because everybody's going look at me look at me, I'm here to be edified, built up, on and on and on. There's another reason that tongues are secondary, and that is this. They are unintelligible. You can't understand them. Verse 6. But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what does it profit you? Unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or prophecy or teaching, simply meaning, unless I speak to you in a way that you can understand, it's not going to profit you. So I'm not going to bring my prayer language here. then he goes on and illustrates yet even lifeless things either flute, harp he compares it to a musical instrument that's played without distinction and tone so that you can't understand the melody he compares it to a bugle that's just blowing off steam and you can't respond to the bugle in terms of what it's trying to communicate and he's saying basically this it has no value there because you can't understand it now there's something that I want you to catch here the basic thing he's saying is you can't be edified by what you don't understand. You get that? You can't be edified by what you don't understand. Now, if you think about that, that is so obvious, it's almost stupid. I mean, you can't be edified or built up by something you don't understand. Well, thank you very much. That's beautiful. Would anybody actually think that? The fact is this, the Corinthians thought that. You see, remember they dragged everything, they drug everything in, drug, is that a word? They brought everything in from their old pagan culture, and one of the things they did in their pagan worship was they got ecstatic. And if I connect with a deity, I'll speak this ecstatic language, and that's all that really matters. And that's just wonderful. And I'll leave feeling like I had this really neat spiritual experience. And the reason I think Paul is saying this that seems to us so obvious, well, of course you can't be built up by something you don't understand. The Corinthians would come together, have this incredible frenzied worshipful experience, walk away going, boy, I'll tell you, the spirit really moved tonight. Just chaos, you know? It's just great. God, man, God really did something there. Paul's saying, don't be so sure. Don't be so sure that when people are blowing their trumpets off and shooting their mouths off and it's just chaos, you're walking around feeling like you got fed and you didn't get fed at all. And you may not know it, but you're spiritually malnourished. In fact, in verse 20, when he talks about, I don't want you to be children in your thinking, in your understanding, they were unbelievable babes in their thinking, in their understanding, especially when it came to this. I'm telling you this, Paul said, you have your ecstatic experience and you just go bananas, but according to verse 2, unless there's revelation, knowledge, prophecy, teaching, tongues don't profit. And verse 7, because it isn't known, that's why it doesn't profit. And verse 8, it prepares you for nothing. You might feel yummy in your tummy, but you're not really being prepared for anything. Let's look at it a little more closely. In verse 7, he compares it to an instrument that is not making a distinct sound. Okay, we had a piano player, Angie, played the piano today, and it was beautiful. And she makes, the essence of music is that there is a calculated, designed and thought through difference in tone and difference in rhythm so that when we play it, according to this disciplined way, melody comes out. And sometimes that music has different effects on you. Sometimes it's very soothing. Sometimes it's very stirring and it really inspires you. But the point is that music that is going to have any impact or any melody is distinct. There's a variation in tone. Angie plays the piano. She does it well. I got a five-year-old son who plays the piano too. Only it doesn't soothe you. It hurts. It hurts your ears when you hear him. Why? Because when he plays the piano, he sits in the same chair, he hits the same notes, but there is no distinction in the tones. It's bang, bang, bang. And it does nothing. It communicates nothing. That's his point. That's his point. And Corinthians, when you get together and you just decide to bring all that into the congregation, let it run amok, You might as well. It sounds to me like you're all just banging on a piano. And then you walk away going, boy, God really blessed. Get out of here. The bugle. The significance of the bugle. I know I'm really subtle when I come up with stuff like that. Anyway, Paul didn't like it. Verse 8, the bugle. The significance of the bugle is that it is among all of the instruments, the clearest and the loudest. And it could be heard above the din of battle. I mean, I don't know if you can see it, but maybe somebody bringing a violin into battle, you know. It wouldn't work, you know. They wouldn't hear a harp, you know. Riding on his horse, playing a harp to tell them what to do. It doesn't work, you know. Or a piano would be loud enough, but it couldn't carry it on a horse. It wouldn't work anyways. You know what a bugle's to do, okay. You know what a bugle's to do. Now, there is a purpose for a bugle. One, it's loud. But two, the purpose of the bugle is to give direction. It's to tell people where to go, what to do, when to do it, on and on and on. A bugle in an army would tell guys when to go to bed. They're really thick in the army. They need to be told when to go to bed. So it does that. It tells them when to wake up. It tells them when to put their armor on. It tells them when to go into battle and charge. It tells them when to retreat and move away. And I believe that's a wonderful picture of what the prophetic ministry does. That you have, that we have together, through the word of God, through the things that God is specifically telling you that you share with us, that are understandable and discernible and gives to this body what? Edification, exhortation, consolation all the time. And I believe what Paul is saying to them as we come to verse 9, he drops the hammer on them and says, So also you. I'm talking about you, Corinthians. You, when you come together, as far as I'm concerned, your worship sounds like an instrument that is so out of tune it can't be recognized, and a bugle that is so confused no one knows what to do. But they might all leave going, well, it wasn't that neat. No, it wasn't neat. Have you ever been in a worship like that? Some of you have, some of you haven't. Where the clear word of the Lord and the delineation of God's word couldn't be heard for the din of all the confusion that was happening. I don't know what your perspective is on that but I believe that scripture says that is not good verses 10 through 12 he basically says the same thing in a different way I can't expound on it I'll just read through it you'll pick up the same flow there are perhaps a great many kinds of languages in the world and no kind is without meaning if then I do not know the meaning of the language I shall be to the one who speaks a barbarian and the one who speaks will be a barbarian to me That word barbarian is again an onomatopoeic word. It's simply this. It would be if you come and do that in this midst, in our midst together, it would be as if you would just stand up and say, bar, bar, bar, bar. No value at all. So also, since you are, he wraps it up, zealous of spiritual gifts, seek to abound to the edification of the church. And you might have a prayer language and it might be legitimate, but you're not going to bring it here. Why? Because that doesn't edify. unless it's interpreted. And we're going to, again, get into that later. There's another reason why tongues is secondary when it comes to corporate worship. The third and last reason is because tongues can hinder, not help, corporate worship. Tongues will hinder, can hinder, not help, corporate worship, verses 14 through 19. Follow me here. Listen. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. Paul is not saying their tongues are lousy. Okay? Because my mind is unfruitful, that makes tongues bad. He's not saying that. I think what he's doing here is simply describing what it's like to participate in a prayer language. When I do that and participate in that, and by the way, I do that more than you all, verse 18. When I do that, here's the dynamic. My spirit prays. Spirit, there is pneuma. It is not Holy Spirit. It is my spirit. It is my emotions, my feelings. It is something that I deeply feel within me. It's real. It's powerful. It's wonderful. But when I speak in with my spirit, my mind is not fruitful. It's not like I'm thinking of something specific and I'm responding to specifically what it is that I'm thinking about. Because of the fact that that is the nature of my prayer language, what is the outcome then when I come to a corporate worship? Because of the fact that my mind isn't fruitful, I am not going to bring that. I'm going to bring a different kind of worship to the corporate experience. When I come corporately, verse 15, I am going to pray with my spirit just like I do when I'm doing my prayer language. I'm going to feel it. I'm going to enter into it. I'm going to worship the Lord. But when I'm corporate, I'm going to have my mind engaged too. I will pray with my spirit. I will pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit. and I'll have some of the same feelings as when I'm speaking in tongues by myself, and I will sing with my mind also. You do that all the time. Every time you worship, you do that. Verse 15. Verse 15, that's what you do. You sing a song. One of the things that happens is the information that is being communicated in the song, you understand. If you enter into worship, two things happen. First of all, I understand what it is that I'm saying. Jesus is Lord. Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy. Okay? Thou art worthy, thou art worthy. All of a sudden, not only does my mind understand that, but my spirit feels it. So I sing with my mind, understanding the words, but I sing with my spirit also. That's what that means. And the reason that's the way I'm going to worship in a corporate sense is because if I, verse 16, would come and bless in the spirit only, when my mind is unfruitful, something bad will happen. And that is this. The one who fills the place of the unlearned, that's what that word means, not ungifted, but unlearned, they won't be able to say amen at your giving of thanks since he does not know what you're saying. Sort that all out, Dave. To build each other up. If I come in and I do my singing or praying with my spirit, but my mind is unfruitful, you won't understand what I'm saying, therefore you can't enter into what I'm saying and say, yes, I agree with that. Amen is simply that, by the way. Amen is simply saying, I agree with that. I affirm that. Let it be. Right on, on and on. In fact, when I was a kid, I hated saying amen. It sounded too pious. So I used to always sit in the front row and go, right on. Right on. Anyways, forget it. But that's what it means. And what I'm doing is if I do that in a corporate sense, I'm just going to eliminate everybody and not give a rip about anybody else. And I'm missing the whole point of worship. Interesting side note. In Jewish synagogues, saying amen was a real priority. They really had a big thing about it. It was so pervasive that the guy who was doing the teaching in the synagogue, the rabbi, couldn't always get through his lesson. It might have been comparable to some churches, I suppose, where tongues is really going like crazy, and you can't hear the lesson for all the tongues going on. Well, in the Jewish synagogue, you couldn't hear the lesson for all the amening going on. There's a reason for that. Quotes from the rabbis, listen to this. He who says amen is greater than he who blesses. Okay? Listen to this. Whoever says amen, to him the gates of paradise are open. Okay? Here's where it gets more fun. Whoever says amen shortly, like amen, or amen, or not even say it, just kind of amen. If you say amen shortly, so shall your days be shortened. okay amen i'll tell you what okay okay it gets worse he who says amen distinctly and at length so shall his days be lengthened amen ready come on let's go amen all right jesus is lord amen alright you're going with me up there alright guess what if you don't understand the words that are being said Jesus is Lord you are forgiven you are a new creature in Christ all things are become new you won't be able to enter into that and say amen and worship is useless it hinders worship again there are places where interpretation can come and then it can edify. But even then, it's not as good as prophecy because it's clear and understandable. Verse 18 and 19 just sums it up. Just sums it up. I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all. I don't think anything could be more clear that he did. However, in the church, I desire to speak five words with my mind that I may give instruction to others that would do what? Edify them, exhort them, console them, rather than 10,000 words. And by the way, the word 10,000 is bigger than 10,000. That's the biggest word they could come up with in the Greek, myrioi. And myrioi, it's 10,000. Our word would be a zillion, trillion, billion, million. However many that is. That's the ratio. It's not 5 to 10,000. Rather than 10,000 words in a tongue. I've machine-gunned you down with all this information. But I want to close with verse 20. And this is really going to be the beginning of our next week of study in this passage. But just hear this. Brethren, Corinthians, Opendorians, whatever. Don't be children in your thinking. Don't be children in your thinking. Yet an evil be babes. I want you to notice something. When he talks about children and babes, there's a distinction. A child is older than a babe. When it comes to evil, I want you to be like a little baby. What is a baby like when it comes to malice? They don't know about it. They don't even, I mean, a little baby doesn't know how to be mean. They don't know how. They don't know how to rip somebody else up. They don't know how to be evil. They're incapable of it. But in your thinking, be mature. You know why that is an unbelievably heavy hammer on the Corinthians? It's real easy, because that's exactly where they were. When it came to their thinking, they were babes. They were babes. Let's just have ecstatic experience. Let's just go off. When it came to dealing with the word of God and understanding what it meant and doing the work it takes to understand the deep truths of God, they didn't have time for that. When it came to evil, they weren't babes. They graduated at the top of their class. Immorality. Suing one another. Getting drunk at communion feasts. I just leave you with that. Where are you with that? In your thinking. Are you a child? Or are you mature and evil? Are you a babe? Innocent? Or is that where you really excel? We're going to pick up on that next time we get together. Let's pray. Father, I thank you for your word. I thank you for how, when we take the time to go through it and study it, things just begin to come clear to us. and balance is found and health is found. But Lord, as we think of what was really on Paul's mind and heart as he was confronting these folks, we need to bring ourselves under the same confrontation as he said, I would that you were not children in your thinking, but mature, and I would that you were babes when it comes to evil. I pray, God, that as we examine our hearts, that that would indeed be true of us. And I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. you
