And great fear came over the whole church, and over all who heard of these things. At the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders were taking place among the people, and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico, but none of the rest dared to associate with them. However, the people held them in high esteem, and all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number. But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, And the blood of Jesus, his son, cleanses us from all sin. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. A great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things, words that you don't usually associate with preparing yourself for the table, which is what we're doing today. Let's ask the Spirit to help us prepare. God we know by your spirit you are here We would like capacity to know it and sense it To enter into it, to believe it To be affected by it We're going to hear words, we're going to sing songs Good words I think and songs as well But your spirit needs to give life to all of it For any of it to have life And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come into these words, into this time as we gather as a faith community around this table and cross and you. Pray it in your name. Amen. Last week, if you were here, I'm pretty sure you remember that in response to this strange and disturbing story in Acts chapter 5 of Ananias and Sapphira, who because of their pretense, their hiding and pretending, their posturing and posing, their shifting of the feet, the winking of the eye, their lying, we call it spin, they breathed their last because of that. And because they did, it says in verse 11, that a great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard these things, causing many, if you remember this from last week, to run, to get away, to create some distance between themselves and this growing but kind of crazy group of people who, according to verse 12 of Acts 5, had begun to gather at Solomon's portico with ever-increasing numbers, at least until now, because now they were being scared off. At least some of them were. Actually, many of them were such that none of them, at least none of them, who were being scared off dared to even associate themselves with this crazy group of people who were gathering at Solomon's portico. I'm not going anywhere near that place. One wrong move, you're dead. So it was just the strangest thing. We noted last week when the very same fear that predictably drove some people away, the very same fear was drawing other people in. Indeed, all the more. It says in verse 14, the text that Peggy just read, all the more people were believing in the Lord. Multitudes, in fact, of men and women were constantly being added to their number, which raised for us this obvious question. We kind of pressed into it a little bit last week. Why? And what? Seriously, what was it that they saw, that they sensed? What was it that they feared that drove many of them away but drew many others in? Because everybody in Jerusalem, when this event happened, was looking at the same thing. They were all looking at Ananias and Sapphira dead. But while some, in looking at not just them dead, but this whole situation, while some of them, in looking at that, could only see death, that stirred up fear that made you want to run, others, looking at the same thing, saw in this life, generating hope that made them want to join. Why? The hope. In this scenario, well, we speculated that the hope was maybe, just maybe, the realization among some of them that there actually could be somewhere a community of people, like a family or a church, like maybe even this strange group of people who are gathering at Solomon's Portico, where the people in it actually, a weird thought, tell the truth. And if they don't, it turns the water blue. Remember that? Like when you go on vacation and the kids jump in the pool and keep them from, you know, whatever. You tell them there is this chemical in the pool. And if you do, you know, whatever, pee in the pool, I can say pee. I've been here 33 years. I'm staying. You know, Anyway, it turns the water blue. What that means is you're busted, so don't be pointing your finger at anybody else. And that kind of dynamic is a real disgusting illustration, but it illustrates because some people, if they knew that, the water would turn blue if they would run. A great fear came upon all those little kids, and they got out of the pool, and others would go, I'm getting in that pool. It's finally saved. In fact, we speculated a little bit What would you feel like? Well, would you go to a church like that? Like this Acts chapter 5 church Where the presence and the power of God And that's what was going on here Was so thick and so real That even the slightest bit of hiding and denying And posing and pretending The slightest bit of shiftiness and slipperiness Lying, we call it spin just gets blown up on the spot. It's exposed. Pow. Well, that would stir up a great fear, causing some to run, but it would cause others to come. So while some are jumping out of the pool, in Acts chapter 5, others are jumping in because of fear. They're jumping in because of fear, but it was a different kind of fear this time because now the fear, and this was the draw to this first century community of believers in Jesus. The fear they had was of ever becoming the kind of people who could get good at lying and denying, hiding and pretending, who could hide and deny and get away with it, but you don't get away with it. You just think you do, and as you think you do, because it doesn't turn the water blue every time you get away with it, and as you get away with it and you do learn to hide, you get really good at it. So a fear came upon some of them of ever getting good. It's shifting the feet, swinking the eye, pointing the finger, because you can get good at it. But as you do, and you know it's true, we're all in this together, As you do get shiftier and shiftier and slipperier and slipperier, things inside begin to die. Just as surely as Ananias and Sapphira died physically, there is more than one way to be alive. There's more than one way to be dead. There's more than one way to be dying. And things inside, when we learn to hide, begin to die. And there are significant things. Turns out, things like character and integrity, authenticity, and transparency, and when things like that begin to die, people's ability to trust us dies. And when things like that begin to die, relationships die. Just as sure as Ananias and Sapphira died, when we learn to hide, people lose their ability to trust us, relationships die. Marriages crumble. Families split. Churches explode. They breathe their last, just like Ananias and Sapphira. So the word of the day last week was this, so be afraid. Be very afraid of ever getting good at this because you can. Indeed, so good at this can we become that we can actually get to the place where we deceive ourselves, where we can't see ourselves, which is a disturbing thought if you think about it, even a little bit, actually. Because if I were to suspect, for instance, that you were trying to deceive me, in the suspecting it, I would be on guard around you and be careful around you, not trust you, might even find ways to avoid you, thereby being protected from you. But self-deception brings with it no such protection like that because self-deception is something you're doing to your, you know, self. Cornelius Plantinga describes this self-deception thing this way when he says that self-deception is the shadowy phenomenon by which we pull the wool over some part of our own psyche. We put a move on ourselves because we can learn to deny, to suppress, and to minimize what we know to be true. And with enough practice, asserting, adorning, and elevating what we know to be false, we can prettify ugly realities and sell ourselves the prettified versions. We know the truth, and yet we do not know the truth because we persuade ourselves of its opposite. So first, we deceive ourselves, and then we convince ourselves that we are not deceiving ourselves. Indeed, we can actually forget that certain things are wrong and that we have done them or that we are doing them. Don't believe it? He rhetorically asks and then answers. Then why do alcoholics and drug addicts typically go through years of denial before they see what they're doing? And why is the revelation of incest an astonishment to people who are living right in the middle of it? And why do abusive husbands offer minimizing and euphemistic accounts of the beatings, both physical and emotional, that they administer? And why do battered wives sometimes, not always, but sometimes accept and sometimes even repeat these false accounts? Here's why. Because we've gotten good at hiding and denying it, posturing and pretending, at shifting the feet, at winking the eye and pointing the finger. It's not me, it's you. It's not here, it's there. In other words, to borrow the language of the Apostle John, we've learned to live in the dark. And the reason we've learned to live in the dark is because we love it there in the dark. And the reason we love it there in the dark, according to John, in the third chapter of his gospel, is actually quite simple. This isn't rocket science. It's because our deeds are evil. I don't know how straight he is. It's because you're doing things you are ashamed of or want to hide. It's because your deeds are evil. It's not that complicated. John 3.19 says it this way. People love the darkness rather than the light because their deeds are evil. It's really very simple. And the darkness just provides this incredibly convenient place to hide the evil deeds, to not look at them, to not have to acknowledge them, to not have to deal with them. And you know this is true because if you hide them well enough, whatever they are, and if you hide these things long enough, you can hide them even from yourself. self. Daniel Goleman, in a book that he wrote some time ago in titled Vital Lies and Simple Truths, tells a story of John Dean, a name from the past. Some of you remember him as being part of Nixon's, President Nixon's cabinet and a central figure of the Watergate scandal years ago. Dean's testimony before the Senate Watergate committee was lengthy, articulate, and remarkably detailed, Goldman says in his book. Indeed, he amazed committee members with his ability to remember precisely who said what, to remember it verbatim, and to do this after many intervening months. But when the Watergate tapes were discovered and played for the committee, Dean's testimony turned out to be mostly wishful memory. Like many of us, Dean had remembered a lot of stuff that hadn't actually happened. Not surprisingly, most of his mistakes and distortions of recall had the effect of placing him in a much more favorable light than the one in which he actually stood. His testimony turned out to have described not the critical presidential meetings themselves, but Dean's fantasy of those meetings, the way he dreamed they went, And most of this suggested Goldman was kind of at an unconscious or subconscious level. And the way he was able to do that was simply that he had learned to live in the dark, to hide the truth even from himself. He had deceived himself. But here's the problem. particularly, and maybe this isn't a problem for anybody else, but it's particularly a problem for those of us who are or want to be followers of Jesus. And here's the problem. 1 John 1.5, God is light. It's a problem if you're trying to hide. God is light, and in him, and whatever it is that is in him is what you can expect from him, and in him there is no darkness at all. he's like, so it's going to be really hard to hide here. There's no pretense here, no double talk, no misdirection, no blowing smoke. Last week, that was no BS at all, which actually creates another problem, 1 John 1.6. And the problem in verse John 1.6, coming off verse John 1.5, is this, that if we say we have fellowship with him, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all followers of Jesus. If we say we have fellowship with this God who actually is light, and yet we walk in darkness, our way of life is to hide and deny. And by the way, the darkness isn't sin. It is what I just said, this hiding and denying of our sin, keeping it in the dark that we've gotten good at after years of practice. We lie. Verse 6. And what we're lying about is that we're actually having fellowship with this God who is light because it's not possible to be in fellowship with this God who is light, who kind of exposes everything. It's kind of hard to be in fellowship with that ultimate reality and be walking in darkness, be trying to hide at the same time. And again, the darkness of which he speaks isn't sin. It's this tendency that all of us have to hide our sin. And whatever else it is, we're trying to hide in the dark by posing and pretending and posturing, by shifting the feet, by winking the eye, by pointing the finger, we lie. So here we have this man, and here we have this woman, and here they are at church this morning. Every Sunday, they're here, and I'm here, And you are too, singing songs and raising arms and listening to sermons and nodding heads. This is good. Or not. But living in the dark sometimes are we. Absolutely blind sometimes are we to how controlling we are and how angry we are and arrogant as well. How petty and unforgiving. will never let her off that hook we are and how those things, blind to how those things damage even people that we really love because, I don't know, I think we've all gotten pretty good at hiding and denying, at posing and pretending, at shifting the feet, pointing the finger. It's not me, it's you. It's not here, it's there. which brings me finally to the question that might now bring us to the table and some of us to this cross and others of us to people for prayer. The question is this. Given that we're kind of all in this together, what might give us the courage and maybe the capacity to, I don't know, come out of hiding, to quit pretending and posing and denying and pointing at everybody else. Well, I don't know for sure, because if we've been doing this a while, what that means is there's a lot to protect. Some of you can feel it. If you've been doing that a while, there's a lot to protect, So there's a lot of fear because there's a lot at stake. If people knew this or I admitted that, I might actually not look bad, but if I admit that, I might lose control. So what might give people the courage to come out? Actually, as I thought about this, often what I see working in me and, you know, friends of mine, the world is pain. It's kind of one of the things that works. Loss, some kind of failure, sometimes is what gives us, it's not necessarily the courage. It's just like we got caught, and this veneer I was presenting got torn down, and there I am. It's like Peter. Remember Peter? It's a great story, because he's the guy who promised he never would. I will not deny you. Everyone else will fall away but not me, and then he did fall away, And this big, I will not guy got exposed. You can't. And Paul, the Apostle Paul, on the road to Damascus, not so much the veneer got stripped away. It was like it was kind of an intervention. He wasn't looking for God. God just said, pow, here I am. And sometimes it happens that way. And that's grace too. But what if, what if it didn't have to be you getting knocked off your horse? What if it didn't have to be some monumental failure? What if just sitting here, nobody's going to force anything out of you? What if, however, there really was grace? Like right here, right now, for whatever it is you're trying to hide and deny, would it make it any easier to bring out into the light where God is? Would it make it any easier to bring out into the light what we hide in the dark if you knew that when you brought it out, there would be grace? Would it make it any easier to pray the prayer of David? I love this prayer relative to this who in Psalm 139 says this, Search me. Oh, God, maybe even as you sit here preparing for the table, it would be a good prayer. Lord, let me just open myself up and let your light come in and show me. Search me and know me, my anxious thoughts. Try me and see. Help me to see what I can't see because I've been hiding so long. I can't see it anymore. Help me to see if there be any wicked way in me because I can't see. So Holy Spirit, come in now. Well, the good news is this. that at this table and at this cross, there is the grace we need. Forgiveness, too. Indeed, there is cleansing. Wouldn't that feel good? To be clean. Verse John 1-9. Just a few verses after all this living in the light stuff. But, he says, you've been hiding, I know. But, he says, verse John 1-9, And if we confess, if we, another way to say that is, come out of hiding and quit denying and start confessing, yeah, it's me. He, that is Jesus, is faithful and just to forgive us our sin and to cleanse us from all that stuff and all of that is waiting for you here. and here.
