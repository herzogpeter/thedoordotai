Our scripture reading today is from Genesis chapters 2 and 3. Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and he fashioned the woman from the side of the man, and they were both naked and unashamed. The serpent said to the woman, God knows that in the day you eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God. When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate and she gave also to her husband with her and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings. And also Philippians 2, 5 through 8. Have this disposition in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although he was in very nature God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but instead emptied himself, taking the form of a bondservant and being made in the likeness of men. He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. I'm with you on that one, Nina. Yeah, you know, Dave, I see that you're sitting here today. If you want to come up and give the sermon now instead of me, that would, whew, made a way. That actually will be part of the message this morning. I do want to start by saying Merry Christmas, everyone. I didn't grow up with the church calendar, and so I had no idea that Christmas wasn't just a day, it actually is a whole season that extends beyond the day of Christmas to something called Epiphany, and I don't know what that is yet. I'm going to Wikipedia that when I get home. and try to sort that piece out. But it was good news that it's still Christmas because now we can sort of just rest in the realities of Emmanuel and God with us. Because he's still here. It wasn't just a day. It wasn't just leading up to a day. And so as we focus on the calendar flipping here in just a couple of days into 2015, it's with that in my mind of God with us continuing to walk out this journey into the unknown into which we head, and that will be the focus of the sermon today. So with that, let's go ahead and pray as we begin, and we'll get started. God, for your voice, not just here this morning or even in this calendar year, but in each day of the year ahead, I pray that your voice would be sticky in our lives, that we come what may, may tune the ears of our heart to that voice to continue to walk this whole thing out, whatever shape and way that is to look. I ask these things in your Son's name and by the power of your Spirit. Amen. Well, as I've said in just a few short days, and you know as well, the calendar will close on 2014 and the sun will rise on 2015. And for some of us, that can be a time in which we decide to go ahead and make some intentional resolutions in the year moving forward. I had some fun with my kids this past week. It was, I think, Tuesday afternoon. And unprompted by me, as they're sitting around having their afternoon tea time where they get some sweets and some tea and hang out and just chat together as a family, they were recapping their resolutions for the year ahead. And my daughter Anna gave us the obligatory, well, for 2015, I am going to keep my room clean. And then seven hours later, as I was doing her bedtime, and she's lugging her laundry basket around her room with this look of discouragement on her face, she said, yeah, I don't know how long that one's actually going to last. Which I resonated with, because I don't know if you're resolution person. There's nothing wrong with them, but I know I am not, mostly because I forget after about 15 minutes of the resolutions that I made in that moment, though my seven-year-old Abby gave me some degree of hope this last time as she was sitting around the table. And I don't think she quite understands the spirit of the resolution, but I was grateful for her nonetheless because with all the earnestness she could muster, she looked at her brothers and sisters and said, no matter what else happens in 2015, I am going to eat more chocolate. That's the spirit right there of a resolution, right? That one I can keep. So it's fun listening to them. And again, maybe you are, I'm not. But as I reflected on some of that moving forward, I realized that even though I don't have a number of resolutions I carry into a year, I do actually have a number of assumptions that I sort of just carry with me in daily life about how the year ahead is going to look. And they're assumptions I don't really reflect on, I don't really think about. They're with me as the alarm clock goes off, they're with me as I go to bed at night, and again, they're just sort of part of how I do my day, assuming how the future is going to unfold, even in just mundane and routine ways. And so some of those assumptions for me is maybe wrongly, but I assume I'm going to have a job next year. I do some teaching at Bethel and Northwestern, and the classes schedule is already all set up for the year ahead, and the syllabi have been written. Many of these classes I've taught for about 10 years or so, including human sexuality, which, as you'd imagine, there's no prof in the five-state area that wants to touch that subject, and so I feel like I'll have that one until I die. so the job is there I assume with our five kiddos that there's just going to be certain dimensions to our life together including I'm sure as many of you know driving driving driving driving driving getting in the car driving to soccer and to dance and to piano and driving we had a threshold moment this year where my oldest child my son Caleb is turning he's already turned 2015. So this is the year of the driver's license, and if he wants to drive, he can drive. We'll have parties, we'll play games, we'll break up squabbles, we'll sing songs. I know we're hitting Disney World this year in March. We already have our plans made to hit Cinderella's Castle for a lovely brunch with the princesses. I can't wait to sit in that space with my kids. Well, Not me. I'm happily married. My kids with the princesses will have a great time, and the magic will all start again, and I'll be recalled back to my childhood. I know Disney psychologically manipulates me from the moment I walk in the door, right? But I'm more than happy to let them. But it's all just assumed. I kind of know how it's going to work. I'll be at the grocery store every day trying to feed these five kids. I will hopefully, Hallie and I, will finish our seven seasons of Doctor Who on Netflix this year. I'll probably play some golf with my best friend of 20-some-odd years. He has five children as well. And we get up in the morning before the sun rises about once a week and just share that time together on the golf course. I assume that'll continue. If I'm lucky, and now this picture will be up on the screen, if I'm lucky for my birthday, I will get a giant ho-ho made for me. And this isn't one of those synthetic varieties at the convenience store that stays in your system longer than gum, right? I mean, this is the real deal. This is Ghirardelli chocolate and organic whipping cream threaded all the way through. And Julia asked me last night, can I have a bite of that? And I said, no. Probably see the new Star Wars movie. Try to exercise at least four times next year. should be double in last year so it's going to be a good year ahead eat as many nachos as possible i figure washington will be gridlocked the vikings twins and wolves won't win 100 games combined actually sat and did the math i thought is that true oh that actually is true silicon valley will ultimately i'm sure try to convince us all of some new technology that we're currently doing fine without, but will suddenly become a must-have item. It'll be an iPhone number, I'm not sure what, and a week later, Samsung will copy it. The idea here, obviously, is if I just sit back for a moment, and maybe you're like this too, you just have a series of assumptions. Just about the day, about the week, about the year, things I don't reflect on, things I don't really think much about. But I took a little time this last week, and if I was to rewind the clock just a bit and go back maybe 365 days, standing now not on the dawn of 2015, but on the dawn of 2014, and just went back, if I could somehow climb into my head, climb into my heart about what life was like back then, it's quite likely that I, and probably you, had a series of assumptions that we carried walking into 2014. But as I thought about that, this just now with the perspective of 365 days having passed, made me wonder, do I really, or do we really see that which is coming? Do we really know what's going to happen in the year ahead, regardless of our assumptions? Again, I don't know about you, but I did not predict the polar vortex heading into May or June. I didn't even know what a polar vortex was last year. The staggering rise of ISIS and the brutality of their regime in the Middle East was predicted by very few. And now we have a whole group trying to reestablish a caliphate from the 8th century sort of thing to form a base there. We don't even see that coming. The United States normalizing relationships with Cuba. Who saw that one coming? Paying $2.10 a gallon at the pump. The experts even at Goldman Sachs never saw that one coming, but of course, based on their prediction of oil prices going to a zillion, I went ahead and got a hybrid car this past year, and I thought it's going to be great because, you know, it's a little extra money on the front end, but within a couple years it'll be paid all off because gas is going to be $1,000 a gallon, and all you poor saps with gas engines. Ha! And now my investment, I think I recovered in like 2050. Didn't see that coming. One of my favorite ones from this past year was North Korea accused of getting hacked into Sony, creating a near constitutional crisis in the United States all around a movie of the same genre of road trip or dumb and dumber. Who saw that one coming? You did. Oh, good. See, yes. Russia nearly collapsing, lone wolves in Canada and Australia. There's little that we see coming in world events. Who knows what 2015 is going to hold? Of course, it's true of our own lives as well, not just out there with the headlines, but as it gets closer to home, we could probably sit here for an hour and fill up the notepads on our phones with things that happened in our own lives that at least heading into 2014, we never saw coming. How many of us have stories from our jobs this past year, both good and bad, that we didn't see? Something maybe about an opportunity that we had or a position that opened up to us or a promotion that we got. It was good news, we just didn't see it coming or on the flip side, no longer having that job. A job maybe of many years. With retirement on the way, certainty ahead in just a couple more years and it's time to cash in and now it's gone. We're sitting in a job we were once satisfied with, but suddenly something has changed inter departmental or within the personal relationships and it's no longer the same to be there and feeling kind of stuck in a job now that just a year ago felt great. Or just unanticipated things with our friendships, good and hard, maybe gaining some friends or losing some friends, being in a difficult spot with some of our friends that used to be our best friends, or finding some new people to walk out the journey with and being grateful for that, never saw that coming. Can't believe that my marriage is in this spot, we might say, or that it ended all together. I didn't see that coming in 2014. Mistakes that we never thought we would make, triumphs we never thought possible, difficulties and turmoils that were always the stories of somebody else. And in 2014, for some of us, they became our story. Or how about the health of us or those around us? Did we anticipate having that diagnosis breathed over us or of someone close to us? Just by the sheer number of people in here, I'm guessing that's part of the story. I have walked those dark valleys as well of the diagnoses you never thought would come. You don't anticipate those things. The final goodbye is not something that is part of my assumptive world as I head into the future. Never saw that coming maybe with the health of my child. So many things happen in the course of a year that if we just sat back again, we could fill the notepads of our phones with any number of things. And all of which then for me this past week, as I thought about it a bit, it revealed something, obviously something that is true of all of our lives. And that is that the future, whatever else it is, is actually one large void of uncertainty, isn't it? We don't really know what's going to happen in the year ahead. And we make our plans and have my assumptions and possibly even an intentional resolution to shape and exert control over the future. This year, here's my resolution. I'm going to get ahead of the future, right? I'm going to make sure this happens and this happens and this happens and all the while trying to stay one step ahead of that which is coming, and yet I don't know what is coming. The future is unknown for all of us. And that prompted a question to me this past week, and it was a difficult question on a number of levels, but it was a question that I think had to be asked, and the question sounds something like this. So if that's true, as we stand on the dawn of 2015, that we really don't know what's going to happen in the year ahead, how in the world do we walk into the perpetual unknown? How in the world do we walk into the perpetual unknown? What posture could we take? The posture I tend to take when that happens and I get filled with anxiety around it is, as I've said, I try to get one step ahead of that future by trying to exert some control over that to shape it according to something that will kind of create this little bubble of illusion around me that I really have control now and so I can rest. Whether it's financial, whether it's manipulating a relationship just a little bit, whatever it is, I'm going to get ahead of that. Is there a different way to walk? How do we walk into the perpetual unknown? What I realized with that too, as I thought about that is it obviously isn't just a question for us here this morning, standing on the dawn of 2015. It actually, as my mind started hearkening back to the ancestors of our faith and to those people of the text about whom we read, this actually was not just a question for us. It's an all-timer kind of question. For the people of the text, we're always walking in this way, and I don't think about that much, and I like to read about their stories, about who they are, and I love the VeggieTale videos about all of them, and I love Bob the Tomatoes, a little moral sort of thing that he says with Larry the Cucumber at the end, and just creating some nice little kitschy thing out of that. Fun to watch, I don't want to walk like them. I don't want to be Abraham or Sarah, walking, leaving all that was comfortable behind and walking into the unknown. Rather, read about it. I don't want to be Esther and go stand in front of a king saying, if I perish, I perish, but I know this is how I have to walk. I don't really want to be three young men standing in front of a fiery furnace and saying, even if our God doesn't help us, we still will bow to him. I don't want to get chucked into a lion's den. I don't want to be Mary saying, let it be done unto me as you have said. I don't want to be Paul getting on a horse and riding into the unknown of a Gentile world. I'd rather just stay one step ahead, exert some control. I can manage this future, relieve the anxiety. So how do we walk in the perpetual unknown? Because we know how well it works when we try to control and exert that force. There's any number of the stories of the text that we could look into that I just mentioned. But in trying to answer that question about how to walk into the unknown, there was two stories actually that came into my mind. It was the two great stories of the gardens in our text. The first story is the Garden of Eden. We read a piece of that, Nina did, just earlier. And the second is the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus was. And my hope is that in looking at the two great garden stories of the text, we can get a little clue about how it is that at least as the calendar flips forward into 2015, we can sort out a way to walk that is maybe different than trying to exert that control in getting one step ahead of the future. So with that, I'll try to walk through at least a little bit more extended in the story of the Garden of Eden to form a contrast with the Garden of Gethsemane holding these two gardens up against one another. So starting first with the Garden of Eden, there's three parts of the story that were embedded in what Nina read. And the first part might not seem obvious about why we have to talk about this phrase that's here, but it's a very compelling phrase that describes the form of the man and the woman at the end of the creation narrative. And that phrase is this phrase, naked and unashamed. Now, at first glance, that is the kind of phrase that is one of those weird Bible phrases that you think, why in the world is that in the text? Why do we need that one? What would be, what's going on in the author's mind? Why would we need to understand this piece of it? Is it just that these, we need to get a sense that they were so naive or something that they didn't even know they were wearing any clothes? Is it for Michelangelo in the Sistine chapel, how do we understand this phrase? It's actually a critical phrase for walking into the unknown, but I don't necessarily understand it because, again, the analogy that goes into my mind when I hear this phrase, naked and unashamed, is that of a young child when they're maybe taking a tub, right? And they suddenly go, and they pop out of the tub and they go streaking around the house wearing nothing but a smile. Maybe you've seen that. I mean, I have five children and I won't embarrass them. But yeah, well, they all did it. And they're just, they're standing there in their full God-created glory wearing nothing but a smile. Why would we need to know that they were standing naked and unashamed? But a few years ago, as that was sort of the picture in my mind's eye, there was an Old Testament scholar that I know that really brought out the beauty and the wonder of this phrase. For within this phrase, It's not necessarily just referring to a physical nakedness, though it is that, but it's primarily focusing on something different. For the phrase in the Hebrew, and it's going to be up on the screen here, it literally is rendered this, that they were fully open and vulnerable to the power of God and to one another and acting wisely. Fully open to the power of God and vulnerable and acting wisely. meaning among other things that they stood there without any illusion about who they are and whose they are and what was in front of them. They were just fully themselves as God had created them, fully bearing his image, male and female, and just being who they are, letting God's power flow through them in that space, which was critical for their future. Because if you remember the command that God gave to them at the end of Genesis 1 was to go and to rule over his ever-unfolding creation. As the trees do what they're going to do, and the animals do what they're going to do, and the whole universe is going to do what it does according to my plan, I give you the full power and authority to rule over that. But the way to do that is to stand with me, naked and unashamed, fully open to my power, because this is my creation, and you're going to need me to let this whole thing run its course the way it's meant to. And that's what they did. Fully open posture to God. That's the first part. Second part, however, of course, is that the page turns to chapter 3. And the story takes a significant turn for the worse. For we read here that they bite into the fruit of the great illusion. It's the greatest illusion of all time, and it still is present here this morning as it was back then. For the serpent came and said, Hey, you two, here's the thing. You don't have to be fully open to the power of God. You just bite of this fruit of the knowledge of good and evil yourself. And the core of the temptation was, and you can be like God. You can do this whole thing yourself. You can walk it out. You can take control. You can grasp after that which is God's future and just cut them out of the mix. Look at the wonder of your creation. Look at how beautiful you are. You can do that. And it's described that this fruit, as the serpent began to wind this illusion in front of them about what this fruit was, it says these really interesting words that it was something that was delightful for the eye. And what's interesting, the Garden of Eden is simply the garden of delight. They were living in the midst of the delight for which they were meant, and suddenly the illusion wound itself in front of them. And no, that's delight. Taking control, that is delight. And it said that, and it's possible to make one wise with this fruit. They already had the wisdom they needed. They said, no, that's for me. And of course, they take a bite of that fruit, and this great illusion begins to wind its way through them. And what's the first thing that happens after they take a bite of that fruit? They realize that they were what? Naked. Now maybe that word makes a bit more sense when we understand what's in that very passage. They realize that they're open. They realize that they're vulnerable. They realize that, whoa, wait a second. I want to be like God. You want to be like God. There is a God of heaven. We're all wanting to be like God. And instead of being in this lovely companionship of mutual power under kind of relationship where we're with one another, fully open and vulnerable in love, the reality is, is there can be only one God. And so my companion with whom I'm walking is now going to become my competitor. And I can't control you for sure. My way I am going to control you is I'm going to hide from you. So it says they realized they were naked and they put up the fig leaves and said, no longer am I taking this posture. This is about me and about walking forward in a way where I will govern that future. The illusion is a delusion and a lie. And they change the posture. That's part two of that story. Which brings us to the final part. And we didn't read it from the text yet, but it's the part where God comes down into the garden. And he takes his daily stroll in Eden. And as he's walking about, he suddenly realizes that something is amiss. The start of something is maybe taking shape that doesn't smell like the garden is how it's supposed to smell. It doesn't look how it's supposed to look. Something is amiss. And he realizes that the two are hiding from him, not because they found some great place to finally hide from God and the eternal hide and seek of the garden, right? They finally found that shrub to get behind that God couldn't find them. He says, you're hiding. Where are you? Meaning that the one that I created fully opened to me that I could see. I can't see you anymore. Where are you? And of course, this whole story gets told. They explain what happened. And then God issues these judgments. There's four of them, right? There is the increasing pain in childbirth. There is that the land is going to be more difficult to toil. That there is going to be this power over thing. I'll explain more in a second in their relationship. And that death is introduced. and I don't know if you've heard that story you probably have from Genesis 3 but I know for me growing up when I heard this story and thinking about the scenario there was this sense in which that as God was taking his stroll through the garden that when he realized that something was slightly amiss that he sort of just the temperature rose and God kind of blew his stack in that moment you know sort of he would be a lousy school teacher right because he's not creating logical consequences at all for what happened. More like me and the free association discipline that I often do during the week, right? I mean, I noticed something in my kids that's gone amok, and so just whatever is the first thing to come to my mind is what I issue, the pronouncement for what their life is going to be like moving forward. And so God was like that. He gets mad for a moment, and he says, well, childbirth is going to hurt, and the land is going to stink, and your relationships are going to fail and you're all going to die. Ha! Then he sort of just, you know, tools back to heaven and says, I finally showed them, right? Well, like the zillions of things from the text that I probably don't have great and accurate pictures around. I don't think that God is some sort of loose canon. Maybe I can just have that assumption. I can maybe just assume for a moment that God is even being redemptive in these moments. for the first thing to notice as we walk through this idea of what's going on is it's helpful to know that God is not declaring something as much as he is just simply predicting something in the Hebrew language when you read this stuff it is simply God just saying oh dear you want to take control of this whole thing you can you can but my creation is going to go haywire as you do the way in which I meant for things to be is going to go utterly amok and haywire oh no I need to tell you a little bit about what the future is going to be like I need to explain to you about how it's going to be like to live but even in the midst of that there is this little whiff of redemptive possibility as we look through each of those four so let me just do that briefly looking through these four judgments as they were of God, starting first with this increased pain in childbirth. And again, we could teach through this passage for hours, but from the Hebrew, it's literally rendered that with physical exhaustion and emotional anguish, you will now bring forth children. Meaning that childbearing will not be easy, but more important than any physicality of it, that the bringing forth of children will be emotionally exhausting because you're bringing them forth into a now broken world. And how many parents know the anguish of sending our children into a world with the headlines about which we read today? I was talking with Hallie this last week and she said, you know, Peter, that's the thing that keeps me up at night. The future of our children, where are they headed in a world where thousands and millions and even billions of us are all, you know, individually trying to get ahead of that future and controlling it and shaping it for our own desires. And we send our children into that and we read the headlines at how much pain is possible. With emotional anguish, you will now bring children into this world because creation has gone haywire. And I don't know about you, but as I think about that fact, there's this little whiff of redemptive possibility. And that redemptive possibility is that as I'm walking out the great illusion as well, in ways in which I don't always know about how I'm trying to control and shape, when I see the future ahead for my children, what does it do? It drives me to my knees. And it reminds me that this is not about my capacity to control. But if God isn't real and his power doesn't really move, there is no hope. I see, at least for a little whisper, with clarity, who I am and who God is again. it's the same thing with toil in the land i don't know how many of you grew up on a farm anybody grew up on a farm in here so you know you know that you know the crops just come every year without fail and no trouble right the weather and the pests oh they're always easily dealt with the reality is is that all of us are dependent upon our food for our livelihood you know the Israelites worshiped Baal so often, not because there were theological dunderheads. Oh, I just like that statue. I think I'll worship that one. It's because Baal was the god of fertility in that culture. And so worried were they about their future, that they would worship anything and even take control of who they would worship in order to make sure they had provided for. And into the midst of that is this little redemptive whisper, give me this day, God, my daily bread. Remind me of who I am and whose I am in a posture of just being open to you for the future. One of the most obvious things I could say this morning, number three, is that in our relationships, how many of you have had wild success trying to be like God and controlling the other people in your life? Worked out really well, right? It's funny how people kind of squirt this direction and squirt this direction. We try to control them over here and they squirt out that way. They just do it better and they squirt over it. It just doesn't work. It's fascinating too within the text. Again, hours could be taught about this, but it says your desire will be for your husband, but he will rule over you. And within the Hebrew, this is not a nice little desire, a nice situation between the two of them. That word desire there is the same word that's used in chapter four, and this time describing sin. After Cain has killed Abel, it says, pain, sin is crouching at your door and its desire is to master you. And so for these two who have given up this posture of naked and unashamed, forming the fig leaves, now they look at their companion as a competitor. And both of them are looking at each other with this desire to control and to manipulate and to dominate the other. It's how we deal with our anxiety because we can't control other people and maybe sometimes they just cause us some pain. And I don't want that, so I will control that. And in that, there's this little redemptive whisper that sometimes as Hallie and I are in the midst of that kind of cycle, and you've heard me say it's always late at night, right? We have a conversation. And in the midst of that, every once in a while, there's this invitation that says, wait a second, you're actually another human being. Whoa, you've got the image of God as well. And it's not my image. oh, could I at least just for a moment see the wonder in who you are? Because it reminds me then of who I am. And it reminds me of who we are and the posture we are to take. It's a scarier posture, but it's utterly redemptive. And of course, finally, there's death in this. For death, as we know, as much as we try to escape it, it's had its way 100% of the time. and that reality should break any illusion that we can be like God controlling everything and I referred to it earlier in the sermon that I know of those diagnoses of which you likely do too whether it's you or somebody close to you it's a long story for another time but I remember 10 years ago sitting in a doctor's office a medical specialist my wife and I sitting there and him breathing over the top of me a terminal diagnosis, telling me that I was going to die within two years. And among the many things I learned, maybe tell that story again another time, the doctor turned out to be wrong, but I didn't know that for an extended period of time. And the many things that I learned in those dark valleys of the shadow is that any control I might have is fleeting, at best illusory and it blows away. Some people say, Peter, you should sue that doctor for malpractice. But there's this little whiff of redemption that happens. For though that diagnosis was utterly horrifying in every way that you would know and imagine, there was something wildly redemptive about it too. Because in those moments I could see who I am and who God is. and what this life really holds. That's Genesis 2 and Genesis 3 in a nutshell. It is this garden story, the wonderful and beautiful image of God on earth meant to live open and fully vulnerable to God's power and they bite into the fruit of the great illusion and creation starts going utterly haywire as a result. That's that garden story. Two beings who are not God grasped after God-likeness, and everything went amok. Contrast that now briefly with the Philippians story that Nina read earlier, too, of the second garden, and this time in Gethsemane. And that passage says this, that your attitude or your disposition should be like this. Remember something here. That though he was in very nature God, this one was God in his garden. he didn't consider his equality with God something to be hung on to but unlike the original two this one let it go and he walked it out all the way to death even death on a cross and we see in his final words this wonderful request about what a life open and vulnerable to the power of God looks like he says these words and they're his last father into your hands I commit my spirit giving us even just there a little clue about how to walk through that last threshold because none of us know what's going to wait for us on the other side, for sure. The only thing we can do is lean in and trust. I mean, I know for me that at the end of that light tunnel and stuff, there's going to be a giant ho-ho waiting, but I don't know what will be waiting for the rest of you. But at the end of that, Jesus shows us the way. And in his garden story, It was filled with the nevertheless let your will be done sort of ethos and atmosphere and it captured his whole life. And the thought that struck me this whole week as I thought about walking into this future of 2015, into the perpetual unknown, right? The thought that struck me is that if the one who was God actually let it all go, then who in the world am I to try to take it? could there be a different way to live? For among the many dimensions of the great atonement of Jesus, and there are many dimensions, but among the many is that he pierced the great illusion. And in watching his life, we are reminded of whose we are and who we are and the kind of posture to which we're called. For when I look at his life, I'm reminded, is that I'm a child of the king, and so are you. So to stand fully open, let the power of God flow through, partnering with him, not now with the way creation was meant to be, but in a creation gone haywire, now we get to partner with him in the great reconciliation. For Paul says, you are ambassadors of reconciliation, as if God was making his very appeal through you. this is the tikkun alam of which we speak. This is the healing of the world. And I can't do that, and nor can you, but maybe we can, as we walk out this journey of life, calling people back to remember who they are and whose they are. So I don't know what's going to happen in the year ahead. I really don't. Except perhaps this. When a people continues the struggle of becoming fully alive with God, being fully open to his power. Crazy stuff might just happen. And those people of the texts that are removed from me by VeggieTale video suddenly come crashing into our time and space, and we walk it out in that same sort of way. And what happens in those places is, I don't know, stuff that is perhaps subversive to the order of this world. Stuff that comes against the order of this present darkness. For whiffs of redemption come. And relationships start being healed. The illusion of a corporate climb starts going away. And in those valleys of the shadows, there can be this little settling whisper of peace that says, don't worry, for even though you die, yet you will live. And for some of us, as we look around the world, myself included, and we see the pain and the suffering and the struggle of what's there, maybe our eyesight will clear and as that great Christmas song O Holy Night declares that we will see that the slave is actually our brother and maybe a little cup of water would be nice. Don't get me wrong living fully open to the power of God doesn't mean pain all ends and we're all happy snappy. Isn't God great? It just means that we can be part of a light that the most ferocious darkness of any headline can never overcome. For a baby was born in Bethlehem. And he reminded the world of who we are and whose we are. And he promised that, lo, I am with you always, even every step of the way. God with us. Emmanuel. I was trying to think about how to close this out. As you know, I don't have any fancy benedictions ever. I failed that part in my sermon class. I think I got a D in benedictions. But I was trying to think of something this week. And I had Hallie on the lookout for me and me too. We were searching some Celtic blessings, you know, that could kind of just launch us into the new year. You know, those ones that kind of just create a little wind underneath our feet as we walk or some Irish ones or something like that. But those always end at a pub, so I didn't want to do those. I thought about emailing Vicki Degner because she kind of speaks in Celtic blessings but I didn't want to bother her during the holiday and then I sat with you at that lovely Christmas Eve service and at the end of that service Al stood up here and he read this lovely blessing over the top of us and I went to him and I said Al can I use that blessing that was great it's just what I was looking for wherever did you find that he said well Peter I kind of wrote it this afternoon and I thought oh how beautiful that within the fabric of our journey together as this body that we would see with clarity who we are and whose we are and how we're to walk so with that I'll just invite you to stand and we'll read that blessing adding a few more pieces to it because it's our journey after all and invite you as the calendar closes on 2014 and we walk into the unknown of 2015 to keep these words in the mind and in the heart so hear now that in our joy and in our sorrow Emmanuel in our pleasure and in our pain Emmanuel in our certainty and in our confusion Emmanuel in the beauty and vigor of health and new life Emmanuel and in the valleys of the shadow Emmanuel on our highways of success and those long dirt roads in which we never thought we'd have to travel Emmanuel for he is our king and we are his people a chosen people a royal priesthood God's own possession to declare the praises of him who called us out of darkness and into his marvelous light. Blessings on the road ahead for 2015. Amen. Amen.
