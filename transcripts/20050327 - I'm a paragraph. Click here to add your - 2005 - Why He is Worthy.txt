hear our praise, O Lord. For if we did not sing your praise, the rocks themselves would cry out. Hear our praise. In this church, hear our praise. In this city, as others who love you have gathered to sing your praise, hear our praise. so come now to the ministry of the word by the power of your spirit give life, resurrection life to these words and to the spirits of men and women in this place, in Jesus name, amen if you have your Bibles with you I'd like you to open them with me to what may feel like an odd place, actually, of study for an Easter Sunday sermon, the book of Revelation, the fifth chapter beginning in the first verse, where the Apostle John shares with us a vision of heaven and the worship that goes on around the throne of God and the reason for that worship. Actually, this scene is set for us in Revelation chapter 4 verse 1 because the first thing that John sees in this vision of heaven is a door in heaven that is standing open. That's significant. The door is open wide to you and me. And the first thing John hears is a voice like the sound of a trumpet speaking with him saying, John, come up here and I will show you what things must take place. Immediately then, John says, I was in the Spirit and behold, a throne was standing in heaven and one was sitting on the throne. Chapter 5, verse 1. And I saw in the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne a book written inside and on the back sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals? And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it. And I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it. And one of the elders said to me, John, stop weeping. Behold, the lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, it has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals. And I saw between the throne with the four living creatures and the elders a lamb standing as if slain. Move to verse 8. And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the lamb, having each one a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. and they sang a new song saying, Worthy art thou to take the book and to break its seals, for thou wast slain and didst purchase for God with thy blood men and women from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. Verse 11. And I looked and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads and thousands of thousands and saying with a loud voice, worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing in every created thing, which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them. I heard them saying, to him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever. And ever and the four living creatures kept saying, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped him. do you ever wonder if it's worth it maybe an odd question having just read that powerful text and some of the energy we feel this morning have you ever wondered if it's worth it and lots in her book on the revelation wonders what it would be like to ask that question to people in the Bible. People like Abraham. Abraham, was it worth it leaving your home, everything familiar, everything you love to spend your one and only life wandering around as a stranger all for a single child in an unfulfilled dream? Was it worth it? Or to ask Moses, Moses, was it worth leaving the prestige and power and the wealth of Egypt? you had it in your hands to carry a stiff-necked complaining people on your back for 40 years through the wilderness only to die before you were able to enter the promised land. Was it worth it? I wonder what it would be like to ask Mary, Mary, are you glad that your response to the angel that day was, be it done unto me just as you said then to conceive that child out of wedlock, pour out your heart of love to him only to have him grow up and publicly say that the real members of his family are those who do his will, and then in the end to stand helplessly by and watch him die on a cross, publicly humiliated, discredited. Was it worth it? Or how about John himself, the writer of the Revelation? Was it worth it, John, To spend your old age on a prison island called Patmos, cut off from everything and everyone you love, when at this time in your life you should have been able to kind of relax, sit back and enjoy the fruit of your faithful life. Was it worth it? What about you? Did you ever wonder? Is it worth it to pursue God and live to serve Him when you can't always see the benefit? Is it worth it to obey God, to tell the truth when a lie right now would serve you much better? Is it worth it to persevere day after day, year after year in a difficult marriage when part of you just wants to run away? Is it worth it to invest your life in a dream for ministry when it feels like there's way more plowing of the field than reaping of a harvest? Is it worth it? Do you ever wonder about that? Well, you may not be wondering that today, but in the course of life's journey, I think it's a pretty common question. So what I want to declare to you this Easter Sunday is what Abraham, Moses, Mary, and John would declare to you if they were here. It's this, that at the very center of the universe, there is a lamb standing as if slain, and one day you, yes you, you will behold the lamb, And you will behold the Lamb, not by means of a sermon or a song. You will behold the Lamb, not by means of a book or a movie, but face to face. And on that day, every doubt, question, and fear will be blown clean away, for you and I will know what Abraham, Moses, Mary, and John know, that yes, it is worth it, not because it was easy, not because it was fun, or because it led to great accomplishment or recognition, But because at the very center of human history stands a lamb who was slain. Revelation 5 verse 6 says, standing as if slain was this lamb. Because though he was dead, behold, he is alive forevermore. And he is worthy. He is worthy is the song that is being sung in Revelation chapter 5. This Easter weekend, by means of Revelation chapter 5. I want to tell you the story of God. Using the rich imagery and symbolic language of John's revelation, I want to talk to you about the Lamb of God and why he is worthy. And here's the bottom line. It's because he is worthy that it's worth it. It begins with a book according to verse 1 of chapter 5. Some of your texts might refer to it as a scroll sealed with seven seals. Let me explain that picture. In John's day, one of the documents that might be sealed this way was a personal will. We talk about someone's last will and testament. This book with seven seals could be understood that very same way as the revelation of God's last will and testament for the world is about to be revealed. where everything God wants to be done is going to be done. This book, this last will and testament of God, contains all the judgments of God, which include some wonderful things for some devastating things for others. This book also contains all the plans and purposes of God, including his plan for redemption, for restoring his creation to himself. There is a book, beloved, that tells the story of God, that reveals the desires and purposes of God. And whoever has the book has the ability to tell the story, to reveal what the story actually is. More than that, to fulfill the purposes of that story, to literally make things right. Because that is the purpose of God in the world. But then, verse 4, John begins to weep. Why? Because there isn't anyone who has the authority, who has the capacity, who is indeed worthy to take this book and break its seals, to unveil the story, to fulfill the purpose. No one who has authority, capacity, or worthiness to make things right. And so John weeps. But his weeping is bigger than what can be reduced to this one little thing. Because John, beloved, is weeping for the condition of the whole human race. Because this is the reality of the human race. For throughout human history, we have anointed kings, elected presidents, followed leaders, formed governments, made alliances and created initiatives, all with the hope that maybe this time, maybe this time we will get it right. Maybe this time justice will triumph and peace will prevail, but it doesn't, at least not for long. You see, John really is weeping for the failure of the whole human race. He is weeping for the beauty of the world that could be but is not. He is weeping for all the little children who are abandoned and afraid and exploited and abused, for the relentless inhumanity of man to man, and he's weeping even for his own failure as well. Well, because even John, with his best efforts and most noble desires, couldn't make things right. You see, there was no one who could take the book and open the seals. Beloved, if you have ever wakened up in the middle of the night and wept, because things had suddenly gone wrong and you didn't know why, or because you wanted so badly to make things right, but you didn't know how, then you have wept the tears of John. But now, but now, enter one of the elders. It says in verse 5, saying to John, John, stop weeping. Why? Here's why. Behold, look, the lion from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has overcome. So as to take the book and break the seals, And when John looks to see this line in verse 6, he sees instead a lamb standing as if slain. And when he sees it, he begins to hear a song being sung in verse 9. And what's being sung over and over and over is this. Worthy, worthy, worthy is the lamb to take the book, to break the seals, to reveal the purpose, to restore the lost, to make things right. John, look up. Behold, a lion who has conquered, a lamb who has been slain. And when those things came, a song began to swell in heaven. A word about the song. In verse 11, the song begins to grow. And I looked, says John, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders and the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, worthy is the Lamb. Some of you might not like this, but the worship in heaven, according to this verse, is going to be loud. It's going to be very loud. But here's the deal. No one is going to be covering up their ears, bent over like this in pain, for everyone before the Lamb will be standing up straight with arms extended, singing worthy is the Lamb as myriads of myriads. The Greek word there is significant. It's murion. It means 10,000. There is no word in the Greek that goes bigger than 10,000. So 10,000 times 10,000 is to go beyond what can be calculated. And after you've counted, says John, beyond what can be counted, add thousands of thousands. In verse 13, the praise choir is complete as every living thing in heaven, on earth, under the earth, on the sea and in the sea. He joins the chorus saying this to him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb. Be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever. And the four living creatures kept saying in wonderment, Amen. Verse 14. And the 24 elders fell down and worshipped him because it wasn't just loud, it was overwhelming. So they fell down. By the way, these 24 elders fell down a lot. They were a clumsy group, evidently. Just get the flow of this, beloved. Chapter 4, verse 10. The 24 elders will fall down before him who sits upon the throne and will worship him who lives forever. Casting their crowns before the throne saying, over and over worthy is the lamb. Chapter 5 verse 8, and the 24 elders fell down before the lamb and as they did, they sang a new song saying, worthy art thou to take the book and break its seals. In chapter 5, verse 14, they go down again and then again. In chapter 11, 16, in chapter 19, verse 4, they fell on their faces and worshiped God, saying, we give thee thanks. Paul saw this. Saw it a different way than John saw it, but he saw it. It's very clear that this is exactly what he's talking about in Philippians chapter 2. Speaking of Jesus, who is the lion. Speaking of Jesus, who is the lamb. Paul says that this Jesus emptied himself of all the rights and privileges that belonged to him as God and being found in the appearance of a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient unto death even death on the cross and when he died on the cross Ephesians 4.9 says he descended into the lower parts of the earth but he who descended into the lower parts also ascended and when he ascended blowing open the gates of hell. Philippians 4 verse 9 says that God highly exalted him and gave to him the name. That is very specific. Gave to him the name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow. Every knee should bow. You know what that means? That the elders who are going down got it right. Every knee will bow. Those who are in heaven and on the earth and under the earth, and that every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father, and as every tongue is confessing that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father, those tongues will be joining the 24 elders and the four living creatures and the myriads of angels singing, Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb. Question. Why is he worthy? what makes him worthy well the answer to that according to the vision that John got in the revelation is revealed in Revelation 5 verse 9 here's why he's worthy for he was slain and did purchase for God with his blood men and women from every tribe and tongue and people and nation and he made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God and that beloved is why the angels sing verse 11, worthy is the Lamb. He did purchase for God people. I want you to think about that concept just a little bit with me. The concept of purchasing people happens most commonly in the context of slavery, A sad reality that many people actually in John's day were very familiar with because many of them were slaves. Slavery was a common reality in John's day. So to them, this issue of a purchase price for a person would hold a particularly emotional charge to it. and their reaction to it would be particularly visceral, far more than yours or mine. We understand the concepts of slavery. Many of these people were slaves. In those days, when someone became a slave, their freedom would be set at a price, which on the surface sounds hopeful, because if I could just save enough money, I could maybe be free. But as a slave, you actually had no possible means by which you could raise the money. So the purchase price that would potentially make freedom possible ultimately just mocks a slave. Now, once in a while, it's true a benevolent owner would provide a way for a slave to be free someday, usually at the end of their life, working their whole life when they couldn't do the work. A benevolent owner might set them free. Every now and then, someone would actually purchase a slave for the purchase of setting them free, but that was incredibly rare. So it is that most slaves lived and died, knowing that freedom was just a ransom price away, but knowing also that they couldn't pay it and no one else would pay it. So I wept greatly, says John, chapter 5, verse 4, because no one was found who could or would take the book and break its seals. No one was found who could or would make things right, set people free. And then one of the elders said, Stop weeping, John. Behold, the lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, he has overcome. So as to be the one who could take this book and break its seals. And I looked to see the lion, but when I turned, what I saw was a lamb standing as if slain. And then the singing started again. The singing started again. Worthy is this lamb. Don't underestimate the power of this lamb. Get the picture. Pull it together. The Lion of Judah, appearing as a lamb, standing as if slain, had both the means and the authority to purchase for God men and women from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation who were in slavery to Satan, sin, and death. The purchase price, he purchased us with his blood, his life's blood. In other words, it cost him. The purchase price was everything he had. And that is why he's worthy. And that is why it's worth it. And that is why we worship, and that is why we sing, and that is why we serve. I think most of you are familiar with a film that came out some years ago. A profound film is still remembered called Schindler's List, where Oskar Schindler in Hitler's Germany sees a whole race of people headed for destruction. When it dawns on him that as a wealthy factory owner, he has the resources to buy human lives, to literally purchase them for ransom. In one scene early on in the film, a group of men have come to work in his factory, and he learns very quickly that their wives, the wives of these men and their children, were headed for a train that was going to bring them to a death camp. So he goes to the German officer in charge of all these things, declaring that he needs these people, the women and the children, to work in his factory. And he pours out a bag of diamonds to literally purchase these children and these wives of these men. At the end of the movie, the war is over. And one of the most poignant scenes of the movie happens where the death camps have been liberated. And Schindler is standing there surrounded by hundreds of people that he saved. And they are very grateful. And with tears of gratitude are expressing that gratitude to him. But as he looks around, he begins to weep. As this one thought occurs to him, I could have done more. I could have sold this car. And he looked at this beautiful car that he rode to this occasion in. And he looks at his hand and he sees a ring. And he says, I didn't need this. I didn't need it. This suit is tailor-made. How many lives? One? Two? Oh, if I could do it over, I'd give everything I have to buy every life I could. The point is this, beloved. That is precisely what God did. He gave everything he had. He held nothing back. Not a piece of jewelry, not a suit, not a car. For our God, who is holy, holy, holy, who created all things by the word of his power, that God said this, I will empty heaven of its finest treasure. I will give everything I have to purchase every life I can. And when he did that, it opened wide the doors of heaven to anyone who didn't want to be a slave anymore. and that is why the 24 elders and the four living creatures and the myriads of angels and every living creature day and night do not cease to say worthy is the Lamb who was slain. Why? Because He did purchase for God with His blood men and women from every tribe and tongue and people and nation and that is why He's worthy and that is why it's worth it and that is why we worship and that is why we sing and that is why we serve and that is why the first thing that John saw in his vision of heaven was a door standing open wide but he also saw a lion who had conquered then he saw a lamb who had been slain standing as if slain for he is risen alive forevermore and that is why we're grateful and that is why right now we are going to stand and tell him thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
