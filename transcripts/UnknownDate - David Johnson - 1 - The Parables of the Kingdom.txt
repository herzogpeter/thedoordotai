The rest of you open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 13, verse 1. I wanted to say a word about Haiti before I began. Haiti is a land where it seems to me that Satan has been allowed to rule his king. Voodoo seems to be everywhere you look, not just even among the people in little tiny villages hidden away, but at the very highest levels of government. Voodoo is the power. It is seen by them, even at high levels of government, as their source of power, Satan worship. The fact that Satan is allowed to rule as king is evidenced in many places that you look. When I was in Port-au-Prince, I think it's the largest city in Haiti, where we flew in. the poverty is beyond belief. I'm sure you've all seen pictures. You have to be there to really get it. I've heard that before. It always sounds condescending when people say that to me. You have to be there. As I was walking through Port-au-Prince and the little tiny shacks where people lived right on top of each other and sold their little goods, maybe a few pea pods or something like that to try to eke out an existence, the thing that was going through my mind was how do I explain this to people without sharing with them the smell. I remember Steve Hansen coming back and sharing the smell, and you just can't picture Haiti without the smell, which is powerfully affecting. The thing I saw in people's faces, and I remember remarking with the people I was with in the midst of all the poverty in Port-au-Prince and the squalor, literally, there is no sanitation whatsoever. I kept looking for anger because people treated like this ought to be really angry. And I think you've got to be in better shape to be angry. I don't know if that makes sense. What I saw was despair everywhere I looked. Satan really has a grip on people there. But you need to know also the gods that work in Haiti in powerful ways. And that is evidenced as well. You can look at it. It's evidenced by a church in St. Mark, Haiti, where I visited. And our young people were where they painted the whole church, where well over a thousand people every Sunday come and worship Jesus. And many of them could tell stories of how they came to Christ, but their story is laced with stories of how God had to break the power of Satan in their lives and had to set them free from voodoo and demons would be cast out. The power of God is at work in Haiti, and it's evidenced in a little town called Trico. And that was where I preached last Sunday. I think I probably got as much of Haiti as you possibly can get in three days. We went from Port-au-Prince, which is what it is. huge, huge place. Just people teeming everywhere. And incredible aroma, as I mentioned, and poverty. To St. Mark, which was a little bit more manageable up into the mountains than in a town called Trico, where it felt like, I felt like Indiana Jones when we were going there. We had to cross three rivers in this four-wheel drive Jeep. It was wonderful. There was a bus that was turned over, and we made it. the missionary who drove the jeep is an absolute maniac and he enjoyed it the more dangerous it was the more he liked it I think we got up in this little mountain village and it's probably what you picture when you think of doing missionary stuff all the little huts and all these kinds of things but there's a church there and there's a little school there and there's opportunity for our kids to go I think that is going to be our next trip and I spoke to 200 Haitians last Sunday morning with an interpreter and I heard there were jokes made about that here, what that would be like. It was wonderful. The guy who interpreted for me was a wild man. He was a maniac. And we got into a rhythm and it was really good. I had a picture in my mind of it being opposite of tongues. It was like I would speak in English and he would go, It was like, it was opposite. I gave the interpretation and then he spoke in this weird tongue. Anyway, sorry. I told him I had good news for him. Luke 4, Jesus opened a book. And he said, the Spirit of the Lord is on me. And I've come to preach good news to poor people. And not just give them money, I came to give them life. They like that. I don't know what they say, they just mumble. In Creole, amen sounds... I told them about the kingdom of God, and the kingdom of God has power to bind the darkness. But see, I think they know that better than I do, because they've been set free. the pain and the squalor of that country, it's wonderful to see. The reason is because it makes you very aware that money can't fix it, and giving them food can't fix it. They need money and they need food. There's only one thing that could possibly affect the condition of people like that, and see in some ways, the condition of those people is the real condition of everybody. We just don't see it. We cover it up with Cadillacs. There's only one thing that could possibly touch those people's pain. The kingdom of God. That's why we speak it. That's why we spread it. That's our agenda. It's going to the world. Let's pray as we come to Matthew 13. Jesus, I pray in your name that as we come into this wonderful passage, this new section of the parables of the kingdom, that God, you would come with your spirit and illuminate our minds and our hearts. This text reveals to us that there are people who, because they resist and reject and they don't want to see your kingdom and they want a church to just stay this nice little thing where we know our right doctrine and our creed is correct, but we want to push away the power and the reality of the kingdom, then the kingdom remains a mystery to them. And they aren't illuminated relative to the power and the glory and the real working of what you want to do on earth. But God, you have granted to some who have come hungry and broken and yearning for the reality of God in their life, and you have granted to them the mysteries of the kingdom. And I pray, God, that you would illuminate our minds, that you would grant to us this morning eyes to see and ears to hear what you've got to say about kingdom truth. I pray it would come directly from your spirit to our hearts and minds in Jesus' name. Amen. As we come to chapter 13, we are entering a new section. It is a section called the parables of the kingdom, or maybe even more accurately described, it is the mysteries of the kingdom being revealed to people who have a heart to hear and a heart to see. This is a rich and a vital section. It's a section in which Jesus is going to describe for us the nature of the kingdom and the character of the kingdom relative to its inner realities, its mysteries. It says in verse 11, To you it has been granted to know the mysteries, but other people aren't going to know them. One of the things Jesus is going to do to teach these inner secrets, if you will, these inner workings of the kingdom of God, is to make little word pictures with words. He's going to say the kingdom of God is like a field. The kingdom of God is like a farmer. The kingdom of God is like leaven. It's like a mustard seed, a little tiny thing. Usually it makes a bush, but the kingdom of God is like a mustard seed that grew into a big tree, and then birds came and rested and made its dwelling in the branches. The kingdom of God is like a pearl of great price, where people found it and sought after it and gave everything they had to get it. The kingdom of God is like a treasure, and he's going to paint all sorts of wonderful pictures relative to what the kingdom of God is really all about. Parables, simply simple word pictures to teach, reveal, unveil the mysteries, the deep truth about the kingdom of God. And so it is that in chapter 13, verse 1, it says this, that on that day, Jesus went out of the house. He'd been reviling or dealing with the Pharisees. He's done with that. He goes out of the house. He's sitting by the sea now. Great multitudes follow him. They gather to him so that he got into the boat, and then he sat down in the boat. Great theological debate as to why he sat down, because you're supposed to stand when you preach. You know that. The reason he sat down to clear up all the debate was so that the boat wouldn't tip over. And the whole multitude, I'm sorry, the whole multitude was standing on the beach. And he spoke many things to them in parables saying this, Behold, the sower went out and began to sow. And he began to tell a story. In verses 4 through 9, he tells this story and he just tells about a guy who's sowing in the field and he sows some on rocky soil and some on fertile soil and some on stuff where the plant begins to grow but then the sun beats and it goes away. But he doesn't explain it. And at the end of that, the disciples are a little confused and they say in verse 10, how come you speak to them in parables? Because when you don't explain it, it just sounds like an impossible riddle. There isn't any sense to it. And Jesus said there's a purpose for that. There's a reason for that. Verse 11, to you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted. That sounds kind of mean. For whoever has, has what? Has been granted the mysteries of the kingdom, I got good news for you. You're going to get more and more. To him shall more be given, and he shall have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him. Therefore I speak to them in parables, because while seeing they do not see, while hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. In fact, in their case, the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, you will keep on hearing, but you will not understand. You will keep on seeing, but you will not perceive for the heart of this people has become dull and their ears they scarcely hear. They have closed their eyes lest they should see with their eyes or just in case they would begin to see with their eyes and if they would begin to hear with their ears and understand with their heart and return to me, I got good news, I would heal them. But blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear. We are going to be covering this morning verses 1 through 3. We're going to skip down to verse 10, then through 16. What we're going to be doing today is something we generally need to do whenever we come into a new section. It's basically kind of an introduction. We're not even going to get into the parables this morning, but basically lay for ourselves a foundation for what it is that Jesus is doing. I'm going to give you three things this morning. Surprise, surprise. The first thing is this. The foundation laid. There's some things we need to know theologically. This is a passage, whether you know it or not, is very pivotal for a lot of theology and a lot of perceptions relative to what the nature of the kingdom is really all about. So I need to lay some theological foundations for you. The second thing we're going to do is simply define what a parable is. And then the third thing, we're going to talk very quickly about the purpose of a parable. And the purpose I already gave you is to reveal truth, but also to conceal truth. And it's kind of a troubling thing. Why would Jesus do that? Let me lay the foundation first of all. I believe that before we can speak of the character and the mysteries of the kingdom, we have to have a pretty good definition of the kingdom. In fact, if you have a definition of the kingdom that doesn't allow for the kingdom and doesn't allow for the power of the kingdom, it's going to affect profoundly how you interpret the parables that speak of the mysteries of the kingdom. Do you understand that? How we view the kingdom and how we see its presence to be expressing itself in the world today is going to profoundly affect whether or not we're able to understand the parables or understand or unlock the mysteries of the kingdom. In fact, I think that how we define what the kingdom actually is and how it expresses itself on this earth is going to determine whether or not we understand the mystery at all. We have a classic example. We've been meeting them and seeing them week after week after week, every single Sunday on these mornings, of people called Pharisees who had all sorts of theology. They were looking for a Messiah. They had a theology even about the kingdom. But when the kingdom came to them and the power was demonstrated to them and they heard the message of it, they resisted it, they rejected it, they finally said, that's of demons, that's not the kingdom of God, that's a demonic thing. And because of that, hearing it, they didn't hear it. Seeing it, they didn't see it. They turned it off. The kingdom didn't really come. There's some things I want to establish this morning theologically for our foundation of this whole study. Relative to the kingdom. Defining what it is. First of all, I want you to know that the kingdom of God, whether or not you understand what it is, the kingdom of God is the central issue of all redemptive history. Jesus talks about it constantly it is rooted in the Old Testament the prophets yearned for the day of the Lord when the Messiah would come and bring his kingdom it is also not only rooted in the Old Testament it is active in the Old Testament in the Egyptian in the Exodus where God delivered his people from Egypt we see the kingdom of God coming in a moment invading their lives intervening for them and God ruling in kingdom power as he parted the Red Sea as a pillar of smoke led them out as he provided manna. The kingdom was injecting itself into their lives. The kingdom is seen there. It was seen in the Babylonian captivity. But the kingdom didn't come to earth and find a dwelling place on the earth until Jesus came. And when Jesus came, the kingdom did indeed invade human history. And it came to stay. And in his message, we find the kingdom of God absolutely central to everything he said and did. In Matthew 5, we find that his words tell people how they can enter the kingdom. In Matthew 6, through his prayer, we find that it's okay to ask for the kingdom and to seek the kingdom and ask the power of the kingdom to be released in their lives. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. I want you to pray like that. I want you to ask the kingdom of God, the rule of God, to come to your life and to your church and to your community and to places like Haiti. Pray that way. In Matthew 8 and 9, we find that his works demonstrate the power of the kingdom. Matthew 10, his training of disciples, indicating the ongoing nature of the kingdom. In Matthew 13, where we are right now, we're going to be dealing with the mysteries of the kingdom. His death, resurrection, and then distribution of the gifts demonstrate that we have been raised just like Jesus and we have been equipped by the gifts of the Spirit to be instruments of the kingdom. So this kingdom did come. It is here. He talked about it constantly. Even after his resurrection, just before his ascension in Acts chapter 1, verse 3. He said to his disciples and anybody who would listen, it says in Acts 1, 3, he appeared to them many times, did all sorts of signs and wonders, and just kept on talking about things pertaining to the kingdom of God. You need to know about the kingdom. You need to know how to function in the kingdom. I have brought the kingdom to earth and I have given it to you. But there were people then and there are people now who don't believe the kingdom has come. Much confusion, and if we are not clear on this point, we're not going to be able to draw one legitimate principle out of the parables. There's three views of the kingdom I want you to know about. Real quickly here. The first view is this. And this, in my view, is a wrong view. And that is that the kingdom has come in its fullness. The first view of the kingdom and its definition is that the kingdom has come in its fullness. C.H. Dodd said, In the message and in the ministry of Jesus, the kingdom was established on earth absolutely fully. It's almost as if we're living in a millennium. No more pain, no more hardship. It's all here. It is fully realized. All healing is here. All power is here. All peace is here. Praying for healing is simply a matter of receiving what you've already got. The name it and claim it thing flows out of that whole theology. I don't know if you know that. It just flows out of that whole thing. It's all here. The problem with that is that it isn't all here. It hasn't been given preeminence yet. It is something that is spreading and it is moving. At the second coming of Christ, we are going to have the consummation of the kingdom. The kingdom is here in another sense, but it isn't fully here. There is, however, another view that is far more scary to me than that one I just gave you. And that is the view that many of you have even grown up on, and I have grown up on. And that is the view that says this. The kingdom of God is not a present reality. It is only a future hope. The kingdom of God is not a present reality. It is only a future hope. I don't normally do this kind of thing, like name names, but this is the theology that is called dispensationalism. It is the fundamentalistic approach. The kingdom of God is not a present reality. It is a future hope. The way that theology works is like this. Jesus Christ came to earth 2,000 years ago, and when he did, he brought the kingdom. You follow that? The evidence of the kingdom being with him was miracles, signs, and wonders, healing, and deliverance from demonic power. But what you need to understand according to this theology is that all of those miracles and all of that power was only a preview or a foretaste of the kingdom that was going to come in the future. He didn't bring it to bring it for us now. It was going to be a preview of what was going to come in the future. His death and resurrection guaranteed the fact that the future kingdom would come, but we wouldn't get it now. You follow that? The death and resurrection guaranteed that what you just saw Jesus do in power was going to come someday. And then when he ascended, the theology teaches this, that he brought the kingdom with him. Follow that. The kingdom didn't stay. The power didn't stay. The gifts of the Spirit didn't stay. You're on your own, folks. That's good news. No power, no authority, no signs, no gifts. Well, there's some gifts, but certain gifts are for today. I grew up hearing that. Certain gifts are not for today. And you're a heretic if you believe that the gifts are for today. He will move like he did in the Old Testament from time to time. That's how he moved in the Old Testament, by the way. Intervening here and there, sovereignly as he willed. But the kingdom isn't here. By the way, that whole theology really does flesh out in certain kinds of postures that scare me. The kingdom isn't here. There isn't any power. There are no gifts, so don't get excited. You're on your own. Hear this, just by way of application, and I'm not even getting to the parables yet here. If it's true that Jesus brought the kingdom when he left, and we don't have authority, and we don't have power, and the gifts aren't for today, then what is our approach to ministry? Because you are on your own. You can't count on the power of the Holy Spirit by the gifts of the Spirit moving through you or moving through us to affect changes in people's lives. If I don't have the power of God available to me and the kingdom authority of God available to me and to us, then the only thing that's left is me. And I am going to, I guarantee it, resort to slick methodology, external manipulation, all sorts of unbelievably frantic effort in the flesh to try to do the work of God. Why would I do it that way? Because the gifts aren't available. Power of God's not available. It's up to you. Better have good methodology. better know your doctrine right down to the T. Know your doctrine. Use appropriate methodology. But if the kingdom isn't here and the power isn't available, you're on your own. It's going to be my power, my authority, my knowledge. And you can see that fleshed out in the church today. I believe that the message that the kingdom is not here, by the way, here's where I'm going to make the connection. I believe that the message that the kingdom isn't here and the power isn't available is the same theology the Pharisees had. I think it's exactly the same theology. They heard the message. They saw the power. When they heard the message and saw the power, they resisted, they resented, they rejected, and now they hear it and they don't hear it. They see it and they don't see it. If it's true that Jesus took the kingdom back when he ascended, You're wondering right now, what does this have to do with Matthew 13? I have no idea. I just decided to talk about this today. I'm going to get to that. You're going to see this wonderful weaving tapestry here. I hope I can do it. If Jesus brought the kingdom back with him when he ascended, I've got some questions. The first question is this. If he did that, why did he say in John 14, as he was preparing his disciples for the time of his death, he said this. You guys, you need to know I'm leaving, but I'm not leaving you alone. I'm going to send another one. The Holy Spirit of God, who is going to not be with you, he is going to be in you. And I got a good word for you. The same things that you have seen me do, you shall do also. In fact, greater works will you do than I have done. How in the world is that going to happen if he brought the power of the kingdom with him when he left? It can't happen. What about Pentecost? I can't even explain Pentecost. If Jesus brought the kingdom with him when he left, Pentecost makes absolutely no sense. When Jesus brought the kingdom, he brought the kingdom. There's something else here, though, in this dispensational theology, and this is where it begins to tie in with Matthew 13, and it's even why I got off on this whole thing. Let me explain. We have just come in chapter 12 to the place where the Jews rejected Jesus. Remember what they said? He is a demon. The more revelation they got, the more resistant their reaction was. Finally, they said, he's a demon. And it was an expression of, an emblematic of their ultimate rejection of the king and of the kingdom. According to a dispensational theology, what happens is that when Jesus tried to bring the kingdom and the Jews refused it, he brought the kingdom back. He wanted to give it. He wanted to bring it. Now listen to this. And again, many of you don't even know what I'm talking about when I talk about dispensationalism. Many of you have grown up in this. And I think it's bound you. Here's a theology. When Jesus originally did come, his full intention was to bring the kingdom in its fullness, to establish it on earth, to go right into the millennium, and we were going to be absolutely together, and the marriage supper of the Lamb right now, it was going to be wonderful. And he tried to bring it, he tried to bring it, he tried to bring it, but he couldn't bring it. You know why? Because the Jews rejected it in Matthew 12. They said no. And it's as if God said, well, okay, if you're going to be that way about it, I'm not going to give the kingdom. And so because the Jews rejected it, he changed the whole plan, and we're going to withdraw the kingdom, and instead of bringing the kingdom in and establishing it, instead of that, he goes to the cross, he dies, he rises again, and secures a future kingdom, not one now. Got that? The plan, bring the kingdom, establish it now. We're all going to sit here and just be wonderful. It's going to be great. We're going to have it right now. They rejected it. He says, well, forget you then. We're not going to have the kingdom. I'm going to go to the cross. I'm going to die. I'm going to rise again and establish it for later. All sorts of problems with that. What that sounds like is that the plan of God got thwarted because Jews rejected it. He had plan A, bring the kingdom, establish it. People said no, so he had to go to plan B. So the plan of salvation that we enjoy right now was plan B. That's heresy. The fact is this. Jesus did bring the kingdom. Jesus did offer the kingdom to Israel. He offered it to Israel, and we've seen him doing that. By the way, after chapter 13, we're going to hear more and more about him offering it to Gentiles. But he brought the kingdom to Israel. The reason he brought it to Israel and to the Jews first was because they were the chosen people of God. It would be as if he came and gave a visitation personally to the church today. They were the children of the covenant. They were the children of promise. And so he came and he brought the kingdom to them in order that they might continue to be the channel of God's power, the channel of God's authority, the channel of his word, his work, his mind to the world. The Jews rejected. They said no. And because they rejected, some would have us believe that that means the whole kingdom plan changed. We're only going to get it later. What happened was this. When the Jews rejected the kingdom message, God did with them what he does with every one of you and myself included. When he comes to you or to me and says, David, I want to use you to speak my word. I want to use you to affect people. I want to use you to be a channel of the power and the grace and the glory of God. And I say, no way, I'm not going to do it. I don't want anything to do with that. You know what God does? He goes, oh no, now I can't do my plan. Oh, now I can't have my purpose done on earth. No, he goes, oh, okay, I wanted you to be the one. You don't want to be the one. Fine, it's your loss. I'm going to agree for you, but I'm going to use these people over here. God came with the kingdom to this earth to establish it so that it could begin to move around this earth and take back for God from Satan, his people. And he came first to the Jews to be the channel of that powerful kingdom. they said no he didn't go oh no now I don't get the kingdom there I'm going to change the plan no what he did was this I wanted to give it to you I wanted the power to go through you you said no instead I'm going to put it in the hands of lepers and tax gatherers and prostitutes and broken people hungry people mourning people who will receive the king and believe in the power of the kingdom and they are the ones that I'm going to use to spread this message so it is that Jesus did bring his kingdom and his kingdom did come and it is not fully consummated yet but he bawled all those lepers and prostitutes and broken and hungry and weary people Jews and Gentiles he bawled them all together in a big bunch and he called them the church and he gave to the church his indwelling spirit and he gave to the church the gifts of the spirit and he gave to the church marching orders and the marching orders were this occupy till I come meaning this the kingdom has come to you you have got the power and the authority of the kingdom now I want you to occupy that doesn't mean just take up space in the corner of 45th and Florida that means to spread the kingdom bring it everywhere you go bring it to little towns in Haiti spread the kingdom occupy till I come take back by the authority of God for God from Satan people. If the kingdom isn't here, we've got a problem with the parables. We're never going to understand them. We're never going to understand the mysteries of the kingdom. And it says right here that some people are going to understand the mysteries of the kingdom and some people never were, never will. When Jesus later on says the kingdom of God is like a field, the kingdom of God is like a muster seed, the kingdom de God is like a piece of wheat, the kingdom of God like leaven. If you don't believe the kingdom is here, that's a very puzzling statement. It's like the kingdom of God is like the field. So, the kingdom is not here. So who cares if the kingdom of God is like a field? The kingdom is not here. It isnít real. There isnít any power, there isnít any reality, Which is, by the way, exactly what the Pharisees said. The kingdom isn't real. The kingdom isn't powerful. And when I see power, what I determine is that it came by the power of a demon. Which is exactly why in verse 13 it says, they hear and they see, but they don't see, and they hear, but they don't hear. For 12 chapters, the kingdom message has been coming to the Pharisees. The power has been revealed. Their response to the message and the power was, he is a drunkard, he is a glutton, he is irrelevant, he's dangerous, he's a demon. Later on in Acts, they're going to look at the power being displayed, because the kingdom did come. They're going to look at the power being displayed through people, and you know what they're going to say? Oh, those guys are unlearned men. I don't see how they could possibly have anything of value to say. They're unlearned, but they're turning Jerusalem upside down. I don't get it. For 12 chapters in Matthew, we have seen the Pharisees not seeing, choosing not to see. They wouldn't see, they wouldn't see, they wouldn't see. they wouldn't hear, they wouldn't hear, they wouldn't hear, they wouldn't hear. And now in chapter 13, because of their basic theology that said the kingdom isn't here, that's not God, that's a demon. The kingdom's not here, the kingdom's not here. Now in chapter 13, when God, Jesus is going to begin to reveal the mysteries, he says this, they wouldn't hear for 12 chapters, and you know what? Now they're not going to be able to see. Now they're not going to be able to hear. They can't see, they can't hear. Why are you saying all this? For this, I need to say something real clear. it'll probably get me in trouble but I think it and I need to say it. I believe that theology that denies the kingdom of God is here. I believe that theology like dispensationalism that says the power of the kingdom is not available now is the same exact theology of the Pharisees who for 12 chapters would hear the message see the power but every time they'd see power displayed they'd go that's not God that's a demon. Have you ever heard that by the way in evangelical circles? Whenever the power of God began to move they said oh no that's not God that's a demon and that's all sorts of ways to say that that's a theology that is just like the Pharisees, that when they hear it and they see it, they go, no, that's not God. Why? Because the kingdom's not here. If the kingdom's not here, we can't have any power, so when I see it, it's got to be something else. I believe that kind of theology, the theology of the Pharisees, is what sets them up in chapter 13 for not being able to understand the mysteries. It's why it's going to be closed to them from now on. And I believe that kind of theology creates a people who do never understand the mysteries of the kingdom. They will always sound like a riddle. They will look at people like they did in Acts who are moving in the power of God and say, oh, those are unlearned people. They don't know as much theology as we do. Good, hang on to your theology. It's a real puny God, but hang on to it. It's all you got. Like the Pharisees, people with that theology, I'm afraid, move into a mode of existence that is a shell of correct creeds, a shell of moral codes. But I believe it is what Paul warned about in 1 Timothy when he said, they hold to a form of godliness, a form of godliness that denies its power. With that in mind, I can move to the parables. The key, again, just to remind you of why I even gave you all that. Your theology relative to whether the kingdom is here or not is going to be key to whether or not you're ever going to understand the mysteries. Now let's begin to look at the mysteries. The parable, what is a parable? Let's define it. Let's give a definition of a parable. He spoke to them, chapter 13, verse 3, in parables. The Greek word there is parabole. Literally, the word para means alongside. A parabole is to literally lay something alongside something else. A parable is simply this. When you take something physical, like a field or a seed or a leaven or something like that, and you take something physical, natural, or observable, and then you just lay it alongside something that is spiritual, not physical, supernatural, not natural, hidden, not observable. You take the physical thing and you lay it alongside the spiritual thing, and then you extend the physical thing into the spiritual. And all of a sudden, that little technique of teaching opens up our understanding of all sorts of deep spiritual truth. The kingdom of God is like a field. It makes truth even portable. I don't have to remember every facet of the kingdom and what it's really all about. All I've got to do is remember the story. The kingdom of God is like a field, and there was a farmer in the field, and he was sowing seed. I could stop right there and tell you deep truth. What it even tells you is that our responsibility is to what? Spread the seed. You got any power to make it grow? None. So relax. But spread the seed. Spread the seed. You can't make life happen, though. I mean, I don't have to go any further than that to come up with stuff. And then it tells you about rocky soil and fertile soil and soil in the middle. It sprouts up, but then it beats down, and they reject later on. And what does all that mean? Taking natural, physical, observable truth, laying it alongside supernatural truth, extending the physical into the spiritual, and then we get it. Simply put, it teaches deep truth with simple terms so that if you have a heart to see, you're going to see. But parables do more than that. And Jesus is doing more with these parables than just telling good stories. I want to get thirdly to the purpose of parables or the nature of parables. I'm not even sure which title is the best. The nature of parables or the purpose of parables. The disciples came to him and said, Why do you speak in parables? Why do you do this? Again, let me catch you up here. From verse 4 to 9, all he did was tell them a story about a guy walking through a field. He didn't make any of the connections. He just laid down the physical, didn't point to the spiritual yet. And he said this weird stuff. To you it has been granted to know the mysteries. If I were to just explain to you the metaphor or the picture I just gave you, you'd understand. Others, however, it hasn't been granted to them. And so they're going to hear the story, but they're never going to see the significance. Two purposes of a parable, as simply as I can say it. Number one purpose of a parable is to reveal the truth. Number two purpose of a parable is to conceal the truth. Totally opposite, depending on your heart. Let's move through this, to reveal the truth. To reveal the truth. Verse 11. To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. I've got a good word for you if you're redeemed. If you are among those who have received the king and have received the kingdom, if you are among those who have come by faith, and you believe and you have received and heard the message and seen the power and said, my heart is hungry for that, not just theology. I want right theology, but my heart is hungry for more than just theology. I want to know God. I want to know his son. I want to walk in union with him. I want a brand new heart. If you are among those people who, like the disciples, when they heard the message and saw the power, left everything they had to follow him, you have been granted to know the mysteries. And then it says something else. For whoever has to him shall more be given, and he shall have an abundance. For whoever has what? Whoever has been granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom because of their faith, because of their belief. and receiving of the king and the kingdom. Whoever has been granted to know the realities of the kingdom, to him shall be given more. Let me just explain that, and then I've got to go back and do some other stuff. First of all, that's a promise to every believer, and that gives me chills. What that tells me is this, that if my heart is open to God, and if I have received the king, and if I have opened my eyes to the realities of the kingdom, then the promise of God right here is this, that I'm going to hear more and I'm going to see more and more and more. See, I couldn't be more excited than I am right now about the kinds of things that I feel like God is teaching, not only me but our whole church, about the reality and the mysteries of the kingdom, the power, the glory, the gifts of the Spirit. We are beginning to see among us God move with sovereign power and kingdom authority among us, and people are being healed, people are being delivered. We're seeing it on a weekly basis. But one of the things I'm always aware of as we take little tiny baby steps and having God reveal to us the mysteries of the kingdom, one of the things that I'm constantly aware of is this. We've only just begun. We're taking these little tiny baby steps, and God is revealing things to us and illuminating things to us, but we haven't seen anything yet. I'm 35 years old, and when I get a hold of the fact that God says right here that if you have believed and you have received and you're a seeker, not only has it been granted to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom, but you're going to know more and more and more. I've got 30, 40, I don't know how many years of having more illumination, more revelation, more power, more exposure to who God is and what He wants to do in and through His people and His church by the power of the kingdom. That's a good word. There's a picture here I wanted you to see, though. And I don't know if I can even say this right. It's like sometimes I feel like I'm really ready to give this stuff, and other times I feel like some of the truth in this sermon, I'm going to discover it next week, and so it'll be too late to preach it then. In fact, some of it, even while I'm standing here, is kind of beginning to germinate. I believe that the parables that Jesus is moving into right now, the parables themselves are parables. What do you mean by that? Get me. Hang on with me here a second. One of the patterns that we are going to see Jesus do is this. Like in verses 4 through 9, he tells a story, but he doesn't make a spiritual connection. And then he says to them, what you need to know is that to some of you it's been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom, but others of you are not going to get it. And then he takes the disciples aside, away from those who don't have eyes to see and ears to hear. He takes them aside, and he simply tells them the truth. He illuminates them, okay? And it's kind of a story. I've heard that all my life, and I've always been a little bit upset. That's kind of mean, isn't it? That's a little bit mean. Why did he take them aside, illuminate them, and not tell the other Pharisees? Maybe if they would have heard, they would have connected. Maybe they would have. In fact, I'm aware that over the next couple of weeks, I'm going to make the connections for you, and there will be even possibly unbelievers who will understand the connections, even from the physical to the spiritual. But I believe his whole parable thing is a parable of what? What? You're talking goofy today. here's what I see 2,000 years ago Jesus to those who had ears to hear and eyes to see told a story and then he took them aside and illuminated them and he told them here's what it really means here's the depth of it you want to know something? Jesus does the same thing now in fact he's doing it right now right now to some of you who've got eyes to see who've got ears to hear to some of you in whom the Holy Spirit lives You see, what Jesus said to the disciples 2,000 years ago is this. When I go away, I'm going to send another, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit. And you know what he's going to do? He's going to do what I did. I used to take you physically after the sight, explain to you spiritual truth. Now you're going to have an indwelling resident Holy Spirit, and he is going to do exactly that same thing every day of your life. Right now, while some of you hear spiritual truth, you know what happens? It's for some of you, like hearing a story where there's no spiritual connection. But others of you have a resident Holy Spirit, and He's explaining the parable to you. He's explaining the mysteries to you, and it makes sense. Have you ever sat in church? Have you ever sat in church, and you're hearing truth, and your heart is just exploding, and you're excited, and you're thrilled, and you're going, yeah, that makes sense, that makes sense, I understand that, that's really good. And then you look at the guy next to you, or somebody else somewhere else in the church, and you're looking at him, you're going, isn't that great? And they look at you going, what? What? What is great? I don't get it. I mean, what is that? what's going on there? I think what's going on there, we see it every day. Exactly what Jesus does here with the disciples, taking them off to the side, explaining, illuminating, happens every day right here. The resident Holy Spirit, like Jesus 2,000 years ago, takes spiritual truth, illuminates it to your mind, and people who do not have the life of God in them don't get it. Might be real religious, might be involved in the church. But to you, who have received the King, and the kingdom. To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. For whoever has the kingdom, whoever has the king, whoever has opened their heart and received by faith the gift, they're going to get it more and more and more. In fact, in verse 16 it says, but blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear. When I first read that, I thought, Boy, that means I've got really good eyes and I've got blessed eyes. What that means is you need to know, Dave, that you've been given a gift. Your eyes are really blessed. You are one blessed guy. You know why? Because by your faith and your openness and your willingness to see and your willingness to hear, I blessed your eyes and I blessed your ears. Same thing for you. You need to know that you are one blessed group of people. You know why? Because by the Spirit of God living in you, you have been given eyes to see and ears to hear the mysteries of the kingdom. the wonder of salvation, the wonder of his power. You need to know that you're one blessed person. You need to sit and soak it in. To be able to sit, to be able to study, to listen, to watch what God's doing in his church and then begin to understand, begin to see, begin to learn. You ever wonder why the word of God is so rich to you? I mean, you know, you can't wait to get to church. Now, some of you can, but you just can't wait because you're going to hear something from the Word. It's so rich to you. It's so exciting. It's so precious. You ever wonder why it makes sense to you? Why it clicks with your life? You ever wonder about that? I think the reason that you need to understand, and now you need to just thank God for the blessing, is that God has sent a resident spirit, and his job is to illuminate you to truth. Blessed are your eyes. You need to know you're a blessed guy. You're a blessed girl. the reason I understand truth some of you might think is because we got good teaching if you get good teaching you'll understand truth you want to know something please get this there's a lot of people who hear very good teaching better than you've ever heard you know what the mysteries of the kingdom never become evident to them why? because the mysteries of the kingdom are not revealed through just good teaching I think good teaching confirms the mysteries of the kingdom there are people I've known who've never sat under good teaching but you know what's interesting you talk to them for a while and you can tell right now they know God they understand the power of God they move and are filled with the spirit why is that because the spirit is the teacher blessed are your eyes because you see blessed are your ears because you see here by faith they received they seeked the kingdom and God gave to you and God gave to me by the spirit eyes to see and ears to hear but some people never see it the truth is concealed sad fact is this some people by their unbelief like the Pharisees who had a theology that said no the kingdom didn't come that's a demon sad fact is that by the rejection of the king and by the rejection of the kingdom, they cannot see. They cannot see. To them, the mystery of the kingdom and the power of the Spirit remains a mystery, and they sound like impossible riddles. Like the Pharisees, these people might study their Bibles, they might dissect doctrine, they might categorize theology, but when the voice of God is heard, they don't hear it. And when the power of God is seen, they don't see it. They figure it's a demon. And they heard it and heard it and heard it and they wouldn't see it and they wouldn't hear it, And now there comes a point, according to this, where they can't see and they can't hear. But to them it has not been granted, verse 11. I'm not going to give the ability in their heart to see the mysteries. 12b, but whoever does not have granted to them the knowledge of the mysteries, but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away. Interesting, just a little interjection here. While the believer and one who is being taught by the resident spirit has a life of deeper and deeper illumination and an ascending awareness of the power and the life of God in their life, the one who has shut himself off to the king and to the kingdom has a descending experience. Less and less and less and less. Darker and darker and darker and darker. In verse 14 there's this prophecy, and in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, You will keep on hearing. You're going to sit in church. They're going to sit in church. They're going to come. But you won't understand. Why? Because the mysteries of the kingdom are revealed by the Spirit, not by your hearing and studying it all day long. And you will keep on seeing, but you're not going to perceive it. For the heart of this people has become dull. They have said no to it. That's a demon. And with their ears they scarcely hear, and they have closed their eyes. Acts 13, 40 and 41 gives a warning that we need to hear as well, and it's ominous to me. It says this, Take heed, therefore, so that the same thing spoken in the prophets may not come to pass among you. Behold, you scoffers, ah, God's not real, marvel and perish, for I am accomplishing a work in your days, a work which you will never believe, though someone would sit down and describe it to you. They could describe it to you, and you'll hear it, but you won't hear it, and you'll see it, but you won't see it. Unless they should see with their eyes and open their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and return, then I would heal them. Let me just close with this. Hearts that shut out the king and the kingdom are hearts that become dull and they could be filled with religion and they could be filled with studying. But if people begin by an act of their will to open their eyes and their heart and return, he will heal. You need to hear this. The mysteries of the kingdom of God, whether it's salvation by grace, whether it's the moving of the Spirit among his people for healing and deliverance and just the manifested presence of God, the realities and the power of kingdom cannot be come to by being smart. They cannot be come to by figuring it out with your mind, by intellectualizing. It remains hidden to the proud. It remains hidden to the self-sufficient. The mysteries of the kingdom remain hidden to the self-righteous who are ever learning but never come to the truth. The mysteries of the kingdom come to the heart that is hungry, to the heart that is seeking. And it comes by the Spirit as an immeasurable gift. And when the Spirit invades, you know what's exciting to me? This is going to sound crass. When the Spirit of God invades the life, Even a stupid person understands the deep things of God. Think about that. It isn't about being smart. It's about being open and having a heart that says, God, your kingdom has come. I want to be a part of that kingdom. I want to receive it. I want to understand it. I want to move in it. I want to get more and more and more and more of it. It comes when we cry with the psalmists in Psalm 119, 18, open my eyes that I may see. Open my eyes that I may see the mysteries of the kingdom, the power of the kingdom. God, I can't figure this out. If I am to see, if I am to know, if I am to understand, I'm not going to come to that knowledge and understanding by figuring it out with my mind. My only hope is you. Illumine me. Fill me. Make me aware. Give me eyes to see and ears to hear. If the kingdom isn't here, this makes absolutely no sense. These parables, we shouldn't go on. we can't go on as we move through this the mysteries of the kingdom are going to be revealed to you by the spirit thank God for that but some will turn their ears off and some will turn their eyes off be aware that the warning comes to you seeing they don't see hearing they don't hear let's pray Father I pray that you would take what's spoken here and sort it out make sense of your truth by your spirit even do your work of illumination right now among us give us eyes to see the reality and the power of your kingdom so that we can begin to understand the mysteries of the kingdom and I pray in Jesus name Amen Thank you.
