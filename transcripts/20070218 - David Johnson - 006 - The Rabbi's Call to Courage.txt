Let's pray as we move to the ministry of the Word this morning. Father, I thank you for the work of your Spirit already among us in the context of worship as inbreakings of your kingdom come, as we lift our hearts and our eyes and our voices to you and the things that make you dim to us during the week become clear and it results in praise and life. And I pray, Father, now that as we move to the ministry of the words, that that work of your spirit would continue within breakings of your kingdom. I pray for eyes to see and ears to hear, for we confess that every single one of us in this room are blind. At certain levels, we see, but we are blind, and we hear, but we are deaf. And so we pray for your spirit to bring sight to blind eyes, even ours. Because your word says that when the kingdom comes, blind people see and deaf people hear. We think that sometimes us help us see and help us hear. The marvelous realities of your kingdom and your kingdom's breaking through into our actual lives right here, right now. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. A couple of weeks ago, in the context of the series we're in, where we're coming to know Jesus as our rabbi, who says to anyone, I love that, he says to anyone who wants to follow him, thereby becoming like him, lechachorai, come follow me. Well, a couple of weeks ago, we noticed a pattern of people doing just that, at least at first, eager to follow, like Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, in Matthew 4, verse 18, who immediately, upon meeting Jesus, this great rabbi left their nets and began to follow him. But soon, there were great multitudes following him, not just a few fishermen. A few verses later in Matthew 4, they were following him, multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and even from beyond the Jordan, at least in part because upon first hearing this great rabbi and seeing him do what he did, they were amazed. Matthew 7, Luke 20, Mark 1, for he spoke as one having authority, not as their teachers of the law, and an authority that was marked with power such that even demons obeyed his command. But the pattern that we noticed was this, that often as quickly as these followers of the rabbi would begin to gather, they would also fall away. John 6, 66, many of his disciples, his Talmudim, who had been following him for a while, withdrew from him, not walking with him anymore. Luke 4, 22, remember this? This is when he announced the nature of his kingdom in the synagogue. And when he was done talking about the fact that in him, this kingdom was going to be breaking into earth. All the synagogue, after hearing him say that, was speaking well of him and wondering at the gracious words that were falling from his lips. But six verses later, those same people in that same synagogue were filled with rage, Driving him out of the temple, out of the city, up a hill, trying to throw him off a cliff. Same thing, same pattern, Matthew 21. The people were together singing, Hosanna, Hosanna. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. One week later, same crowd, crucify him, crucify him. Our withdrawal, by the way, from the rabbi is far more subtle than that. No one in this room or no one that you know would cry, crucify him. Crucify him. Our withdrawal from the rabbi is more subtle. Our withdrawal is embodied in the settling that we do for a version of Jesus, a version of this rabbi that is more to our liking, a rabbi that makes me feel comfortable, a rabbi that makes me feel safe, a rabbi that affirms everything I already believe about life and how it works. But when we do that, we're not walking with him anymore. The question is, why? What explains this pattern of people throughout the age? It happens today, being enamored but then falling away. Well, sometimes the answer to that is as simple as this. The cost is too high. The outcome of following this rabbi that we've been talking about is too uncertain. It's like when he said to the scribe that we've spoken of often in Matthew chapter 8, the scribe who came to Jesus and said, I will follow you wherever you go. The classic example of someone who is a follower of Jesus. But as soon as Jesus says, well, that's great, but foxes have holes, birds have nests, the Son of Man does not have a place to lay his head, and if you follow me, it might be like that. this guy disappears, maybe looking for a rabbi who would give him something else, comfort and ease, maybe health and wealth. I'll follow that rabbi. But often, this pattern is explained, particularly in Jesus' day, by something more involved than that, requiring this understanding of history and culture in terms of why it was happening in Jesus' day. We went over this a couple of weeks ago, and this is what we need to understand, to understand the pattern that rooted in the minds and hearts of most first century Torah-observant Jews was what we call the kingdom of God expectation. This kingdom of God expectation was this, that God, they all believed this, that God would one day break through into human history through Israel. And when he did, whatever else would happen, this would happen. Everything that was wrong would be made right. And what was most wrong in the eyes of first century Jews was Rome, the oppressor. Now, in Jesus' day, there was no shortage of ideas as to how this wrong could be made, right? How this problem could be solved, how the kingdom of God could indeed, would indeed, break through into human history and therefore blow up the Romans and set particularly Israel free. The zealots certainly had an idea of how that could happen, and we went into this in great detail a couple of weeks ago. Their idea was violence in force will be better at Rome than their own game. We will do power over. But so did the Herodians have an idea of how it would work in the Sadducees, and their idea was simply to cooperate, collaborate with Rome, and at least get a piece of the pie, and become, in the name of religion, and rich, and famous, and oppress the poor as they did, and as we detailed a couple of weeks ago. But the Pharisees and the Essenes had a plan too, and that was to withdraw. See, the real problem, and the real reason the kingdom isn't coming is because of all these sinners. So if we get rid of all the sinners, or withdraw from them, the kingdom will come and blow up all these things that are wrong. The problem is none of those plans were working. So when this rabbi named Jesus came along with some obvious authority and power that no one could deny. He's really got some juice on him, talking about the kingdom of God being within reach through him. Hope rose. Well, maybe this is the guy. And if it wasn't hope, at least there was some interest. And with that interest came the crowds, the followers. But as he began to clarify, as he always did and always does the nature of his kingdom, what he meant by what he said relative to the kingdom, it became pretty clear pretty quick that the kingdom of which he spoke was not like other kingdoms and wouldn't be particularly helpful in the building of their kingdoms, whether you were a zealot or a Herodian or a Roman, the kingdom that he was going to bring was not going to be particularly helpful indeed. The kingdom of which he spoke would stand in opposition to, you need to get this, and seek to subvert every other kingdom, be they political, personal, economic, or religious, not just Rome's kingdom. See, as long as, again, you've got to be a first century Jew here in your mind. It really gets what's really going on here. As long as it sounded to a first century Jew like the kingdom he was speaking of would destroy the Roman oppressors, everything he was saying sounded like good news, the gospel. But his kingdom message, particularly the way he said this kingdom would come, not through power over techniques, but power under. I came to be served. I did not come to be served, but I came to serve and to show you how to find your life by losing your life. Are you kidding me? His kingdom message didn't just confront the Romans, which everybody loved. His kingdom message confronted the zealots, who hated the Romans, but it didn't just confront the zealots. didn't just confront violent kingdoms. It also confronted political, economic, religious kingdoms as well, kingdoms that were embodied in Jesus' day in, the Herodians, the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, all of which made his message. Once you began to dial into what he was actually saying, a very different message, indeed a dangerous message, Because if his message of the kingdom he is speaking of is true, what that means is all these other kingdoms are going down, including mine. Not as interested anymore. See, this whole thing, once you began to really hear what Jesus was saying, our rabbi was saying about the kingdom of God, it made the kingdom he was speaking of, and if I was going to associate with it a very real threat to kingdoms of every kind, which means that if I am going to follow this rabbi now, I might be alone from time to time. I mean, honestly, I mean, who's my group? And it's interesting because Jesus did get people to follow him, disciples, Talmid, Talmadim from every group. Remember last week, or a couple weeks ago, Simon, who was a zealot, said, that's not the way I'm going to follow this rabbi. And there were some Pharisees even who followed him as well. but one of the scary things is if I follow this rabbi, I lost my group. Which means, among other things, if you're going to follow this rabbi, you are going to need courage. I want to talk this morning about, in the context of what we're calling the way of the rabbi, if you are going to be among his talmudim, among the things you're going to need is courage. See, some of us thought all it was going to take was going to church and singing some song. It's interesting to me, because lots of people still have a picture of Jesus, and I do too at times. It's this flannel graph Jesus, and it's a version of Jesus that is true to a level, but there's just so much more to him than this. But the picture is this, of him being a kind of docile, inoffensive guru who just went around inviting children to sit on his lap and holding cute little lambs up to his face for pictures, encouraging people to be nice. The problem with that, among others, is this, that people don't generally get crucified for stuff like that. For bland, innocuous moralizing, people get ignored for stuff like that. He's a nice guy, whatever. But people get crucified when powerful kingdoms are threatened. Be they personal, yours, political, religious, economic, think with me for a moment, of the kingdoms of this world. I mean, one way to get a picture of the kingdoms of this world, picture in your mind the newspaper. And now in your mind, just kind of go from the front page, from the war to the strife to the world to the metro section to the business section to the sports section. How many of you know that in the kingdoms of this world, there's not a lot of good news for the unprotected, for the uneducated, for the unattractive, that there's not a lot of good news in the kingdoms of this world for the very young, the very old, for the people who have no voice, for the people who have no choice. It can prompt some people when you kind of get a picture of how bad it is in the kingdoms of this world, it prompts some people to pray the way some people in Jesus' day prayed, Lord, get us out of here so we can go up there and be with you. Now, if you were with us a couple of weeks ago, you might remember who it was in Jesus' day that prayed that way. That way there was a group. Who were they? Do you remember? The Essenes. Went out to live in the deserts, to be the pure group, or get us out of here. They're thinking something like this. The world is a mess and getting messier every day. We're going to heaven when we die because we're in the right group. We're in the pure group. And since we couldn't possibly make a difference in the way the world is, in fact, if we get very close to the world, we ourselves won't be pure anymore. So they withdrew and basically said, we will pine for heaven, we will wait for the rapture when we will be ejected from this horrible place, and God comes back to blowtorch the whole thing. And so we pray, Lord, get us out of here so we can go up there and be with you. I've talked about this before. I call it Star Trek praying. Beam me up, Scotty. You know, it's just like I just wait here and hope I avoid all this junk. Accept, accept. You can live that way if you want, unless you want to follow the rabbi. Because this rabbi, Jesus, taught his Talmudim to pray a different way, to have the direction of their entire life move. a different way. Not, Lord, get us out of here so we can go up there. But Lord, help us bring down here what's going on up there. Thy kingdom come where? On earth. Indeed, the way that would be taught to pray by our rabbi was, Lord, help us become the kind of people who are following you as our rabbi in such a way that what's up there would begin through us to literally break through down here into all the kingdoms of this world, be they personal, my personal little kingdoms, or political, economic, or religious. And so we pray thy kingdom come to our marriages, to things that practical, to our relationships. Thy kingdom come to our families and churches and schools and neighborhoods. Thy kingdom come to our cities. Thy will be done on earth. And when it does, you know how you'll know? Because sometimes people get this mixed up. They think things are consistent with the kingdom that aren't at all. You know how you'll know the kingdom is breaking through into a city? Here's how you'll know. It'll be good news for the poor. In fact, the poor will tell you. Kingdoms come. Somebody cares about us in the name of God. That's what Jesus said in Matthew 4, Luke 4, by the way. When my kingdom comes, the Spirit of the Lord is anointed me. The Spirit of the Lord is anointed me because his spirit is on me to preach good news to the poor. And when the kingdom comes, it's good news for the poor. That's how you can tell it's come. And it'll be released to captives. And people who are blind will begin to see physically, spiritually as well. It'll mean freedom and healing for the trampled. And people who are far off will be brought near, and dead people in their sin will be made alive together with Christ. That's what it looks like when the kingdom comes. But to do all of that, to follow our rabbi into that kind of living, requires, among other things, courage. Because it appears at times, and you know it's true, Unless you're an Essene and you're kind of living off in some fantasy world by yourself, the reason it's going to require courage is because at times, this business of bringing the kingdom to bear against the kingdoms of this world feels to be against all odds. Because the kingdoms of this world are the ones that look the biggest, the strongest, the most eternal, the ones that never lose. So for the rest of our time today, as I talk about our need for courage, if we're going to follow this rabbi, you know what I want to talk about? I want to talk about our rabbi's courage. Because everything we learn about life, we learn from our rabbi. And the whole thing we've learned about this, about disciples being a follower of a rabbi, is that you'd want to become like him. And so part of the development of my courage is to see it in my rabbi. And see it in some of his talmudim as well. and not just courage, by the way, but a courage rooted in faith. I mean, I think of this this way very often, but Jesus was a person of vibrant faith. And I would translate faith in this context this way, confidence. That the kingdom that he was declaring, the kingdom that he was promoting, inviting people into, he lived with an abiding, vibrant confidence that that kingdom was bigger and stronger and broader and more real than all the kingdoms of this world, including Rome. And to believe that took an enormous amount of faith. But without that kind of faith, you would never have the courage to stand against Rome. Get the connection? You need to. Now to give you a glimpse of that courage and faith, I need to bring you once again into what we've been doing for the last several weeks, the first century world of Jesus. I need to give you some history so you can really enter into the scene. In Jesus' day, the most powerful kingdom of the world was Rome, as we've been saying. Rome ruled the world. But Caesars, the Caesars, ruled Rome. Let me tell you a little bit about the Caesars in Jesus' day. best known to us as Julius Caesar, but actually Augustus Caesar, his son, was probably the most powerful and successful of all the Caesars, bringing almost the entire world under Roman rule. And it was this Caesar, Augustus Caesar, who was spoken of in the Gospels as being the one who wanted to take a census, thereby bringing Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem where Jesus was born. So Augustus Caesar was the man in Jesus' day, at least in his birth, his early years. And Augustus Caesar, as I said, brought the entire world under Roman rule during his reign. And that fact was a monumental moment in human history. Think about it. The entire world, one king, one kingdom. And of his kingdom, I'm talking Augustus Caesar, of his kingdom there shall be no end, was actually an anthem that was sung by followers of this Caesar Augustus. In 17 B.C., his parliament declared Augustus Caesar to be God incarnate on earth. Caesar Augustus, God in flesh. Temples were built in his honor. Songs were sung, which would be the equivalent of worship songs to Augustus Caesar, declaring him to be, among other things, the Prince of Peace. a popular phrase in that day was Caesar is Lord, which makes the phrase Jesus is Lord. It kind of puts a slightly different spin on it. We say Jesus is Lord, and it comes from a place of devotion, and it's a good thing to say, but you need to know in this context, for someone to say Jesus is Lord in the culture where Caesar was Lord, I hope you hear a bit of defiance in that. It's like people going, no, he's not. No, he's not. Jesus. There's a popular slogan written by, actually, Virgil, who was a Roman poet who was quite a fan of Augustus. The popular slogan was this, Salvation is to be found in none other than Augustus Caesar, for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby you can be saved. Whoa, whoa, whoa, that sounds familiar. But what Augustus Caesar meant by saved, kind of interesting, was allowed to live. Indeed, that's how it would work. His army would go into villages and declare, Caesar is Lord. And if you said, Amen, Hallelujah, Praise the Lord, Caesar, you were saved. Which means you weren't crucified. You were allowed to live. Now, it's amazing when you go into a place, a city, and declare that Caesar is Lord, and if you don't believe that Caesar is Lord, you're going to get crucified. It's amazing how many conversions you get. Amen. Hell, I believe that. I'll sign the card. Not a lot of devotion. Not much love. Not much following of his way. But if I can avoid the cross, if I can avoid hell, sign me up. Whoa. There's salvation in none other, but no other name. And then now they have a common slogan. People sang it. And it really does put another spin on what Peter said. In Acts 4.12, and it makes me, it makes, something rises in me when I get it, because this gives me, this helps me tap into Peter's courage. But you have to have, if you're going to follow this, Rabbi, Acts 4, let me set the scene for you. He's on trial, Peter's on trial. And again, to just create some tension here and wonder how can you say this in this kind of context, I'd want them to be my friends. He is on trial before the very same people who crucified Jesus, Caiaphas, the high priest, Sadducees, and the rulers of the people, and full of the Holy Spirit, it says in Acts 4, verse 8, which, by the way, helps. It helps a lot. And full of the Holy Spirit, Peter said to them, rulers and elders of the people, let it be known to you and to all the peoples of Israel that Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, my rabbi, whom you crucified, remember, God raised him from the dead. And I'm here to tell you that there is indeed salvation, but not in Caesar. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which you can be saved. By the time, by the way, by the time Peter said this, Julius Caesar was dead. Augustus Caesar, dead. Jesus the Nazarene, alive forevermore, says the apostle John in the Revelation, where he calls Jesus the first and the last, the living one. Now, the living one, that's a neat phrase. I love that phrase, and it stirs me. But B. John again, first century, first century, when he calls Jesus the living one, what you need to hear is this. It's almost as if he's saying, Augustus, Caesar, big guy, scary guy, whole world. Oh, yeah, he's the dead one. Jesus the Nazarene, the first and the last. Oh, yeah, the living one. So who are you going to serve? What kingdom are you going to live in? Who are you going to follow? Who's your rabbi now? Because your courage to follow the rabbi will come directly from which one you believe. Which kingdom is real? Which king will you serve? In addition to the Caesars, there were the Herods. We said that on purpose. There were a number of Herods. These rulers ruled for Caesar in Israel. So they were kind of puppet rulers for Caesar. The first and most powerful of the Herods was Herod the Great. He was kind of the granddaddy of them all. He was a megalomaniac. He was paranoid. He had a tendency of tendency. He killed anybody he didn't trust, including members of his own family. He had 10 or 11 wives. Miriam was a wife that it was said that he loved her. It was the only wife he ever had he loved, but he became suspicious of her as well and killed her too. The guy's a little nuts. He was also brilliant. He was an incredible builder of cities, considered by some historians not only the wealthiest man in Jesus' day, but possibly the wealthiest man ever, who secured his wealth, however, through a crippling system of taxation, which created in Israel, and we've talked about this over the last couple of weeks, massive wealth for very few and crippling poverty for everybody else. Among the things Herod the Great was best known for was, as I said, the building of cities and palaces in his name and in his honor. On Masada, he built a three-story palace with Italian columns of solid marble, hot and cold water for baths and hot tubs, and a pool on the roof in Masada, in the middle of the desert on the top of a mountain. His crowning jewel, building-wise, was a building called the Herodian. Let me tell you a story about that. He wanted to build a palace, and he wanted to build one between Jerusalem and Edom, which is his hometown. He was an Edomite, and he wanted to build something between the two. So he picked a spot right between the two, but there was a problem. The problem was this. He wanted to build this palace on top of a mountain, but halfway between Jerusalem and Edom, there wasn't a mountain. So he solved the problem by building a mountain. True story. Look at the picture. It stands to this day. That's Herod's mountain. And on top of that mountain, that's a present-day picture, obviously, but it still stands today. He built a mountain. With that in mind, picture now this. Jesus was with his disciples one day at a spot on the Mount of Olives, where you could see the Herodian palace, where you could see this huge mountain with the Dead Sea behind it, this huge mountain that said without words, this is the kingdoms of this world. I am the power. I will last forever. I am the one to whom you should bow. And he said to them in that scene, the most outrageous thing, Mark 11, that if you have faith, you could say to this mountain, be cast into the sea, and it will. To which, again, if you're a human being living then, hearing that, you might just go, oh, whatever. Because the mountain Jesus was talking about was not some metaphor of a mountain, and he wasn't talking about some mountain. He was talking about Herod's mountain. He was talking about more than Herod's mountain. He was talking about Herod's system. He was talking about the kingdoms of this world system that use power to crush and wealth, to impress and oppress and exploit particularly the least of these. See, among other things, what Jesus is saying here is this mountain can go into the sea if you believe. What he's saying among others is that the kingdoms of this world that look so big, I'm telling you, I know how hard this is to believe because it's what you see. These kingdoms of this world that look so big, that look so impressive, intimidating, powerful, and eternal aren't. Indeed, they're going down. So have faith. That's not some blobby, gooey faith. What he means by faith there is put your confidence in, right now, a different kind of kingdom with a different kind of king. Or don't. And keep serving the kingdoms of this world, but you're not following this rabbi anymore. It's just fascinating to me. In fact, this is where, you know, I hope it stirs in you this thing. I just want to be just like him. I'm not like him yet, but I want to be just like him. And what it is is how it seemed that Jesus was so not intimidated by the Herods of this world, by the Caesars, by the big mountains that looked impressive. He didn't hate them, but he wasn't impressed or intimidated by them. And it wasn't because he was such a tough guy. It was simply because he saw a different kingdom, much bigger than theirs. And if you don't see that kingdom, if you don't have confidence in that bigger story, faith, you'll never have the courage to stand against those kingdoms or not be impressed or intimidated by those kingdoms. Let me tell you a story that illustrates how he just wasn't intimidated. This one is dealing with one of Herod's sons, Archelaus. He's mentioned in Matthew 2, 22. Herod had died by this time, and Herod had three sons who lived. Made the cut somehow. And when Herod the Great died, they all wanted a piece of their dad's empire. So they went to Rome for Caesar to sort it out. In the meantime, as they're going to Rome to get their little piece of the pie, a delegation of 50 dignitaries from Jerusalem also went to Rome to basically say to Caesar, anyone but these three guys, particularly Archelaus, who they saw to be the most vile and dangerous to them of the three. So Caesar, and we don't know why exactly, but maybe to send just another message about who's the boss, you're not going to tell me what to do, appoints the one they dreaded most, Archelaus, to be the ruler of Judea. And when Archelaus got back, the first thing he did was call those 50 dignitaries in who went to Rome to try to undermine his ability to rule, brought them to himself, and had them executed in public. Point to point of that is this. He's a powerful, scary guy. He is a king. He has a kingdom. And if you're living in that day, the message is this. Don't mess with him. Don't mess with him. He's the one you bow to. You may not love him, but just be nice to him because he's the one who's got the power. He's the winner. With all of that in mind, consider Luke 19. Jesus in Luke 19 is about to teach a parable that you've heard before, and it's a parable that he's taught before in different places, the parable of the talents. But this time, when he's telling that parable, he's told at different times in different places. He's near Jerusalem, which is where Archelaus is ruling. So he sets up this parable he's taught before this way this time, verse 11, Luke 19. And while they were listening to these things, he that is Jesus went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem. In other words, he went on to tell it this way precisely because he was near Jerusalem. And they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to break in immediately. And he said, therefore, A certain old man went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself and then returned. And he called ten of his slaves and gave them ten minas and said to them, Do business with this until I come back. But his citizens hated him and sent the delegation after him, saying, We don't want this guy to reign over us. And it came about that when he returned, after receiving the kingdom, because the guy gave it to him anyway, he ordered that these slaves to whom he had given money be called to him in order that he might know what business they had done. And then he goes on in the text to tell the parable of the talents, and he ends in verse 27 with these words. But these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence. And every single person, again, go back into the scene, be there. This isn't Sunday school. Every single person who's hearing Jesus tell this story is thinking, this guy is in so much trouble. but Jesus had I love this guy he had the strangest way of acting like someone really was in a whole lot of trouble but it wasn't him why? how? he was just so tough I think he was tough but that's not why, here's why because Jesus saw a different kind of kingdom and he lived in it He heard it. He saw it much bigger and stronger than Herod's. And he was living in a much bigger story, much broader story than Herod's 40-year-old story. Herod, Herod, big guy, 40 years. And then he's gone. And Jesus says, yeah, that's a big deal. And he's gotten a lot of acclaim. And he's hurt a lot of people. I'm just living in a bigger story. So even if you kill me, I'm not living in that story. and that confidence is where courage comes from and over and over again throughout history this truth would be borne out that Herod's mountain's going down and the truth over and over again through history would be borne out and even be made visible in some of the most unlikely ways through some of the most unlikely people like a 14-year-old peasant girl named Mary. Now, in your mind, compare a 14-year-old girl, 14-year-old girl, Herod. Who's the big one? Who's the strong one? Who's going to make a difference for eternity? Breaks through through a 14-year-old peasant girl like Mary who simply says, in effect, I believe. And maybe she didn't say those words. Here's the word she said, Let it be done to me. And when she received the life of the Spirit, the seed was planted and it changed. It began to change the world. Luke 3, I love this. I love this one because it illustrates the same thing of what looks big is really little. What looks little is really big. And if you're blind, you won't see it. If you can't see it, you'll never have confidence in it. And if you don't have confidence in it, You'll never have the courage to follow this rabbi ever. It'll always be religion for you. That's all it'll ever be. Chapter 3, verse 1. I love this. It says this. Now in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, there's another Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was Tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was Tetrarch of the region of Idyria because it had all been split up between these brothers. These are all sons of Herod. And Trachonitis and Licinius was Tetrarch of Abilene. In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. Now, here's what I love about this. Why does Luke mention all those names before he says the word of the Lord came to John in the wilderness? Because it isn't random, and it isn't by accident. He's not just trying to create historical context, though it does create that. Here's why he does it. Because Luke here is identifying all the rulers of all the powers of the kingdoms of this world. Political kingdoms, their names are right there. Religious kingdoms, their names are right there. Economic kingdoms, their names are right there. But the word of the Lord, get this, didn't come to them. It didnít come to Caesar. It didnít cometo Pilate. It didnít come to Herodís sons or the chief priests of the temple. It didnít come to all the people who have all the power and all the status and all the money in the kingdoms of this world. It came to an untitled, unwashed, rag-wearing, locust-eating, hermit in the desert, which means, among other things, that in the kingdom of God, everything gets turned upside down. Because now in the kingdom of God, this kingdom that Jesus is speaking of, who counts and who doesn't, who makes a difference and who doesn't, who's successful and who isn't, who has power and who doesn't, who's in a whole lot of trouble and who isn't, gets all mixed up. It's what Dallas Willard calls the great reverse, where the first will be last and the last will be first, where those who exalt themselves will be brought low and those who humble themselves will be exalted. It's where a young peasant girl named Mary from a little town called Nazareth is told that she would bear a son conceived by the Holy Spirit and you shall call his name Jesus And when she says, let it be done, the world began to change. How subversive is it? The kingdom of God. But if you don't have eyes to see it, ears to hear it, many don't. You'll never have confidence in it. And if you don't have confidence in it, you'll never have the courage to follow this rabbi into this kind of living. More happen. but all of this makes you start to wonder what's going on here well I'll tell you what's going on here the kingdom of God is turning all our ideas of who counts and who doesn't who's successful and who isn't what matters and what doesn't who has power and who doesn't upside down so that now you just never know who God might use. You just never know who our rabbi might call and say, lachathorai, come, follow me. I mean, he might call a locust-eating, camel-wearing, Herm in the desert. Who'd have thunk it? He might call a zealot like Simon, or a fisherman like Peter, or a prostitute like Mary. He might even call you. or me? Come follow me. But here's the question. Do you want to follow this rabbi? Do you believe that this kingdom is real? Or would you like to find a rabbi who would help make your kingdoms better than they are? Then you have a different rabbi. this is a different kingdom, a different king than the kingdoms of this world he's not interested at all in making your kingdom the great one, or mine last story, Luke 13 some Pharisees warned Jesus in verse 31 again, some Pharisees became his talmud from every group, and when they began to follow Jesus part of their pain was, I lost my group, I don't have a group I'm a follower of the rabbi, I hope he's right you ever wonder that by the way that would take me on a bunny trail I am so and so are you many of you are so into the rabbi every once in a while I go I hope he's right do you think the disciples are I hope he's right because I've given everything to this it's okay to wonder about that in fact it tells me you're really following him if you get scared if you're not scared I don't know if you get it how radical this message is so these Pharisees warn Jesus Herod wants to kill you And this Herod was Herod the Tetrarch, one of Herod's sons. Tetrarch, interesting, it means quarter. Whenever you see that phrase, and I read that in Luke 19 where all these Tetrarchs, Philip the Tetrarch, it means they were given a quarter of their father's kingdom. They were a quarter king. Jesus' response to the fact that Herod wants to kill him is this in verse 32. Well, go tell that fox. Behold, I'm casting out demons. whether he kills me or not. And I'm performing cures today, and I'm going to do it tomorrow. But on the third day, I will reach my goal. Now, break that verse down in a couple of ways. There's a couple of features here. When Jesus calls him a fox, it's very significant. In our day, we might speak of someone who's as sly as a fox, and it speaks to the fox's cunning. and even if they were an adversary, we would be saying it with a tinge of respect because they're cunning, and that would be a positive thing, I suppose. But that is not true in Jesus' day. Indeed, rabbis would often compare foxes and lions to teach life lessons. Lions, in the metaphor and the symbolism, were majestic and powerful. Lions were the ones who would make the kill. foxes were scavengers. They would show up after all the work was done and take what's left. And they would look real big and intimidating, and they'd have blood all over themselves because they were eating what was left. But what they were were lion wannabes. They were posers. And the fact is that that's exactly what people in Israel thought of this Herod, the Tetrarch, who was now threatening Jesus. In their minds, Caesar was the lion. In fact, Herod the Great, who was the father of these tetrarchs, these quarter kings, was the lion. Herod the tetrarch and all of his brothers were quarter kings. They were Caesar Herod wannabes. They were mini-me. So that's what Jesus is saying when he calls Herod a fox, but he's saying more than that. For Jesus is saying that Herod is the wrong kind of king with the wrong kind of power and the wrong kind of kingdom for as rich and powerful and in control and impressive and scary as this guy looks right now, he is not a king at all. He is a temporary ruler of a temporary kingdom, so go tell that fox that Caesar wannabe, that lip-syncing, milly-vanilly poser. That if he thinks he can stop me with threats like he's going to kill me, he's wrong, because I will manifest my kingdom. And I will cast out demons, and I will heal the sick, and I will empower my Talmudim to keep that thing going. And on the third day, I will reach my goal. You just need to know, you do know this. We've spoken of this before. Third day. The third day is symbolic language, biblically, because the third day, remember what day that is? That's the Lord's day. The third day is Resurrection Day. The third day is Victory Day. And the third day is a very good day because the third day is the day God shows up. The third day, beloved, is the day that reminds you and me. And by the way, the third day needs to remind you and me every day that we are living in a much bigger story than all the Herods of this world. but somewhere along the line we need to decide and maybe re-decide and maybe it's not even about some of you it might be about deciding some of you it might this morning be about remembering what you forgot because we forget that we believe that there is a kingdom to which we've been invited that is much bigger than all the kingdoms of this world. Because if you don't believe that, if you don't have confidence in this kind of kingdom, you will never have the courage to follow this rabbi because courage comes from believing that what the rabbi says about life is true. Notice finally this, verse 34. it's in verse 34 someplace chapter 13 Jesus says oh Jerusalem Jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who sent her how often I wanted to gather your children together just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings but you would not have it it's weird to me he uses a fox to characterize Herod just a few verses previous and a hen to characterize himself it's odd to me. It is odd, but it's intentional. Let me explain. Think for a moment of the juxtaposition of a fox and a hen. When a fox breaks into the hen house, what weapons does the hen have? How does the hen protect her chick? There's only one way, to spread out her wings and cover them and to give herself up to the fox for the chicks so they can live. See, the only way she can save them is to die for them. So it looks like the fox wins. And that's the problem with the kingdoms of this world. There are times it looks like they win. But there's one place. Where a hen beats a fox. You know where that is? In the kingdom of God. There's one time when a hen beats a fox. You know when that is? On the third day. And the third day is a very good day. That's the Lord's day. That's resurrection day. But you'd have to actually believe that this kingdom of which I speak is real and that the way you come to life in it is to give your life away for it to give you any courage or any hope. Because if you don't believe that this kingdom is real and that the way to find your life in it is to give your life away, then you'll never find the courage to actually follow this rabbi very far at all. It will never be anything but religion to you. Ever. you know sometimes I wonder from time to time Jesus paused knowing that what he was saying and what he was doing would surely get him across I wonder if in his humanity it was ever tempting for him to just settle down and be you know maybe the most popular rabbi in the synagogue and just be a really good teacher of Torah to just tell people how to love God more. But he kept on saying these things. And he kept on living this way. And he kept on manifesting the kingdom and exhibiting immense joy, even though he knew with utter certainty that they would put him on a cross for what he said and what he did. He kept on speaking, and he kept living out loud and loving the least. When I put all that together, I know it may sound kind of dopey at some level. It makes me feel proud of him. And it blows me away that he would say to me, Lechakarai, Dave, come, follow me. And if you follow me, me, not some invention of me, me, you can become like me. Wouldn't that be something? But to have the courage to follow him, you'd have to believe. And to believe, you'd have to see. And some of us are blind. we have good news because when the kingdom breaks through you know one of the things that happens blind people see deaf people hear I think there are degrees of blindness and degrees of deafness that's why I said when I started the service all of us are blind I mean if you think you see at all You scare me. We see in part, we all see in part, but part of our journey is, oh, God, help us see. Because the more you see, the more confident you will become that this kingdom is real. And with that confidence will come courage to follow this rabbi wherever you go. So let's close in prayer. Would you stand with me as we close? as I pray I'm going to ask anybody from the prayer team to come while I'm praying and just kind of bring yourself up front and make yourself available to anyone who needs prayers we close but I just want to pray just just be quiet before the Lord and ask the Spirit Holy Spirit like a gentle breeze, I pray you blow. I pray, Father, by your Spirit, like water you would flow. I pray for inbreakings of your kingdom right now in this place. We acknowledge our blindness. And Father, you said that when the kingdom comes, anointing was on you to bring sight to blind eyes. And I pray, Father, that one of the effects of this word and the work of your spirit among us today is in ways we can't maybe even put words around. We're walking out of here seeing some things dimly, but there's some things coming into focus about the kingdom of God and our life in it. And as we do that, courage is rising. I pray, Father, for release of captives. I pray, Father, as I'm speaking these words, that those who are feeling very, very far off would be brought near. I pray for some among us who are dead, absolutely dead in their spirit, in their sin, in life, would be by your Spirit even now, be being brought alive. Holy Spirit, come, move, stir. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done right here. right now. And all God's people said, Amen, Amen, Amen.
