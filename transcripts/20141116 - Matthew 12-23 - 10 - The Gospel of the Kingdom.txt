Our scripture reading today is taken from Mark's Gospel, the first chapter, and Matthew's Gospel, the fourth chapter. The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. Immediately coming up over the water, he saw the heavens opening and the spirit like a dove descending upon him. But after John had been taken into custody, Jesus withdrew into Galilee. And from that time on, he began preaching the gospel of God, saying, The time is fulfilled. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel. And as he continued to go throughout all of Galilee, news about him spread into all of Syria and even Decapolis and beyond the Jordan. And as it did, he kept on teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks, Robin. the gospel of the kingdom, the good news of God, the gospel according to Jesus Christ. It's all about the kingdom. Let's pray as we begin. The kind of life and energy and effect that can only be generated by your spirit, I pray, be done among us in Jesus' name. Amen. Brian McLaren in his book, The Secret Message of Jesus, begins it with a series of questions I found compelling and indeed a bit provocative when he simply asks several times in different ways, what if Jesus of Nazareth was right, more right and more right in different ways than we have ever realized? What if Jesus had a message that truly could change the world, but we're prone to miss the point of it, to minimize it or distort it, what if many have carried on a religion and faithfully celebrated Jesus in ritual and art, teach about Jesus in sermons and books, sing about Jesus in songs and hymns, theorize about Jesus in seminaries and classrooms, but somewhere along the way have missed the rich and radical treasures hidden in the essential message of Jesus. But what is the essential message of Jesus? Which is actually the question we began to ask last week when we began to ask this question, what exactly is the gospel? With this clarification, we're talking about the gospel according to Jesus, a gospel referred to in Mark 1 that Robin just read as the gospel of Jesus Christ. It's also called in Mark 1, the gospel of God in Matthew 4. Jesus himself, when he began teaching and proclaiming in all of Galilee, he was teaching and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. Matthew 4, 23, saying, the kingdom of heaven is within your reach. It is at hand. It is something you can access and enter into right here and right now. So it's not just heaven when you die, which is one of the major points we made last week, because the rule and reign of God is accessible to ordinary people, just like you and just like me, and it's accessible right here and right now. But all of that that we dealt with last week, it was part of a larger question that we've been asking actually for several weeks, a couple of months, as a matter of fact, about who we are as a church. So who are we as a church? What is the church? Why are we here? What is our purpose? What is our mission? What is our message? Does anybody know what is the gospel? All of which are pretty basic questions, I think. And there could be an assumption on the part of some that they're too basic to even go into deeply because we all know about these things. But we think these are really important questions, particularly right now in the life of our church where we think it's time to be as clear as we know how to be as a church about our core values and our core beliefs because those core values and beliefs speak to who we are. If you're going to answer the question, who are we, you've got to get down into what do we fundamentally believe about God, about ourselves, and our purpose as well because if we deal with our purpose, that explains why we're here and our mission is simply what. What we do as a people and what we do around here, our mission stated out loud is we're here to invite people into the struggle that we're all kind of in to become fully alive in God. But all of that is rooted in and grows out of our core values and beliefs as a church, which is exactly what we've been talking about for the last couple of weeks. And they're pretty basic things, fundamental things. I don't know if you remember, but back in September, we began with this question, what is, Or who is God? And that's a pretty big question because if you get off on that, your whole journey with God is going to be skewed. What kind of God is God? The second question was who are you? Who am I? Individually, who are we? But then the question we've been sitting in for quite a while is beyond just individually who are you and who am I, but who are we? As a people, who are we? As a church, 1 Peter 2.9 says, among other things, we're a people, which doesn't tell you much, but the next part does. We are a people, actually, for God's own possession. A chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, who actually come from a long line of people. And it's important as God's people to dial into this and remember this. We come from some place, a very long line of people who've been called that very same thing, a people for God's own possession since Genesis 17. It began with Abraham, who began to be called by God a people. My people, I own you, you're mine, and I'm yours. And from the beginning, we've had a purpose and a mission. That is, we as the people of God, to in a variety of ways, says 1 Peter 2, 9, proclaim the excellencies of him. That's why we're here. Proclaim the excellencies of him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous lights. We're a people who have an identity as a people, but we also have a mission as a people to proclaim, to make known the reality of God, all of which is rooted in a story. Which means that among other things, we are, we are a people of the story. Which is another one of our core values. It's something that we identify ourselves with, that we are a people of the story. And we think it's pretty important to understand the story. Because at the center of the story, the story of God, the primary theme of this story is the gospel that we began to talk about last week. But it's the gospel according to Jesus is the clarification we want to make. Who called it the good news of God. He called it the gospel of God. But he also called it the gospel of the kingdom. because central to the story of the gospel is the story of the kingdom. Let me tell me the story of the kingdom. I want to talk about the kingdom. Jesus talked about the kingdom all the time. He talked about the power of the kingdom. His miracles demonstrated the power of the kingdom. His parables spoke to the mystery of the kingdom. He talked about the fact that the kingdom of God is within your reach. It's upon you. It's coming to you. It's a present reality. It's a future hope. But at the most basic level, If you want to understand what Jesus was talking about when he talked about the kingdom, the kingdom simply speaks to the rule and the reign of God being made available to ordinary people in the context of ordinary life. But it's also about the king's right to rule. Not just his rule and reign, but his right to rule and to reign in the context of the world, but also particularly his right to rule as king among his people because the story of the kingdom, said this last week, is the story of a king. And the story of a king is a story of a people who belong to God and God has a right to rule, to be king of those people, if you will. But from the beginning, that whole relationship got messed up. This was the problem. At creation, it got turned when the two icons of God, remember that? I love that word, E-I-K-O-N-S. People created in the image of God in the garden, Adam and Eve, created in the image of God, designed by God to live abundantly, but they would live abundantly under the authority of God. Didn't like that arrangement, unsatisfied, dissatisfied with being under the rule of God. They wanted to be God. So the original sin at the very beginning of the story of humankind was this refusing to bend the knee to God. To submit to the rule and reign of God, which is all about the kingdom. And it's going to be hard to be in this kingdom of God where he reigns if we're not willing to bend the knee to that God. They didn't want that. So you know the story. they were ushered out of the garden, sent out of the garden in Genesis 3, which last week we discovered was symbolic language, theological language for what the people of God, particularly all through the Old Testament, knew to be, they called it the exile. And exile, it was a very real thing when the Babylonians would come and the Egyptians would come and the people would be taken away. But in metaphor, in terms of how we experience exile, Exile is simply the realization that we're not home anymore, that it's not safe anymore, we're not protected anymore, no longer under the rule and reign of God, where with him we could partner in ruling creation. The people of God are now alienated from God and also alienated from their own identity as the people of God and also cut off from their purpose as the people of God in the world. So when Jesus comes proclaiming, teaching and proclaiming the gospel, the good news of the kingdom, he was teaching and proclaiming the rule and reign of God is within your reach again. You can come home again. The exile is over, which means you can be reconciled, first of all, to God. You can also come home to your own identity and rediscover who you actually are, who you were created to be as a person of God, in the image of God, and you can even return to your purpose as a human being on the earth. You can return to your mission in the world because life in the kingdom of God is being made accessible. This is his announcement. It's being made available to you right here, right now, through me, Jesus says. Indeed, his encouragement was, put your confidence in me, which means put your faith in me. that speaks to faith, and then follow me, which speaks to discipleship. It's more than just believe the right thing about me. I want you to put your confidence in me, and then follow me, which means my way of living and being, and you will follow me into an entirely new kind of life, into an eternal kind of life that will result in heaven when you die, but it will begin to be experienced by you right here, right now, the rule and reign of God enters into your ordinary life. So that now when we pray, the way Jesus taught us to pray, when he taught us to pray this way, thy kingdom come, thy will be done. That prayer, I don't know what stirs up in you when you pray that prayer or think of those words. It is many things actually, but I think that prayer is among other things a prayer of submission to God. It's a prayer of surrender to God as I acknowledge his right to rule. I mean, think about that every morning, getting up. You know, some people do that. They kind of do the Lord's Prayer. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. We just kind of gloss over that, what that's doing, what I'm saying. What I'm saying that is, okay, God, today, here we are, here we are again. As best I know how, bend my knee to you, your kingdom come into my ordinary life, Your rule and right to rule, your right to rule. I say yes to your right to rule. In my heart, in my troubled heart, anxious heart, your right to rule. I recognize your right to rule in my financial stuff, my sexuality, my anger, my fear. I recognize your right to rule. Your kingdom come into my selfishness and pride, my anger and my fear. Thy kingdom come, my kingdom go. There's the rub right there. My kingdom. Dallas Willard in his book Divine Conspiracy says this and he says it quite bluntly that the greatest threat to the kingdom of God in my life is not Satan or demons, it's my kingdom. And that's what we saw in the garden. So I just told you the story again because from the very beginning the demand of the human heart was kind of this, and we've kind of ratified it since Adam and Eve, the original people of God, did it. The demand is this, to do what I want to do when I want to do it the way I want to do it, and you can't tell me. You particularly can't tell me, but even God, I'll sing songs about you, and two of you even on Sunday, but really, this is mine, not yours. Don't touch. And I think we get that. I don't think we're oblivious to the reality of that in most of our lives. We've seen all that. But let me clarify something in all that that Willard, Dallas Willard clarifies, I think very importantly, when he clarifies this, that we all have kingdoms. That's not a bad thing to have a kingdom. You actually need to know you have a kingdom. Indeed, it's part of the original design by God of you and me in creation. For we were created by God with a drive. It's a good one. You were created by God with a drive to create, to govern, to rule, to accomplish, to build. So when we marvel at a beautiful building or a beautiful art or hear a beautiful song or watch a play or figure out how to use apps on your iPhone, it's amazing. It's all good. And those are good things and they're God things. The capacity that human beings have to create and expand is a God thing. You and I have kingdoms. But, and you know where this is going, and you know this is kind of the story of humankind's history. When we come to believe that, or we begin to act as if we're the king of that kingdom, and our little kingdom is the ultimate kingdom, We discover pretty quickly that not everybody agrees with that. Indeed, we soon discover that there are many other kingdoms out there beyond our own. So now what we have are kingdoms in conflict. And if you need an example of that, kingdoms in conflict, just watch the news tonight and you'll see it right on the news. Listen to your kids talking in the backseat of the car on the way home. You'll see it there. You can go to a city council meeting. You'll see it there. A lot of church business meetings. you'll see it there. Just disagree with someone and you'll see it there. Kingdoms in conflict such that it actually becomes the explanation. This is Willard again. It becomes the explanation for the nightmare we've seen and continue to see played out in human life in history including church history because our personal kingdoms are in disarray. And it might sound simplistic to say it this plainly, but the only way human kingdoms can ever work and come to their full potential, and they can work, and God's design and desire is that they do come to their full potential, the only way they can is when the people in those kingdoms learn how to bend their knee to God. Learn how to live in submission to the rule and reign of God and in their actual lives begin to do that. But now, imagine this, that we're learning how to do that, not just as individuals, because that's something individually. And I must always dial into this kind of thing with my piece in that. Gabe, you need to bow your knee again to God. Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God. Again, individually. But what if, what if, that spirit of desire to bend the knee to God, to his right to rule his people was not just yours and yours and yours and mine, but ours? What if we, as a people, began to say, you know why we're here? We're here. What we're about is trying to learn what it means for a people to recognize the king's right to rule in our ordinary lives, in our real dimensions of our lives, and what if that is who we are, and what if that is why we're here, to become a people who are learning that, how to pray, thy kingdom come. See, when I say that, I don't even know what my kingdoms are. I don't even know the places I need to bow their knees, so now we're on the journey. And maybe people who are learning how to say, thy kingdom come, have to have the courage to say, Lord, I want to bend my knee, and I'm not right now, and I know it, and give me the strength to bow to you and become rightly ordered in my life and in our life. truth is becoming that kind of people I don't know what that feels like to you but to me it sounds amazing it sounds like wow is that possible what would it look like if a people began to say it's why we're here we want to learn how to do this together this reversing of the rebellion in the garden well if it's something you want you just still need to be aware of something because as much as we would want that and I do want that for us for me as a people. We just need to be aware that there are a myriad of things that mitigate against that ever being a reality in your life or in our life. Scott McKnight in his book, Kingdom Conspiracy, says this about that. We need to be aware of competing kingdoms. And I talked about personal kingdoms a minute ago, but there's a bigger story going on and it mitigates against us ever entering into this. And as God's people, we've got to be wise about this. He talks about competing kingdoms rival stories. Because these competing kingdoms offer some things that promise some things, saying, among other things, this. I will make you happy. I will meet your needs. I will make you feel secure. I will give you joy. I will give you peace, a sense of purpose and meaning. I will give you fulfillment. and these competing kingdoms, competing with the kingdom of God under his rule and reign. These rival stories existed in Jesus' day too. They aren't just here today. They are here today. This is part of the story. This is part of what the people of God have always kind of had to navigate, be aware of, and walk through. Let me give you some examples. Brian McLaren actually calls these kingdoms the framing stories of history. which I find interesting. All of them representing powerful kingdoms. One of those stories or kingdoms would be called the domination story. It's a kind of kingdom and what the domination story promises, like all other kingdom forms, it promises peace and safety. It promises security. But what it says is this, the only way for you to be safe and secure in this world is for us to be in control. And the only way for us to be in control is to take control, is to dominate. And this dominating story often takes place violently, militarily, sometimes economically, politically, and socially as well. In Jesus' day, this kingdom was alive and well. It had a face, and everybody knew what the face was because the face looked exactly like Rome. And in the framing story of Rome, the framing story was indeed domination. You might remember, we have talked about this before, the Pax Romano. And what the Pax Romano is, is the peace of Rome. And what the peace of Rome promised in this kingdom was peace and safety. You'll be safe and secure, but the way they got peace and safety was by force. They just eliminated, destroyed, actually in very graphic and horrible ways. Anybody who disagreed with them, anybody who got in the way, and when everybody quit complaining because they were all dead, we got peace. That's a kind of way to get peace. It's a form of it. It's a kind of kingdom, but Jesus came with a different story. It was a radically different story. It was a confrontational story. It was a head-scratching story, actually, for some, because what he came saying, among other things, was this, Rome is very powerful and pretty scary, but I got news for you. It will never make you safe or secure. It won't even make them safe. Indeed, we're talking about the kingdom of God. Rome's gone, long gone. It's not going to last. Indeed, it's only by losing your life that you find it, is what he said. And everybody who heard him say that said, huh? I mean, what? I don't get that. He offered people not a sword. Come, we're going to build a kingdom. Well, give me a sword. And he gave him a cross, which confused them even more. Second framing story, another framing story, second kind of kingdom, alive in Jesus' day, alive today as well, comes right on the heels of the domination story. It's one of the problems of the domination story because whenever you have a domination story, this next story kind of grows right out of it, and it's the revenge and revolution story. And this is a really old story, but it's a very familiar story. In Jesus' day, this was the zealots who said, among other things, this, the only way to feel safe and secure, especially with Rome, those oppressors, the only way to feel safe and secure is to get rid of Rome. So when our guys are in and their guys are out, we'll be safe and secure. So come unto me, was their Bible verse, come unto me, all you who are angry and oppressed, and I will give you a cause. and it will include a sword. Another framing story. Alive in Jesus' day, alive today as well. Kind of kingdom story was the purification story. It's a very popular story in Jesus' day. It's a popular story today if you're in some sort of religious context. And the purification story said this. There's just too many people around who aren't like us. They don't look like us. They don't act like us. They don't believe like us. They don't talk like us. We need to get rid of them because the only way to be safe and secure is to stay away from them, at least marginalize them. In Jesus' day, the group that lived in this story, even though they talked all the time about God and the kingdom of God were, you know, the Pharisees and the scribes, who actually in Jesus' day had a lot of power. So in some ways, you've got to scratch your head, they were safe and secure. If anybody was, they seemed to be. But they weren't satisfied with that. Because you know our problem? We would say the Pharisees and the scribes. It's all these unclean people. That's the problem in our culture, in our world. So let's start with the lepers and marginalize them, which they did. But it's also the publicans and the sinners and the prostitutes and the drunkards. And lots of people bought that story. And lots of people buy that story today. They loved that story, made him feel holy and clean. And then Jesus came with a different story. And they hated his story. Wanted to put him on a cross because of this story. Makes you wonder who's living in this story today. Actually the story of Jesus, which is the kingdom of God, his right to rule. Because he came saying, it's not the healthy who need a physician. So why would you run away from sick people? It's not, it's the sick. So what he did was eat with them and drink with them and include them. And then there's another story that people live in and represent another kind of kingdom. And these kingdoms are all in conflict with the kingdom of God's victimization story. Followed quickly by the isolation story. Another popular story to live in and build your own little kingdom. And this story said that there's nothing we can do about the world. It's just a mess and we're powerless. So the only way to be safe and secure in this scary, scary world that's just going to hell in a handbasket. Did you read the news? I know I did. I did. I did. the only way to be safe and secure then is to withdraw into our own little subculture, our own little subgroup, insulated and isolated from the rough and tumble realities of real life, the big bad wolf out there. Let's come together, sing kumbaya, and we'll be safe in here, never thinking. And this is what this story does to you because it shrinks your understanding of your purpose as a person of God because that story of isolation will blind you to the fact that maybe God's calling us to go toward the mess. But you'll never even consider changing anything, getting involved in anything, healing anyone, feeding, clothing, wouldn't even cross your mind because you're living in an isolation story and it's a kind of kingdom and you might have all sorts of Jesus songs you sing when you get together. It has nothing to do. It's nothing at all. Like the kingdom, Jesus came. In Jesus' day, this group of isolationists were called the Essenes who literally, they physically moved out into the desert believing that this world was beyond repair so why try to heal it or help it? Tikkunalam, the healing of the world, not on their radar screen, that we should be involved in that. Not even a thought was given to that because God is coming in judgment. And you know people who think like this now because this is their story. God is coming in judgment. He's going to blow towards this whole thing. Let's just go out into the desert so when he does it, we're not in the way. He won't hit us. He'll hit them. But once again, Jesus came with a radically different story because the gospel of the kingdom, the story of God, not to isolate and withdraw. I know you like that story. It's not the story. The story of God and Jesus that Jesus came to proclaim is that we've been called to enter in, which, by the way, I don't know, is what he did when he left the throne of heaven and descended, taking on the form of a man, even that of a slave, and became obedient even unto, whoa, death, whoa, you might get hurt. Yeah, you might. But if you lose your life, you'll, wow, really? Yes, but you gotta be in it. different kingdom. Finally, there's the accumulation story, one of the most popular. Today, it wasn't as big in Jesus' day because not many had access to the accumulation, the consumption story. And this story says the only way to be safe and secure is to accumulate more stuff. It's to consume more and more and bigger and better and brighter and faster. It's your own little kingdom that you're building in Jesus' day was the Sadducees. Again, a small group because there weren't many people who had access to this kind of wealth. They were part of the aristocracy. We've spoken of all these people before. They were the wealthiest of the wealthy on the planet earth, actually, and they got that way by collaborating with Rome. Actually, they were kind of seen by other Jews as traitors to their identity as a people of God and promoting a system is what they, whether it was intentional or not, by their collaborating with Rome, they ended up promoting a system that helped them accumulate more and more, which is what they wanted, but the system actually created a system where the rich got richer and more and more and more and the poor got poorer. I don't know, that smells a little familiar. The fact is, according to Scott McKnight, in that book, Kingdom Conspiracy, Jesus had almost nothing to do with the Sadducees. The wealthy, he had hardly ever talked to them. He had nothing in common with them. Indeed, he was most at odds with them. And I thought it was the Pharisees. I mean, that's what we see in the Scriptures. He was most at odds with these people whose kingdom was accumulation and consumption. which makes me a little nervous. Because once again, Jesus came with a different story, talking about a different kingdom, a kingdom that was at odds with, in conflict with, seeking to subvert every other kingdom, which means the gospel of the kingdom, hello? It's not just about heaven when you die. Are you getting it? I think you get it. What a small story. Even that is, heaven when you die, yeah, you're going to be fine. but the kingdom you've been invited it's something that's going to begin if you enter into it entering into a different story it means becoming aware of the stories you're living in right now that are totally inconsistent with the kingdom of God and saying I'm going to bend my knee, I'm going to bend my knee or not to that and that's how the kingdom comes into our ordinary lives as Jesus came proclaiming this kingdom among the things he did was say as loud as he could and it got them in a lot of trouble. The kingdoms of this world don't work. In fact, they're wrong. Rome is wrong. Because power over, this power over thing, though it's gotten them someplace right now and a lot of you are scared of them, here's the deal, it will never make you safe or secure. And people hanging on crosses kind of knew that. But even people who were the recipients of that kind of peace, because they were, you know, allowed to live, knew that this would not make them safe and secure. but the zealots are wrong too because the zealots hearing Jesus hammer Caesar, Caesar isn't Lord, I am, sorry. The zealots would love that. He's gonna take Rome down but then he'd say the zealots are wrong too because you can't overcome evil with more evil but so is withdrawal, it's wrong. That kingdom built by the Essenes, that story is wrong because I'm looking for a people who will not retreat and withdraw, They'll enter in to the darkest places on the planet and bring the life of God. They'll try to help. They'll try to heal and serve, which is why the Sadducees got it wrong too. Concerned only were they with their own personal accumulation and consumption of more and more and bigger and better and brighter. Because the kingdom of God will come to, it will flow through a whole new kind of people. weren't just singing songs about God. They've entered into a whole new kind of life, a whole new community of people who once were not a people. Why? Well, they certainly weren't a people of God because they were a people of another kingdom. Maybe had God words all over it, but they were living in another kingdom and another story. But then he began to call out a people. And it just kind of brings you back to the beginning when he was calling out Abraham, And then he called out the people through Moses. And here he is again when Jesus now shows up. He starts calling out a people. And it's just a riot. It's hysterical to see who he calls. Luke 6.15. He says in effect in Luke 6.15, I'll take you. And he's talking at this point to Simon. But the Simon I'm talking about that he picks is not Simon who is called Peter. This is Simon who is called a zealot. The guy's a zealot. I'll take you. I know you're living in another kingdom. But I'm calling you into a different kind of life that puts down the sword. believes a whole different thing about how life works and how evil needs to be moved into with grace and even a willingness to give up your life. Are you kidding? I'll take you. And Simon said, I don't know how to do it yet, but I will follow you. And then he picked Matthew. I'll take you, Matthew. Tax collector. Very wealthy. What does that mean? That means Matthew is part of the Sadducee group. He's part of that collaborating group. So I'll take you, Simon the Zealot, and I'll take you, Sadducee, by the way, who is the person that the zealot is trying to topple, and you guys can room together. This is great. What would that take? I would take a different kind of person who's bending their knee to a different kind of king living in a different kind of kingdom. Nicodemus was a Pharisee, like the Essenes, into purity and separation. I'll take you. And then he takes the woman at the well, a Samaritan. She was the wrong gender, wrong race, wrong religion, wrong sexual history. I'll take you. And Nicodemus, is that okay if I take her? And Nicodemus, eventually, it's a journey here, said yes. And then he said to this band of people who didn't know how to do it yet, but said, we want to bend our knee to you, King Jesus, and follow you. He said, here's what I want you to do. One thing, not a list of behaviors. Follow me. Just follow me. Not believe the right thing about me. That will come. You'll figure that out. That's not the hard part. I want you to follow me. and follow my way of living and loving. And if you do, you will follow me into a whole new kind of life. Becoming a whole new kind of person, a whole new community of people who once were not a people because they were living in all these different kingdoms and all these different stories, but now you are. because you bent your knee to the king. He's not just your personal savior. He's the king. And we find our fulfillment when we bend our knee to the king of this story. Once we were not a people, but now we are the people of God, a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a kingdom of priests. a holy nation who are learning together and stumbling along the way learning together how to be people what that means is we're learning how to live in submission to the king we're learning how to bend our knee to the king it's like bringing us back to the garden we're starting over because that usurping that I will Hunter song at the end. Remember when he sang this song? I don't know if you noticed it. He said, I say yes, I say yes, I say yes. What's that? That's a kingdom. I say yes. And when you begin to do that, I don't know why this happened. It happened to me last week too. I just get all weird about this. When we begin to bend our knee, Not just individually, but think of us as a people, as a people saying yes. We, not just you and you and you, we enter back into our purpose, our mission, as a people. Because we're coming back to God. And then we're coming back to who we are. And then we're coming back to why we're here. And that is who we are. And that is why we're here. And that is why we do what we do, the way we do it. And that is why we have a radical commitment to spiritual transformation. Because spiritual transformation is actually all about learning how to bend your knee. So that we can come home to God. To our identity and to our purpose. And that is the good news of God. That is the gospel of the kingdom. So repent. Jesus said. But repent. Remember that? I gave you this last week. Repent means simply this. In light of all this, review your plans for living. Serious. And join us as a people in arranging your life as we try to arrange our lives around this good news, around this gospel of the kingdom of God. Let's stand as we're dismissed. as is always the case there will be people here to pray for you some of you you know it's important sometimes to say yes just to find a moment where you know I need to I need to even with some person acknowledge my need to say yes because my knee hasn't been bent and I want to I can feel it my kingdom's not working there's people here to pray for you and be with you and just encourage you to sit in that for a while. Father, we thank you for this story. We thank you for your design. We thank you for your invitation, for your relentless pursuit of us, continually coming back to us, offering us a way to come back to you, to who we are as well, and to our purpose on this planet. May these things among us grow as we try to figure out under your kingly authority what it means to be a people, a people of God, a people of your own possession. We pray these things in Jesus' name and all God's people said, amen. God bless you as you leave. You're dismissed. Thank you.
