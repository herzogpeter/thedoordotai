The words I have to share are designed to minister healing and hope to both victims and perpetrators of the issue we're focusing on this weekend. In the session that I had last night, I speculated as we were dealing with the variety of characteristics of spiritual abusers, false spiritual leaders that was drawn all out of Matthew 23. And coming around one particular verse where it says that their characteristic is that they say things and do not do them. And I kind of got into this whole thing about a characteristic of false leaders, that they have a double life. And I kind of gave some theory around that. And part of my theory was that at least in part, one of the reasons some men and women in leadership, some men and women in particular doesn't take leadership to fall into this, but that they say but do not, that is they have a double life, is because, among other reasons, The only method they've ever been given to deal with the sin that plagues them, and the assumption I had around the sin to plague them was that they hated the sin that plagued them and wanted to find a way to have some victory over it, but the only method they'd ever been given to deal with the sin that plagued them was to crank the lid down really tight with prohibitions, restrictions, injunctions, and then I even further speculated as it related to ministry people that without this kind of intentional thought, but more of a subtle way of thinking, that one way to maintain those kind of prohibitions and injunctions and pressure on yourself to keep the lid down would be to go into the ministry where you would even, in the context of your ministry and in your study, create an environment where you would be consistently applying this pressure. The problem was this. I said last night that if those things that plague us are not dealt with honestly, they are going to come out some way. And sometimes they blow up in ways where there are, to use my words last night, bodies everywhere. And sometimes they come out in more subtle, behind-the-scenes ways with a private life that is absolutely inconsistent with what your public persona is, but it's consistent with what it is inside that's plaguing you. I want to speculate today, with that little paradigm in mind, I want to speculate today that one of the reasons some people never experience healing Now, I've really kind of flipped here. We're talking over here of some reasons that some people never get victory over the sin and the plagues. And now I'm talking about somebody who's been a victim. Some of the reasons, among the reasons that some never get healing is because the only method they've ever been given to deal with their pain, with their hurt, is to grin and bear it. The only method they've ever been given to deal with their hurt is to praise the Lord anyhow, is to forgive and forget, is to hear things like this and encouragements like this brought from well-minded, well-intended people, good Christians who really trust God, don't get angry and don't get discouraged and don't get depressed. And so to prove that you are a good Christian, you kind of take all those feelings of woundedness and aren't allowed to go anywhere with them. And much like the guy who doesn't have any permission to go anywhere with the sin that plagues him or her, the person who's got some pain has no permission to go anywhere with the hurt that plagues them. And so we learn to pretend. We end up very often frozen with behaviors that we don't connect with what's inside of us frozen, but some very dysfunctional things going on. The words I had to share with you today are good news for both those kinds of people that I just described. They are the words of Jesus found in Matthew 5. So turn with me to Matthew 5. I was asked specifically to do this particular word, blessed are the broken, blessed are those who mourn. In order to understand this, I want to give you some background. Because until I got the background on this passage, I didn't understand some of the things that Jesus was here saying, because the truth is that for many, many years, the words of Jesus in the Beatitudes were pretty well lost on me. I grew up in church. I've heard these things all my life. Blessed are the broken. It's the kind of thing I could affirm in a Sunday school class, but there's nothing about that, quite frankly, that appeals for me. There's nothing about that that draws me. Blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are the meek. Sounds to me, blessed are the weak. Be a 10-year-old boy, be an 18 years-old boy, be an 18-yearold woman. There's very little about meekness that draws me. I don's not going to die. I don't understand, I don't see the attraction. Blessed are those who mourn. Sounds to be like blessed are the bummed. Who are the blessed? If I was in a Sunday school class, I'd get the answer right. They are the broken, they are the mourning. There'd be nothing in that, however, that I would move toward, aspire to. You know, like my goal in life is to mourn. My goal in life is to be broken. Fact is, 18 years old, 10, whatever, sticking yourself as just a person sitting in a pew, my goal in life is to never be broken, to never be sad, to do whatever I can to not be in those kinds of positions. And so in the Sunday school context, we kind of nod our head, yeah, these are really good things. But there's honestly nothing here that would draw me that I, in my heart, honestly would aspire to see as a healthy thing. When I saw the context, some of those things changed. Let me just give you the context. In verse 12 of chapter 4, it says this, Now when he, that is Jesus, heard that John had been taken into custody, he withdrew into Galilee. When Jesus heard that John the Baptist had been taken into prison, without giving you all the background on this, It was as if the divine starter gun of history went off. Up until this time, Jesus had not done any ministry. Everything till now was preliminary. He had his temptation in the wilderness. He had his baptism. When John the Baptist was taken into custody, bam, he withdrew into Galilee. Verse 17 says this. From that time, Jesus began to preach and say, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Saying it this way, repent, change your mind. I got good news for you. And the good news is this. the kingdom of God, the basilea of God, I defined kingdom last night, the reign of God is within your reach. The reality that men and women can experience what it feels like to be in a community where, or to just be in life, where God is indeed ruling is something that you are going to be able to experience. It's something within your reach. And he began to gather to himself his disciples, verses 18 and 19. Verse 20, it says that the ones he had called to himself left. And his ministry is defined in verse 23 in terms of exactly what he did. So he's announced his ministry. He's gathered his disciples. Verse 23, he actually does it. And Jesus was going about in all Galilee, basically doing two things, teaching in the synagogue, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, saying, going everywhere, saying the kingdom of heaven's within your reach. You can really experientially know God. And second thing he was doing was not just proclaiming that he was doing that, meaning healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people. The response to that was predictable. I mean, the message would be great, but on top of the message was the power. The response was predictable. News about him spread. Went out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were ill, taken with various diseases, pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics, and he healed them all. And great multitudes followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan. And when he saw the multitudes, stop right there. And when he saw the multitudes, he did a very weird thing. Now, again, I told you last night that I see all these things through the lens of a senior pastor, and so I'm a senior pastor looking at this one, too. And when he saw the multitudes, it says he withdrew. And paraphrase when we read ahead. It says he withdrew from the multitude. And what dawns on me about that that's weird is that that's not exactly what I would do. If I saw the multitude, I would have a party. I would write a book telling people how you draw a multitude, and I would try to figure out how to keep the multitude and do a big church growth thing and spread it around. And Jesus, seeing the multitude, withdrew from them, went up on the mountainside. After he sat down, his disciples came to him, and opening his mouth, he began to teach them, saying, Stop right there. I like to get into these scenes. If you were a disciple who, you know, five minutes ago in verse 18, it was more than five minutes ago, but in verse 18, you just got called. All the guys so far that he's called have been fishermen. So you were a fisherman just a while ago. You didn't have any plans other than to be a fisherman the rest of your life. Now this guy Jesus calls you. You go. You're not even sure why you're going. First thing you hear is this message of the kingdom. I've kind of heard this religious stuff before. then you see the power of the kingdom demoniacs are being set free epileptics are healed everybody's being healed now he pulls away sits on the hillside what would you want to know what do you think they would want to know here's the deal i don't know what they would want to know what i know is what i would want to know i know what i would want to know i would want to know how'd you do all that second can you teach me to do all that and whether i you know i would probably have you know i just want to help people. The truth is, way down deep, the reason I would want to know all that and be able to do what he did would be so I could draw a multitude like he drew the multitude. Jesus, you know, your hands, you did something with your hands. When you heal that guy, some guy, did you put it on this side of his head? It was on his forehead. Well, you did something with your hand. What is it with the hand? I mean, is there something in your hands? Is it like right in here? The healing comes? What is the thing with the hand? In your voice, you did something with your voice. You put your hand on him and said, in Jesus. Well, you didn't say in Jesus' name because your name is Jesus, but you said, I mean, what is the thing? Now, what's the formula? How do we make it happen? I'm setting all this up because I do think this was a dramatic dynamic behind these words. I think that's what they, I know that's what I'd want to know. And opening his mouth, he began to teach them saying, stop right there again. I have another little interjection before I actually get to this crazy text. He began to teach them saying, I got some good news and I got some bad news. The good news, disciples, is this. Everything you heard and everything you saw is true. It's all real. And not only that, it's all for you. All that power is real. All that life-giving grace is real. And it's available. The kingdom of heaven is available to you too. The bad news is this. None of it's coming the way you think. None of it is going to come to who you think. None of it is going to flow through who you think. Remember, I mean, I don't need to recreate this much, but spirituality in Jerusalem in the first century, in the context of Jesus' life, was defined by a group of people called the Pharisees and the scribes. We talked about them a lot last night. And they were the ones who looked really good, and those were the ones who you always felt a little bit intimidated by, and you weren't quite as spiritual as them, and that's what spirituality meant. And Jesus says, I got some good news and bad news. This kingdom stuff is real. The bad news, it's not coming to who you think. It's not going to flow through who you think. Let me tell you who this kingdom's coming to, and let me tell you who this power that you just saw is going to flow through. Blessed are the broken. Blessed are those, and I'm not going to stay on brokenness very long here. I want to get to the morning. But basically, the brokenness piece is the poor in spirit, is blessed are those who recognize that in themselves they can't crank it out. Blessed are those who recognize I can't, number one, save myself. People who recognize they can't save themselves come up hungry for what? Grace. Blessed are those who recognize that after they got saved, I can't sanctify myself. I've got a new heart and now I want to walk in holiness and I want to walk in obedience. And his statutes are written on my heart and it's the biggest want to I've ever had. And I tried really hard and I strobe and I do it. And blessed are those who recognize that in their flesh they can't. And you know what they come up for? Hungry for? People who come up hungry for sanctification that they recognize that by themselves they can't do. They come up hungry for the filling of the Spirit. They come up hungry for the empowerment of God. Blessed are those who recognize that they can't by themselves, by the power of their own intellect and capacity, serve me effectively. Blessed are those who recognize that what I've called men and women to do is more than just build big churches and gather large multitudes of people. What I've called men and women to do in the kingdom is to help lame people walk and blind people see and dead men and women rise from the dead. And I'm not just speaking here physically. I am speaking primarily spiritually, emotionally. I have empowered you with words of life and the power of the Spirit to do that. Blessed are those who recognize that they cannot help lame men and women walk, blind men and women see, dead men and women rise from the dead by the power of their intellect. Blessed are the broken. Blessed are those who understand they can't. And I'm not going to do all the application around the healing, but that is, in fact, a powerfully healing dynamic. Blessed are those who've been trying to crank the lid down, going back to that paradigm I started with, whose only method of controlling his sin was to crank the lid down, To that individual, the words of Jesus in Matthew 5 would be, Blessed are those who recognize they can't hold the lid down. Blessed are those who recognize that the only way you're going to be able to keep the lid on is if you act out behind the scenes. Blessed are those who take off the lid and recognize they can't hold it in. Blessed are those who are in their pain and have been told that the only way that you have to deal with your pain is to grin and bear it. Praise the Lord. Anyway, forgive and forget. stuff it's blessed are those who recognize they can't do that blessed are those who recognize they can't cope with their pain unless they do something more uh it's not a very fun realization but it's one of the first steps to healing the one i'm gonna spend most of time on is the next one blessed are those who mourn blessed are the bummed and blessed are those who walk around Oh, boy. Well, let's deal with that impression about this particular verse. And I may be presumptuous that you have that impression of the verse. Maybe you don't, but I always have. I don't know how it first hits you, but it does hit me that way. And maybe in trying to give it a positive spin, our response could be something like this. Well, I guess it really is a virtue. It probably would be a good thing if we were all a little, you know, the Bible should be sober. We should be sober, and it's probably not a good thing for people to be as happy as they are, and I don't see that many people happy. Maybe I'm stretching it. But I do think that some people take passages like this, and whether it's out loud or not, it seems that they take passages like this and use it as a proof text for a sour disposition and a miserable, grumpy life. I think you've all heard a joke, it's a very old joke, of the man who brought his little kid to the war memorial at Pearl Harbor, and saw a plaque with all these names on it, and the kid asked his dad, what's that? And he said, well, this is a plaque of all the names of the people who died in the service. And the little boy said, which service, the morning or the evening? You know, because it's kind of spiritual to be sad and grumpy, and, you know, oh, boy, that's really good. The problem with that is this. If that is our perception, not only of spirit life, but of this verse, we've got some contradictions. You see, in Galatians 6, it says, fruit of the spirit is among other things what joy and i remember when i did a study on that word and and it was you know very disconcerting if we're trying to come up with a proof text for a miserable sour grumpy life because the word joy means among other things romping stomping running around in circles joy it's the kind of thing that your your little kid does if you have a little kid you know when when you come home from work i remember when my kids were little we lived in a little a split entry house and when my kids were tiny you know you'd walk into steps you'd walk in the door and there was a little tiny landing and there were steps right away. And when my kids were three, four years old, I'd come in from work, I'd have my briefcase in my hand, I'd have to put it down before I got out, I'd open the door, I know they'd hear me because what I'd have to do is make sure I didn't have any stuff in my hands because they would come running off the top step and dive off the top step and I'd have to catch them. Running, running circles, romping, stomping, joy, that kind of joy. Proverbs says, a merry heart does good like a medicine. Therefore, if what Jesus says here is true, and it is, that blessed are those who mourn, the question we need to ask is this, in what sense is it true? What does he mean by it? Well, defining the word mourning begins to clarify. The Greek word for mourning here is penthos. If you want to take notes, you can just kind of phonetically spell that out. It means to grieve, to sorrow, to mourn. Well, all by itself, that doesn't help us much. What I discovered in further study, however, was this, that there were nine Greek verbs for the concept of mourning. I think I made it clear that I've grown up in a church. My dad was a pastor, and I kind of grew up with, every once in a while, hearing something from the pulpit about a Greek verb. And I remember getting all pumped as a kid because we did this big thing about three Greek verbs for love. Wow, I mean, I just thought that was so neat. It just filled everything out. And then I took Greek, and I found out there were three Greek verbs for everything. There's nine Greek verbs for this concept of mourning. Now, what that does is it tells me, it tells us that whatever word it is, chosen by the Spirit of God to be used here, is on purpose. He had nine to choose from, he chose this one. So what does this one specifically mean? It's more than just grief, sorrow, mourning. This one specifically means an external expression of an inward reality. You have not done penthas until you have not just been sad. Penthas is when you externally express an internal condition. sorrow outwardly expressed in things like the images would come quickly tears you could tell it in somebody's body language someone who begins to sob there are biblical references to to people who they they would be seen in what they called sackcloth and ashes and if i look at someone in sackcloth and ashes whatever that would look like i wouldn't look at him and wonder what kind of day they were having right i mean if they were in sackcloth and ashes i would know whatever the reason, I don't know, but I know they're having a bad day because what's going on in here is showing up out here. Blessed are those who have what's going on in here start showing up out here. Let me tell you one of the side points of this, the confrontations, in fact, of this, the realizations we need to come to around this word is this. Since penthouse means specifically to get out here, what's going on in here, it becomes apparent that it is possible to be sad and not to mourn. It is possible to be, like in the vernacular I was using a minute ago, be bummed, but not to be penthas, not to be mourning. What I'm driving at is this. There are a lot of people who are sad, hurt, discouraged, scared, angry, failing, and stumbling, but you would never know it in a million years by looking at them. But they are sad, hurt, wounded, victimized, in desperate need of healing. there are some people using the other paradigm of the they say but do not the guy who's got to crank down who look holy and in control and it's all buttoned down and they are not free and i hear jesus sitting on the hillside with these guys saying i got some good news and some bad news the bad news is this people who have issues on the inside whether it be sin or pain whatever the issue people have issues on the inside that never come to the outside they never get comfort the good news is this people who mourn who get out here what's going on in here whether it be pain or sin whatever the people who get out here what's going on in here they get comfort and in the greek by the way it's in the emphatic which means this they are the only ones who get the comfort they only get comfort again i put the glasses on the lens through which i see these things and step into my pastor role and as a pastor i ask myself this question lord how how how would how would you spot a kingdom church? How would our church be identified as, as you would look over the panorama of God's work in the United States, how would you discern there's a kingdom work, there's a kingdom work? Would it be that we're big? Would it be that we're rich? Would it be that a lot of people are coming and a lot of people are giving? Would it be those things? Those would all be good things, I suppose. But somewhere along the line, in the pot of what you discern to be a mark of kingdom life among a group of people would have to be included this, that when people begin to get out here, what's going on in here, that what they get is comfort, not condemnation. And if when they begin to get out here, what's going on in here, they get condemnation, not comfort, don't call that a kingdom church. Might be a big church. Don't call it a kingdom church. Might be a theologically correct church. Don't call it a kingdom church. For the first words out of Jesus' mouth relative to the attributes and the characteristics of kingdom life, Remember, he just started his ministry. That is very, very compelling to me. These are the first words out of Jesus' mouth describing the characteristics of the kingdom. Blessed are those who get out here, what's going on in here. They alone get comfort. And it seemed to me that those who are in line with the kingdom would be among those who would be giving the comfort to people who mourn. Okay, let's start to apply this. And there's two real simple ways to apply it. We'll just apply it emotionally, psychologically. and we'll apply it spiritually. Let's look at the emotional dimension of this first of all. And by the way, these are just going to bleed together, so I don't know why I'm trying to separate them. It doesn't matter. People say things like this. I went up to my room and I had a really good cry, and now I feel better. What does that mean? What that means is simple. They simply got out here, what was going on in here. Nothing was solved necessarily, but when they went up to the room, they stopped for a while and now you feel better. All it means is they got out here, what was in here. A pressure valve was released. Here's the deal. Whether we like it or not, whether we understand it or not, the ability to get out here, what's in here, is essential to emotional health, I believe. It is a pressure valve. I believe the ability to get out here, what's going on in here, could be said this way, that it is in fact a gift from God, that if not allowed to function, poisons the human psyche. I don't care how strong you are, intelligent, stiff upper lip type you are, if you are not able, if you do not get permission, If you are not in a system that allows you to get out here, what's going on in here, what is being forced to stay in here, whether it be sin, crank it down, or pain, deny it, deny it, it will poison you. The fact is this, the sickest, most unhappy, hard to be around people you'll ever know are not necessarily evil people. They may feel evil when you're in their presence, but sometimes the bottom line for their life experience is this, They are simply people who have never, ever been given permission or given themselves permission to get out here, what's really going on in here. Because this is a spiritual abuse conference, the context within which we are speaking of the abuse is in the context of the church. And so, therefore, those sick, unhappy, hard-to-be-around people who haven't been given permission to get out here, what's in here, need to be kind of focused in around the redeemed community, Christians. Christians in your church and in mine, in your family and in mine, who somewhere along the line got the message that good Christians don't fail, good Christians don't hurt, good Christians don't stumble, good Christians don't get depressed, they don't get discouraged, they don't get despairing. And if they do, they don't show it. Here's my question. Where did that message come from? Word of the message that says, good Christians don't hurt, fail, stumble, get confused, and if they do, they don't show it. Well, I don't know where it came from. I can tell you where it didn't come from. It didn't come from God. Because this came from God. Blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are those who get out here. What's going on here? That came from God. See, the fact is this. Good Christians do get hurt. Really, really good Christians do get discouraged. And Christians full of the Spirit who love God from their toes sometimes get depressed. And sometimes Christians who love God from their toes get confused and angry. And when they do, they pretend they're not, slap on a happy face, and call it the abundant life. And wonder why people aren't drawn to them and this message of amazing grace. Larry Crabb has a term for that kind of lifestyle. He calls it victory through denial. Isn't that cool? Victory through denial creates, in my opinion, some of the most unhealthy, frighteningly unhealthy people you and I will ever meet. And the reason I add frighteningly unhealthy is because this unhealth is coming in the name of God. It's the cause of God that somehow caused us to keep all the stuff down here. Why? Because good Christians don't have these feelings. I'll never forget the, you know, I've kind of always believed these things. I believe this, and some of you even believe this, but you're kind of going, yeah, Dave, I believe it, and I agree with you, and we're on the same team, but just because I say it and you say it, who cares? The system that I'm in that puts pressure on us to not be real with our feelings isn't going to be impressed by you or by me. It was an incredibly liberating thing to read, therefore, this verse. When I turned to 2 Corinthians 7, Paul said this. And just having it there, I mean, it blew me away. It said this. When we were in Macedonia, our flesh had no rest. We had conflicts without, we had fears within. But God who comforts the depressed comforted us by the coming of Titus. Now, I don't want to make depression a virtue, you know, and I don't want to say, oh, it's inspired to depression. Paul's depressed, let's be like Paul. The thing that blew me away was this. When Paul was depressed, what did he do? He said, I am depressed. He didn't deny it, but God who comforts the depressed, just that verse being there tells me that Paul got depressed. We had conflict without, we had fears within. It tells me he got afraid. That is incredibly encouraging to me. Why? Because I get afraid too. And if I'm in a situation, whether it be my family or my church, that when I'm afraid I have to act like I'm not, I'm going to go underground with it. And when I get permission from somebody who I'm pretty sure is somebody everybody would agree is a good Christian, Paul. see you might argue get arguments that Dave's a good Christian or you're a good Christian but Paul we're all going to stand on him he's a good guy think he loves the Lord you know he had his devotions four days in a row I'm telling you and he still got discouraged he still got depressed he still got afraid it's an amazing thing when you can't get out here what's going on in here not only do you get discouraged but you keep your discouragement. When you can't get out here, what's going on in here, not only do you get depressed, because guess what? Here's the deal. All of us get depressed. I'm going to go out on a limb here. Everybody in this room gets depressed. Everybody in this room stumbles. Everybody in this room fails. Everybody in this room loses their way. But if you can't be honest about the times you lose your way and get afraid and get discouraged, you get to keep losing your way. You can't ever ask for help. You get to keep your pain and you get to keep your sin, the plaguing sin. I mean, again, I referred to this thing last night with the cranking it on and this pastor who is living a double life and we all, oh, what a scumbag. And now maybe our heart breaks a little bit because he never, she never, whoever it is, never had permission, never had a system, never had a place that said, let's talk about what's real instead of just what's right. Blessed are those who mourn. First words out of Jesus' mouth about kingdom life. Galatians 6. I referred to it a couple times last night. I want to sit on it a little longer in our session. All through the book of Galatians, Paul has been assaulting the theology of the Judaizers, and without going deeply into them, just give you a caricature of them, they were the legalists. I don't have time to develop that anymore. At the end of chapter 6, Paul does something that is somewhat uncharacteristic, but he does it in other places as well. Rather than simply talk about their theology. He talks about them. He gets personal. And he says this, those who desire these Pharisees to make a fair show in the flesh, try to compel you to be circumcised, simply that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. What I want to focus on is that first phrase. They're those who make a good show in the flesh. A good show in the flesh. Good show in the flesh. One of the things that's scary about the person whose energy is spent making a good show in the flesh is that it's a good show, meaning it works. They look good. The way I framed this so I could understand it was this. I read that verse. I got the concept, these are people who make a good show in the flesh. And I had a memory of being a little kid growing up in church. And in a little church, it was a little Bible church, and it would have maybe looked something like this. And we had an arch, something like this, but the arch came down further. And every six months, Actually, I think it was once a year we would have a verse that was written on the archway up here, and it was the verse of the year. And it was a neat verse. There's no ridicule around that. Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord. That kind of thing would be up there, and it would be ever before us, and that's a good thing. But in my mind, as I saw this thing here, these are those who make a good show in the flesh, I kind of see myself as a little kid sitting in church, and that verse would get changed, and it would become Nebuchadnezzar's handwriting on the wall. And instead of the verse, which is really good and right, what would happen would be the motto that really was the motto that nobody said out loud, the motto that really was the motto of these people would appear on this little archway in my mind. And the motto would be how things look is what matters here. Making a good show in the flesh is what they do. The motto or the way of life, therefore, is how things look is what matters here. Just kind of lay that over some of your church experience, some of your family experience, how things look is what matters here. I got a principle of births right out of that. Here's the principle. If you are in a family or from a family or in a church or a school system of any kind where how things look is what matters, here's the principle, how things are will not get dealt with. If you're in a system, family, church, school, whatever, where how things look is what matters, how things are will not get dealt with. Why? because how things look is what matters we don't want to talk about how you really feel we want we just we keep all the energy is spent looking good and if i'm in a system where how things look is what matters how things are not getting dealt with it will actually become more important let's talk about marriage that you think i have a good marriage then i have a good marriage are you following me so far therefore all of the energy i'm spending on my marriage will not be on my marriage. This is so weird talk. All the energy I'll spend on my marriage will be creating an image about my marriage so that when my wife and I go to church or go to wherever we go, you will think we have a good marriage. And so we will learn the social Baptist alliance, whatever those behaviors are that good Christian couples have to have to be seen as having a good marriage, we'll spend the energy of our life developing those things. So you think I have a good marriage because it's more important that you think I have a good marriage than I actually have a good marriage you are talking so weird Dave okay let's say it a different way I think you're following me let's just cut the whole thing a different way we're on our way to church define the relationship any way you want from fighting like crazy a violence in the relationship make it a little more subtle than that, and maybe, I don't know, how do you measure pain? We're not fighting. It's just dead. It's just dead. We haven't said an intimate word to one another for six months to six years. I don't know her heart at all. She doesn't know my heart at all. I wouldn't show it to her in a minute. There's no way. It's cold. It's dead. We hit the door of this church where how things look is what matters. by the way nobody says that out loud we go to sunday school and we start talking about our marriage class and we hit the door and we're arm in arm and we may not be deliriously happy but but we know the things you have to do and the words you have to say and the way you have to act to make you think we have a good marriage let's say somebody gets sick of that the husband or the wife i don't know it doesn't matter who gets sick of that and in their proverbial sunday school class and I'm using the Sunday school class not as the recommended place to do this necessarily. You need to find a safe place, but let's just make it a Sunday school class for the sake of this illustration. The husband or the wife, in the context of this kingdom context, raises their hand and says, I don't know what the real answer or the right answer to what we're supposed to do in a marriage and what they're supposed to look like, but the real thing is this, that my wife and I or my husband and I are not doing very well at all. And you have thought we are and we're not. And here are some of the examples of why we're not. And maybe don't even give the examples. Just start with that one thing. We're not doing well at all. If you are in a system where how things look is what matters, it will never come out with these words or quite this clean, although maybe it will actually come out with words like this. And maybe it won't be words at all. What you'll feel is pressure. And the pressure will be to shut up. And if you are the one who said out loud that our marriage stinks, the spoken or unspoken pressure to you is going to be this kind of indictment. You must not care very much about your marriage. You're not respecting your husband. For you to say that out loud, you must not care much about your wife. And all of a sudden, the one who's saying we have a problem with our marriage is the problem for saying there's a problem. You might have already heard that kind of thing from Jeff. When the truth is, the one who breaks the silence and says out loud, our marriage is not doing very well, is the only one in the relationship who cares about the marriage. because I quit caring whether you think we have a good marriage or not. You know what I started caring about? Whether we have a good marriage or not. And if I care about having a good marriage, I might say out loud our marriage stinks. Why would I say that? Because I want to embarrass my husband? No, because I'd like to know my husband. Why would I say out loud our marriage stinks? Because I want to humiliate my wife? No, I'd like to maybe know my wife. And the first step to doing that is saying out loud, I don't know my wife. Blessed are those who get out here, what's going on in here, they alone. They are the only ones. who get the comfort, who get the healing. And the people who keep on pretending might end up on the elder board. And they might be the president of the school, and they might be the pastor, but they get no comfort. And they don't get a real marriage. What if you're depressed? I mean, I talked about depression a minute ago. What if you're discouraged? Let's forget about depression. Let's just say you're discouraged. What if you begin to go through what I think normal Christians go through from time to time, and that is this, you begin to get some serious questions about God. In fact, I have a theory that the more you have plunged your life into the realities of the kingdom life and have placed your life completely into the hands of God, the more likely it is to, from time to time, come up with major questions, not about whether you've committed to Christ or not, but whether having committed to Christ, it was the wisest thing you ever did. I liken it sometimes to jumping off a cliff. I've jumped off the cliff. I can minister as a pastor to people who haven't. The cliff is kind of a metaphor for commitment, you know, body, soul, the whole thing. I can minister to people who haven't. I'm not where they are. I've jumped off the cliff. Every once in a while when I'm in a free fall, I wonder if it was a good idea. You think, well, I'm just amazed how you're sharing that with us. Maybe I wouldn't have the courage to share it if I didn't know a pretty good, a pretty good guy had the same question. In fact, it was a guy of whom Jesus said he was the greatest man ever born of woman. His name is John the Baptist. After his ministry. See, the question he asks is one of those questions you ought to have settled before you go into ministry, not after. After his ministry, multitudes had come. His impact was incredible. He was in prison. He was in a dungeon metaphor for he was going through a rough time and all of a sudden the the stuff that used to work isn't working anymore and he came up with a pretty common question pretty normal question he said to one of his disciples go to jesus and ask him if he's the one or should we look for another that is a you know and any any any church that i know is going to read that verse in that story and they will they'll say that and not bat an eye that there's something wrong with john there's nothing wrong john that's that's what he asked it's to feel like you know in fact the bible teacher would make sure you know that fact. But hear what he's saying. At the end of his ministry, he's wondering if Jesus is the one. What do you do with a question like that? If you've been teaching the Sunday school class for 15 years, or you've been the pastor for 20 years, and now in the quietness of your own despair, and your own stumbling, and what used to be happening isn't anymore, and you're wondering, and you know what? My question isn't whether I've committed. I've committed. I just wonder if it was a good idea. Where do you go with those kinds of feelings if how things look is what matters? There's nowhere to go. And I hear Jesus saying, blessed are those who ask those questions when they have those questions. They're the ones who will be able to work through those questions. Those are not bad questions. But if you don't have a place to go with those kinds of questions and those kinds of doubts, you get to keep your doubt. Don't doubt. Okay, so when I do, I deny I do. No, I need to say out loud I do and run the risk of people who say, don't ever doubt, are going to think I'm not a very good Christian. But when I have those doubts, I'm going to say them out loud so I can work through them. And I hear Jesus say first words out of his mouth, blessed are those who do that. They're the only ones who are going to be able to go through their doubt and come again to real faith, not pretend faith. Another way to say this, by the way, in my mind is blessed are those who quit pretending. What if you're in a system like this how things look is what matters it's more important that you think i'm spiritual than i really be spiritual so my private life in terms of my pursuit of god is not where i spend my energy i spend all my energy creating this persona as a pastor hello hello dearly beloved open your mouth you know you're kind of with this language and this image and you know what i have a theory all of us have only so much energy you know what i mean i mean you have this much energy some of us have more energy than others, but all of us have so much. And you're going to spend it somewhere. These who make a fair show in the flesh spend the energy that they have polishing the outside of the cup and of the bowl. Jesus said, spend the energy of your life developing an inner life. Developing an inner life of passion toward God and honesty toward Him and toward men so that the outside may be clean as well. But it's coming from the inside out. It's authentic and real. And the people who are doing that are people who mourn. It doesn't mean walking around being bummed all day. It means getting out here, what's really in here. Blessed are those who quit pretending is what it means. Now that's all the emotional stuff. Obviously there's some spiritual stuff. Oh, by the way, just one little fear factor in here. What if you're the one who's coming up with the doubts and you're the one who's not feeling real spiritual and those are the real feelings and you're the pastor and now you have a need to get out here what's going on in here but you've been part of you've been part of developing this system that made it impossible for people to get out here what's in here how lonely are you how lonely are you it's pretty scary to me spiritual ways this applies i gotta touch this quickly only a few more minutes rather than just get out your pain and get out your your your anguish and stuff uh it applies to sin. Psalm 32, David said this. It's just wonderful. He says, when I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away. Your hand was heavy upon me and my vitality was drained away as if by the heat from summer. But when I confess my sin, you forgave me. And what I hear, what I hear ringing down the quarters of history out of Psalm 32 is Matthew 5. What that means, David, is blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are those who get out here, what's going on in here. Blessed are those who quit pretending about their sin too and quit rationalizing about their sin and quit blaming everybody else for their sin and start looking really hard at their sin. And here's my kingdom promise to you. If you start getting real about your sin, you will get what? In a kingdom church. In a kingdom context, you will get what? Comfort. You will get grace. My theory is this. Until people believe that they will get comfort, until people believe that they will get grace, they will not mourn. They will not get out here what's in here. If they still suspect that they're going to get condemned, they will continue to hide. Let me just wrap up with a few questions. I think I've established the fact that mourning has value. Getting out here what's in here is a high value. let's say just for sake of argument that we all agree about that after my talk and we all yeah i really see the value of this emotionally spiritually we all agree here's my question if we all agree why is it still so hard and why do we still see so little of it a couple a couple of suggestions that i have one is fear maybe that's the most obvious what would people think if you answer this is the old that's the old thing if if you know what i was really like, I'm just convinced you'd never like me, you'd never accept me, and I just have enormous amounts of fear. I don't know how to get over that fear. There is, well, I have some ideas. What I'm trying to say with that is I just don't think there's any presto chango thing. I think it takes years to develop an environment in a church or in a family where people really begin to trust. It takes years to develop trust and to develop what we call here at Open Door a graceful atmosphere. I mean, that doesn't come because you preach a sermon. That comes because you've established a way of life over years and developed a track record that when people really do begin to mourn, they get comfort, not condemned. But people are afraid. That's one reason. Another reason people don't get out here, what's in here, and I want to be able to clarify this well, so don't react too negatively to this, but they can't. They can't. And where I'm landing on this one is I'm landing now on the Pharisee who Jesus spoke to in Matthew 23, and I'm not saying they can't as if they're doomed forever and they're going to hell for sure. What I mean is this. I really think there comes this place, and it's not a line that can't be brought back, but if you invest long enough, just think about this, in the image. If you've spent your entire life investing in the image and all of the energy of your life has not been spent developing the inner life, authentic faith in Christ, being out here with all the stuff that's there, where God can heal it and grow you and people can see it. All of your energy has been spent out here polishing the outside of the cupping of the bowl. When you do that long enough and invest it long enough, there comes this time, I don't know when it is, and I'm never giving up on anybody, but I do believe there comes this time when you don't even know it's fake anymore. When you don't even know it's fake anymore. And when calls for mourning come, it's not even something you're resisting. It's not even something you're, oh, that's really getting too close. You don't feel anything because you don't have any sense of your own hypocrisy anymore and their conscience is seared. First Timothy talks about it. I think some people can't. It doesn't mean they ever won't. It doesn't mean they're hopeless. But in the condition they are, they just don't get it. Another reason is sometimes despair. What do you mean? I mean this. I think sometimes when people hear a word like I'm giving, to get out here, what's in here, the reason they don't is not because, you know, I'm not going to do that. It's not about rebellion. It's the belief that they're past forgiving. I've gone too far. I've done too much. Not have I gone too far and done too much. The thing I need forgiveness for, I've done before, and I've asked for forgiveness before, and I've done it too often. so when the spirit prompts it isn't hardness that is the trouble the problem is despair another reason is this it could have been that you were in a church or in a family or with a group of christians maybe a small group where god moved on you one day and you knew you had to do this you didn't call it morning that day you didn't have this teaching you didn't call about getting out here, what was in here, but that was what you did. It wasn't those words, but this pain you had, this fear you had, this depression, discouragement, this whatever it was, this hurt you had, you were in this context where for whatever reason it felt safe to do it this time. Maybe it wasn't a discouragement or depression or anything, it was sin. And you'd been hiding this thing for months. And for whatever reason, the moving of God, friends you thought were safe, There came this liberty to give it away, and you said it out loud. And instead of getting comfort, you got condemned. Instead of getting comfort, you saw the look on people's faces that they were horrified that you said what you just said. And you made a vow that day. You didn't know you made a vow, but you did. And the vow you made was this, I will never do that again. And so the next time the Spirit of God prompted, and it is the Spirit, it is the Spirit prompts you to get out here. What's in here? How do you know it's the Spirit? Because the first word out of Jesus' mouth relative to life in the kingdom is this. Blessed are those who do this, and the Spirit of God in you will visit you again with a prompting. And the reason you don't isn't because of rebellion, it's because you did it before, and the power of a vow that you don't even know you made is there saying, I will never do that again. And again, that's one of those things that takes some time in a family or a church over time where a graceful environment is there over time and people begin to really believe. Maybe it is safe to say this out loud. Some people don't mourn because they do love their sin. Let's not be naive about that. Some people love their sin. And for people who love their sin, the word to you is simply this. It probably needs to get worse for you. You probably need some more pain. I don't wish for you pain. I wish for you mourning. If it takes pain, I wish for you pain. So that you'll come up mourning. So that you can get comfort. So that you can get healed. There is a general superficiality in the church. Today, I am afraid. And that's nothing new. I say today as if it's a new thing. There's just a general superficiality in the church, and part of it is that it's manifested in the fact that we don't call for mourning. And the superficiality is manifested in the fact that we have messages that don't exactly say this, but they sound a little bit like this. Come to God, and He'll give you a nice big lollipop, and He'll make all your clouds roll away, and everything will be great. He'll give you a lollipop. I just don't hear Jesus saying that in Matthew 5. I hear Him saying this. kingdom dwellers are not people who've come to me looking for lollipops kingdom dwellers are people who've come look to me looking for forgiveness kingdom dwellers are people who've come to me looking for grace and when they want forgiveness and that's what they want is grace that's what i give them and they're the ones who get the kingdom and they're the ones who get the healing leave you with this one image we live in an entertainment at Mad Society. Picture it in your mind, like I do right now. A huge auditorium. Sit up where the people get the nosebleeds. You can't hardly see the entertainer. He's about this big on the stage. He's being paid millions of dollars to make us laugh, and he does, and it's great. Millions of dollars, though, for this little guy to make us laugh. Wouldn't it be great if just once, not just you, but think of the world. See, I stick the gospel into this thing. Wouldn't it be great if just once people could laugh because they were clean and not have to laugh to try to medicate the fact that they're not. Blessed are those who mourn, who get out of here, what's in here, they get the healing. They get the comfort. First words out of Jesus' mouth. You can't get more basic than this. It's very important that we see this as foundational. These things we're saying on this weekend, aren't new. They're the foundation of it all. Thank you.
