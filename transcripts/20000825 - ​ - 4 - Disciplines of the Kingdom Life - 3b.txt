It is something of a blow to our self-importance, and actually that is one of the main things that solitude strikes at. Solitude strikes at our sense of self-importance. I have ministers who will say to me, I can't do that. Why, I have to be there at the office. And my reply to them is, well, what if you died? Do you think they would just quit? But you see, we can talk ourselves into this. And one of the great gifts of solitude is the realization that the world is not resting on my back. And sleep is a gift that comes when people lay down that burden. Elijah slept and an angel woke him up and fed him and he laid down and slept again. Those are Elijah's disciplines, eating and sleeping. We need to pay attention. God has arranged them for us because they're good for us. The last time I looked, it was still on the list that we are to spend one-seventh of our waking time doing no work. Now, you see, when you begin to think about that, you can see why solitude would prove to be so fundamental in our relationship to God. See, God is not going to compete for our attention. And you can just put it down. He is not going to do a song and dance in front of us to get our attention. That isn't God's way. God's way is, if you seek me with all your heart, you will surely find me. If you are enmeshed in your relationships to the extent that most people are, you couldn't possibly seek God with all your heart. That's why you need solitude. You need solitude to bring you to the place to where you can seek God. No, no, it isn't the same as solitude. Solitude is what enables us to do that. Remember, the structure of the discipline is something in our power that enables us to do what we cannot do by direct effort. You cannot see God with all your heart if you're battling away with this, that, and the other. You've even forgotten about God because your reputation is on the line or someone is about to criticize you for something or whatever. So you have to step out of that. Now, this is a fundamental discipline and we have to learn how to reply to all of these problems that arise and we have to do it by practicing solitude until it begins to take hold and I tell you it will take hold and you will discover resources for living for God before God and with God that you never dreamed existed. But if you stay in your pursuits then God will let you stay in those pursuits. and if you say the world can't do without me he'll let you keep that illusion but the truth is I can't do without God that's the truth I can't do without God and the law of the Sabbath is deeply mixed with this because you know if you can't practice solitude you probably can't practice Sabbath. And very few people today can practice Sabbath because they're so tied in to everything pulling at them. You really have to think about this deep, folks. This may seem strange or a little Catholic to you or something like that. I never know quite where my audiences are traveling around the country. But you see, when I began to concern myself with these things, I thought I was in pretty good shape over here until I began to think about it and try to make it really work. And then I realized I wasn't doing so well. These looked good because these were activities. I wasn't thinking of them as disciplines. But even with activities, I began to find that prayer and study and worship and certainly celebration, some of these other things, I really wasn't doing very well with them. And in fact, I was driven into solitude and silence personally by the need to make prayer work. And I found that prayer was not a little something I could tack on. Even several hours of it was not a little something I could tack on. I had to become different. And out of that, to learn to pray. But my orientation was, this is the stuff. I didn't think of them as disciplines. I thought of them as services. And this, what's this over here? See, that didn't make any sense. Again, I thought, well, that's a little too Catholic for me. And then I began to understand that if I didn't live over on the left-hand side, the right hand side would get mighty thin and in fact the right hand side could be a quick path to burn out and in my context I was told repeatedly it's better to burn out than to rust out did you ever hear that? it took me several years to figure out that you didn't have to do either one of those that it wasn't an either or situation and you know we go through all the stuff that is thrown at us and praying, for example. I had to find out that you don't pray, you don't do heroic praying. Prayer is not a hero situation. Prayer is you learn how to pray as a part of your life with God. And then there are the great prayers like Norman Grubb and Praying Hyde and other people. Okay, that may be for them. But if you try that, you're not going to make it. And so you might as well decide now how you're going to handle your guilt. You're not going to make that. And that's because very few people are called to heroic praying. But you have to be in a position for it, and the way you get in a position is over here. You learn how to pray by living in solitude. You learn how to come before God you give up all these illusions that only if you're out there thrashing around are you serving God you know Milton's sonnet on his blindness Milton went blind at a relatively early age and he was a writer and he had many things planned to write and how do you do that if you're going blind well he actually found a way but if you've never read Milton's sonnet just titled on his blindness I encourage you to read it and it includes words such as these, thousands at his bidding speed and post or land and sea, those also serve who only stand and wait. See, he understood. God does not day labor require when light is denied. He understood that. And he came to peace. And he was able to go in the strength of that and continue to do wonderful work for God. And we have to understand that thing. Be still and know that I am God. Be inactive and know that I am God. Now, see, the old way was to take that as an end in itself. and people like Luther and Calvin criticize that justifiably. It isn't an end in itself. It isn't something that we do just because we enjoy it. We learn to do it as a discipline that enables us to live in the kingdom of God in a way that we could not otherwise do. I have a question here and then we'll talk about silence a little bit. Okay, good. so now with reference to solitude let me just say a few practical things now one is you have to practice it for a long enough time for it to gain intensity you have to practice it for long enough times for it to gain intensity you can't really make progress with this by selecting an hour here and there. You're better to save your hours up and invest them in an afternoon. Long enough for you to get a good nap and on both sides of it have some experience of being alone and rested. You can't get a shower by one drop of water every five minutes no matter how long you stay in the shower. You have to get wet. lots of water at the same time now solitude is like that you have to stay with it you have to let it develop silence is the same way silence is one of the most powerful disciplines you'll ever experience I have seen people's lives totally revolutionized by it but you have to take time for it see and this is one of the greatest challenges to your faith again is will you take the time? You cannot find the time. Don't look for the time because you won't find it. You have to make time. That's why this is a challenge to your faith. Because what you're going to do is what you believe is important. And if you've got the vision right and the intention right and you see how solitude and silence connect then you will make the time. Don't be heroic about any discipline, including solitude. In other words, don't try to suffer. Don't think of a specially uncomfortable place for you to go to be in solitude. Don't believe this stuff about no pain, no gain. It's not true. There's lots of gain with no pain, and there's lots of pain with no gain. And the temptation here is that you will be drawn in to make your suffering, Again, something heroic and something that is earning something from God. Don't do that. Be comfortable. Find a place you'd like to be and be alone there. Try to make it a quiet place or only natural sounds. Again, you can't divorce the solitude and silence thing. They interact with one another. And go spend a lengthy period of time quietly resting in that place. You have to let your mind run down. You know, these cars that kids have that have the little weight in them and they push them away and they keep going. We're like that, see? So we have to keep going to the point where that inner motor stops and then just rests there. Now, when I say you don't want to do anything, I mean you don't want to do any work. If you enjoy walking, walking is fine. You can use your scriptures and your hymn book, but don't make work of it. do what you enjoy you like to read poetry that's often very good or listen to very gentle and quiet music that sometimes can be good but don't make it again anything that you're doing to improve yourself get used to the idea that you are doing nothing doing nothing just embrace that idea then you should plan to have periods every week in which you do nothing you don't need to take an afternoon for that but after you get into it you'll be able to have solitude in shorter periods of time with greater effect do what you enjoy do things that don't amount to anything I often cite ducks and watching ducks because ducks are so totally gratuitous that's what you want see I mean there's no excuse for a duck if you've ever looked at a duck you know there is no excuse for a duck and that's really you want to be in that point where you're not doing anything to get anything you've turned loose you say but am I doing this so that I can find yes you are but don't try to make that happen if you try to make it happen you'll lose the point of solitude and you'll constantly be saying, is it happening? Is it happening now? Are we about there? And that's what you really have to move. Let me add silence on to that now because silence means, well, really two things. It's two separate disciplines. One, it means quiet. Escaping noise. Noise is an absolute blight on our existence. Maybe not here in Minnesota, but it's hard to find any place else that it just isn't a blight on your existence. The noise, the racket, a lot of it is self-induced. We think, keep pumping stuff in our ears, it'll do something for us, music, all that sort of, just quiet. You may have forgotten what quiet is like. So you may need to put some effort into finding a place where you can actually be quiet. If you've ever been in one of these cork line sound rooms, you experience what quiet is, and then once you experience it, you realize it's doing something to you. Quiet is not an absence. It is a ponderous reality. It speaks to your soul. It's like the wind of eternity blowing in your face. Just silence, quiet. And when you go into silence, you find that you are able to rest inwardly in a way that you cannot if noise is pounding at you. Sound enters perhaps most deeply of all the senses into your body. And so you learn to detach yourself, to enter into rest and quiet. Now, not speaking is another dimension of silence. It has a very different function because when we stop speaking, we lay down the burden of adjusting perceptions of us. And that's very important for us. It's a great act of surrender not to explain yourself. If you do something stupid when you're entirely alone, you'll probably explain it to yourself. See, that's because talking is so tied into how we present ourselves to others. Being silent in that respect means we lay down the burden of adjusting other people's perceptions of us. See, now, again, I mean, here's abuse. People who take vows of silence. and they never speak. Well, I don't mean to say that there might not be some case individually where God would call a person to that. I cannot imagine what it would be, but, you know, that's up to God. But this is an illustration of how you take something good and you turn it into something bad. Solitude and silence are not things you take vows for. They are things you use as wisdom to help you bring your life into the kingdom of God ever more fully. And as you do it, you will begin to experience it. I want to talk a little bit about fasting, then I'll just talk quickly about some of the others and answer questions about them. and I think that will have to be our presentation for the time being. But let me say this. If you will take solitude and silence and put them into practice and then begin to join them with study and worship and include things like scripture memorization of passages in your study and let that all bleed over into your worship, you're going to have enough to drive you. in the kingdom of God a long, long ways. And in fact, most of these things will come along. I want to say about some of the others in a moment, but let me talk about fasting. Now what is fasting? Fasting means basically that we do without food. Extreme fasting without food and water. Moderate fasting only with special kinds of food. But fasting basically means that we refrain from eating. And you may think what a strange thing to do. And especially since, as I've already said, when we engage in spiritual disciplines, we don't do that to accumulate righteousness or run God in a corner or whatever, you know. We do it to access the reality of the kingdom. Now, Jesus had something very interesting to say. At the end of his fast, he actually takes some words from Deuteronomy 8. Let's look at Jesus' words here in Matthew 4. And at the end of his long fast, Satan comes to tempt him. And first of all, with the lust of the flesh, hunger. nothing wrong with that in itself but if it governs life then there is something wrong with it and when Satan tempts him in verse 3 if you are the son of God command that these stones become bread and Jesus replies it is written man shall not live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God now bread is one of the words that proceeds out of the mouth of God everything that is created proceeded from the mouth of God through his word but Jesus is pointing here to a very special kind of relationship in which the word of God becomes literally a substance to our body to nourish it and one way that I like to put this is to say fasting is feasting fasting is not just a deprivation, it is a realization. It is laying hold of something in place of standard food. Now God has ordained that we would in the normal situation be humble before food, standard food, that we would be dependent on it. But then he is also, by his word and practice in the scripture, has made it clear that there is an alternative source of strength. And in fasting, we directly take in the word of God into our bodies, and our bodies are upheld by the spiritual kingdom of God. Okay, now, I know that that's a little bit of a strain. Do you remember Deuteronomy 8? It's about, this is where Jesus takes the quotation. Deuteronomy 8 is where God is sustaining the children of Israel in the wilderness. And do you remember what they had to eat? Manna. Now let me ask you, what was manna? Verse 3 of Deuteronomy 8. He humbled you and let you be hungry and fed you with manna which you did not know. That he might make you to understand that man does not live by bread alone. So it wasn't bread, was it? but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord. Add to the thing a bit. Look at the next verse. Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot grow larger in relation to your shoes. You didn't outgrow your shoes for 40 years. None of that new shoe smell. Old shoe smell. what's that talking about? that's talking about something we see at many places in the scripture that is physical reality being sustained and expanded from the kingdom of God directly for example Elijah you remember went to a widow in Zarephath in a famine and this widow was in the process of preparing the last meal from her meal and oil and she was going to eat it with her son and die. Elijah said, go fix it for me. Now if you think that wasn't a test of that woman's faith, you haven't got the story. The fact that she did what Elijah said showed she had great faith. And you'll remember the rest of the story, I trust. Until the end of the famine, the meal and the oil kept coming. Where did it come from? Same place the shoes did. Same place the clothing did. Same place the manna did. Manna means, what is it? That's what manna means. It means, what is it? So go gather another bucket of what is it for dinner. Manna was the word of God congealed into a form that they could deal with it. If you wish, manna is just congealed word of God. Makes it manageable. So the loaves and the fishes, where did that come from? Same place. when you fast your body is sustained from the same reality that produced the meal and the oil and the shoes and the clothes and the manna and the loaves and the fishes see when you talk about the kingdom of God you're talking about reality you're not talking about something that isn't real, you're talking about reality if we had time to get fancy with that we could talk about what energy is and what matter is and where energy comes from and so forth and so on and even at the human level you know these cyclotrons where they fire photons around and try to get them to meet and produce matter from their energy God produces matter from energy all the time he has infinite energy now when you fast you are involving yourself with the kingdom of God in a way that you are not involved in other times and therefore your actions have a different effect I hope I haven't totally ruined your afternoon by saying that to you so you need to understand what fasting is fasting is feasting when I fast now I had to learn to fast but when I fast I never experience hunger never I'm stronger than when I don't fast now I wouldn't say that to you because you say well this guy's just shooting off his mouth bragging look when we get up to teach we just have to say a lot of stuff and you can try this yourself and I've shown it to other people and they've tried it and found it to be the same. Now I had to learn to fast. When I was learning to fast, I didn't experience that. I experienced hunger. Do you know why? Because I was thinking about fasting. It's like when you pray. Don't think about praying. Think about what you're praying for. Right? But see, it took me a long time to get to the point where I could stop thinking about praying. thinking I wonder if anything's going to happen and what a goose I'm going to look like if it doesn't and so no wonder your prayers don't do any good if you're thinking about that so you have to come to the point where you don't care how you look that's why the passage of the individual from the point where they say I'll pray for you to the point where they say let's pray now is a huge step. It's a huge step to say, let's pray now. And the results are very different. And if you've been down that road, you know that, the result, because you are engaging God's kingdom in a different way with your prayer when you say, let's pray now. Or when you pray with laying on of hands. See, laying on of hands is a fundamental, New Testament practice and teaching. But you have to be into the kingdom of God in a different way before you can effectively do that. And of course if you're not going to pray with people you can't lay your hands on them in the distance can you now? So it all hangs together. Fasting is something we learn how to do and then when we learn how to do we forget about it. you do other things and when you learn to fast you will find that your engagement with the work of the Lord is entirely different in quality entirely different in quality and again I have tested this over and over with group after group of especially ministers and telling them how to use fasting as a part of their ministry and I've never had one come back to me and say it didn't work. Yes. That's right. He was absolutely right. He was being positioned in a position of strength. He never missed a beat because he was tied into his father in a way that he would not have been if he had not done that. Fasting makes you strong. It does not make you weak. And I really, I could just go on and on about this with my own experience with it and what it does. I was, I think, telling Keith about jet lag. Now, I travel a lot, and I just got back. It's 14 hours on the airplane from Atlanta to Johannesburg. 14 hours. But I have done that repeatedly now with fasting, prayer, scripture, meditation. I get off the plane. I don't have a moment of jet lag. I used to do this they had to scrape me off the plane roll me into bed and leave me there for 24 hours and I honestly and I don't just do it for those but anytime I have a long trip basically longer than Chicago sort of the rule of thumb I follow then I don't eat I don't drink coffee I don't drink anything else with a little water I pray, meditate and fast and I memorized scripture. Now, if you want to know how the word of God is substance to your body, learn to do that. Learn to do that, and you will learn what strength from God is like in a way you've never known before. Just one other comment here on the scripture. Remember John 4, such an incredibly instructive chapter Jesus is waiting by the well while the fellows go in and bring out some bagels and lox or something and while he's there he is ministering he's ministering, he's doing the work of the kingdom and that's a beautiful story in itself but what happens is when they come back with the food they're kind of worried about him talking to this woman for one thing but then they want him to eat and he says I have meat to eat that you know not of my meat is to do the will of him that sent me now see this is one of those many places in the teachings of Jesus where we just have to say well are these just pretty words just pretty words maybe we set them to music make a song I have meat to eat that you know not of no he was saying what was exactly true what was exactly true he was engaged with the kingdom of God and what he said was true I have meat to eat that you don't know about because they were asking has anyone given him something to eat? And the answer was yes, God had. I have meat to eat that you know not of. Fasting is a very fundamental discipline for the spiritual life. And when its power lies in the fact that it unites us with the reality of God's kingdom in a way that otherwise we're not united. Now, it isn't the normal way to go. We should practice routinely fasting, and we should fast purposively for special needs. We should, and we need to practice routine fasting, so when we need to fast for special needs, we won't be thinking about fasting. And the disciplinary function of fasting is manifold. There are many aspects. One is to teach us to be sweet and strong when we don't get what we want. See, it's a part of the project of the cross in the life of the believer. I don't get what I want, so what? That in itself is of no significance. And the old saints all knew that the person who fasted well would be in charge of all of their desires. And fasting does have that effect. So that when you don't get your way with something else, you're not upset about it. Now often there are issues other than just you getting your way. And sometimes you need to insist upon something that is right or good. So it isn't like you turn into Casper Milk Toast or someone like that, you know. Actually, you have more strength, you have more vigor, you have more clarity, you have more calmness to do what is right. You don't have to get angry to stand for what is right, to be resolute, and if necessary, take death. You see, that comes with the practice of fasting. It is the knowledge of our engagement with the kingdom of God. Now again, we don't talk a lot about it, and I'm talking too much about it right now, but here's secrecy. It's a very important discipline. Secrecy is the practice of not letting our good deeds be known. And people who think that fasting is a good need, those are the ones in Jesus' day. You remember in Matthew 6, he said, people fast to be seen of men. And in that teaching there in Matthew 6, he's talking about doing good deeds, praying and fasting to be seen of men. Now there's nothing wrong with being seen of men when you do your good deeds, pray and fast. That's not the point. The disciplines, you don't go into solitude because there's something wrong with human relations. Right? You don't fast because there's something wrong with food. That's crazy. And you don't practice secrecy because there's something wrong with being known to do good deeds, to pray, to fast. No. The problem is not with being known, but with doing them to be known. You see the difference? Now then secrecy helps you get over that. The person who practices secrecy learns to do what is good and to avoid what is bad without regard to what people say. If they praise, if they blame, it doesn't matter. You know the proverb that says, the fear of man bringeth a snare. And secrecy enables us to step free from that snare of worrying about what people are going to say. are they going to approve are they going to disapprove you don't do that you live before an audience of one that's God that's your audience and you learn to do that and an incredible stability then comes now you have to practice it because ever since we're little kids it's approval and disapproval isn't that right oh no oh yes oh you're wonderful oh how wonderful oh he's been a naughty boy today so all of that stuff heaped up and we still now we're 60 years old and we're still thinking about that sort of stuff you know secrecy can help you break out from that and then of course your fasting you do it in secret or others know it doesn't matter and that's true of all of these things that we might practice I'm not quite done but it's 3 o'clock let's take a little break and come back and finish this and then I want to talk about some more personal issues how could it be more personal? I don't know Thank you.
