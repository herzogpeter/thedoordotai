Open your Bibles with me to the book of Galatians, chapter 1, verse 6. Galatians, chapter 1, verse 6, second week of our study. Paul says these words, I'm amazed that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel, which is really not another. Only there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ. But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed. And as we have said before, so say I again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you have received, let him be accursed. For I am now seeking, for am I now seeking the favor of men or of God? Or am I striving to please man? If I were striving to please men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ. I love this word. I love this book. And every week it seems to me, when I go home from a Sunday and I move into the next week and I discern in my mind that text that we'll be dealing with, the fear is always stirred up in me after I preach on a Sunday. I've just run out of things to say. I've told them everything I know. There's nothing left to say. And week after week after week, the Word of God comes and deepens us and teaches us things. I love this Word. One of the ways that I believe we honor this Word is by treating it in a deep way, by bringing ourselves to it in such a way that would say, I think this is so vital, so important, that I'm going to spend the time it takes and I'm going to spend the energy it takes to understand this so that it will grip me and change me. This morning is going to be a study. And I want you to enter into this study with me. It's going to be work. And I want you to do some work with me this morning. You're going to have to exercise your mind. And you're going to have to expand your thinking. And you're going to have to hang with me. And you might do well to take out a piece of paper and a pen and try to take some notes to kind of follow along. I believe this lesson, as we're beginning here this morning, is going to be important for our entire study in Galatians. We're building a foundation these first couple of weeks. I would ask you, as we begin this morning, for you to pray for me. Invariably, when I move into the pulpit, depending on what it is that I'm talking about, Satan invariably is attacking me at that area. There are times when what I'm talking about is something very emotional and very close to my heart. You can bet your life that where Satan is attacking me is he's telling me I'm a chump for being open. I should never tell people how I really feel. You can just be guaranteed that that's what I'm going through. This is one where the mind has to be clear. And you can bet your life things have been going on all morning long that have been distorting my brain so I don't know if I'm thinking clear or not. Would you join with me in praying that God's word would be proclaimed with clarity and power this morning? That the gospel would be heard. Would you join me in that? Let's pray. Jesus, we are a people who love your word. And Lord, we are also aware that we are a people, even though our hearts yearn for you and yearn for the truth of the word, that sometimes we move away from it unwittingly at times. I pray, Jesus, that by your teaching you will expose to us areas in our individual lives and in our life as a church that we could unwittingly move away from the pure and simple gospel. I pray, Father, for far more than mental, intellectual clarity, though, Lord. I pray for the endowment and the touch of your Holy Spirit upon what we're speaking on this morning. In Jesus' name, amen. We spoke last week in an introduction of the fact that when Paul wrote an epistle, he never wrote to them just to dispense theology upon their minds. He didn't just give them doctrine. He gave them doctrine for a purpose. The doctrine that he gave them was always designed to solve a problem. When he would write an epistle, he would always be addressing some particular issue in that church. When he went to Corinth, he was confronting directly their carnality. When he writes to the church in Galatia, he is confronting directly their problem with legalism. And all of the theology and doctrine that he gives them is not just so that they understand principles of legalism or principles for the church in Corinth, principles of carnality, but the theology is designed to help them solve the problem that is sitting there, right there. If, then, that's the purpose of his epistle, if 2,000 years later we would endeavor to understand his epistle, we need to do more than simply disseminate the theology. We need to understand the situation to which this book was written. And I believe, to the extent that God gives us the ability to do it, we need to enter into this situation, put ourselves in that place, and try to understand. Last week, we kind of exposed you to what was going on in these churches, these Galatian churches. Last week, we discovered from this letter that there is a tremendous amount of tension in Paul's writing. Highly confrontive in nature is this book. He is not terribly gentle with what he is saying to them about their problem of legalism. He doesn't come to them, put his arm around them, gently say, Hey, I think you're doing a wonderful job. In fact, this is one of the only epistles I know of where he does not first commend them for their walk with Christ. No commendation. He even did that for the church in Corinth. Chapter 1, verse 6. I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting him. Chapter 2, 11. He confronts Peter to his face. Remember that last week? Some of us were appalled at that when we read that for the first time. But when Cephas, that's Peter, came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned. The legalist had actually sucked in the apostle Peter. In chapter 3, verse 1, you foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you? Before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. Verse 3, why are you so foolish? Tremendous tension. And then verse 411, maybe this is the epitome of everything he says. After he's just rebuking them tremendously, he says, I fear for you that perhaps I have labored over you in vain. My ministry with you has been a waste of time. We established that fact last week that there was tension in this church. Tension not so much in the church, there was tension in this letter. He was confronting something and the fur was going to fly when he did. the question we have to ask today as we kind of progress through this thing is this what is the source of the tension what in the world could be so serious what in the world could have made paul so angry and now again it's very important that we don't come up with some simplistic answer just break down a little theology identify the good guys identify the bad guys and go home it isn't that simple what we're moving into this morning is a situation It's a situation where people are involved and perspectives are involved and ideas and theology is involved in ways of living, are involved in this whole thing. And like in any real life situation, especially a volatile one, if I am going to move into a volatile situation, one of the things I need to understand as I do that is that the answers to figuring out that situation aren't going to be that simple. They are going to be multifaceted. And we find ourselves asking questions like, what do we do? What are they doing? How do we sort this out? Where do we begin to understand what exactly is going on? Have you ever found yourself in a situation? I'll just put that in quotes. Situation. Just a situation. You walk into a room and something's buzzing. Something's just happening. You can feel the tension. Something's wrong. Something's up. There's a word over here, a word of anger over here, a word of impatience over here. Somebody's crying over here. Somebody's laughing over here. And you try to start figuring out what in the world is happening here. And you listen and you start picking up little bits and pieces and you try to sort it out. You know what you're going to do this morning with me? I'm not going to get you off the hook. I don't want to just dump a whole bunch of stuff on you. I want you to come into this situation with me. Get your ears all perked up and start listening. Start listening. Ask the questions as we move into Galatians. What's going on here? What's happening? What are these people upset about? What is Paul upset about? What can we listen for? As I began to dig in this text and began, here's the phrase I would like to use as you go into this text that we need to kind of wade into it. You've ever waded into it and you just start moving into it. and you start getting the feel for what's going on. As I began to wade through this text, there was something that perked my ear up, and I began to hear it, and I thought, that's where we're going to start. That's the first thing my attention is drawn to. That's where we're going to go. It's a little phrase that appears twice in the text I just read. Once in verse 8 at the end of that verse, and once in verse 9, it's this verse. It's this phrase. Let him be accursed. Twice. let him be accursed. The Greek word for accursed is the word anathema. It is a word that many of you are familiar with. You've heard it before. It means simply this, to cut off. It indicates something that is absolutely forbidden. It is the act of handing over. Let it be anathema. I hand it over to a curse. I hand it over to destruction. In fact, literally, that is what it means. When something is anathema, When something is accursed, it is devoted to destruction. I want you to have that phrase in your mind. Let him be devoted to destruction. One of the reasons that little phrase catches my eye is because that's a powerfully serious thing to say. You don't hear that even very often in the Word of God. Anathema, devoted to the destruction. In the Old Testament, in Joshua 6, verse 7, in regard to the city of Jericho. One of the designations that God had placed on that city was simply that. It is anathema. It is devoted. It is set apart by God for this purpose, destruction. That's a pretty heavy statement. In the New Testament, we don't even see that term that often. But as my mind begins to reel with this whole thing of this phrase, let them be devoted to destruction, one of the things I want to know is who is he talking about? Who in the world could possibly have that designation placed upon their life that because of what they've done or what they've said, they are devoted to destruction? You know that one of the phrases that that word is used to describe over and over again, in fact, most often in the New Testament, it is referring to those who are engaging in false teaching. False teaching. would lead you to believe that teaching in general is vitally important. Clear, solid, deep teaching is the lifeblood of the church. False teaching can kill the church. Shallow teaching can kill the church. And lo and behold, as I did a word study on that word anathema and found out that that word was most often designated for those who were under that designation of false teaching, we find in our study as we're wading through this that that's exactly who he's referring to here in verses 8 and 9. Read them. Even though we are an angel from heaven should what? Preach or teach to you a contrary gospel. Let him be what? Devoted to destruction. What do we know so far? We know that somebody's been devoted to destruction. The second thing we know as we're wading through this and trying to pick it all apart is that those who are devoted to destruction in this text are those who have come with false teaching, false doctrine. Now, before we go busting in through this, like the Keystone Cops and just figuring we can make all sorts of conclusions, one of the things I feel I need to do with you as a pastor teacher who needs to teach is we need to back off a little bit here before we go flying through this text and examine a little bit about what a false teacher really is. what do you think of when you think of a false teacher if i gave you a piece of paper if you flipped your bulletin over and you had a little pen in your hand and you were to draw a picture of a false teacher what would he look like huh anybody would he have fangs huh yeah he probably would he have would he spit venom would he breathe fire would he have eyes that would burn right through you? Is that what a false teacher looks like? For many of us, that's exactly what they would look like. What would they say? Would they come into our midst and say, Jesus is accursed. Grace is folly. Jesus never rose from the dead. Is that what they would say? That would be great. I wish like crazy that all the false prophets and all the false teachers of the world would come just that way. I wish they'd have fangs. I wish they'd spit venom because then they'd come into our midst and I'd go, aha, a false teacher, third row, right in the middle. I can see him. He's got fangs. He spits venom. He walks around saying Jesus is a curse. We'd kick him right out. Be easy. Problem is they don't come that way. And the word of God has warned us over and over and over again that that is not the way they come. Matthew 24 verse 24 says this, false prophets, beloved, and false Christs will arise. And I want to tell you something about them when they arise. They are going to be so convincing that if it were possible, they would even mislead or deceive even the very elect. Their method, dear friends, is not to come into our midst and confront everything. Their method is not to come into the middle of the sanctuary and just start upsetting everything and changing all sorts of things all over the place. Their method is to weasel in among the throng. Their method is to kind of just become as much like the throng as they can, just kind of find people who are superficial and shallow and kind of win them over, and then deceive them, dilute the scripture, and pervert the things that God's going to do. By the way, just so you know something here about a false prophet and a true prophet, one of the things I just said is that what a false prophet won't do is he won't come in and confront everything. That wouldn't be good deception. If you want to deceive somebody, you want to kind of get in on them and warm up to them. You know what true prophets did? True prophets. Oh boy, that's how God slows me down. True prophets. True prophets are the ones who confront. True prophets are the ones who come into the midst of the congregation and say, repent, thus saith the Lord. We need to change our direction. We need to change our viewpoint. We need to be deeper people. True prophets come and say that. Think about that. Would you think about that? Sometimes we think the people who come into the church and call for repentance and call for deeper living, oh, he's upsetting things. He must be a false prophet. Those are the true prophets, beloved. Jeremiah came into the midst of the people and said, you people are moving in the wrong direction. In fact, you are moving right into death. You have no relationship with God. Jeremiah, Isaiah, Paul, confronted. You know what the false prophet does? He comes into our midst and goes, hey, how you doing? How are you? Good guy, shakes your hand, puts his arm around you. You and me. You and me, baby. You know, we're really going to make it. We think alike. Let's not like him together. They're deceivers. They're deceivers. A good deceiver is not going to come right up to you and say, I disagree with you. He's going to get as close to you as he can. John chapter 8, verse 44, talks about Satan, and it defines his character. It says this. He is a liar and he is the father of all lies. I want you to know something about Satan as we're building this foundation for our understanding in Galatians. Get this. That is his arena. The area of lies and deception. When you're talking about lies, you know what that is that's confronting? It's confronting your mind, isn't it? The distinction between what is true and what is false. What I think is true and what I think is false. He is a liar and he is going to try to get me to believe sincerely that what is true is false and what is false is true. And he'll deceive me so that when I make the wrong choice, I'll think it's the right one. That's deception. I believe that Satan's greatest force in diluting the church and perverting the church and the pure, simple gospel is in the arena of false teaching. Now when you begin to realize as I move through this who I'm referring to when I'm using false teaching, you're going to think that's a pretty extreme term when you begin to see who I'm identifying. But that's what Paul identifies. You'll see what I'm saying in a few minutes. He wants to get to your mind, and he wants to get you to think in a shallow way. He wants to get you to think in a convoluted way. And if he can get to your mind, beloved, he will get to your heart eventually. And again, I affirm as strongly as I can, If that is Satan's arena, that he is a liar and the father of lies, I believe it is absolutely imperative that somewhere, somebody along the line is telling the truth, that teaching is clear. Side note, solid teaching of the Word of God, deep teaching of the Word of God is not a luxury for the church. Wouldn't it be nice if we had deep teaching? It's absolutely necessary if we're going to win the war at all because Satan's going to attack you in your mind and he's going to confuse you and deceive you. Listen to the descriptions of false teachers. Acts chapter 13, verse 10. In fact, why don't you turn to it real quick? I told you I was going to make it work, so here we go. Acts chapter 13, verse 10. Paul and Barnabas had just left for the first missionary journey and they met a guy who was called a false prophet. His name is Bar-Jesus. And here we have a description of this guy. You who are full of deceit and fraud, you son of the devil. Whoa, whoa. You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight way of the Lord? Okay, here's a false prophet. Who is a false prophet? I'll tell you who a false prophet is. It says right in that verse, he is a son of the devil. He is an enemy of righteousness. Okay? It looks like he must have fangs and spit venom, right? That's not true. The beauty of the false prophet, in terms of his perspective in wanting to deceive people, is that that is not at all what you see. That is not at all what you see. God's perspective when he exposes a false prophet is just that. He may look real good, but he is a son of the devil. He is an enemy of righteousness. But that's not what you see. Why is it that we don't see the enemy of righteousness and the son of the devil for what he is? Because of what he does. You know what he does? He deceives. He deceives. That's why you can't tell. And he defrauds. And he makes crooked the straight path of the Lord. You know what he does with the straight path of the Lord? The simple gospel, saved by grace through faith, that's it. You know what he does with it? He doesn't take it away and say, ah, that's a baloney. He twists it. He just twists it. He keeps you on the path. He doesn't knock you off the path. He says, oh, yes, we're still on the path. We're on the path. He just twists it. He makes it crooked. Nobody notices. He doesn't come into our midst and say, aha, I am a false prophet. I am a son of the devil. I am an enemy of righteousness. Would you please come and follow me? No, he deceives. He deceives. That's his job. That's what false prophets do. 2 Corinthians chapter 9 says same thing. This is probably the description of the ultimate of all the false prophets. But guess what? His method is still the same. The way he works is still the same. He doesn't come and knock people over the head and say, I'm going to lead you straight to hell. I'm going to mess your mind up so bad you're not even going to know what's happening. he comes and he deceives. It is speaking of the Antichrist. It is at the end times the great man of sin. His method of dealing with the world and getting them to buy a lie, what? He comes to them with lying wonders and deceit, deception. Revelation chapter 12, verse 9. In a final description of Satan himself, he is called simply this, the deceiver of the whole world. Get this now, please, as we're kind of moving through this. The nature of deceit, the very nature of deceit, is that the one who is being deceived doesn't know they're being deceived. Get it? Okay? You got that? The very nature of deceit is that the one who is being deceived doesn't know that they're being deceived. I want you to note this and file it. If you're taking notes, you might want to jot some things down here. Please get this. People who have been deceived by a false teacher of some kind, people who have been deceived are not malicious people. People who have been deceived don't have a process in their mind that says this, what could I do to destroy the church of Christ? They don't say that. They don't say in their mind, aha, here's the right thing to do and here's the wrong thing to do. I am an evil person, I'm a deceived person, so I'm going to choose the wrong thing to do because I like to do the wrong thing. Deceived people don't say that. Deceived people don't come into the church and say, What could I do to hurt the cause of Christ? Don't say that. You know what deceived people say? Deceived people say this. What can I do to build the church? I want to do the right thing. What can I do to help the cause of Christ? But you know the problem with deceived people? They never do. They never do. Why is that? They've been deceived. That's why. That's why. Everything they do, they think they're doing it to build. Everybody's got good motives, beloved. Everybody's got good motives. I see that all the time in our church. Everybody, no matter what they say, no matter what they do, they've got good motives. They think they're right. They shoot off, they fire off. It's incredible. Everybody's got good motives. Nobody says, I want to destroy this church, so I'm going to go to... They think they're doing the right thing. They're not. Why? They've been deceived. The false prophets come. The false teachers come. Something's been planted in their mind. And what is real they don't see is real anymore. And somewhere, someone along the line has got to come and say, Wake up, you've been deceived. You're moving in the wrong direction. I don't care how sincere you are. The very nature of deception is that the one who has been deceived doesn't know they've been deceived. Could you be deceived? Could you be deceived? Nah. Galatians were. Galatians were. They bought into a lie. They came into a fellowship with Christ, and it was by grace, through faith. And the characteristic of their life when they first met him was that it was, met Christ, that it was free, and it was about liberty, and they were growing, and the fruit of the Spirit was evidencing itself, and they were full of joy. And then some Judaizers came along and said, Ah, there's something to add here. And it just tore them apart. And they began to be a church that was just striving and working, and measuring up, and all their joy was gone. And Paul came to them and said, You have left him. You've been deceived. You think the church in Galatia said, Aha! What can we do to walk away from the gospel? I think we'll get legalistic. They didn't say that. They thought they were doing a good thing. Deceived people don't know they're being deceived. Deceived people don't know that what they're doing is turning the straight path of the Lord and making it crooked. You know who else was deceived? Peter was deceived. You think we couldn't be deceived? I think we get deceived a lot. Again, I come back with teaching. and they had to be told. Let's look even a little bit deeper. Their method, the false teacher's method is what? It is deception. Their vehicle to carry out their deception is people. Okay? If you're trying to follow something through here, we've got false prophets being the problem. Their method of getting people is deception. Their method of, their vehicle for bringing that deception is people. What's more, the people they will use will be invariably religious people. They will be religious people. If he can use people, he will use them as much, they will be as much like you and me as possible. You think on that for a minute. You think, that just makes sense. That just makes sense. Put your place in the place of a deceiver for a minute, okay? You are the deceiver. What would be your plan? If you wanted to deceive our congregation, if you wanted to deceive the masses of Christianity, what would you do? How would you do it? Would you come with a sign and put it up in front like this and say, I have a lie right out of the pit of hell. Would you come and believe it with me? I'd be stupid. Deceivers don't do that. Deceivers don't operate that. If I was a deceiver and wanted to deceive you, I wouldn't confront you. I'd coddle you. I'd warm up to you. I'd try to win you. I'd try to look just like you. I'd get inside you. And then you know what I'd do? I'd twist you. And it would be just a little twist. You wouldn't even notice it. what I'd do is I would just take the straight path of the Lord and I would twist it didn't knock you off the path we're still talking about a path we're still talking about Jesus but I'd just twist it just a little bit who would notice? these people didn't beloved 2 Corinthians chapter 11 13 through 15 warns us all the time about stuff like this who are the false prophets? what are they going to look like? how are they going to come? how will we notice them? they're going to have fangs and they're going to spit venom no, they're going to come as apostles of Christ and they're going to come as ministers of righteousness. You're going to buy it. They're going to look good. Verse 14 of that same chapter, 2 Corinthians 11, verse 14. Paul says this, but that should be of no surprise. Don't act so shocked when I tell you that the ones who are very often the false teachers are the ones who are ministers of righteousness. Don't be so shocked because Satan himself comes as an angel of light. That's his style. Enter Galatians. Just gave you background. That's all I gave you. Enter Galatians. Gave you some teaching on false prophets. Gave you some teaching on what was going on here. These false prophets are accursed. Enter Galatians. What do we know so far? What we know is this. False teachers are at work in the church in Galatia. The work that they were doing had worked. They were deceived. they bought it they were getting into legalism the method of their of their delivery was deception and the vehicle they were using was people now we're in galatia what we want to ask now as we're wading into this and trying to make heads or tails of the situation is this what was the nature of the deception now because i've mentioned it already we know a little bit but let me give you some background in other words what we want to know now as we're wading into this thing is what specifically was the lie that these Galatians bought, okay? That Paul is just damning with his words. The lie that they bought. Let me do some background. I hope you enjoy this. I love this. I think this is so important. It's teaching. We're building a foundation. You know, behind my house, behind our house, when we first moved in, our whole backyard and stuff was just open. There was nothing there, no houses there. And slowly they've been building houses. And it's so fun to watch them. You know what they do? First they dig a hole and then they pour the footings and then the foundation. And it's a real long process. And when they first dig the hole, it doesn't look anything like a house at all, but they got to dig the hole. And then they pour the footings and it doesn't even look anything like a foundation. And then they build the foundation. Guess what we're doing? We're digging a hole this morning and we're laying a footing. We don't even have the foundation. It doesn't look anything like a house. Got to come with me. Hang with me here. Background. Background. Understand what's going on. This whole thing started. All the tension and And the beginning of this letter to the church in Galatia started way back in Acts chapter 13. Let's go, okay? Acts chapter 13. Here we are again. It's the first missionary journey. Paul and Barnabas had left Galatia and they were moving west. I mean, sorry, they had left Antioch and they were moving west to the province of Galatia. Now, Galatia is not a city. You just need to understand this. Galatia is an area of about 175 miles wide and 250 miles long. So I don't know, would that be a small state? Something like that, 175 miles wide, 250 miles long. Four major cities in that area. And what Paul and Barnabas did was that they moved through those four major cities, evangelizing those cities, and then establishing them in the faith. And then what they'd do after they would establish that church, they would move on to another city in Galatia. And what they would do, they would move all the way through to these four churches, and then they turned around and they moved back the other way, hitting each church as they went. Okay? Building them up, building them up, building them up. Strengthening them. Then the second missionary journey came, and Paul didn't go with Barnabas this time. He went with Silas. And you know what he did? They went right back to the province of Galatia and did the same thing. Hit every one of those churches again, trying to get them built up, trying to disciple them. went all the way through, turned around, came back, hit him again. Paul, the point is this. The point is this, that Paul had a tremendous investment in these churches, as is recorded in Acts chapter 13 and 14. He had almost lost his life. This was the account in here someplace where Paul had been stoned. They thought he was dead. They threw him out on the dump and left him there to die. But he was still alive and he went on to minister. But he had a tremendous investment in these churches in Galatia. So I guess it's no small wonder when he begins to hear that they're falling apart in terms of their doctrine and their living that he gets a little bit upset. What happens is this. Those churches have been established. They have been discipled. Acts chapter 15, sand gets thrown into the machinery. Something's going wrong. The problem is introduced. Let's look at it. You've got to picture this. Things are going great. The word of God is prevailing. People are growing. The churches are strong. And all of a sudden, this junk happens. And some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brethren, ah, yes, salvation by grace through faith. But listen, unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you can't be saved. Come on, give me a break. Then verse 6, verse 6. Something's going on. Something's icky here. Verse 6. I'm sorry, not verse 6. Verse 5. But certain ones of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up saying it is necessary to circumcise them. If they really want to be a Christian, they're going to have to be circumcised and to direct them to observe the law of Moses. Who are these guys? Who are these guys? Way back in Acts chapter 15. Who are bad guys? Fangs? Spitting venom? Were they malicious? Was their design to move into that church and I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to destroy that church and I'll tell you how. I'm going to add circumcision, some external sign and I'm going to make them live up to some law. That's what I'm going to do. I'm just going to wreck this church. no I don't believe that was their intention at all everybody's got good intentions I believe if they had any intention at all that they were going through in their mind it was that boy I'll tell you this is really standing up for the word boy this is really standing up for what matters we're going to protect the church we're going to make it better it's not going to be just salvation by grace through faith it's going to be salvation by grace through faith plus circumcision boy hell just honor God what was their message Jesus is cursed grace is a lie salvation is by works no no no no no Satan is too good for that Satan and his deception is too good for that we would pick that up he deceives so what does he say he says this Jesus is Lord Jesus lived he died he was buried he rose again from the dead and you can be saved and here is the plan of salvation it is by grace through faith plus plus plus what plus you name it you name it any good work you can do and you know what's incredible it sounds good at first oh yeah oh yeah boy if we're serious Christians we should really buy into that yeah say things like this sure sure you're saved by grace sure you're saved by grace through faith but you know real Christians do, you name it. The problem is what we don't realize and what they didn't realize when they add anything to the gospel, when they add anything to the gospel that is my effort, some external thing in adding anything of the flesh to earn your standing before God, what you do is you do not just add something on to what is there. If you add something on, you destroy what is there. And I want you to know something else. that I did not make that up. Acts chapter, Galatians chapter 2, verse 21. Paul says, if righteousness, beloved, comes through the law, if righteousness comes through your performance, some external thing that you can do, and I want to tell you what that means. It means that this has been negated. Christ died needlessly. Why? Why is that true? Because I'll tell you what, if you add any work, if you add any work, any kind of law to the end of your salvation that says, this is what I need to do as well. Your source of confidence in your salvation is no longer only in the blood of Christ. It is no longer your source of confidence as a believer is no longer in the grace of God. It will become, I guarantee it, even if you've gotten sucked into this kind of lifestyle, your source of confidence, I guarantee it, will begin, even if it doesn't at first, it will begin to be in that thing that you do. You have negated the blood of Christ. What they added specifically in Acts chapter 15 was circumcision and the Mosaic law. I want you to notice in verses 6 through 11 that they dealt with it right there. They nailed it right to the wall. 6 to 11, the apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter. And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among them, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he also did us. And he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by works. No, cleansing their hearts by faith, nothing else. Therefore, why do you put God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear. But we believe, statement of faith, statement of faith, but we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same way as they also are. Don't you dare add the law. Fine. The problem is solved. You close the book, it's never going to happen again. It's not true. See, the problem is this. It's one thing to make a decision at a council in Jerusalem, which they had. It was basically a council. It's referred to often as the council in Jerusalem. It's one thing to make a decision at a council like that. It's another thing to communicate that message to all the churches. And I want to tell you something. The message had spread and it came to Galatia. Here we are getting closer to our text. You can't wait, can we? When are we going to get to Galatians? By the time this message started in Acts chapter 15, this little addition to the gospel of Christ had gotten to Galatia, This legalism had even begun to spread. It got a little more juicy. It got a little more exciting. No longer was it just circumcision, some external thing. No longer was it just keeping the Mosaic Law. But they added a few other little juicy things. We're going to get to that in a minute. Picture the people. Here they come. You got it? What's a false prophet do? He comes spitting venom and has fangs. No, he doesn't. They're coming into the church in Galatia. Here they come. Maybe it's very possible that they were right out of this church in Jerusalem. They might have even been able to come to this church in Galatia and said, hey, we're not only from the church in Jerusalem, they sponsored us, they sent us. Ah, brother, brother, hug, hug, hug. Isn't it great that everybody has a good fellowship with other believers? Their purpose in coming to destroy the church, to defile the doctrine, absolutely not. In fact, their purpose was, again, good intentions, make it better, just add this requirement. And again, I would affirm that in their minds they were simply showing how serious and devout they were about their faith. Their message? Grace is folly. No, it wasn't. Of course they wouldn't say that. Deception doesn't work like that. They would say this. You've been saved by grace through faith plus what? For them, it was circumcision. The Mosaic Law, chapter 4, verse 10, they added this little juicy thing. They got them to observe days and months and seasons and years. Well, I tell you, if you're a real Christian, Yeah, okay, oh, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, we're saved by grace through faith. But if you're a real Christian, you're going to observe days and weeks and months and seasons. And no, honor these things, boy. And these people, these people who knew the Lord and were free and were serving Him and were giving out of liberty and love, all of a sudden got shackled by a law. Now they were trying to perform and keep it up. Oh, better observe the law. And the joy had been robbed. You know what Paul called that stuff? especially the part in chapter 4, verse 10, where they started observing days and months and seasons and years. Chapter 4, verse 9, he says this, Of those weak and worthless, why have you returned to the weak and beggarly things, like, oh, gee whiz, like observing days and months. Man alive, your joy has been stolen. Grace, saved by grace through faith, plus what? What about for us? For them it was circumcision. Some external act. Some external act that I do that affirms that I'm really a believer. What are we at? How have we been deceived? Think we have? Have you ever heard this? Oh yeah, saved by grace through faith. Plus, speaking in tongues. If you speak in tongues, then you're in. That's those guys though. That's not us. Good. Hit them, Dave. Get them, boy. Saved by grace through faith. plus going to church. Plus going to church. Plus joining the church. And the pressure just is on. Nobody even says it. They just put it on. And all of a sudden, before you even know it, there's a tension in the church that if I'm really a Christian, I'll do these external things. You know what? That if you really are a believer and if you really are born of the Spirit and the life of God in you is really there, you are going to have a tremendous control on your life. And the fruit of the Spirit is going to be there. and if you love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul and mind what is going to issue from your life is going to be holiness and sanctification we are not speaking of live it up and do whatever you want that's baloney Paul has to deal with that all the time we're going to deal with it in Galatians when he says what do you think we talk about freedom so you can do whatever you want never but I want to tell you something if you begin to add external controls to make people holy you have defiled the gospel it's got to be an internal control these people came with an external circumcision external go to church external people will go to church if they love the Lord they'll be there you don't give them a law when I was growing up it was cutting your hair I loved it I'm glad I just got my hair cut some of you are going how long was it cut around a year just like circumcision you know what's defiant circumcision never was to be a physical sign circumcision means to cut around and you know what it means to cut around it means to cut around your heart so that you feel like you never felt before and it means to cut around your eyes so you see truth like you never saw it before and it means to cut around your ears so you hear what you never saw before but we just make an external thing out of it we just cut it, cut it around I made it, baloney Jesus always drives it inward and external things just give me a false sense of security you know the other problem with external things that I do that affirm to me my faith is real you know why it's faulty? because anybody can do an external thing anybody the most pagan, defiled, disconnected person on the face of this earth in terms of their relationship with God can go cut their hair and look like what we think an evangelical looks like. It doesn't require a change in heart. That's the only thing that matters to God, a change in heart. What do we got here, folks? As we're wading through this teaching, what do we have? The tension. Why is there tension here that we introduced? Because there's false teaching. False teaching. What was the method of their false teaching? Deception. So that the people who were deceived didn't know they were being deceived. They thought they were being good Christians. The vehicle they used was people and the message that was the false teaching, the message was legalism. You're saved by grace through faith plus this or this or this or this. Just in wrapping it up, hit the text. Know what I want us to do? I want us to hear what Paul said about that. I just gave you the background. I gave you the whole backdrop. That's it. That's the situation. We're in the situation right up to our necks right now. We're in it. It's all mucky and it's all over us. I want you to hear now what Paul says about it. He gives us first, we see his wonder in verse 6, we see his wisdom in verse 7, and we see his warning in 7 and 8, or 8 and 9, and please don't panic because this is not going to take long. We're just wrapping it up right now. Okay, verse 6, his wonder, his wonder. He says this, I am amazed. Key word, I want to just jump on it, give you some teaching. It's the same word right here, his amazement, is the same word used to describe the amazement in the mind of the people who are going to see Christ when he returns. Okay? Same equivalent. I just cannot conceive of what I'm seeing. I am amazed. What's he amazed about? I am amazed that you have so quickly deserted. I even want to break down so quickly. You know what the word quickly means or it refers to? It could mean a couple things. I am amazed. I can't comprehend this thing that you have so quickly deserted. Quickly meaning quickly after I left. You know, I had this ministry with you. I had this influence on you. And you were thinking the right way. The teaching was clear. And you were coming along. And then I left. And as soon as I left, bam, you went the other way. That's possible. I think it means this, though. I don't think it means just when I left. It means this. You were going along. And you were living by grace. And you were living in freedom. And the Spirit of God was working His wonderful work of sanctification in you. Somebody came along with one word of legalism. Bam. you rolled over. I'm amazed at how quickly you rolled over. Why didn't you stand firm in your liberty? Chapter 5, verse 1. Oh, it gets deeper and deeper. You can hear his anger in this, folks, so quickly deserted. Every word, I've got to nail it for you. It means to defect. It means to revolt, to transfer allegiance. Do you think the Galatians thought they were doing that? Do you think they had a thing in their mind that said, Aha! I'm tired of salvation by grace. I'm tired of all that kind of thing. No. I'm going to go the other way. I don't think they did. They were deceived. They were deceived. Paul had to come along and say, I know you don't see you've done this, but you've done it. I need to tell you. What did they desert? What did they leave? What did they defect from? A doctrine? That would have been fine. A teaching? No, it wouldn't have been fine. I take that back. what they deserted was more serious than a doctrine or a teaching or a system of religion a quirk of lifestyle, did they desert that? no, they deserted him he is intense here I am amazed, can't believe it that you have so quickly rolled over and deserted, defected Christ oh come on Dave you know I can get it and I can see how adding works to our salvation or a legalistic kind of structure within evangelicalism might cloud the issue a little bit and might confuse people a little bit. But you're talking here, or Paul is talking here, about apostasy. Don't you think that's a little bit extreme? You know what? We have the idea. We have the idea that people who call themselves Christians who are wrapped up and bound up in legalism are just a little bit off. Paul says here they're cursed. Paul says here, when you walk away from grace and grace alone, you have walked away from Him. Strong stuff. Strong stuff. We might think, well, if it's just a little bit of legalism, a little bit of legalism never hurt. You know, my mom used to joke about this because we talk about this a lot in our family, about freedom in Christ and having the love of Christ be constraining us to sanctification and holiness. And I want to tell you, it works. But my mom always used to joke about the fact that it doesn't hurt to have a little bag of sand in the trunk. And what the bag of sand one was, a little bit of guilt. Kind of keeps you from sliding like this all over the place. A little bit of guilt never hurt anybody. A little bit of legalism never hurt anybody. I want to tell you something. A little bit of poison is a little bit of poison. Get a glass of water, fill it with water, add one drop of poison. Ah, it's just a little bit of poison. It's mostly water. I'm amazed. His wonder, I'm amazed that you have so quickly rolled over deserted him. Secondly, his wisdom. He wisely helps them sort through this thing and identify what the false teaching was. The false teaching was not just a perversion. The false teaching was not just a little bit of a, you know, it wasn't just a straight path made a little crooked, a little twisted. It was this. Verse 6, the end of it. For a different gospel. Verse 7. Which is really not another. oh boy is that confusing I don't even have the time to go through that in the Greek you know maybe we need to go through that some other time because I really want to explain that to you what I'm going to give you is the conclusion the time is just too short but there's two Greek words and both of those words are different what it means is this another a different gospel a gospel that comes to you and says you're saved by grace through faith plus it looks like the gospel it looks real good but they add all these things to it a different gospel beloved is not the gospel that's what it says a different gospel is not the gospel just because it looks like the gospel just because it's close I want to tell you something if you add one thing it's not the gospel anymore and again chapter 5 verse 2 if you add one thing it could be a good thing chapter 5 verse 2 if you add one thing it could be a good thing it could be circumcision it could be cutting your hair those things might be nice they might be fine do it if the Lord leads you to do it do it but if you had that as being something that gives you standing before god i want you to tell you something that christ's death is of no benefit for you verse four he goes further chapter five he says you have been severed from christ we see his wonder i'm amazed we see his wisdom the gospel that you're getting is not the gospel you've deserted him we see his warning in verse 8 and 9 verse 8 and 9 simply this but even though we are an angel from heaven I don't care how nice they are this is again alluding to what? the false teacher how does the false teacher come? fangs, spit and venom? no, it could be me it could be me if I come to you again having preached the gospel of grace and then I come back and my gospel is twisted I don't care how good he looks I don't care how nice he is I don't care how many times you've heard him I don't care what I don't care if he's an angel from heaven if they should preach to you a gospel that is contrary to that which we have preached to you grace and received by faith and that alone let him and he's saying to himself let me be accursed as well and that's a hypothetical thing if that should happen let him be accursed then it goes real practical this is happening in your church and as we have said before so say I to you now if any man is, present tense, is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you have received, let him be accursed. I don't care if he's an elder. I don't care if his name is Chester Erickson or Les Keel. I don't care if his name is Paul Stone, Jeff Van Vondren, John Ward, Al Franz, Dean Jacobs. I don't care if his name is Craig Hofer. I don't care if his name is Dave Johnson. I don't care if he's a former pastor. I don't care if he's a future pastor. If he comes and adds this stuff to the gospel, let him be accursed. by the way tremendous responsibility laid at the feet of the teachers aren't there according to this people can be deceived in fact Romans talks about the weaker brother who kind of moved off center and we need to love him in and encourage him into freedom but the teacher is responsible this has been a study and I hope your mind has been stimulated and this evening we're going to talk about what I want you to do with this study. What your responsibility as a believer with anything we deal with in the word of God, what your responsibility is to do with it. But I just want to close with the reading of this verse. Again, I want to enter you into this situation. What he has said has just blown the doors off that church because they were just wrapped up in all sorts of legalism, feeling real self-righteous about all the things they were doing. He says this in verse 10 to just back off and I just read it and close. For am I now seeking the favor of men or of God? or am I striving to please men? Beloved, I need to tell you something. If I were trying to please men, I could not be the bondservant of Christ. If I don't say what I have to say regarding this, I am no longer a slave of Christ. I'm a slave of you. And you pull my strings. And he's saying simply this, and I say it too. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. He who has ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. Let's pray. Lord I feel like this morning has been a war we have dealt with some issues that I think are vital and our minds have been stimulated my mind has been stimulated and I pray that as we continue to grapple with these issues that we would grapple with them not through the eyes of our experience or our background or any other issue but that we would pour ourselves into the Word of God so that your Word would begin to dictate to our minds that which is true. Jesus, I am aware, maybe more now than I ever have been, that false teachers come and they are not easy to spot. But Lord, the way that I believe we can affirm that which is true, between that which is true and that which is false, is by digging into your Word in depth. Give us discipline and give us patience in continuing that endeavor as a church and as individuals. We would seek the truth. We ask your blessing on all we've done this morning. In Jesus' name, amen. you
