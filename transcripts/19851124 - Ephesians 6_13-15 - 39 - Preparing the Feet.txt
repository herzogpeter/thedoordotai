Ephesians chapter 6, verse 10. Take up the full armor of God that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace, in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and take all of those things and put them on with prayer, praying at all times in the Spirit. I want you to do something with me this morning, and I want you to do something on my behalf this morning. And that is, as we back off the reading of this text and move into the preaching, that you not just listen to me pray, but pray with me and pray for me. One of the things I feel very strong about when I meet with the elders before the service is that there is a way in which I am not preaching alone. There is a way in which I am standing as Peter did with the eleven, and we are preaching together. I am just the mouth. And this morning, there is a way in which I am feeling the whole flavor of our service is such that we are sensing a battle, even as we are worshiping. And Satan has no dominion here. We are dealing with the Word of God, and I want you to join with me in preaching this text this morning. We are preparing ourselves for war and bring yourself to it as we pray. Father God, we thank you for your word. We thank you more for yourself that can illumine your word to us and prepare us for the things you've called us to. Father, I pray this morning as we break open your word for a sense of freedom that Satan in every dimension would be absolutely bound, having no influence on our minds and our hearts. Even now, may we put that breastplate on. Even now, may we gird ourselves. Even now, may we put the shoes of the gospel of peace on our feet before we even move into the text. Father, I pray for your divine energy and anointing this morning as we deal with your word in Jesus' name. Amen. We are still dealing, obviously, with a great text in the book of Ephesians that is delineating the warfare of the believer. What do we know so far? Several things. I think if I was to hand out some paper, I could probably give you a quiz. The first thing we know for sure is that if you are a believer, you are in a war. We have entered into a war. And I know again, as I've already mentioned, That some of us this morning, some of you this morning, are even sensing the tension of that warfare. You might be calling it a lot of different things. You might be blaming it on something else. But basically, there is a warfare going on and it affects the mind and the heart of the believer. Paul is confronting that right here and saying, Listen, friends, we wrestle not against flesh and blood. That would be wonderful if all it was was a nuclear bomb. Now, I'm not trying to minimize that. But the war that I wage on a daily basis is the war that's waging in my mind with the guilt, with the frustration, the tension I feel, how I'm going to live from Monday through Saturday. We are in a war. We have seen all the way through the epistles that Paul wrote that he's constantly referring to the Christian life as a war. Fight the fight of faith. Stand firm against the enemy. Maintain the standard of sound words. Over and over and over again. It's obvious that he considered his walk with God being one of warfare. We also know not only that we are in a war, but that we have an enemy, and he is a personal enemy. His name is Satan. His name is Diabolos Diabolical. He is a liar and the father of all lies. Okay, we have a war. We are in a war. We have an enemy. He is a personal enemy, and he is constantly moving against us. As soon as we think we've got it together, we have not got it together. He is moving against our church, and in fact, we have discovered that the more we begin to move, and the more we begin to believe God, the more we are going to sense and experience the opposition that is there. One of the truths that we have learned about in the book of Ephesians is a very theological truth, and I just trust it's engraved in your mind by now, and that is the difference between positional truth and practical truth. Remember, positional truth is that positionally before God I am holy and blameless, right? The problem is in my practice, I don't always experience that holiness and blamelessness. And the exhortation of the worthy walk is to get them together. I want to tell you something else. The same thing is true in the warfare. Positionally, you are in a war if you've received Christ as your Savior. The problem is that practically, and not only that are you in a war, but you have received the victory. There's nothing that Satan has on you, nothing. All of that was defeated at the cross. The problem is that even though we are in a war, and even though positionally that victory is ours, many of us as believers are not experiencing that victory on a day-to-day basis. I believe that because this warfare that we are speaking about is the experience of every growing Christian, there isn't a person here, unless you don't know the Lord, or unless you're just not growing at all as a believer, there isn't a believer who hasn't experienced some dimensions of this warfare. And because I believe with all my heart that that is true, I believe it is incumbent upon us to diligently study, know these weapons and how to use them. We know, for instance, right off the bat, that there are six pieces of armor that we are putting on. And these Sunday mornings, it's as if we are coming together in something like a spiritual boot camp. And every Sunday morning, we're taking another piece of equipment, We're looking at it, we're discussing its function, and then hopefully every one of us are putting that piece of equipment on as we move out of here to do the warfare. The first piece of armor that we've dealt with was found in the 14th verse. It says this, stand firm therefore. And the way you do that is first of all to gird yourself with truthfulness. We call the girding up of your loins the belt of readiness. To gird your loins is to be ready, be prepared, be alert. The lifestyle of a Christian is not that of a sleepy person. Romans 13, verse 11 and 12 says this, Know this, believer, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from your sleep. The night is already gone, the day is at hand. Let us therefore lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. It's time to go. The belt of readiness. Gird yourself, gird your loins with truthfulness. and that had to do with an unbridled commitment. Remember, I pull in all the loose ends of my life and commit myself fully to the task. Okay, that's done. We got everybody. We spent some three weeks on talking to people who we were afraid maybe weren't in the race, getting people to realize that they're in a warfare and we've got to be girded for it, be ready for it. We're there. Everybody's excited. Everybody's prepared. Everybody's girded the belt. The next thing we had to understand very graphically, and I need to repeat this, and I cannot emphasize this enough, that while putting on that belt of commitment, that putting on that absolute unbridled commitment to Christ, you've really put yourself into this thing, I can't emphasize enough that that is not enough to win the war. Over and over again, even last week, we talked about the fact, even jokingly, about how we go to camp and we go to retreat, and we get all committed and we get all emotional, we hear a wonderful sermon, and we just really respond, And believe me, it is I am not making fun of that as if that is not valuable. I believe it's valuable. It's necessary. The Word of God tells us it's necessary. Where we get deluded and where we run into trouble is believing that somehow, just because I'm all emotional, that that's going to win the war. I'll tell you what it's going to do. It's going to get you into the war. What the Word of God says here, put on the whole armor of God. I spoke of the fact two weeks ago that if we walk into warfare with nothing but a belt, you're really going to look pretty silly. You're just not prepared. So we need more. I believe absolutely, in fact, that it is irresponsible, that it is irresponsible for a church, for a pulpit, to work people up into some sort of emotional lather of wild-eyed commitment and then just leave them there as if that wild-eyed commitment is enough. It is important. It is necessary. But it is not enough. Step one, put on the belt. Got to have it. In fact, every other piece of armor that I'm going to put on is going to lock into that belt. It's necessary, but I'm not walking into warfare with that alone. You got that. Okay? We're moving on to step two. We covered this two weeks ago. The next thing I need to put on is the breastplate of righteousness. Verse 15. I'm sorry, verse 14b. Now, this is kind of fun to learn about the breastplate of righteousness and these other pieces because even as I begin to move into these other pieces of armor, Every one of them begin to graphically illustrate how that belt is totally inadequate. All I've got to do is begin to talk about the breastplate. What does the breastplate protect? Remember that? It protects these vital organs, all of these things, the heart, the bowels. And for the Jewish mind, it was where he thought. It was his mind, his thinking, and his feeling. And I want to tell you something. If Satan attacks us anywhere, if Satan attacks me anywhere, it's in that area of my feeling. Just that feeling of queasiness, that feeling like I've been rejected, that feeling like somehow I'm just not in touch and just feel like things aren't the way they should be and I just feel defeated and slow and the possibilities of winning the victory are so remote. So we put on the breastplate of righteousness. We call it the confidence giver. The confidence giver. When I'm protected here, I'm able to swing, and I'm able to do the warfare that I need to do without covering up. But we also noted, and I need to reaffirm this, that we need to be, as soldiers, as we are preparing together for this warfare, we need to be, every step of the way, aware of the ways that Satan is going to move in against us to keep us from moving any further in this warfare. The first line of attack is obvious. He wants to keep us ignorant and apathetic to the war itself. He wants to keep us distant. He doesn't want us to even put on the belt. Stay away. The second line of attack, after God has moved in my heart and I have seen that I've been too apathetic and I've been sitting on the sidelines and I'm ready to get in, the second line of attack he's going to use on you, sincere believer, is he's going to get you to wade into battle with nothing but the belt. But now we see that that's not enough. And so I put on the breastplate of righteousness. And this is another place dealt with it last week, that Satan is going to move against you, and that is this. he's going to get you to put on a breastplate of righteousness that's made of tinfoil. It's made of paper. And a breastplate of righteousness made of tinfoil or paper is simply a breastplate that is made of my own righteousness. My own worthy walk. And even though it looks shiny and it's wonderful and I have all these little emblems all over it and I'm really growing and all this kind of thing, the problem with my own righteousness being the thing that's going to protect me as a believer is simply this, that it's not flawless. There are cracks and we can guarantee you because those of you who have tried it and I can attest to you my testimony this morning is that having put on that breastplate of my own righteousness Satan finds the crack in me he exposes it to me and I end up defeated. The breastplate of righteousness that I need to put on is that breastplate of righteousness and even as I speak it brings a calm to my heart and that is this the breastplate of righteousness that Christ has imputed to me in salvation, he looks at David Johnson and says, you are holy and blameless before me. And putting it on is simply by faith saying, I believe you. I believe you. And I believe that so much of the turmoil that we go through is because we really don't live lives of faith. And you want to know something? That's what I mean by living by faith. Living by faith is simply in the midst of the warfare believing that what God said about you and what God said about me is true. I don't believe that. See, what I think is true about me is what I feel about me, and what I feel about me is that I'm really a pretty cruddy person. And if you really knew the way I really was, there's no way that God could like me, and I've already ruled that out. And so what I do for you is, again, we put on the show, and I try to get people here to like me, but the only thing that's going to protect my heart and my mind is by faith receiving the righteousness that Christ has imputed to me. I take it. I sit down in it. I rest in it. There is victory in it. 1 Corinthians 5.21 He who knew no sin became sin for us so that we would become the righteousness of God in Christ. Put it on. Put that on. Sit down in that. Bathe in it. Rub it all over yourself. You are the righteousness of God in Christ. Nobody said you could do it. Nobody said you could earn it. Ephesians 4, 1 again. Before the foundation of the world, he chose us to be holy and blameless before him. Believe it. By faith, receive it and put it on as that breastplate of righteousness. Again, we are reaffirming as I am taking you as if you were fresh recruits, ready to do battle, and I need to reaffirm to you again that we are discovering that the way the battle is won is not by my getting strong and I'll tell the devil, I'll show him. It is by faith, believing, putting on those pieces of equipment that protect me. Satan is beaten by believing. I want you to remember that. Over and over again, it's going to come up through this study. Satan is beaten by believing God. You are the righteousness of God in Christ. okay are you all ready we're there we put on the belt you're all committed and ready to go you put on the breastplate of righteousness and now you're resting in the righteousness that christ has imputed to you and it's protecting your heart and your mind you got the belt on i got good news it's not enough you got the breastplate on i got good news it's not enough it's not enough the whole armor of god verse 15 let's put on the next piece of equipment today. And having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Let's take that apart. The preparation, no, having shod your feet with the preparation. Stop on that word preparation. What does that basically mean? A lot of different commentaries are having all sorts of conjecture and really making it complicated. It really isn't very complicated at all, but it's necessary for us to slow down here a bit and do some teaching. I want you to understand very simply what this means. It simply means this. Believer, the next thing you want to do is make your feet ready, prepared. That's literally what the word means. Make your feet equipped. Prepare them. Make them ready. Prepare your feet for war. That's all it's saying. When we're saying shod your feet with the preparation, it's simply saying make your feet ready. Now, unless we get a clear picture of what Paul is dealing with here, it's going to be hard for us to transfer the importance of having my feet shod to the warfare. See, I'm afraid that today we don't even understand as much as those people then understood the importance of having the right kind of feet. You see, we live in a world right now that basically is completely carpeted. There's nice tile on the floors. The parking lot is paved. My house has got carpeting in it. And basically, these shoes, I don't need them. I could stand up here barefoot because it's basically cosmetic. They're all designed. They got little tassels on them, look real nice. Sometimes I shine them. Basically, cosmetic. It's a fashion item. Unless you do a lot of hiking or something like that, you're really not going to catch the thrust of the importance of having your feet shod. In those days, however, the way of life was that shoes were a very necessary piece of equipment. They didn't have the carpeting. They didn't have the paving. They were walking on stony ground. They were walking on ground that was full of thorns and thistles, and their feet would get pierced. If they walked out with something on their feet, without something on their feet, they were going to be in a lot of trouble. And if your feet are not protected, you're not going to be able to stand. You're not going to be able to walk. You're not going to be able to go anywhere. There are ways in which we can relate to this and get a clear picture of it. If you would look, for instance, at the sports world, The kinds of things you get involved in athletically. It's incredible. Have you ever, there's a place in these malls now called the Foot Locker. I mean, you can get anxiety trying to figure out what jogging shoe to wear. They have all sorts of shoes. There's no way. You don't walk anymore and walk into places and say, when I was a kid, I'd say, ask for gym shoes. What's a gym shoe? I don't even know. There's 10 million different kinds of shoes, and they all have a different function. You have tennis shoes. Tennis shoe used to be a gym shoe. Now it's a tennis shoe. They have football shoes, and you have golf shoes, and you have jogging shoes, and you have track shoes, and they're different too. So you have all these different kind of shoes, and even if you go into tennis shoes, there's all different kinds of tennis shoes. You have a tennis shoe for a grass court, a clay court, a concrete court, a rubberized court. For track, you have a cinder track shoe, and you have a rubberized shoe. For football, you have a shoe that's for a nice dry surface, and you have a shoe that's for a wet surface with longer spikes. And then you have a shoe for astroturf and all this kind of crazy stuff. the point is this that every shoe you put on has a purpose it has a definite function in mind and this is especially true in any kind of warfare that you're involved in paul had that in mind i want you to remember something and this is something we haven't mentioned completely i even believe that one of the reasons he's using this military kind of language is because this was a prison epistle He wrote this when he was in prison, and it is very possible that even as he's writing, he is chained to a Roman soldier, and he's looking at him, and he's looking at the breastplate, and he's looking at the feet, and he's looking at the helmet, and he's describing them and giving them spiritual kinds of connotations. When a Roman soldier went out for war, he didn't go out barefoot, and he didn't go out with any old kind of shoe either. He went out with something that was specifically designed to give him the ability to stand there when the warfare came. They needed shoes, specifically designed to help them. In those Roman wars, one of the things that the enemy would do, today we have landmines that keep you from moving anywhere, and they blow people away, and their legs get cut off, and they can't go anywhere. In those days, the enemy, just before the army would come, would plant razor-sharp spikes into the ground, and as the Roman soldiers would come along, it would pierce their feet. It's a little owie, you know, it would go through their foot, and you think, man alive, there's a big strong guy, big armor, ready to go, helmet there. If you can't walk, if you can't stand, you're going to get blown away. And that's exactly what would happen to the Roman soldiers. So they had these big, thick-soled boots that they would wear. Hobnail boots is what they were called. They would have a thick leather sole that would last for a long time in these long marches, and hobnail simply means that in the bottom of the shoe, they would have little pieces of metal sticking out of the shoe. And what that would do would basically give them traction. They'd be able to stand there, and when the enemy came and they were fighting hand to hand, they wouldn't be slipping and sliding all over the place. If it was just a flat surface, they'd slide, they'd fall, they'd never be able to climb a rock, they wouldn't be able to do anything. It gave them traction so they could what? Stand firm. You got that? Very important. Paul's saying basically this. When we get to the feet, he's saying, listen, believer who's involved in warfare, you put on the belt, that's wonderful. You could have the greatest commitment there is. You put on the breastplate of righteousness, that's wonderful. But I want to tell you something. If your feet are not shod with the preparation of the gospel, and I'm going to explain that in the middle, the gospel of peace, you're going to slip and slide all over the place, and you could have the greatest armor, and you're still going to get defeated. I want to take a little note here. We haven't explained something that I think is very important. Three times in this text, it talks about standing firm. It doesn't anywhere talk about going anywhere. The whole idea in terms of doing warfare with Satan is that I don't really think it's wise at all for us to be thinking about Satan and chasing after him and trying to figure out what he does in terms that I would kind of chase after him. You are called to follow after God, move toward him, Consider the things he would have you be doing. And if you're doing that, believe me, Satan's going to come. And when he does, you stand there. Standing is the thing we've been called to do. To stand firm, resisting against. It may seem like a little thing, but I want you to play with that and put that into the whole concept of this warfare. Okay. I understand the importance of having my feet shod properly so I can stand. what is it that I am supposed to put on my feet what is it that is going to protect me and give me the ability to stand there like this when Satan comes it says basically this the gospel of peace that is what is going to protect me and give me that ability to stand there okay next question what is that what is the gospel of peace before I tell you what it is again I need you to gird the loins of your mind up with me this morning because I need to teach you some things. First thing I need to tell you is what this is not. When I first came to this text and was just anticipating before I really studied it, I looked at this 15th verse and I thought, isn't that neat? Right in the middle of this warfare thing, I'm going to be able to talk about evangelism because having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace means obviously that you put on your shoes and you go marching for the gospel and share the gospel. That is not what it's talking about here. One of the reasons we get that idea is because of the fact, possibly, that in Romans 10, 15, it says this, how beautiful are the feet who bring the good news of the gospel. How beautiful are the feet. And we could put those two things together and figure that's probably what we're talking about here. It's about bringing the good news to people, and how beautiful are the feet who do that. It is important to preach the gospel. It is vital. It is even a dimension of the warfare that's going to come later. That is absolutely necessary, but that is not what is being spoken about here in Ephesians 6. Again, what is the point of what we're doing here? We're not going anywhere in the battle. We are told to stand firm. And these shoes that I'm being given are being given to the believer. They are being given to me. I'm not giving anything to anybody right now. You got that? I am first of all making sure that I am prepared. In a way, I am taking care of myself in terms of that personal battle that I am having with Satan, and God is giving to me a resource to handle it. It's the gospel of peace. It's for me. And I'm not giving it to anybody yet. I'm taking it for myself. I'm putting it on myself so that when the warfare comes, I can stand. just like the breastplate of righteousness i need to know what this is and i need to know how to put it on the gospel what is that everybody knows it is the good news right peace what is that it is peace so what we are talking about right now is what i put on my feet is the good news of peace i'm supposed to put those on that's what's supposed to help me stand firm and all god's people said huh what are you talking about i still don't have this clear let's dig in some more i want you to turn with me to romans chapter 5 and i trust that as we go through this this is just going to explode for you and you're going to see some new things you've never seen before in terms of how we need to put this on chapter 5 verse 6 through 10 it describes for us when we see the implications of this particular text. We have described for us here the basic picture of man. In verse 6, we are told that without God we are weak, we are ungodly. Verse 7, we are told that we are unrighteous. Without Christ we are unrighteous. Before we had life, verse 8, we were sinners. Verse 9, we were unjustified, unsaved, and objects of God's wrath. And then in verse 10, it sums the whole thing up when it says basically this. Without Christ, you were enemies with God. God was not on your side. Now flip it a little bit because, again, we're talking about positional truth here. This is a lot of teaching and you got to get it. Before you met Christ and you were reconciled to God through him, you were at enmity with God. Your ally was your father, the devil. Now that's a fact. That may not sound real nice. You might feel like you're a nice religious person. The fact is this, that if you don't know Christ as your Savior, Jesus said, you are either for me or against me. There's no middle ground. I don't care if you feel warm and gooey about me. If you haven't received me, you haven't been reconciled. You are therefore an enemy of mine. So that's the picture. The basic status of man is that he is at odds with God. He is my enemy. When I became a Christian, that whole thing flipped. And that is why on this Sunday morning when I'm speaking predominantly to what I think are believers, I am saying, listen, friend, you have a new enemy. It is no longer God. You've been reconciled to God. You have a new enemy, and you're now doing warfare with the one who used to be your father, and that is Satan. Understand that. Verse 10 sums that whole thing up, and it says this, For if while we were enemies, something happened, and God said, I want to make something available to these people so that there can be a reconciliation, so that we don't have to be enemies anymore. If while you were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his son, much more having been reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. The good news, okay? The good news of the gospel of peace, the good news is basically this, that there was a time when you were at war with God, but now in Christ you are at peace. Okay? Let me put it a different way. It means basically this, You are not at odds with God anymore if you're in Christ. He is not your enemy anymore. Very simply put, God is on your side. Real simple terminology. God's on my side. This morning, as I stand before you, a confidence giver for me is realizing that God is not working against me. He's working with me and for me on my behalf. Simple, basic truth. Not a believer here who doesn't know that. But you know something? There are believers here who haven't put that on, who aren't living like that's true. Romans 5.1 says, Therefore, if any man is in Christ, he has peace with God. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God. That is a ringing affirmation. No longer enemies with God. There has been a reconciliation. Peace with you. He's on your side. He's got nothing against you. And in order to stand firm against the movement of Satan in your life, you're going to have to put that on. You know what that means? This is real simple. What that means, basically this, is when Satan begins to move against you with lies about who you are, even this morning, lies about your worth, lies about your value, lies about your relationship with other people and your relationship with God this morning, he's moving against you. The last thing in the world you want to do is start getting strong and thinking, I can handle him, I can handle... what it means is when Satan begins to move against you, you don't stand in your firm resolve. You will slip and slide all over the place because your firm resolve isn't that firm. And you do not stand in your firm commitment because that's not that firm either. And you do not stand in your own righteousness because it's not that righteous. I don't care how far you've come. If you are putting that on your feet, you're going to slip and slide all over. No. I need something to put on my feet so I can stand there, something that's going to anchor me in the ground so that when he comes I don't get blown over backwards. My shoes are made of simply this. My shoes are made of this. God is on my side. God is on my side. He has made peace with me. He is not moving against me. And I need to rest in that. I need to stand in that fact. Know where we're at again? we're at that place where i mentioned just a few minutes ago that this whole warfare is won by believing you got that i need to reaffirm believers you need to reaffirm even this morning that fact that what's going to give me the ability to stand is the fact that god is at peace with me nothing can change that i can admit then the fact that i'm weak i can admit then the fact that i'm inconsistent I can admit then the fact that I can't win, but I know who's on my side, and now I can't lose. Romans 8. You can turn to that. A familiar text. We use it all the time. Anytime we're feeling a little bit low, we turn to Romans 8. And I believe that this particular text just underscores this whole concept with bold truth. And I want us to read it in a way that I hope will open this text up for you in ways you've never seen it before. It did for me. let's start in verse 31 what then shall we say to these things if God is for us peace the gospel of peace the good news of peace if God is for us who will oppose us who will oppose us and Paul said let your mind go a little bit who's going to move against you Satan for sure okay well then let's consider that he's talking about warfare here verse 32 he who did not spare his own son he's talking about God now, but delivered him up to us all, how will he not also with him freely give all things? Now he gives another question, okay? It's the same one as the other one. First he says, who's going to bring, what shall we say to these things of God's force who's against us? Now he says, who's going to bring a charge against God's elect? Who is God's elect? That's me. The next thing is this, it says, God is the one who justifies. You know, I never understood that. How does that fit? In the original language, the way this needs to be read is this. Now get it. Who is going to bring a charge against you, believer? God? Is God going to move against you and accuse you and beat you down? Come on. God is the one who justifies. Believer, God is on your side. God's moving with you. God is fighting that battle on your behalf. You need to know who's on your side. He's talking about the preparation of the gospel of peace right there. Move on. And who is the one who condemns? Satan will do that. Rhetorical question. But would Christ do that? Is Christ the one who is going to move against you? Come on, listen. Christ Jesus is he who died. He's not going to be moving against you. Yes, rather, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us. He's basically saying this. Believer, he is on your side. Having been justified by faith, you have peace with him. He's not condemning you. He's not moving against you. Put that on your feet and stand up. Obviously, friend, I need to back off. When you get into theology like this, you need to make sure you're safe because there is conviction of the Spirit when sin is in my life. But I'm telling you something. If my heart is anything like yours, the bombardment of Satan often comes when there is no sin there and it's just those nagging doubts and those feelings of unsettledness. Put on the feet. Put on your feet the gospel of peace. It is not God who's condemning you. It is not Christ who's condemning you. That is Satan recognizing and put on your feet the fact that God's at peace with you. Satan is beaten by believing. I feel like saying that on and on and on. Believe it. You don't beat Satan by trying harder. You don't beat Satan by working more and coming more often. You're just going to get beat up. But here it says as we go on, What can separate us from the love of Christ? Nothing shall peril of sort, nakedness, famine, anything? No. Verse 37, but in all these things, but in all these things, anything could come against me. Death, nuclear holocaust, anything could come against me. But if I put on these feet, I'm going to stand here firm. And it says, now I overwhelmingly conquer. You're talking about victorious Christian living. How is it done? Being strong? No. It's done by believing God. No matter what I feel, no matter what I see, God's at peace with me. It's not him moving against me. It's the enemy, and I'm going to stand here. I win when I say, yes, he is on my side, and I put on those shoes, and I stand up and move them. Just in closing, I'll give you some examples like that. It helps me to see people who've done that. Peter and John. It was after Pentecost. And it was after the realization of all that Christ had done became real to them. And they were standing in the Sanhedrin, and they had begun to turn Jerusalem upside down with their doctrine. And they were brought before the same people who put Jesus to death. And so literally, they were looking death right in the face. And they had been instructed by these authorities, you need to stop saying what you're saying. You're going to have to stop preaching this garbage about a Jesus who we saw die, having been risen from the dead. We want you to stop that. Peter and John said simply this. You can say what you will. We respect your authority. We are here, and you can do anything you want to us, you want to do. But let me tell you this. We are not serving man. We are serving God, and you can't stop us from sharing what we're sharing. How were they able to do that in the face of death? Because they were strong, and they were determined, and they had a firm commitment, way more than mine. No. No. They were able to look at the enemy, and they were able to look at death, and they were able to look at those people who were moving against them, and somewhere on their feet, they had wrapped around them the fact that they were against them, but God was on their side, and they would not be moved. Paul boldly preached Christ, and he preached Christ until it did cost him his life. How? Because he was so strong, because he was so intelligent, because he was so committed. No. Because he put on his shoes. Because he put on his shoes. He really believed, he really believed that if God is for me, who can be against me? And I'm going to stand in that. And I'm going to put him on and I'm going to stand there, believing God. you know that's why we call it the fight of faith paul says fight the fight of faith he doesn't say fight the fight of real hard commitment he doesn't say fight the fight of working real hard he says fight the fight of believing god because believer that's where satan's going to move against you that's where he moves against me he's throwing lies at me and he's saying those things aren't true the big deal of God's for you. So what? And to fight the fight of faith is fighting to believe. Fighting to believe. If you're going to put your energy, if you feel like you have to do something, do that. Do that. Believe. Harder. All you're trying and your self-righteousness is just going to get you blasted. David and Goliath. We're studying David in the evening and I even bring this up because now I can skip it in the evening. David and Goliath. when he went to war with him how was he able to do that because he was so tough david was a pipsquee and yet in first samuel 17 verse 45 david said to goliath this listen goliath you come to me with sword and spear and javelin and i see it and they're big and they're powerful and i understand that those things are moving against me and i recognize that i'm not stupid but i come to you with a slingshot. Oh, well, how do I, stupid? I come to you with, you know, he looked at himself, he said, I got big biceps, and I compare him to him. No, he never did that. If he would have done that, he would have run away just like everybody else. He did something that no one else in that whole camp was doing. He looked at the enemy, and he saw the arsenal just like everyone else, and he saw the potential for destruction, but he saw something else. He saw God, and when he looked at the enemy and looked at himself, he got afraid, but when he looked at the enemy and he looked at God, he says, you don't have a chance. he says i come to you in the name of the lord of hosts and he is on my side you're dead you know what he had he had on his shoes he looked at the weapons and he saw their potential but he saw more he saw god and he will be him and then he moved out by faith that's it having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace god's at peace with you he's on your side some of you this morning need to put on your shoes some of you this morning are committed you've given yourself to it you've put on the breastplate of righteousness you understand that it's maybe a battle to keep it on and keep believing that but you're still slipping and sliding all over the place you need to add something to that and that is this god is at peace with you when those movements in your soul begin to move against you you need to know that god is not the one who condemns you god is not the one who's accusing you that is satan's function he is the accuser he is the one who stands in the way and there's only i don't have any cute answers for you this morning he's beaten by believing believe in god Thank you.
