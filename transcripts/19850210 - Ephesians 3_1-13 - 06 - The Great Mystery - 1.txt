Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, the third chapter. We're making progress, the first verse. We're a continuing study in the book of Ephesians, and as you do, I'm going to pray. Let's read the text first, okay? Ephesians 3, verse 1. For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus, for the sake of you Gentiles, If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace, which was given to me for you, that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. And by referring to this, when you read, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit, to be specific that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. Let's stop there and pray. Lord Jesus, I ask very simply that you would absolutely control this time as we break open your word and teach, open our hearts, and quicken our minds in Jesus' name. Amen. In the 20th chapter of the book of the Acts, Paul is leaving his three-year ministry at the church in Ephesus. And he's doing it with a very heavy heart, and he's dealing with the elders that day, and he's saying goodbye to them, and he's leaving them a charge. And it was simply this, dear elders, take care of the church, which Jesus Christ has purchased with his own precious blood. The apostle Paul was a man who had a deep, burning love for the church of Jesus Christ. And I believe that one of the things that made Paul great was that he loved the church. He prayed for it. He wept for it. He wept over it. He got angry with it and rebuked it. He nourished it and exhorted it and encouraged it through his letters. And at times his love became a protective kind of love, and he used aggressive and firm kinds of language. I remember to the letter to the church in Philippi, he said this in the fourth chapter, Beware, friends, of the dogs. Beware of the dogs. And I want to tell you something. That term in the Greek, a dog to them wasn't a cute little beagle. It was something that wasn't permitted into the home, And Paul was coming about as close to swearing as he possibly could without and still being the alliance, you know. He was really coming close. Beware the dogs that would come and mutilate the gospel and tear apart the flock. And again, to these same elders in the 20th chapter of Acts, he says, Beware when I leave that savage wolves might come in. And they might be wearing sheep's clothing. They might look like Christians. But their purpose in your church is to tear it apart. Beware of that. Paul loved the church, and so he protected it, and he fought for it. He also went to great lengths to teach about the church. He taught the theology of the church, to teach what the church is, to teach how it is to function. And that's why the book of Ephesians gives us the theology of the church. And that's what we've been discussing and we're moving into right now. One of Paul's principles that we've been introduced to very early in our study in the book of Ephesians is simply this. Paul says, before I exhort you people as to how I want you to live, the first thing I need to do is tell you who you are. I need to describe to you some things you need to know. We do not subscribe to the mentality that says every Sunday morning we're supposed to have kind of a cheerleading service. It's a halftime pep talk where everybody gets kind of jacked up. What we need to do first is teach. What we need to do first is understand. And when we understand, then we exhort the people of God to do the things that are in accordance with who we are. In chapter 3, we are going to begin to see a burning, almost an impatient desire on the part of the Apostle Paul for believers to know and to understand what it means to be part of the body of Christ. Let's look, verse 1. For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus, for the sake of you Gentiles, And I think in most of your Bibles, there's a dash there. There's a very good reason for the dash there because simply this, the verb is missing. It goes in verse 2 to a totally different thought. What Paul is beginning to do here in the first verse is he's beginning to pray for them. But where's the prayer? You see, in verse 2, he starts something totally different. We are going to have to go all the way over to verse 14 to find the prayer that the Apostle Paul starts in verse 1. Now, I want to just kind of get your mind going here as we get into verse 1. For this reason. For what reason? What Paul is doing here is he's referring back to everything he's explained to us in chapter 2. The plan of salvation, that you went from death unto life. That one time you were far off and alienated from God, but because of salvation you've been what? You've been brought near. There was a time in your life that you were at war, but what happened? He came preaching peace. Verse 19. So then, you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and are of God's household. That's who you are. Therefore, I want to pray for you again that you'll understand what I just told you. Remember when he did the same thing in chapter 1? After he told us the magnificent plan of God, he backed off and prayed that they would understand. He's doing the same thing here. Verse 14, we see the prayer for this reason. Verse 14 starts out again. I bow my knees before the Father. He's finally started to pray. from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, that he would grant to you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and grounded in love, here's his real prayer, that you may be able to what? Comprehend, again, understand with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. He's praying for them. But something strange does happen in verse 2, doesn't he? He starts and then he stops. And as I was reading this earlier in the week, I kind of thought, Paul, you're really a ding-a-ling. He's really hard to follow in the Greek. It's unbelievable because he just kind of leaves you hanging there and his mind snaps away. But what happened was simply this. He began to pray and then he started, wait a minute, wait a minute, I can't go on and pray because there's something that they need to understand first. They need to understand verse 2. He backs off and he says this. I'm not going to pray unless I know that you know this. If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace, which was given to me for you, that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery. Made known to me the mystery. Paul was a vessel, a man chosen by God, to reveal the mystery of the church. And that mystery is simply that. In a general sense, it refers to the church. The mystery is the church, the church age. And it is a mystery in the sense that it is something that up until this point had never been revealed before. The Old Testament fathers looked for it. They anticipated it. They kind of had ideas about it because prophecy spoke of some sort of thing like that, but they had never seen it. So it's a mystery in the sense that it was something that was to come but never came, and now it is being revealed. And Paul is the revealer of this mystery. It's also a mystery in the sense that the body of Christ, the church that he's talking about here in chapter 3 is unique. It's different than anything else. The family of God, the people of God, throughout all the ages in the Old Testament are referred to many different kinds of things. Many different metaphors referred to. The people of God, they're called a flock. They're called a family. They're called a bride. They're called a kingdom, a building. But here they're beginning to call them a body. It's a whole new concept. The body of Christ. Said a little bit more distinctly, the church is Christ's body in the world. Christ's body in the world. This body, the church, is to be the expression of Christ in the world. We discussed as we began Ephesians this whole idea that 2,000 years ago God became a man, his name was Jesus, and through that man, Jesus, God expressed himself to the world. And the way God works with men now is that God expresses himself to the world through his church. Again, his body. The body of Christ. Body, too, is what we've called it. Then he goes on in verse 4 and 5 and says, and by referring to this, when you read, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, this new thing that has come upon us, this body of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to who? To the holy apostles, men chosen by God, like Paul, And to the prophets in the Spirit, verse 6, to be specific. Or we could say it this way. But the real mystery is this, verse 6, that all believers, Jew and Gentile, bond and free, man and woman, Greek and barbarian, are one flesh. Jesus prayed for this unity, that this unity would be found in the body of Christ, John 17, 21. He says, Father, my prayer is that they would be one, just as I am one, that you and I are one. God planned for that unity, and now Paul is preaching about that unity. And we need to grasp the truth as we begin here of verse 6. But I want to ask you a question. Does it bug you at all that he's going over something he already went over? We covered this in chapter 2, didn't we? He went over this whole thing about you who are far off have been brought near. You Gentiles and you Jews who are alienated and cut off, and you've been brought near and you're one in Christ. And now in chapter 3, he's going over the exact same thing again. Does he think they're stupid or what? I don't think that at all. I think one of the things we're catching in this third chapter of Ephesians, and I want you to catch it with all your heart, is we are catching a feel for the heart of the Apostle Paul, how he loved the church, and how he wanted the people who were in the church to understand a relationship with other believers within the body, that you and I are one. This unity, and I want you to listen now, because this is very important. This unity, this, as it says in verse 6, this being fellow members of the body is not like being fellow members of a club together. We are all members of this church, and every one of us signed a little document that made us members of the church, okay? And you're a member, and I'm a member, and I may not like you, and you may not like me, but we're all kind of members of the church. That is not the concept that's being spoken of here at all. We're not members of a little club together. When God designed this unity, this one body concept, He did not design this unity to be thought of as a truce between you and me. It's not a peace treaty that we're signing together. It's not just you and I getting together and forming an alliance, a peace treaty, a friendly agreement. It isn't a matter of you and I looking each other in the eye and saying, okay, let's shake hands and just kind of put the war to end and we'll kind of just get along somehow. That isn't at all what he's talking about when he's talking about the body of Christ being parts and members together. What God designed to happen between you and me in the body was a fusion. That you and I would be one. That's the body. That's the body of Christ. You and I one. I cannot live my life separate from you. There are different parts. There are different functions. There is one flesh, and that's the mystery. That's the mystery of the church. And that's what he's revealing right here. Chapter 4.4 tells us there is one spirit. There is one hope. There is one Lord. There is one faith. There is one baptism. There is one God and Father. And he began that whole series of one things with this. There is one body. You and I are one. And the implications of that are the things that I think need to be grasped with all our hearts. The implications are simply this. That we can talk about evangelism all we want. And we can talk about reaching a lost and dying world until we're blue in the face. But I want to say this as firmly as I can. If in the body of Christ there is discord and bitterness and strife, at that point of discord, bitterness, and strife, at that point, the body is disconnected, it is separated, and it is maimed. And therefore, the church, as it is being observed by the world, while the world is supposed to be seeing Christ in the world, through the church, what the world sees is Christ, a cripple. he's maimed he's separated he's disconnected he has no effect and he's very very easy to ignore i can ignore that there's no power there there's no there's no glory there we are his body the manifestation of christ in the world and it comes through this unity but dave wait a minute you're really you're really coming down hard here fine you're really coming down hard here, but we're people. We're people, and we are going to have disagreements, and we're going to have things that come between us, and there's going to be sin in my life, and it's going to cause a separation between you and me, and those things are going to come along, and I mean, you know, I'm not going to get all upset, and gee whiz, it's going to happen. What do we do about that? We're going to have problems, and sometimes discord's going to be there, and there's going to be tension. That's true. That's absolutely true, and that is why, dear believers, all through the New Testament, we have exhortations to the church. And what are those exhortations? They're this. Stripe is going to come between you. There are going to be tensions between you. Sin will come in and there needs to be problems. There are going to be problems that way. And that's why the church, this great mystery, more than any other place in the whole world, the thing you should see in a church is people leaning to love, be given to forgiving, forbearing with each other. Don't you dare let that root of bitterness find its way into your life. Strife will come, but you deal with it. Colossians, I want you to turn to it. Colossians 3, verse 12. Colossians 3, verse 12. Again, this exhortation to the church, it's almost like saying there are going to be times when there's disunity. There are going to be times when there's strife between believers. But here's the exhortation. So you who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, listen to me, okay? Put on a heart of compassion. Put that junk away. Kindness, humility, gentleness. I slow down. Even as I read that, something affects me. Put this on. Gentleness, patience. Hey, bear with one another, okay? Bear with one another. Forgive each other. Unity. Whoever has a complaint against anyone, just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you. I didn't say that. It said it there. And beyond all these things, friends, put on love, which is the perfect bond of what? Unity. Unity. You and I are one. And I can't live my life separate from you without destroying the body. Ephesians 4, 3. We're going to be getting to it in a couple of weeks. It says this, be diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. It means simply this, do everything you can. In other words, even this, whatever it takes to preserve the unity in the body, do it. Whatever it takes to preserve unity in the body, do it. Let me also say this, and let me say it clearly, that this unity between believers is so essential to the life of the church that if there were some among us who were refusing to forgive, refusing to be forbearing, consistently spreading seeds of discontent, if it was tearing at the body, what would we do? Nothing, right? No, you remove that. You deal with that. And I believe that we're accountable to God if we don't. I remember my dad's church. I wasn't there at the time, but I heard about it and I had close contact with my father. You came to me for advice all the time. They had a real problem of strife in the church, and it was with a woman who had been in that church for years and years. And here was a woman who knew the Word as well as anyone knew the Word. She knew the Word of God, and she could give answers tremendously. A good teacher. But there had risen in her heart a seed of bitterness and strife and anger. And I want to tell you what she was doing in the church was very evident. She was ripping the church apart. And one of the hardest things that that church ever went through was the process of removing the leaven. And they did, and they grew. But it had to happen. You know what happens in most churches? The people who are bitter and full of strife and ripping at the body, you know what? Usually they run the church. My former church, Melrose Park Bible Church, just went through a real hard time. With a man who was contentious and had a bitter spirit, angry, and it had nothing to do with their opinions. There were differences of opinions, but we talked about this a couple weeks ago, that there are going to be differences in opinion all the time. And I can live with that. The problem is when bitterness and strife and anger get in there, and that person was a board member and they removed him from the board. And when they removed him from the board, he left the church. And you know what I say? I say, that's fine. That's fine and that church is going to grow. Because unity within the body is essential and we protect it. Why such drastic measures? Because I believe with all my heart And I think this is a message from the Apostle Paul that our ability to be the church, Christ in the world, is wrapped up in our unity. You and me fused together one. And so we protect it. And we do everything we can to preserve it. The church of Christ. Boy, I want you to be turned on to what the church is. How precious it is, how powerful it is, what we are the church. I think that by now you've caught the idea that I am not talking about a building. You know, even as that comes out of my mouth, it sounds cheap, doesn't it? The church, a building, yuck. It is not a denomination. We are talking about the body of believers that have been bought by the blood of Christ. And I think you've also caught that in the mind of God, the church is precious, and it is special, and it is unique. And that is why all through the New Testament, we have extensive teaching on the church, what the church is, the theology of the church. And that is also why that in the next three to five weeks, I haven't decided whether it's going to be three or five, we from this pulpit are going to have some extensive teaching on the church, what it is and how it's supposed to be functioning, and how we should be structured, and what our biblical priorities as a church are, and what the function and the responsibilities of the leadership are, our elders and deacons and all that kind of thing, and what the responsibilities and functions of the lay people are. It's extremely important. It's going to last about three weeks. But this morning, I want to leave you with just a couple of things very quickly. And again, this message this morning, there's going to be some very clear direction that we're going to be needing to take in terms of our response to what we're going to have this morning. But I want to also indicate that this is much an introduction to our whole series on the teaching of the church, what the church is to be and how we're supposed to function. The first thing I want to impress on your minds this morning is simply this, the importance of the church in the mind of God. The importance of the church in the mind of God. Just flip over a page to Ephesians chapter 5, verse 25. Ephesians chapter 5, verse 25. Husbands, love your wives just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, he's talking about the church here, having cleansed her by the washing of the water with the word, that he might present to himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and blameless. Verse 29, For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church. What do we see there? Christ's attitude towards the church. He loves the church. He gave himself for the church. He wants to perfect the church. He wants to wash the church with the word. He wants to present that church, us, blameless before the Father. He wants to nourish it and cherish it. He's having a love affair with the church, isn't he? These are the deepest emotions of God toward us, the church. Matthew 16, 18 is the very first place in the Word of God where Jesus speaks about the church. It was something that was to come. And he said this about the church. We get something of his attitude right here. Matthew 16, 18. I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. I will build it. He is the builder. Please, I want you to note something here as I indicate this, a bit of teaching, but it's very important that this be applied right now. He is the builder. The note is simply this, that the church is not built by a denomination. It is not built by a lot of money. It is not built by methods. It is not built by great individuals leading the church. It is not built by programs and committees. I like what Chuck Swindoll says about committees. He says a giraffe is really a horse that was made by a committee. I like that. The church is built by him. It's his church. The church is also built on him. Paul put it this way, other foundations can no man lay than that has been laid, which is Christ Jesus. The church is his. He bought it with his own blood. And then he built it by himself, on himself, for himself. It's his and thus it is sacred. And thus it is precious and thus it is unique. The church is important. And we are his body. Christ in the world. That's us. And that's why our goal as believers is Ephesians 4.13, as a result, no longer children tossed here and there by waves of doctrine and carried about by every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men. I'm sorry, verse 13. 14's good too. Verse 13, until we attain, that's our goal, until we attain the what? Unity of faith, the knowledge of the Son of God to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. Our goal as a church is that through us, Christ would be able to stand up before the world in full functioning form. Christ in the world through us. I want us to see the importance of the church, but also I want you to see the history of the church. Here's where the teaching begins, and here is where we begin to discover the function of the church. And these are some things we're going to be bringing up that I think are going to be a little bit stinging. They're things that we as a church need to evaluate and look over and consider. Are we moving in these directions? Are these the things we're emphasizing? And many of these exhortations that are going to be coming in the next few minutes are not so much geared to us as a church, but as individuals. These are individual matters. You know the condition of your heart concerning these things. Let me begin by saying this, that I do not believe that we are called to be this first century church. We are not to do the things that they did all the way down the line. We have been called by God to be the 20th century church. And therefore, there are new methods. There are new ways to communicate the message. There are new ministries. There are new problems. But I also believe this, that on a spiritual level, absolutely, that the things that the church was in the first century are the same things that we are to be today. Let's look. It all happened on the day of Pentecost in a prayer meeting in an upper room in Jerusalem. And on that day of Pentecost, the church was born. And not only the visible church was born, but the invisible church. The invisible and the visible. There's a distinction, and I want to make the difference. The invisible church is simply the church to which every believer belongs. Anyone who has responded in his heart to Christ is part of the invisible church. Let me say this. There are many people. We could have everyone here in our church be part of the visible church. Our visible church is church of the open door. It doesn't necessarily mean that every one of us are members of the invisible church. It doesn't necessarily mean that every one of us have responded in our hearts to the Lord Jesus Christ. But on that day, the visible and invisible were there simultaneously. Everyone who was in that first church of Jerusalem was a believer. And it was a magnificent thing. The Spirit came and filled all who believed, and the body was formed then and there. Thrilling church. Exciting things happened. You just imagine for a minute a church that's just full of new Christians. Every one of them had just been baptized in the Holy Spirit, and they were excited. Every one of them filled with the Spirit. Every one of them ministering. Every one of them demonstrating to the world the unity of the Spirit and the love of Christ. And that world saw it. They also heard it. 3,000 converts the first day. But something interesting happened in that church where 3,000 were born in one day. It was simply this. That Acts chapter 2, verses 9 through 11 indicates very clearly to us that on that day there were people from all sorts of different cities. They were from all over the place, and I believe just by a miracle of God, they were all there at one time speaking all these different languages, and the gift of tongues was given, and the gospel was communicated miraculously to all these different people. And what happened was these crazy people who had just received Christ went everywhere telling everyone that Jesus is the Christ, and you know what happened? incredible impact they filled jerusalem with their doctrine and everywhere they want they spread the news and churches were built i want us to back off for a minute as i just look at that history of what happened i want us to back off and consider something i want you to notice for a moment and consider the source of their excitement the message behind the movement i want us to consider that that's extremely important and again it needs to be brought down to where am i what am i excited about? What is the message behind the things I'm really moving toward? The book of Acts, again, as I already said, says this. These people went everywhere telling everyone what? What'd they tell them? We got a new building. Oh, I'm so excited. We got a new building. They went everywhere telling everyone. We got a new program. It's really neat. It's a whole new curriculum. It's wonderful. It's It's just the neatest thing. I'm so excited. They went everywhere telling everyone they got a new pastor, that they got a new program, that they got great music. No, no. They went everywhere telling everyone that this Jesus who was crucified, he has risen, and he's made me a new creature. And that was their source of joy, and that was the message that was ringing off their lips, and they went everywhere, and they told everyone. This church was amazing They didn't have a program They didn't have time to have a program They didn't have a building They didn't have time to have a building They did eventually There was no sacred form They were just excited about Jesus How naive to think that that's all you need Come on, we all know Within the context of that thrilling excitement having been made new creatures understanding who they were in Christ I think again that same fire can be built under every one of us as we know who we are in Christ that we've been bought with a price that you can stand by his grace before him blameless, whole, a new person they went everywhere telling everyone about how the church has changed today today the church is a business isn't it? not necessarily our church but why back off that? Where it applies, let's apply it. So I'm not going to say that anymore. Too often the church is a business, a massive organization with denominations and commissions and councils and world councils and national councils. And there's nothing wrong with a lot of those things except for this, that very often within the context of the councils and the denominations and the structure and all the wonderful things that are taking place, the result is too often this, that it can't possibly function like a family because it's a factory. There's no way in the world it can function like a body because it's really a business. How in the world can the church function as a community? It's a corporation. I believe the church is in grave danger of losing sight of its real priority. And church at the open door, while everyone else is going another way, we better not lose sight of our priority. I believe in many ways the church has become a success game. And I'm not talking about some religion or some slant on Christianity that's so much different than us. I'm speaking of the evangelical camp. Okay, it's us. I believe it's become a success game in many ways And the prize goes to the one with the biggest building The nicest bus and the fattest budget Bruce Larson said in a book that he wrote The Edge of Adventure Almost quote, almost without exception Successful churches and pastorates Are measured by their giving records By their building size And by their rate of attendance The obvious implication is this That a swelling budget and the increased attendance Are the real goals of the local church Well so what's so bad about that? we're going to get to that in a minute another question we might be asking right there is this or another statement we might be making right there is this we would never do that it's obvious our goal would never be just to to you know pump up the attendance that's not our goal we want that to happen but that's not our goal a way that bruce larson kind of points out to us the fact that very often that is our goal we don't say it we would never say it we know that's not the right thing to say. But very often it is our goal by saying this. Consider for a moment, if you will, the kinds of things that cause panic in the church. Just be honest. The kind of things that cause panic in the church. Weak and insipid teaching, while it might irritate a few people, the only time weak and insipid teaching would bother anybody is if the weak and insipid teaching affected attendance. Then it would bother people. Not in touch with the needs of the people, Bitterness and strife, not really having any kind of ministry in the community at all, those things might concern us, but causing a panic? I don't know about that. But you let the line in the graph that measures the money fall down, and you can watch the fur fly. What causes panic in the church? I think what causes panic in the church can indicate to us what our priorities are. But Dave, just wait a minute now. What's so bad about growing numbers? What's so bad about a healthy budget? Absolutely nothing. absolutely nothing nothing in fact i i it's just a thrill for us to watch as our church begins to grow and people are coming and when they come they stay and it's just a it just gladdens my heart to see some of the older folks who who've been here through the ups and the downs and now we're going up and people are coming and you're acting like little kids it's great you're coming there it's so fun oh we're so excited the lord's where he is it's great it is it's exciting and get excited about it and let's just rejoice in the lord together and our finances are doing well it's neat There's nothing wrong with that. The problem is, is if in any way, shape, or form, even subtly, those things become the goals. Because if those things become the goals, I guarantee two things are going to happen. The first thing that will happen is, one, we might have a big church. And so what? Big deal. The second thing that happens is this. I guarantee that if our goal becomes just getting people here and having a fat budget, if those are the things we're constantly focusing on, I guarantee that somewhere along the line we'll compromise the message. Guarantee it. You know why? Because if those things are our goals, to keep them coming and to keep them giving, somewhere along the line, I've got to alter the message so that I don't lose anybody. I wouldn't want to step on anybody's toes. I wouldn't want to tell the truth because if our goal is to keep them, then I can't say anything that would be controversial or rough or hard to handle or anything like that. the truth gets compromised when those things are our goals i know of a pastor right now this moment who refuses to speak on the problem of adultery you know why because the goal of his church is to keep him coming and to keep the budget fat and the reason he won't preach on adultery is because one of the greatest contributors of the church and a member of his own board is involved in blatant adultery. Listen, if at any time we fail to do what we know we have to do, we have compromised. Our goal as the church of Christ is to speak the truth in love and let the chips fall where they may. Jesus was talking to 5,000 people one day, and I shared this illustration with you once before from a pastor's heart who was speaking to 5,000 people, I'd want something that would tickle them. I'd want something that would make them go, wow, can he preach? Oh, I'd want to do that, and I'd want to say something that would make them come back. You know, I don't really think about money, but I do think I've got a problem with people being here. I love that income. It's great. And it could easily become my goal, very easily. But you know what Jesus said to those 5,000 people? He said this very firmly, birds have nests, and foxes have holes, and the Son of Man doesn't have a place to lay his head, you still want to come? If you follow me, it might be like that. Nobody did. 2 Timothy chapter 4, I want you to turn to it, it's important. 2 Timothy chapter 4, Paul is giving what I think is a famous exhortation to his young disciple who is ministering to these people. He said, Timothy, you maintain the standard of sound words. For the time will come, verse 3, when they will not endure sound doctrine, but wanting to have what? Their ears tickled. Wanting to have something that just sounds nice and religious and cute. They will accumulate for themselves. They will find leaders who will tell them what they want to hear in accordance to their own desires, and then they'll turn away their ears from the truth, and then they'll turn aside to miss. But you, friend Timothy, I don't care if you're down to three people, you will be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. the church too often is involved in playing a success game and when we end up playing a success game what we end up doing is becoming an entertainment center with performances given to placid pew sitters I gotta do this over again I got this written down, it's a good one, you'll like it okay? with performances given to placid piles of impotent unproductive pew sitters you say that three times fast six Ps in that thing you know what I hope I'm hitting your heart a little bit and just you know I want to back off here because this sermon the thing that's so hard about this for me is that this is being preached to me this is being preached right to my heart and these are goals that I very easily could stray away from because I want everybody I want I want every one of you to like me oh and so I'd love to just not say that. We get involved in a success game and it turns into an entertainment center, and we spend all our time thinking of devices and gimmicks to get them here, and then when we get them here, we give them mush, and we can't do that. You know why the early church had no gimmicks? It was simple, because their source of joy was that they had become new creatures in Christ, And they went everywhere telling everyone that Jesus, who was crucified, he is risen, and I know him, and so can you. And when you're excited about that, you don't need balloons. But if you aren't so excited about that, then bring on the clowns. Because what else is going to motivate us to bring anyone or to share with anyone? We play bingo. We got balloons. We kick a football through a goalpost. Come. The church, the body of Christ, I hope that with me, that you with me will all develop a love for the church. And along with that love for the church, an attitude of protection of the church, the body of Christ, it's important. And it matters how we do things. It matters how we function. next week we're going to find out that it matters how our government and our church is structured it matters that our leadership is doing what they ought it matters but you know what i want to do right now as i'm giving you all these lists of things that are so important for the church to do and so important for the church to be and we're going to be talking about elders and their function and the pastor and his function and lay people and their function the the things of giving and all these kinds of things but right now as i'm listing all these things i just i want to do what paul did in that first verse of chapter 3 of Ephesians and back off, make a slash, there's no verb, and say this, wait a minute. All of that stuff is insignificant. We could have the best elders in the world that could know just exactly what they're supposed to do. The greatest pastor, a wonderful serving congregation, just all these things could be falling into place. But before we even talk about that anymore, before I pray that you would understand all those things and your function and your role, I want to back off because every one of those things are absolutely insignificant unless we understand the mystery. You know what the mystery is? That you and I are one. And from there we go. And from there we grow. And if Christ is to be seen in the church, we must be one. And I'm going to preach it. And we're going to protect it. And we're going to pray that God would multiply it. Let's pray. Thank you for your word. how you teach us teach us to be the church I ask this in your name Amen Amen.
