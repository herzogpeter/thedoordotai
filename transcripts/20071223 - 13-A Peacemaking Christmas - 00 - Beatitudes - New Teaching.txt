Wasn't that fun? Yeah. Man. Let's pray as we move to the ministry of the Word. Father, I pray what I often pray at this time. It's the same. For eyes to see and ears to hear and feet that eagerly and quickly follow You and Your way, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. As most of you know, we've been dealing for several weeks with the introductory teachings of Jesus as revealed in the Sermon on the Mount, beginning with the Beatitudes. Today we come to the seventh Beatitude in Matthew, chapter 5, verse 9. Blessed are the peacemakers. Peacemakers. Sentiments to which I think we would all agree to be a peacemaker would be a good thing. even if we don't know exactly what that means or how to do it. And the theme of peace fits quite nicely into Christmas, I think. So the timing is good for peace on earth, goodwill toward men. And he came preaching peace. He's called more than once the Prince of Peace. One problem with all of that, no peace. Often we don't have to go any further than our own hearts to find the lack of peace. Look out a little further. It's worse into our communities and cities. Just read the paper, watch the news, which really isn't a good idea, because if you do that, then you'll see the whole world where there is no peace at all. But hey, it's Christmas, so let's pretend that there could be peace if we just believe in peace and love. So hear those sleigh bells ring in a jing-jing-jingling tune. That'll work. You know, it was several years ago, I began to get concerned. Actually, I wasn't that concerned. My wife started getting concerned that I was becoming kind of a humbug kind of person around this whole Christmas thing. And it wasn't so much around Christmas itself, but around some of the idyllic and serene scenes associated with it, particularly those associated with and attempting to depict the actual birth of Christ. That might surprise you a bit. I was becoming the guy who, when people were oohing and aahing at some neighborhood nativity scene, would feel compelled to say, it wasn't like that. You know, why do you have to say that? No, the wise men came later. There wasn't any snow. And that woman playing Mary, she's got three kids. Not a virgin. You know, and you're spoiling it for the kids. You know, they didn't laugh at all at that last night. They were very offended. I did it anyway today. Oh, stop. Please, really. Please, stop. Oh. Seriously, I remember watching Christmas pageants. I still see them advertised on TV, and they're in the paper. big productions, live animals, angelic hoes, shepherds, wise men, real sheep. And I would look at that stuff and I'd go, it's so much better than the original. I pretty much ruined Christmas here at Open Door. When I first came many years ago, I remember, I'll never forget the first Christmas here, we had a singing Christmas tree in the old building, a singing Christmas tree. Took up the whole stage. Now, I don't know if you've ever seen one of these singing Christmas tree things. It had been a tradition here at Open Door for years, covered with brightly colored ribbons and bows and fake Christmas presents, the operative word being fake, big enough to hold the entire choir. The whole choir got into this thing and sing Christmas songs about Jesus' birth. Ho, ho, ho. Over time, I mean, it was really weird how they picked up on this, but people began to get wind of the fact that I didn't like this. I don't know how they did that. But when asked, Dave, what's the deal? Well, I don't feel like the singing Christmas tree. I remember saying, and not always, but this is maybe a compilation of what I said, but kind of said, no, you don't, I love that thing. I think we should keep it just as long as at Easter, we have a singing Easter egg too. Okay, okay, okay. Here's the deal. I'm not nearly as curmudgeonly, although my wife doesn't agree with this, as I used to be. I think I've gotten better. She doesn't. But I love, I do. I love the beauty of Christmas, the sights and sounds, and all the traditions. But what I just shared with you might help explain to you why, when I think of the Christmas story, even today, I still find myself far more drawn to the depiction I shared with you a few years ago when we looked at the Christmas story through the lens of John's revelation, kind of Christmas revelation style. It's a vision, you may remember, that gives to us a graphic behind-the-scenes look at what was really going on that first Christmas morning. No sleigh bells, no snowballs, no ho, ho, ho. Turns out there was a war going on that first Christmas morning as God was setting into motion His plan to win back the hearts of men and women, to redeem His lost creation. But it wasn't going to come, this redemption, without a cost and a conflict of cosmic proportions, which doesn't sound very peaceful at all. So for all the idyllic scenes of peaceful serenity that we associate with Christmas, and particularly that first Christmas morning, I keep thinking that the peace he was bringing brought with it the promise of real peace. But it cost him a lot. And then I think if that's true, and we're serious about being followers of this rabbi we call Jesus, then maybe if we're going to become the kind of peacemakers and peace bringers that he was, this thing could cost us as well. Ho, ho, ho. So blessed are the peacemakers. A sentiment to which we all agree would be a good thing. a theme that fits nicely into Christmas. Revelation 12 says it happened like this. That a great sign appeared in heaven one day. A woman clothed with the sun and moon over her feet, and on her head a crown of 12 stars, and she was with child, and she cried out being in pain and labor to give birth, and she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule and redeem and restore the nations. Now, I've just got to stop right there, get the picture. As many of you know, when you're dealing with the book of Revelation, in a very weird book, you're dealing with apocalyptic language. And knowing that helps you kind of unpack some of the stuff. It's symbolic language, some of which is obvious. A lot of it isn't. But in the text I just read, I think the symbolism is actually pretty obvious. The male child born to the woman who would rule and redeem and restore nations is obviously Christ. And the woman giving birth, in the broadest sense, actually, is Israel, from whom Messiah would come, but more specifically, as it happened in history, it's a picture of Mary, verse 3, then another sign appears as the drama continues, and behold, a great red dragon appears. See, I've not seen a great red dragon in any of the nativity scenes. Although I'm told there's a person that I know who has a dragon in his nativity scene. No, he got it right. The dragon, Again, and the symbolism is speaking of Satan, and here's what he looks like, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his head were seven diadems, and his tail swept away a third of the stars and threw them in the earth. And if you're looking at it literally, you're going, when did that happen? This is symbolic language. It's speaking of violence. It's speaking of his nature and what his intent is to sweep away and to destroy. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth so that when she gave birth, he might devour the child, and then she gave birth to a son, to a male child, and when she did, the dragon pounced. In the form, actually, on earth of Herod, this madman who, hearing of a rival king, slaughtered the innocent. Thousands of babies under the age of two in Israel were killed in his attempt to find just one, but he missed. And the woman, verse 6, says, fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared by God. They went to Egypt, you might recall. And then verse 7 says this. Christmas morning, there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. Which kind of makes you wonder, whatever happened to Silent Night? I mean, this sounds a lot more like a scene from Lord of the Rings than it does away in a manger. So here's how I see it. I kind of put it together in my mind. On earth, away in a manger. Maybe it was. On earth, a silent night. I don't know. In heaven, a war. With a woman about to give birth to a child who would redeem and restore and rule the nations, and a dragon waiting to pounce as soon as it was born to devour it. And when the child is born, he pounces. He pounces, using Herod as a pawn, but he misses, and the child escapes. And that is why we sing joy to the world, because the dragon missed. So Merry Christmas, everybody. Peace on earth, goodwill toward men, I think. Where's the peace? And it wouldn't be the last time that the dragon pounces. And it wouldn't be the last time that the dragon misses. Because at the cross, boy, the dragon thought he had him there. Indeed, three days descended to the lower parts. Satan, the dragon, we got him. But God raised him up again. So the dragon missed again And there's your joy to the world But where's the peace? I mean in the story The dragon missed And that's your joy But where's the peace? In real life Where's the peace? In Jesus' day Where's the peace? We sing this song I love this song, O Little Town of Bethlehem, How Still We See Thee Lie. Really? When was that? Where was that? In real life, in Jesus' day. Forget about Revelation 12 and all the weirdness going on there. Well, the song says it was in the dark street. Yet in the dark street shines. Don't sing, Dave. The everlasting light, the hopes and fears of all the years are met in this baby tonight. The hopes and fears. What were they? In Jesus' day, seriously, what were in Jesus' day, what were people afraid of? What were people hopeful for in real life? Well, the answer is obvious, and we've talked about it at length. Even in the context of this series we've been in of Jesus as rabbi and kind of contextualizing that whole thing in history, we know they were afraid of, among other things, Rome. That would have embodied all of their fear. And Rome, which brought with it the Caesars and the Herods and poverty and tyranny and war. And their hopes, that was easy too. I know what they, they were hopeful for change, for deliverance from all of this, but they were despairing that things ever would change in the way the world was. Giving rise to this question that is asked over and over, actually in the Psalms, so this is a legitimate question for the people of God that often comes laced with frustration and anger. How long, God? What are you going to do, God? Well, God's answer to that question, what are you going to do, in the context of Christmas, is a baby in a manger, which is awful cute. you gotta admit, as we ooh and ah at the neighborhood nativity scene. But it's not much help in the face of real problems like Caesar or Rome or Herod. And so for any of that nativity scene to even look like hope, you have to remember that the baby doesn't stay a baby. He grows up to be a man, and with that thought, hope begins to rise, because now I get it. At least I think I do. I understand the plan now. At least I think I do, because here's the plan. This is the way the plan usually works. This little baby will grow up to be a king, and if he's a king, he'll have an army. And when he builds an army, he'll use that to crush the enemy, and because he does, we'll be free. So there's your peace. We'll win the war. We'll crush the enemy, which is how it works. It's always that way. So we need a bigger army and faster swords. It's really weird, you guys, historically getting back into it. That's exactly the way Rome was bringing peace. There was actually a phrase in Jesus' day around the Caesars in Rome. It's called Pax Romano. It's a word that means, or a phrase that means the peace of Rome. That was the goal of Rome, to have peace in the world. Caesar Augustus dubbed himself the Prince of Peace, long before Jesus, the Prince of Peace. It was all about, everybody's going, we want peace. The way Rome got peace, you know, we've talked about this before, however, was to crush everyone who disagreed with them, everyone who didn't have the same politics as them, everyone who got in their way. And when everybody's silenced and when everybody's dead, we'll have peace. We've called it in the past power over. And it's the primary strategy in the kingdoms of this world, even in the kingdoms of this world, that we like. But it wasn't and it isn't Jesus' strategy. Because when he actually did grow up to be a man, and hopes began to rise, and they really did around this guy, he got a lot of attention that maybe he's the one who will deliver us from this stuff. He didn't pick up a sword and teach his followers to do the same. He picked up a cross and told his followers, to do the same. So what do you think of that strategy? Well, you know, in this context of a church, well, I love that strategy. Go back, be in the scene. Here's how we're going to win, by losing. Here's how we're going to live, by dying. A strategy that is, well, let's say it nice, counterintuitive. It just sounds so weird. Because God's answer to what are you going to do, God, about the problem of despair, that things in this world will ever be different than they are, seems to be a baby in a manger at Christmas and a man on a cross at Easter. Which doesn't seem to be much of an answer. Pretty weak response, actually, in the face of Caesar and Herod and Rome, and an odd strategy, to say the least, an odd strategy to be polite, which is why it's often misunderstood, and therefore almost always misapplied, and therefore rarely experienced or seen or even attempted Jesus' way of bringing peace, even by those who say they follow Jesus, because most of us, quite frankly, like the people of whom Jesus was speaking in Luke 19, 42, are blind to the things which make for peace. Remember, he wrote into Jerusalem and said, if only you knew. And he looked at a Jerusalem that was in as much turmoil then as it is today, if only you knew the things which make for peace. but they were blind and while the blindness even today manifests itself in a number of different ways I want to touch on and because it does we're probably going to spend more than one week on this but today I want to touch on just a couple they're actually revealed in a hidden in plain sight sort of way in the story I've been weaving this morning particularly around this Revelation 12 thing and the first blindness or misunderstanding, I want to put my finger on relative to what a peacemaker is, is that a peacemaker is in any way passive in the face of real problems or real pain. That a peacemaker doesn't do anything, doesn't say anything, which is why they're always wishing you a Merry Christmas. People are always wishing and hoping for things, never doing or saying things, particularly things that might disturb the peace. The problem, see, is this, in terms of understanding what a peacemaker actually is, is this, that in order to truly be a peacemaker, You need to understand that the process of bringing peace, of making peace, sometimes isn't very peaceful at all. Like our best-loved Christmas scenes, all tranquil and serene. Because by definition, a peacemaker is someone who is willing not to be passive at all, but a peacemaker is someone who is willing and has the courage to intentionally and active move toward and right into situations where there is no peace. So if your goal in life is to avoid conflict at all costs and call that peacemaking, you'll never be a peacemaker. So when the baby was born, getting back to the story and kind of seeing how this is hidden in plain sight in Revelation 12, and the dragon pounced, it wasn't peaceful. So, you know, he said back and look at the scene and go, you know, if it was actually happening and you were watching it, maybe the baby shouldn't have come because all the baby actually did was make the dragon mad and cause a war. So the baby caused the war. So don't come and don't speak and don't stand ever. Don't do anything. Just wish everyone a Merry Christmas. Because a peacemaker is not that person. A peacemaker is not the person who, in the name of making peace or keeping peace, simply avoids conflict and confrontation of any kind at all costs. But how many of you know that person who avoids conflict and confrontation at all costs and thinks that in doing that they're a peacemaker in their family? You might actually get some practice at this in a couple days. now how many of you are that person or it's a pretty simple way actually to identify this person because this is the person in your family or your workplace church circle of friends whose job it is to change the subjects if we get anywhere near the truth about what's really going on in our family in our marriage in our church workplace circle of friends because to say out loud what's really going on might disturb the peace. Even though to say out loud what's really going on in this family, church, or marriage might also stop the abuse or reveal the sin or expose the injustice. In Jesus' day, this way of dealing with or bringing peace could have been illustrated in a number of ways, but I'm going to tie it into kind of the study historically we've been doing, because in Jesus' day, these people were the Sadducees, and to a lesser degree, the Pharisees, who hated Rome and saw the injustice. If you got them alone, yeah, we hate Rome, all this injustice, it's horrible, but they kept the peace. And by the way, their status and money and comfort by agreeing with Rome when they didn't agree with Rome. They kept the peace that way by remaining silent when someone should have spoken, by going along when someone should have stood against. But they went along and they stayed silent and they agreed when they didn't and kept the peace. At least peace out here. There was no peace in here. The Essenes, another group that we've studied in the past in the context of this story, withdrew altogether. Remember that? They went off into the desert. That's great. How peaceful is that? I'm going to find peace by just leaving everything. Blessed are the peace finders. Somewhat blessed are the peacemakers who stay. And then there were the zealots. who did exactly the opposite of the Essenes. And in this regard, there's something that stirs in us. And I go, I got to, you know, at least they did this. They stood up. The zealots stood up and they spoke up. And then they did what everybody does. They picked up the sword to procure the peace. Everybody's wanting peace. Sadducees want it. The Essenes want it. The Romans want it. Zealots wanted it. in fact is Israel had a history of this violence again we've spoken of this before believing that peace could come through violence and war like the rest of the world and sometimes in the history of Israel it seemed to work and then the best example would be the reign of David who was a great warrior and in fact it was why God said you can't build a temple because he had blood on his hands there was so much violence in his kingdom. But you look at that, and you're an Israelite, a Jew, in Jesus' day. You're going, it works. It worked then. So it must be okay. But soon after David came Solomon, and soon after Solomon came people with bigger armies and faster, sharper swords. So the kingdom was divided into the northern and the southern kingdoms, and the people were enslaved by the Assyrians and the Babylonians long before the Romans were on the scene. So they had been here before. By the time you get up to Jesus' day in the Roman occupation, they had been in this occupied status before and had asked a question before. How long? God, what are you going to do, God? Because some in Jesus' day had kept a dream alive of a kingdom and hoped that there would be the return of the glory days that they associated particularly with David, the days of deliverance and conquest, but most of them could only conceive of this kingdom coming through raw physical violence and force. Because while avoiding conflicts had allowed them to live and the Sadducees actually to flourish, even they knew it didn't bring freedom. So their hopes and dreams were that God would again provide a deliverer like Moses, a warrior like Joshua, a king like David, but oddly behind the scenes, and you have to look behind the scenes always a little bit, something was beginning to stir in the hearts of a few. And maybe it was stirring simply because they noticed over time and in history that their way of bringing peace wasn't working. That avoiding conflict didn't work. That war didn't work. And among the first to notice were the prophets. They always are. People like Jeremiah and Zechariah with a new and better vision of something that no human being, quite frankly, had ever conceived before. For what dawned on them through revelation from God's Spirit, quite frankly, was this, that what Israel and the whole world needed was not another shot at the old way, was not the capacity to wage war with greater force, with better weapons and bigger armies. Indeed, what was needed was an entirely different way, made possible by an entirely different kind of deliverer who would give birth to an entirely different kind of people. whose hearts no longer were made of stone but made of flesh, inhabited by the Spirit, eager to walk in the way of their king. So greatly rejoice, daughter of Zion, says the prophet in Zechariah chapter 9. Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem, for behold, your king, your deliverer, is coming to you. And the good news is this, he is just. He will bring justice and endowed with salvation, humble and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt, the foal of a donkey, and he will cut off the chariot of Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war will be cut off, and he will speak peace to the nations, and his dominion will be from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth. But that picture would raise some questions. for anyone reading them, either in Zechariah's time or Jews in Jesus' time reading the prophets, which they always did, what kind of king? Rides into the occupied city of Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey. What chance would he have? What change would a king like that be able to make against Caesar, Rome, Herod? Well, they were about to find out because one king did. And when he did, he knew what he was doing. For he had indeed come to take away the chariots from Ephraim and the war horses from Jerusalem and to break the bow of battle because he came preaching peace. But here's the question. Would anybody get it? Would anybody see it? And if they saw it, I see what he's doing, would they believe it? Would they believe that this way could change anything? That the old way did not work? That avoiding it didn't help? That blowing it up didn't heal? That violence and force, which seemed to be in Jesus' day and still is in our day, seemed to be the strongest power on earth was not nearly strong enough? Would anybody believe it? To usher in God's kingdom or to transform the hearts of men and women. See, it would take a king born in a manger, riding on a donkey, a king who would ultimately defeat and disarm a culture of death, not by taking anyone's life. That was, everybody gets that way. but by giving his own life away. Not by killing his enemy, but by dying. What? What? For even his enemy, not with the power of the sword, but with what has come to be known as the power of the cross. Well, a few did get it. They saw it, and a few did actually believe it when they saw the full cycle of death. to life. But it started so small. Just a handful of people. And then come in your mind to our study that we've been in the Beatitudes, sitting on the hillside of Galilee. And as they listened to this strange new rabbi, they noticed that he didn't say what everybody else said, blessed are the warriors and the conquerors, the mighty and the strong. He said, blessed are the peacemakers and the pure in heart and the meek. And when he said things like that, many left him. He's nuts. But not everybody left. But most did leave. Because most didn't get it. They couldn't see it. They didn't believe it. Even now, most don't. which is why when he came into Jerusalem that day on the colt of a donkey he wept in Luke 19, 42 again saying if only you had known the things which make for peace but they didn't know because they couldn't see verse 42 for these ways of making peace were hidden, the verse says, from their eyes why? Well, there's really no mystery there. The reason this way of bringing peace was hidden was because they'd never seen it before. No one had ever shown them a different way. No one had ever done it a different way. So Jesus did. Not by avoiding the pain, but by walking right into the teeth of the pain and into the teeth of death, coming out of that death alive, breaking the power of death. But he did it by taking a cross. That was the way to the life and the peace, the cross. That's how you get there. I don't believe that. The cross, the cross. Don't think of it theologically. Think of it physically right now. But also as a symbol in Jesus' day that we have to kind of recreate in our minds because it was a symbol of the worst that man in hell could do to disturb the peace. Remember the Romans used to line roadways with people being crucified in agony to instill fear. Want peace? We'll have peace. Just kill all them. The cross was the symbol of the worst that man and hell could do to inflict pain and instill fear. And that cross was met this time for the first time by Jesus, not with more of the same. Vindictive and hate, I'll get you back. but this time it was met with forgiveness. Remember what he said? Father, forgive them. In generosity, inclusion, and grace, today you will be with me in paradise. He was literally for the first time in history showing people how to do when in his earthly ministry he talked, he said that we should do, overcome evil with good. He was on the cross doing that, overcoming overwhelming evil. not with more evil which is how we know how to do it he did it with goods so there's your joy to the world people there's your peace on earth goodwill toward men but now beyond the sentiment that the oohing and ahhing at nativity scenes our Rabbi Jesus this Christmas says don't just get all warm and gooey about me this Christmas. And don't even just worship me, though it's wonderful to do that. The message from this church for a very long time and from this story again today is this. What I want you to do is follow me and learn to make my way your way because that would be joy to the world. If God's people made Jesus' way their way That would be joy to your neighborhood For some of you it would be joy to your marriage And to your family And to your workplace and school Because people like that could change the world Blessed are the peacemakers Lord, I find it hard to bring peace where there is no peace. It is demanding. Back at home, among friends, with relatives, it can be nice and cozy and comfortable. but sometimes Lord it is not in the world among those where the barriers come up with those I do not like it is far from nice and cozy and comfortable why do I have to love? why have I chosen to be a follower of one who loved to the utmost. Strengthen me, Lord, for the task, the crucifying task of being a reconciler amongst guilt and fear, anxiety and anger. Bring me, Lord, further to the point where I can accept life with all its problems and pains, with gladness and exultation. Not because of future perks in a future heaven, but because I know that to be fully alive, to be fully human, I can do no other. Amen.
