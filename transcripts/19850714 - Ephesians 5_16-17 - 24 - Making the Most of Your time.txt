Chapter 5, verse 15. Ephesians chapter 5, verse 15. Covering three verses today in our continuing study, very rich study in the book of Ephesians. Verse 15, Therefore, be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of your time because the days are evil. So then, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I thank you for your word. I thank you for the things that over the past few months and even years of our lives, you have been teaching us. Specifically, I thank you for the things you're teaching us through this book, Ephesians. And Father, we seem to come to it week after week and are beginning to learn more and more things, and it's opening up more and more. but father I'm real aware this morning of the fact that again the words that are said are nothing more than words and they just bounce off the walls unless there's a touch of your spirit unless there's the control of your spirit in this thing and father I ask that you would be our teacher this morning open us up to the things you would have us do in response to the things you want us to know. I ask these things in your name. Amen. Life is full of people who started things but never finished them. Unfinished paintings, sculptures that stand without the finishing touches applied to them, goals that were thought of but never pursued, good intentions that were never really moved towards. Relationships that kind of started out okay and a lot of good ideas and a lot of neat possibilities, but never coming to a place that that relationship is all it could be. Dreams that remain dreams. Hopes that remain hopes. Ministries that never really move into fruit. All sorts of things, and even in your own mind, you can think of things in your life over and over and over again of dreams that just stayed there because they were never acted upon, never moved towards. I always wanted to do that. I always thought about trying that. You know, I really thought I should spend more time here or there. And it never gets done. I want you to notice a very major statement in the very middle of our text this morning, just as we begin in verse 16, it says this, making the most of your time, making the most of your time. If we are to turn our dreams into reality, if we are to turn our hopes into fact, if we are to turn our relationships into something that is real and something that is deep and something that is full and meaningful, if we the church are to become the body of Christ, if in our own individual lives we are going to be conform to the image of his son, I believe it's because we are going to make the most of the time that God has given us to do those things, because we've redeemed the time. I want you to notice something about this text. Right off the bat, we're going to get into this, and I'm going to do some teaching. Something very important, and I'm sure it just bounced right out at you right away. It's the fact that there's a definite article before the word time. Didn't that get you? I mean, you just really thrilled you, the fact that there's a definite article before the word time, right? I doubt it. It's very significant, though. It says in my particular translation, making the most of your time. It might say in your translation, making the most of the time. The feeling there and the translation there lends us to believe that there is a prescription of time. This is not some sort of vague and abstract, broad use of time. It's not some indefinite, defined span. It is not speaking of a time. It is not speaking of some time. It is not speaking of any time. It is the time. It is your specific time. It is speaking of a prescription of the time, the time that God has given me and given you to do the things He's called us to do. I have a time. It is my time, and within that time, I need to be pursuing and and fulfilling the ministry that God has called me to do. I was sick last week, and I don't want to blow it out of proportion. My wife will tell you that I have a tendency to do that when I'm sick. I really get sick. I don't mess around. And I let everybody around me know just how sick I am. And I was so sick, I just thought I was going to die. I was so sure. It was just it. And I was thinking about this because this was the text I was preparing for last week, and I got so terribly sick, ready to die, And I thought, my time has come. This is it. No more left. I'll never be able to preach this sermon. I'll have to have somebody come in. That was just time. It would be a great illustration. But it is a sobering thought to me to realize that the ministry that God has given me, the things he's called me to do, are within a prescribed amount of time that I don't have forever to do the things he's called me to do. I don't know for sure that I will be here next week, and neither do you. 1 Peter 1.17 says Conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay upon the earth. Conduct yourselves carefully because there is a prescribed time that God has given you. Job 14.14 says He speaks of the appointed time that God has given to him. Acts chapter 20 verse 24 Paul says But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself but rather my passion is that in the time God has given me, that in that prescription of time, I may fulfill my course. I want to finish the ministry. I could go on and on with this kind of concept and build it more and more. David had a real concept of time, a real sense of time. In Psalm 89, 46 and 47, David in that particular time of his life was going through something that many of us go through and some of you even this morning might be going through right now. It was a time of spiritual dryness where he sensed the disconnection from God and nothing was working. And the service that usually he did with such zeal and passion and enthusiasm was just dry. And it wasn't going anywhere. And he had to stop and there was no energy. And he said to God, this very thing, Lord, how long will you hide yourself from me? And the reason that bothered him was this. God, remember how short my time is. I don't have forever to do the things that you've called me to do. In other words, because of the distress he was going through, he felt distracted from doing the things God had called him to do. And he said, Lord, how long am I going to be off center? I only have so much time and I want to be filled up again with yourself so I can function fully in serving you. We know that feeling. And James chapter 4, verse 13 and 14 says this, one we're very familiar with. It's talking about the fact that we talk about today and tomorrow. I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and I'm going to go here and I'm going to go there. And in verse 14 he says, that's fine, but listen to this. Remember, you don't know of your life tomorrow. Your life is but a vapor that appears for a little while and then it disappears. Poof, it's over. Gone. Time. Time. Last week when I was home, I got to do something that I don't normally do, and I can't say I enjoyed it immensely, and that was that I got to watch the electronic church go on. I got to watch all the preachers who get on TV. When they really get good, they go on TV. So we're waiting for one day. We'll get on TV. It'll be wonderful. It really didn't do much for me, but I do remember there was this one person who gave a testimony, and they were from Uganda. And I'm going to be making mention of the same person in a few minutes. And it really did have an impact on me. He was talking about the fact that during Idi Amin's reign, their church had been growing. And a great persecution came upon that church when Idi Amin came into that place. And they had to literally run for their lives. And it was an absolute miracle that brought him out of that nation into the United States, running every day. And four years of just trying to move from one place to the other and try to hide and escape death. and he finally came to the United States and they were here about four weeks and one day he was relating the story that his wife said to him, Honey, tomorrow I'm going to go to the store and buy the kids some clothes. And they stood looking at each other transfixed because they had used a word that they had never been able to count on for four solid years. It was tomorrow. Tomorrow I'm going to do this. Time. James says tomorrow you don't know if you have tomorrow. You see, the whole realm of our lives, whether we like it or not. We don't like to talk about this. And in some ways, I even hesitate talking about this because it can be used to really manipulate a lot. And I'm going to back off that as much as I can, but I still have to tell the truth. The realm of our lives are lived within time. And we need to be made aware of that. And the wisdom that is being spoken of in verse 15, therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise. How do you do that? Redeem the time. Make the most of the time. The wisdom that is being spoken of in chapter 15 is being demonstrated in 16 because wisdom takes the opportunity that is at hand and uses it. That is wisdom. And maybe the converse of that is also true. Maybe the greatest lack of wisdom in our lives is demonstrated in our squandering of time. In opportunities lost. And we run through our lives with a handful of might-a-bens and wish-I-hads and lots of neat ideas and lots of neat dreams and all sorts of things that someday I'm going to do. And even in our relationship with the Lord, you know, someday that pastor is going to get to me. Someday. It's always tomorrow. Tomorrow. And we play the fool whenever we do that. We need to remember where we are in our text, just to back off a little bit and get back to a solid exegesis of this passage. We are speaking these weeks of the worthy walk of the believer. Chapters 1 through 3 of the book of Ephesians has been telling us, and we spent a good six months talking about over and over and over again who we are in Christ, what we have in Christ, the riches that are ours. And then in chapters 4 through 6, the theology was over, the building up of ourselves in terms of really feeling really good about ourselves because I went from death to life is over and now the practical application comes. Chapters 1 through 3, this is who you are. Chapters 4 through 6, now this is how you live. This is what you do because that's who you are. Chapter 4 begins to describe the manner of life that is going to be seen on the inside. Catch my words there. That is going to be seen on the outside if indeed I have been changed on the inside. It's going to happen. And the characteristic of the walk of the one who has been redeemed is this, that it's a humble walk, that it's a patient walk, it's a unity walk, it's a different walk. It's a love walk, chapter 5. It's a light walk, chapter 5, again. And now, again, you can just really catch the theme as Paul has this string of characteristics running through this fourth and fifth chapter. It's now a wisdom walk, a walk of wisdom. The question we have to ask ourselves obviously is this. What does it mean to walk in wisdom? What does it mean to walk in wisdom? I don't always do this for you, but I'm going to today because I kind of feel sorry for you. Because usually it seems like we deal so much with concepts that we just kind of make big circles. And unless you really fight with me, it's even tough to follow. I'm going to give you a little skeleton. I'm not going to make any promises after that that you'll be able to put anything on it. But there is something we need to catch here. There's three dimensions that the wise walking Christian lives with. Three fundamental things that we need to know as a wise walking believer. The first thing is this. That the wise walking Christian understands his life's principles. That's verse 15. Be careful how you walk. We'll talk about that in a minute. That's the first thing. The second dimension of a wise walk is this. That the wise walking believer understands his limited privileges. Verse 16, and that's going to deal with this whole concept of time. And the third concept is this in verse 17, that the wise walking Christian understands his Lord's purposes, God's will, if you will. Very simple, but very important, and I want you to get that as we begin. Let's look at the first one very quickly. The wise walking believer has a sense of his life's principles, verse 15. Be careful how you walk. That word careful can be translated several different ways to kind of give us a little bit of a different picture of that same word. It means to walk circumspectly. It means that you walk accurately. It means to walk with great exactness. The picture I get in my mind is of someone walking through a minefield, okay? If you're walking through a minefield, you're going to walk circumspectly. You're going to walk carefully. You are going to walk with great exactness. You're going to be careful where you put your foot and where You don't put your foot, how you lean, how you breathe. You're going to be aware. It is evaluating my life. It's looking at myself all my life and saying, am I really in the center of God's will? Am I really doing the things He's called me to do? Am I wasting my time or am I not? A careful walk. Circumspect. By the way, it's very important as I just kind of go over this. I don't want to spend a lot of time on this particular point, but there are some things I need to bring to our minds. It's important that you understand that the wisdom that is being spoken of here is not an ability to think wise thoughts. The wise walking believer is not necessarily the intellectual believer. It has nothing to do with your ability to assimilate philosophy. It has nothing to do with whether you've gone to school. It has nothing to do with whether you know theology or anything like that. It has nothing to do with age. However, if you've walked with God, lived with God for years, wisdom will be the result. See, we have a real problem with this, and it's something we've been working on for months and months. And it's the difference between what I know and what I do. And very often, for us as Americans, it really is a thing that is a Western culture kind of problem. I know all sorts of things, and I fill my brain with all sorts of knowledge, and for some reason or another, I seem to be satisfied with that. Christians especially. I know my doctrine. I know what I should believe. But for some reason or another, it's real easy for us to never make the connection between what I know and what I do. Wisdom is an activity. This can be illustrated by looking at the Greek mind and the Hebrew mind that was present even when this text was written. To the Greek, wisdom was something like how we perceive wisdom. Wisdom to the Greek was something that kind of spun off the brain. It was thinking high thoughts. Greeks had a wonderful habit of sitting under trees next to ponds, throwing rocks at them and thinking wise thoughts. You know, it was a wonderful thing. They would wax eloquent and they would fill their minds with knowledge, philosophy, intellectual exercises. To the Hebrew, wisdom was something far different. Wisdom was something not that you thought. It was something that you did. The wise walk is a wise lifestyle. It's a lifestyle. So walking in wisdom is not for the intellectual capable. Walking in wisdom is for the spiritually pliable. It is for the spiritually obedient. Walking in wisdom, to put it very bluntly and very simply, in relation to the other things we've been studying, walking in wisdom is merely the practical application of everything we've been studying for the last six months. Walking in wisdom is walking in humility. It is wisdom that walks in a patient way. It is wisdom that preserves the unity. It is wisdom that causes you to speak the truth in love, regardless of the consequences. It is wisdom that walks a different walk. It is wisdom that gets you to put away bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor. That's the wisdom. It is wisdom that is kind and tenderhearted and forgiving one another. It is wisdom that walks in love. It is wisdom that results in a lifestyle that is imitating God. Chapter 5, verse 1. Again, I don't want to spend a lot of time on this particular verse, but there are some things I need to get you to see so that we understand the whole of this book. By the way, that really is one of the things we're doing through this book. I want us to really be able to come away with this with a grasp not of one or two verses here and there, a neat concept here, a neat idea there, but a real grasp of this entire book. And there are themes that Paul runs through this entire book, and we're running into one of them right now. One of the themes we've been talking about over and over and over again in our study is this, that the basic characteristic of Christianity is not necessarily the fact that I raised a hand or walked the aisle or said some words. The basic fundamental characteristic of Christianity is that when I met Jesus, I was changed. Theologically, I was changed. What happened? I went from death to life. What could be more radical? I went from being in darkness to being in light. There's another characteristic, another contrast, and it's right here. You know what it was? I went from being a fool to being wise. I want you to get this. What Paul is really saying here when he says, be careful how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise. You know what he's saying? Be careful how you walk, not as unsaved, but as saved. Be careful how you walk, not as dead, but as alive. Be careful how you walk, not as those who are in darkness, but as those who are in the light. These are the indicators of being a believer. The believer is wise unto salvation. The biblical definition of a fool is not a Christian who is a fool. A Christian is wise. You get that? I can illustrate it by looking at light and darkness, as we talked about last week. Verse 8 of chapter 5 says, For you were formerly darkness. That means you were dead in your sin. That means you were not redeemed. but now you are light in the Lord. I hear people say, if you walk in the light, then you won't sin. I want to tell you something, believer. If you're a believer, you are light. And if you're living in sin, you know what you're doing, you need to know this. All you're doing is doing the deeds of darkness right in the broad daylight. That's what it says in verse 11. Do not participate. You are light. Therefore, don't participate, verse 11, in the deeds of darkness. You are wise. you claim to have a knowledge of God, walk that way. Live that way. Romans 1, 21 and 22 says, For even though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was dark and professing to be wise, they what? They became fools. Paul's saying, look, you are the wise, you are the redeemed, you are the alive, you are the ones who are light, live like it. Walk in accord to who you are. The flip side of that is if you don't, if we don't see the light, if we don't see the life, if we don't see the wisdom, then tell me, where is the life, where is the light, where is the wisdom? I don't see it. Examine yourselves to see if you're even in the faith. Tough words. I do not believe that these principles that we have been talking about these last few months in terms of humility and gentleness and patience are options for the believer. I believe, and we need to catch this again and again and again, that if we claim to have a knowledge of God, then we need to walk as wise, that we need to walk as those who are in the light. Just in closing this first point up, I need to ask you a question. It's simply this. What possible reality is there to my faith if I say that I've met Christ, if I say that I have a knowledge of Him and walk as a fool. And I still, I say I have a knowledge of God, but it hasn't affected my attitude, it hasn't affected my arrogance, it hasn't affected my lack of patience and forbearing love. No impact at all. If I say I have a knowledge of God and walk as a fool, tell me about the reality of a faith like that. What possible reality is there to a faith that says, I have seen the light, but we do the deeds of darkness? there is no truth there is no speaking the truth there is no confession of sin there is no real honesty between believers there are no relationships being developed everything is superficial but I've seen the light intellectual maybe what reality is there to a faith that says I've seen the light and does the deeds of darkness what reality is there to a faith that says I've been made alive but in terms of how we're living we look like we're dead bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech it cannot be therefore Paul says be careful how you walk walk circumspectly not as unwise but as wise not as those who are dead but as those who are alive not as those who are in darkness but as those who are in light okay the wise walk is a careful walk it understands its life's principles now let's get to the meat you ready now we're going to start It understands its limited privileges in applying those principles. I had to lay some of that groundwork. It's very important. Now we get into the meat of this whole thing, and that's this. That I need, if I'm going to walk a wise walk, to understand that my ability to apply those principles I just talked about is limited. Basically, all verse 16, and that's verse 16, making the most of your time. Basically, all this verse is doing is creating in us, in the hearer, a sense of urgency concerning those characteristics that need to be developed in me. You see, there are limitations on my ability to love you. There are limitations on my ability to live my life. There are limitations on my ability to go to you and encourage you with the encouragement I feel like I want to do. There are limitations on my ability to minister and to care and to give, to do what God's called me to do. there are limitations on my ability to walk a wise walk. Limitation, obviously, we've been talking about it's time. Time. Two Greek words for time, kind of interesting. Chronos is one of them. It's not the one used in this text. It has to do with time on a clock. It has to do with the kind of time that you deal with with the calendar, chronos, or chronology, the flow of time. Another word for the word time in the Greek is kairos, And that is the word that is being used in this text. It has to do with eras or epochs. Literally, opportunities. Opportunities. It's saying this. In other words, you have the opportunity now to respond to God. You have the opportunity now to walk in love. You have the opportunity now to walk wisely. Now to speak the truth in love. Make the most of that opportunity. Grasp that moment you have today. Opportunity. Opportunity. It's here, today. You don't have it necessarily tomorrow. And wisdom seizes it. Wisdom sees the opportunity to do a wise thing, to do a godly thing, to do a righteous thing, to speak the truth in love, to let bitterness and anger and clamor be put away, and it seizes that opportunity and applies it to his life. The fool says, tomorrow, I'll think about it. Maybe someday you'll get through. opportunity the greeks had a statue in the center of one of their ancient cities the statue was called opportunity it was carved by a man named lysippus it was a strange looking thing it had wings on its feet it had a lock of hair in the front and it was bald in the back strange looking thing obviously it needed some sort of explanation and it had an explanation right underneath the statue was a plaque with a dialogue written in greek in It said this, Who made thee? Lysippus made me. What is thy name? My name is opportunity. Why hast thou wings on thy feet, that I may fly away swiftly? Why hast thou a lock of hair in front, that men may seize me when I come? Why art thou bald in the back, that I might look like people in our church? No, why art thou bald in back? When I am gone, none may lay hold of me. I'm gone. Opportunity here now, gone. here now seize it the fool says tomorrow too late psalm 90 verse 12 says teach us to number our days why that we may apply our hearts to what to wisdom the wisdom wisdom seizes the opportunity wisdom sees a chance to do it and it does it now wisdom sees the opportunity again to speak the truth to love to minister to build to set their priorities straight and it grasps it it seizes it the fool says maybe tomorrow. I wonder how many times we sit in a church service or we sit in some sort of dimension of our life where God is beginning to speak to us and I'm really beginning to be convicted about my lack of love, my incredible bitterness, my sour spirit, and as God is moving on my heart to do something about that, you know what that is? That's an opportunity to do something about it. And every time I say tomorrow, and every time I say later, and every time I say I'll do something about it someday, and I know it's ripping my life apart, and someday I'll handle that. Every time I say that, I play the fool. Play the fool. That may sound kind of strong, but there's no way in the world my words can make it strong enough. Because Paul uses some words in here, in verse 16, that bring to this warning a tremendous sense of urgency. He says this, listen believer, walk not as unsaved but as saved walk not as the unredeemed but as the redeemed and the way you do that is you make the most of the opportunity you know why? I've got to warn you about this because the days are evil because the days are evil now what does that mean, the days are evil? well there's a few ways we can look at that there's kind of a broad general way in which we can look at the evil days especially I've got to apply it specifically to the church in Ephesus and again as we do that we can see it applied to us just as well the Ephesians lived in a day that was tremendously decadent in our introduction to the whole series we talked about the debauchery of that city how the temple was basically surrounded of some sort of sexual orgiistic kind of worship with drunkenness and music being played and lack of control and they lived in what we would call an evil day and there's a general way in which Paul is probably saying to them listen folks, you live in a society that is pervasively evil Satan is controlling it the prince and the power of the air it's like a tidal wave and in a real way we little Christians in our little church here against the massive evil we see have very little opportunity to do anything to have an impact and so what he might be saying in a general sense is when you see an opportunity seize it, do something and I think that is true but I think it was far more pertinent to them and to us than something that brought. You see, this church in Ephesus did not know how evil the day they lived in was. You see, it was less than 100 years from the very time this book was written that a tremendous persecution and pain came on the horizon of the Christian history. And Christians during that time were being thrown to lions. Not far removed from this was the time when Nero began to crucify Christians and then he made great sport of it. And I think you've probably heard of the times that in his garden when he would have a great banquet, he would erect crosses all the way around his banquet garden, and he would put Christians on them, crucifying them, and light the crosses to serve as the lighting for the party. Wonderful time. The evil day was closer than they thought. And I think what Paul is saying here when he's speaking of the evil day, he's saying, listen, believer, the opportunity is now to serve the Lord. The opportunity is now to respond to God. Seize it now because you may not always have it. This is no time to play church. Why? Because the time is short. The day is evil. And you may not see it now, but there is no room in our church for bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor. Why? The day is short. The day is evil. You have opportunity now to minister. Seize it. You have opportunity now to love. Seize it. Kipa Sampangi, the same person I was talking about, not too long ago, related the story of the things that happened to his church. They were going through a time where their church was growing and when he was talking, I was thinking about us. I missed you very much last Sunday. It drove me crazy. All sorts of weird feelings. I just didn't belong at home. But as he was talking and he was speaking of this church, it just began to grow and the fellowship was growing sweeter and the people were getting to love each other and, you know, potluck dinners and just neat kinds of churchy things were happening. And then one day, this new ruler came in and the promise of even more freedom was there. A lot of good words from this ruler. His name was Idi Amin. And obviously we know that there was anything but the fact that great persecution hit that church. And he began to describe the fact that it all began very subtly and strangely where people in his church just disappeared and he didn't know where they went. And one day he related the story of a time when one of his best friends in his church had not been seen for some time and And finally, after a few days, he went over to the house. And he opened the door and one of their 12-year-old kids was standing in the door with his arms straight up in the air, transvixed, with a look of tremendous horror on his face. Found out later that he'd been like that in that same position for two solid days. When he walked into the living room, he found the eyes and the tongues of all the members of that family on the floor and all the people in that family had been killed. And that tremendous surge of persecution went through that church and the people began to meet for prayer meetings. And the church filled up and they met outside and the day was short and they knew it then. What are you saying, Dave? Are you saying that kind of thing is going to happen to me? No, you know, this is where we can move into all sorts of manipulation. What's going to happen to us? I don't know that that's going to happen to us. The book of Titus says that evil men grow worse and worse. The point was this. The day was short. The time was evil. and they didn't know it then they had to seize the opportunity when they had it. My point is this for us though is that maybe the greatest evil of all is when there is no evil. Maybe the greatest evil of all for us is when it's easy like it is for us. When I don't see the urgency when I don't see the pain when I'm really not forced to take a stand and make a difference. And you want to know something? You know what destroyed the Ephesian church? It was not the persecution of Nero. They died long before this pain I'm talking about ever happened. Because it was less than a decade from the time that this letter was written that John wrote to this same church and said, Listen, church in Ephesus, I know of your work. I know of your love. I know of your tremendous impact you've had on the city of Ephesus. But I have this against you. It is this, that you've left your first love. It was easy for them. The greatest evil for them was that things were going well. They had success. And John said to them, speaking for Christ, listen, church in Ephesus, if you don't change, I'm going to come to you and I'm going to remove the light. And that light was removed. We know that. You see, things were easy, so they thought they could coast and they thought they could live on the reputation that they had in the past. What they ended up doing was exchanging hot hearts for a cold orthodoxy. their time to minister their time to give their time to share their time to love their time to let God deal with them the way he had been moving them to be dealt with was shorter than they thought the time was short the day was evil redeem the time seize the opportunity now today the word of God is full of reminders that warn us of our limited privileges in applying these principles all the way through the word of God. I can go right back to Noah and the thing that rings in my ears is this. And the door was shut. Opportunity gone. In the New Testament, the virgins were coming to the wedding with unprepared lamps and they came but they weren't prepared. The opportunity that they had to seize wasn't seized. They didn't make the most of the opportunity. What happens? The door was shut. The wedding feast went on without them. Opportunity lost. Over and over again, I hear the words of Christ come ringing down through history. The night is coming when no man can work. I hear Christ saying to his people, the people of his day, you shall die in your sin, and where I go, you cannot come. Too late. Opportunity lost. It was there for a while. It wasn't seized. Wisdom seizes it. The fool says, tomorrow I hear God himself, year after year after year, Time and time again. Through the prophets pleading with the people of Israel to respond, to deal with the things God would have them do to obey. But they were stiff-necked. And finally Jesus said it all when he said, How often I would have gathered you as the hen gathereth her brew, but you would not. Lost opportunity. Maybe the greatest case of lost opportunity in the New Testament is the case of Judas. Three years with the king of glory. Three years where he could learn and understand and respond to Christ. And he walked away. Opportunity lost. It's over. The door was shut. Romans 13, verse 11 and 12 says this, And this do, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to wake up from your sleep. The night is almost gone. The day is at hand. Let us therefore lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. When? Now. I would call a man a fool who threw away jewels. I would call a man a fool who threw away money. I would call a man a greater fool who threw away an opportunity. Who threw away time. Who threw away a life. Time. Verse 17 says, So then, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. Third principle is this. The one who walks a wise walk understands the Lord's purposes. Understand what the will of the Lord is. And what is the will of the Lord? You know, there's a real danger in preaching a sermon like this, especially if I make the great emphasis on ministry. Because what we're prone to do and what I'm prone to do is kind of be like the guy who jumps on his horse and goes off in all different directions. No direction, no real continuity, not really knowing what I want to do, but I want to pave the world and I'm going to do it today. And he said, do it now. So I'm going to get all involved in all these things. And I want to tell you something. I do not believe that this particular text is calling me to get involved in more things. Lord, help us. I don't think we need more activity. I think what we need is more people who are walking in wisdom. You know, I get so involved sometimes being the pastor. And you have the same problem, especially if you care, being the elder or being the teacher or being the water leader, that you forget all about what it even means to walk a worthy walk, to walk in humility and patience, to walk in love and to let God have the time with you to produce in you the kind of character that will demonstrate wisdom. God's will for me you know what it is? that I walk in a manner worthy that I walk in humility that I walk in patience and gentleness God's will for me the will of the Lord is that I speak the truth and love and practice that not just preach about it but if I'm not taking the time to back off the activity I'm never going to let God have the opportunity to do in me the things that he wants to do the will of the Lord for me is that all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor be put away and that kindness and gentleness and forgiveness would be the character that would be demonstrated we read right here in Ephesians 5 verse 17 don't be foolish understand what the will of the Lord is and what is that don't be drunk with wine but be filled with the spirit that's the will of God for me be imitators of God and walk in love and we hear these exhortations over and over we hear them every Sunday and sometimes I'm sitting in church and it rings true and something pierces my heart and I'm sitting here and I'm full of bitterness and I'm full of anger and I'm full of impatience and lack of humility and I've never been broken before the Lord. And I go like this a lot and I begin to see the need and I sense God moving in my heart to seize that opportunity to change. And I say, come on. Maybe someday. I'll deal with it later. You know, we come to church every Sunday and the message is always the same and he's always giving that kind of invitation. So maybe next week or maybe the week after. Redeem the time. Your time. You don't have tomorrow. Time. Time with your spouse. I wonder, dad, husband, you take those precious times with your wife or wives with your husband that they need to build, to talk, to share, to be real with one another, to build that relationship time. Do you take that time, dads and moms, with your kids? Not many years and they're gone. What have you contributed? What have you done? What have you given? What have you done with the time? time for ministry the gifts that God's given you you know you're sitting here this morning and there's this thing you're always going to do the thing you're always planning on doing someday maybe it's nothing more for some of you than that person you live next door to and you love them and you have coffee with them and in your mind over and over and over again one of these days I'm going to share with them one of these days I'm going to tell them about Christ one of these days I'm going to tell them about the most important thing in my life tomorrow and again there are those special times that we come to church and I am not so naive as to believe that every time we come to this place that God moves on our hearts I don't think he does there's times when everything is right and God is at the center of our lives and it just doesn't move us terribly and that's fine. But there are those times. There are those special times because of your need and maybe your pain and sometimes, I know you've experienced this, it isn't even in connection with anything the pastor is saying or what's being sung. God is just dealing with you. And sometimes it's in the quietness of your own heart at home and God's dealing with you about same thing, your bitterness and your anger and your strife and your clamor. and the invitation is given and I don't mean just coming forward but God is moving in you and he's saying this deal with it now dealing with it now is what it means to redeem time because I do not think that those times when God moves in me to change come every day they do not make the most of those times when he moves in you respond to him. Seize that opportunity to grow. Seize that opportunity to change. When are you going to tell that friend of yours that you're sorry? I related to this because there's times in my life when I'll just be sitting all by myself, and this is real practical for you. I'll just be sitting all by myself and maybe it's because I'm quiet and I've got the time to think. And all of a sudden the Lord will just put a thought in my mind and I'll think about one of you. Really, one of you who are serving in our church or I could tell they were a little discouraged the other day and I just wondered how they were doing it. And in my mind I said, boy, you ought to call them up and tell them you love them and encourage them and write them a little note. And you know what I do? Tomorrow, later. You know what happens? I don't do it tomorrow. I don't do it later. Redeem the time. Wisdom redeems the time. Wisdom does it now. When am I going to be able to tell you I'm sorry? When am I going to be able to just put my arm around and say, hey, I love you. I really appreciate you. Redeem the time. Do it now. When are you going to get your priorities straight? My heart was real heavy on this one. I got a friend who's telling me all the time and always under the sense of conviction, well, I'm going to get my priorities straight one of these days. It's always that. One of these days. I know I got to do it. I know I'm wrong. Someday. You don't have someday. when are you going to look into the face of the Savior and say I want to be clean I no longer want to walk as the unwise I want to walk as wise I want to know God I want to know Christ I want to have the life of Christ living in me when are you gonna do it when are you gonna break when are you gonna obey when are you gonna confess when are you gonna receive now is the expected time now redeem the time make the most of your time in your attitude in your ministry in your relationships when are you going to take care of them make the most of them because the days are evil you don't have forever let's pray just with your eyes closed and your heads bowed I am constantly amazed at how the spirit of God works in people's hearts again as I've already said the way he works is often totally disconnected from what is being said from the pulpit and i don't know how god is working in some of your hearts right now i only know this dear friend if he's dealing with you about something make the most of the opportunity seize it today now i'm going to ask john if he would come and we're going to stand and sing and as we do i want you to know that the invitation is open if you need to come and meet with me or meet with the Lord here and pray you do that you don't need to do that you can let God deal with you concerning things you need to do by going to that friend or dealing with him right where you're at I want you to know the invitation is open let's pray as we close Father be teaching us those areas in our lives that need to be seized today that need to be changed now that we can walk not as unwise but as wise Amen Thank you.
