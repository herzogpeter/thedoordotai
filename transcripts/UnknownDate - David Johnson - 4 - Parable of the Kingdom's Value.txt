Children, you are dismissed to Children's Church. Again, those who might be visiting, we have a Children's Church for our children through age grade 6, and they will hear the same sermon that you're going to hear. The rest of you turn to Matthew chapter 13, verse 44. I started this business to take it off my jacket last week and I like it. So there. I figured when I was thinking down there, when most of you go to work and you start to work, you roll up your sleeves. So this is okay. This is what you do. We are dealing these weeks, as you know if you've been with us, with vital aspects of the kingdom and the kingdom truth as they are revealed through parables. In chapter 13, we have what is called the parables of Jesus. The first parable we dealt with was the parable of the sower. And in the parable of the sower, we had revealed to us the different kinds of soils that were the different responses of men's hearts to the word of the kingdom. Last week, we dealt with another parable, three of them exactly. The first was the parable of the wheat and the tares, which was designed by Jesus, First of all, to straighten out the theology of the disciples. Remember that? They had a theology that the kingdom of God, when the Messiah came, was going to be brought by the Messiah, and the kingdom, though, was going to come in its fullness. And when the kingdom came and Jesus brought it, there would be no more sin, no more pain, no more death, no more disease, and it would be here in its fullness, and the lion would lie down with the lamb. And they were right that the kingdom was coming, and they were right that Jesus was the king, but the expression of the kingdom that they were going to live in was not accurate. And so Jesus said, you need to know some things. It is absolutely true that the kingdom has come. And I'm going to plant the kingdom in you, and then I'm going to plant you in the world, and you're the wheat. But the problem is this. In the time that you're living, and in the time that you're going to need to minister, Satan is going to oversow everything that God does, everything that I do. And so it is. You can't have this view of the kingdom that there's not going to be any struggle or any pain. There's going to be tears all around you, things that the enemy has sown. And some of you are going to feel real lonely. You're going to feel like one little solitary stalk of wheat surrounded by tares. And it's discouraging and it's scary. And sometimes you're going to feel real insignificant. But there's something else you need to know. Not only is the kingdom of God like wheat and tares and you're the wheat, but the kingdom of God is also like a mustard seed. And it starts out real insignificant in the smallest of all seeds. And that's what you're like. But what you need to know is like the mustard seed. The kingdom of God grows and grows and grows and grows. and before you know it, birds can come and take their shelter in you. And nothing can stop your growth. It's like leaven. You get permeated. You get placed into the world and you permeate that world. And so be encouraged. There is going to be struggle and there is going to be a constant conflict with what the enemy has done. But you have life and it's like a seed and it grows and it's like leaven and it permeates. And one day, some exciting things are going to happen. Remember that? One day, the harvest is going to come and I'm going to bring that whole mess that Satan has made of the world and we're going to separate and bind that which is born of Satan and burn it. And we're going to gather all that is born of God and barn it. And then there's going to be a tremendous celebration in verse 43. The righteous are going to shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father. That was last week. Today we deal with another parable too again. Verse 44 through 46. dealing with the incomparable value of the kingdom. And what happens when people see the kingdom, recognize it as incomparable in terms of its treasure and its value, how it is that they respond. Look at it, verse 44. The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and from joy over what he found, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls, And upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought the pearl. Let's pray as we begin. Father God, every time we deal with kingdom truth, I am struck how in the flesh we are inadequate to express the wonder of it. And even the parable today is expressing some of the reality that the power of the kingdom and the reality of the kingdom is not something we always see on the surface. So I pray, God, that in the name of Jesus, under the surface, where the kingdom does its work, I pray that your kingdom would be doing its work and your spirit would be moving in our hearts. Create in our hearts and do in our spirits what you need to do relative to this text. I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. We're going to break the text down real simply the way we have been. Remember, a definition of a parable is simply where Jesus takes something that is physical and visible, like a sower and a seed and a mustard seed, and now somebody who's finding a treasure in a field, and then he lays it alongside something spiritual. He extends the physical into the spiritual so that we understand some deep spiritual truth. The first thing we're going to do is tell the physical story. Then we're going to make the spiritual application. Let's look at the story. There are two. The first is that of a treasure hidden in a field. As usual, Jesus, in verse 44, is taking a common occurrence, a simple story to teach deep spiritual truth. Now, while this event, someone finding a treasure in a field, was a relatively common thing in Palestine, it is not a relatively common thing for us. We don't hear stories very often of people going through a field finding treasure. The closest thing I could come up with were these guys that I see from time to time on beaches or in parks with metal detectors. You ever see these guys? I don't know what they're doing. I don't know what they're looking for. Is this how they make their living? Somebody has to, you know, enlighten me on this whole thing. That's the closest I could come. The thing about this guy, though, he wasn't even like a guy with a metal detector because he wasn't looking for any kind of treasure. He was just in a field. We don't even know what he was doing. But let me give you some background relative to how this thing could have happened. In Palestine, and in that day, they didn't have banks the way we do now. They didn't have depositories where people would put their money. And so it is that people, in order to save their money and protect their goods, they would bury them in the ground. Matthew 25 tells the story of the parable of the talents. Remember that? And he gave to three different people different measures of talents. Two of them invested it and got a greater yield. One of them buried it in the ground. He was the one who was unwise. But the point I'm telling you is that it was a common thing to take things you valued and protect them by putting them into the bank of the ground. the historian trench reports that men of wealth divided their wealth in the ground into three different parts resources for daily business were put in one kind of hole where nobody knew it was resources that were precious stones that you would use in case you had to flee quickly were put in another place and then savings your little savings account for your retirement was put in another place and so if somebody with some measure of wealth would not only have his wealth in the ground, but it would be spread out. Another thing that adds to this whole picture here of how this could happen was this, that in Palestine, you've got a place that was just wrought with war. War was always happening. There were wars and rumors of wars happening all the time. When there would be a rumor of war or war, even poor people would take the resources that they had and bury them in the ground. Guess what happens, though, when wars happen? The enemy does come. Sometimes I would be killed, or sometimes I would be taken into captivity into Babylon or Assyria. So what happens to my treasure. Who knows? It just stays there. Lost forever. Josephus, the historian, writes that the ground of Palestine was dotted with buried and forgotten treasure. With that in mind, picture the story now. This guy's just walking through the field. He might be working in the field, but we don't even know that. He's minding his own business, and then he finds treasure. Three things to note real quickly about this guy. Number one, he was not looking for it when he found it. Number two, When he did find it, he recognized the value of it. And number three, when he saw the value of it, he was willingly and joyfully about the business of selling everything that he thought up to that point as being precious to get this, which surpassed whatever he ever thought was precious before. Look at the other story. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls. Right off the bat, I know the difference in the story. In the first one, he's not looking for anything. He's surprised by joy. It just comes on him. He might not be looking at all for treasure. This guy is about the business of seeking treasure. He is a merchant, it says in this passage in verse 45. A merchant who is scouring for fine things. And he's scouring for finer things. And what it means is that he's got some fine things. He's got some things that satisfy. He's got some things that the world says you've got to have. pearls. But the problem is this, no matter what kind of pearls he's got, no matter what kind of treasure he possesses, he's never satisfied with what he's got. He needs more and more and more. He's searching for more, and then he finds one that is so valuable he is willing to sell everything else he's got. All the other little pearls that he treasured so tremendously to get this one. Pearls in that day were equivalent to what we would today look at as in a diamond. The Talmud says that pearls were beyond price. The Egyptians worshipped pearls. In the book of Revelation, a human effort, I think inspired by God though, but in terms of things that they valued, in terms of trying to picture heaven, the writer says that the gates of heaven are going to be pearls. One great big huge pearl is going to be the portal and the pillars of heaven. The point is this. There would be nothing more precious than a pearl. People in those days would go to unbelievable lengths to get a pearl. They would risk their very lives. Pearls in those days and in that region were available in the Red Sea. They could be found in the Indian Ocean and in the Persian Gulf. And people didn't have the modern apparatus that they have today to go and dive the way they do. And so what they would do was they would tie rocks to their bodies so they could get down to the bottom real fast, get what they wanted, and then come up. And I think you can probably imagine the danger of that. You don't always know how deep the water is. The rocks take you deeper than you want to go. You don't have time to get up. It smashes your lungs. It explodes your lungs. I don't know what the water does. You're in bad shape. Either way. No matter what the danger, they kept going and going and going and digging and digging and looking for something of value and hoping against hope that maybe one day I'm going to find a pearl that is going to be so precious and so valuable that I can rest from all my diving and all my striving, and I can retire, and I can be satisfied, and I can find peace. But they never do, so they keep going. But this guy did find one. But the key to the stories, you know, is that that's what the kingdom is like. That's what the kingdom is like. People who are searching for pearls, but they never satisfy, and then they find the treasure. And then they're willing to sell everything they've got to find the treasure. The time is now to go to number two and lay alongside the physical story to the spiritual truth. The kingdom of God is like, let's reveal the kingdom comparison. The kingdom of God, and here's your outline, is four things. The kingdom of God is, number one, a treasure. Number two, it is a treasure that is hidden. Number three is it is a treasure that is hidden, but it is found. And number four, when that treasure is found and recognized as valuable, it is secured, it is seized, it is purchased. something is generated in the heart of the man or a woman that says, whatever it was that I used to value pales in comparison to the surpassing value of this incredible treasure that is the kingdom. What is the kingdom? It is the treasure. Let's look at that first. It is the treasure of infinite value, priceless beyond imagination, worthy to be worshiped. I want to give you the picture that I've got in my mind as we look at the treasure just for a few moments. The treasure is the kingdom. That's pretty obvious. But as I was studying, something came to me, and I don't know if it was a word or God just gave this to me, but it's a picture I've got, and I think it'll help you see it. What I see is a treasure chest. A treasure chest. I'm talking about Long John Silver type treasure chest. Okay? Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Pepsi type deal. And the treasure chest, the chest itself in my mind's eye, that's the kingdom. And everything that is in it are all the little doodads that come along with the kingdom. All of the jewels, all of the precious stones, all of the valuable things. And I come to this treasure chest, just like this guy in the field, and I can't believe it. It's incredible. I'm wondering what's in it. And so I open it up, and the very first thing I see, before I see anything else, there is something that catches my eye right off the bat. There is something that shines brighter, it shines fair, it shines purer than all the other angels and all the other jewels in this. It's the only thing I see. It's Jesus right on the top. I see this incredible thing. It covers everything else that's in it. It's Jesus. And again, he shines brighter and fair and pure than everything else. And ever since I found this treasure, and ever since you found the treasure, and you found Jesus, Jesus is the sweetest name you know. And he's our song, and he's our source, and he's our treasure. And the glory is as he kind of lies on the top of this incredible treasure chest, He made all the other treasure possible. But I don't even see any of the other treasure because he's just right on top. Incredible jewel. And I look at that thing and I examine that nugget and I realize that in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins. And in him the fullness of the Godhead dwells in a bodily form. And in him I have been made complete. And in him there is grace. And in him there is mercy. And in him there is redemption. And in him there is regeneration. and some of you found it the way this guy found it you just stumbled across it and some of you found it because you were searching for it but the point is this you open up the treasure chest and right on top is jesus and you take out that little ruby and you look at that thing and then you put it off to the side and then you realize there's more there's all sorts of other things and they're pouring off the sides you see not only is there jesus but because of jesus there's access to the father galatians 5 hebrews 4 no fear no hesitation no shame i can come right into the presence of god not only that there's another nugget there and there's a whole string of pearls and it's called adoption as sons and i pick that up and i look at it and i go because of jesus i'm adopted as a son not only that there's this one little nugget on there that says this before the foundation of the world david johnson you were chosen before god made the world he did something more important than making the world. He chose you. What a treasure. This is incredible. I've got access to the Father. I'm adopted as a son before the foundation of the world. I've got the indwelling spirit. That's in there too. John 14. I'm not only going to be with you, I'm going to be in you. Not only do I have the indwelling spirit as the treasure, but I've got the filling of the spirit, Ephesians 5. He's going to permeate me. He's going to dominate me. He's going to bear me along by the wind of his spirit. Not only the filling of his spirit, but the empowering of his spirit. that's in there too. Acts chapter 1, you're going to receive power, not only the empowering of the Spirit, but the gifts of the Spirit. They're just falling all over the place, and I see in their knowledge and wisdom and prophecy and healing and incredible. Not only the gifts of the Spirit, but then there's the body of Christ. That's in the treasure too, and I've been placed by the Spirit into the body, and not only the body of Christ, but the work of Christ. I've been placed into the body, and the body has been given a call to storm the gates of hell, and the gates of hell will not prevail. And not only the work of Christ, but the word of God, this precious pearl right here is in the treasure, so that I can actually know the mind of God and know the heart of God and discover who he is by him speaking to me through this. That's the treasure. And that's what the kingdom of God's like. The kingdom of God's like a treasure, but it's a hidden treasure. It's a hidden treasure. Point number two. The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden. It is not superficially observed. If you try to see the kingdom on the surface, you're not going to see it. You're going to have to get underneath. The kingdom of God is something that is going on underneath. And because it is going on underneath and it is not always apparent with a superficial view of the field, okay, picture the metaphor again. You're looking at the field. The field could be the world. The field could be a church. The field could be your family. The field could be somebody's life you're concerned about. Anything. Look at the world. The field. Just looking at the field as you're walking outside when you leave and you look at the world, the kingdom is not apparent there. You're going to have to look underneath. Even here, the kingdom of God on the surface is not apparent. The real working of the kingdom is underneath. Some people never see it. In 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 it says the natural man receives not the things of the spirit. Why? Well, they're foolishness to him. Why? He can't understand them. Why? Because spiritual things, kingdom things, are put together with spiritual eyes. They are spiritually appraised. And spiritual eyes give you an ability to look past what is on the surface, get underneath and see the work of God. It's a treasure. There's grace. There's healing. There's forgiveness. There's Jesus. Some people look right at it and they miss it. Why? Because it's hidden. It's underneath. It's underneath the surface. Some people spend their whole lives playing with the rocks and playing with the dust on top of the soil and they never go underneath and find a treasure. Never, ever do it. Some people are looking right at it. The religious Pharisees, we've spent months talking about how God came in the flesh in the form of Jesus, did what he did in front of them, spoke the message of the kingdom, did the work of the kingdom, and no matter what he said and no matter what he did, they said, this is not from God. This is not a treasure. We value this not one bit. Matthew 13, verse 14 speaks of people who don't ever hear the value or see the value of the treasure. They keep on hearing, but they don't understand. They keep on seeing, but they never perceive, for their hearts have become dull. The picture here of a hidden treasure that some people are right on top of, and some people hold in their hands, but they discard it, would be like a pearl merchant who's got the most valuable pearl that he's ever had in his possession, in his possession. But maybe it's covered with dirt, and it's not coming the way he thought it was going to come, and it didn't come with a steeple and all that other stuff. And so, without understanding the value of what he had, he just throws it away, and it's off in a corner, and he keeps on groveling with the garbage that he's got. And he threw away the most priceless thing. One writer put it this way, Hidden under the form of a man, under the privacy and poverty of a Nazarene, was the fullness of the Godhead. The wise, prudent, arrogant, and self-righteous couldn't see it, and they threw it away. The kingdom of God is a treasure, but it's a treasure that is hidden. And it's not hidden like you can't find it. It is just underneath the surface. You're going to have to look past what is obvious. You're going to have to look past what is physical to find out what the kingdom's all about. Now, this parable speaks clearly of people who are coming into the kingdom, who discover the treasure of salvation. But you need to know as well that as believers, we need to apply this principle and see it as a kingdom principle that goes across the board. I think that if we're going to function effectively in ministry, we need to understand that the kingdom dynamic and the working of God among his people, even at Church of the Open Door, is something that is taking place. The real power of God is underneath the surface. You're not always going to see it if you just look on the surface stuff. That is a kingdom principle. The real work of the kingdom that has eternal significance is not always, in fact, it's hardly ever what you see on the surface. It's underneath. This is very hard to explain. In fact, I think it is a hard thing to explain because it is underneath. It's almost something that has to resonate in your heart, and you need to kind of just go, yeah, I kind of get that. But physically, the field, I think, if we were to stick with this metaphor here, this parable, the field are the things I see, okay? That's the field he's walking through, my everyday life, my job, my career, our church. I just kind of go, and we see what we see, and we kind of deal with our life. And I go to my neighbor's house, and I see physically what I see, somebody who's kind of nice, somebody who's kind of mean. Whatever. The kingdom of God is right underneath that. It's right underneath that. This is a bizarre concept. I don't, I hate it when I'm trying to deal with these weird things and I don't get them yet. You know? But I was running the other day. I'm running through and I'm dealing with this concept how the kingdom's underneath. And I was looking at trees and the birds and the flowers and I'm going, you know, the kingdom is not apparent here on the surface. All I see is trees and birds and flowers. Now take the kingdom principle, Dave. Look underneath that. God made it all. I just took one little step, and now you do see it. The kingdom is visible. It is visible, but you're going to have to take one step down to see it. In the church, what do you see? You see a dingy auditorium. You see a synthesizer. A drum set was supposed to be here for my sermon. It's right in the notes now. People singing. You hear me screaming. you sing a song you ever sing a song and you just love the song you start to weep and you worship God and you go I love that song I hope we sing that song next week and we sing it next week and you go what was that song I thought that was a good song why is that because the song is not the kingdom something was going on underneath right underneath is the life that's where the life is. That's where the kingdom is. The kingdom isn't the words you say when you come into the kingdom and receive Jesus as your Savior. You say the magic words. I believe that Jesus is God. I believe he died for the sins of the world. I confess my sin. Good. You said the magic words. You're saved. Baloney. Why is that? Because the kingdom's underneath, right? The kingdom's in your heart. The kingdom is something you don't see on the surface, but you can see it when you take one step down. And somebody who doesn't even say the right words never says the words, but his heart says, why, my only hope is you for salvation, for sanctification, for service. I receive you. Never says those words, but that's what their heart is singing. Redeemed right now. Why is that? The kingdoms underneath. That's why it's one step under. I'll tell you what, we better know that in ministry. It would scare the daylights out of me if I was dealing with leadership who didn't understand this principle, and all of our ministry was constantly being assessed on the external things we see. Wouldn't that be a scary thing? Ministry and success and failure of ministry is constantly, the bottom line is money, size, how slick everything is. I got a word for you. You're never going to do the kingdom that way. The kingdom is underneath all that. The kingdom is underneath all that. I can't take it you agree with that. I got a buzz here. Am I doing something wrong? Okay. Okay. It's under the surface. It's spirit. It's heart. The kingdom is a treasure. It's Jesus and all the gifts that come along with that. But it's hidden. It's underneath the surface. It's a treasure that is hidden. is found in this thing though and this is exciting to me it's a treasure that is hidden that is found verse 44 says it's a treasure which a man found verse 46 it's a treasure and upon finding it it's one that's found by two people the first one as i told you before wasn't looking for it and this just bless my heart like crazy i hope it does you it's a gift receive this as a gift for some of you here's a guy or a gal just going through his or her life not a noble seeker there is some sense of nobility, isn't there? You know, you have a sense, you know, I really know as a young child, I sought God. Great. Bless you. We're going to talk about you in a minute. But this guy isn't like that. He's not a noble seeker. In fact, he may be a cynical rejecter moving through this field, eking out an existence. You know, I hear people talk about a treasure. I'll give you a treasure. I'm just trying to eat and find something to live for. I don't have anything. A cynical rejecter he might have even been. We don't know that. But I have a feeling that many of you in this very room could give the kind of testimony that this guy could give. And you could say this, you know, as I think about it and I consider the way I came to know Jesus as my Savior, and it really became real. I remember the time it happened and the events that surrounded it. And one of the things I know is that I was not seeking him. He sought me. And I was just looking to get sober. Remember that? Remember that? Your life was a mess and I wasn't looking for God. I just wanted to get sober. The problem is this. In the process of that whole thing, I found a treasure. I was just trying to make my life work. Just walking through the field. I wasn't looking for God at all. I was just trying to make my life work. And I found a treasure in the middle of that. And my marriage was breaking up, and I was just working on my marriage, and I found a treasure. I found God in the middle of that whole thing. And I was just trying to be a better dad. It wasn't even a negative thing. I thought a good dad ought to take his kids to church, So I came to church, and I just wanted a little religion, and I found a treasure. Some might recount in your life, far from even being kind of passive and benign, not looking, in a state of absolute rebellion against God, and God grabbed you by the neck and threw you down on the ground and said, you belong to me, boy. And it doesn't fit with some of our real noble views of how we come to God. and where I'm a seeker, I'm a seeker. And if you have trouble believing that God can just invade someone's life and say, come here, you need to hear the testimony of the Apostle Paul because he would give that kind of testimony. Paul had declared war on God. He was not someone dissatisfied with his life. He loved his life. He was proud of what he did. He was proud of who he was. He was on a horse riding to Damascus. And in the middle of his war on God, God slapped him upside the head, picked him up off the horse, whapped him down on the ground, as John Madden would say. He whapped him. And in the middle of all that, Paul found a treasure. Paul was real big on grace, wasn't he? One of the reasons he was big on grace was because he had an overwhelming sense of how he didn't deserve the grace of God. He saw himself as a murderer. I think all his life he lived with the image of holding Stephen's coat when Stephen was stoned. But I also think one of the reasons Paul was real big on grace was that not only did he know he didn't deserve the grace of God, but he got it. He couldn't even claim nobility in seeking for the grace of God. He didn't seek God. God sought him. That's amazing grace. That is amazing grace. There was a woman at the well who was surprised by joy. she came down, and if she was, she came down to a well, and she met with Jesus, and if she was here this morning, and we gave her the pulpit, she would tell a story like this, you know what, all I wanted was a drink of water, I wasn't looking for a treasure, I just wanted a drink of water, I found a treasure, and I got, I got more than a drink, I got a bucket, I got more than a bucket, I got a stream, I got more than a stream, I got a river of life flowing out of me, living water, just walking through the field, kind of doing their thing, living their life. That's amazing grace. Charles Spurgeon tells the same kind of story. Great preacher. Incredible impact on the kingdom of God. At 18 years of age, he had been raised in a Christian home, had basically rejected the whole thing. His only attendance of church was times to kind of tip his hat to it. So he went at Easter and New Year's. He went on one Easter, or New Year's rather, and he was looking for a church to go to and he saw one, so he went. The pastor wasn't there that Sunday because of a snowstorm. They couldn't get it. And so some usher started preaching. He was described later by Spurgeon as the stupidest man he'd ever heard. I'm quoting him. He just kept saying over and over, you need to look at Jesus, you need to look at Jesus. And Spurgeon's testimony goes just like this. I wasn't looking for God. I wasn't looking for anything. I was just walking through the field, and I found a treasure. I didn't seek him, he sought me. That's amazing grace. I can tell you that in my life, the most significant thing in my life at 18 years of age, when I was walking away from God, this overwhelming sense, absolutely no seeking in me of him at all, God came and tapped me on the shoulder, whacked me down on the ground and said, you belong to me, boy. He sought me. That's amazing grace. Some of you can tell that same kind of testimony. And then there's the seeker, the one who is looking for a pearl of great price. He's found some things, he has some things, and they really are valuable. He might be a real moral person, lots of virtue, good things in his life, a nice family. He's the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 8. The Ethiopian eunuch was a Jewish proselyte. He was a God-seeker. He came hard after God, and he sought him, and he had been in Jerusalem to worship God, and now he was on his way back home, on his way to Gaza. And the Spirit of God ministered to Philip to go and be with this Ethiopian. And he found the Ethiopian reading out of the book of Isaiah because he really had a heart for God. And he was reading it, but he didn't understand one word of it. And Philip came up to him, and using the Scripture, Acts 8 says, he reasoned with him, and out of Isaiah, he then began to turn it from Isaiah, and he started to preach Christ. And this guy who was seeking God then found a treasure. He found Jesus. Same thing happened with Cornelius in Acts chapter 10, verse 2. He was a man of God. It's in this thing. He was a man of God. Sought hard after God. I rebuke you. It says this. Now Cornelius gave many alms to the people and prayed to God continually. And what happened was this. He didn't know Jesus, though he hadn't discovered the treasure, but he was a seeker. And so God intervened and he gave Peter an incredible vision. He also gave Cornelius an incredible vision. And they came together and Peter shared with him the grace of God, the message of the kingdom, the identity of Jesus. And Cornelius fell on his face and went away glad he found a treasure. I want to tell you something else, though, even about the seeker. You probably already picked it up. Even in the life of the seeker, if God hadn't revealed it, if God hadn't come, if God hadn't come to him, the seeker would have never found. So even in the life of a seeker, if you're sitting here and you really have a sense that all your life you sought God, you need to know something else, that the amazing grace of God is this, that even while you sought him, he sought you too. And he came to you, he came to them. The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure. it's like a hidden treasure it's underneath the surface it's like a hidden treasure that can be found and then point number four it is a hidden treasure that when it is found it's an amazing thing and by the way i want to even say this carefully it's as if jesus is saying disciples here's what it's going to look like when people who discover the kingdom and they see it as valuable not everybody's going to see it as valuable but the ones who see it as valuable you're going to see this weird dynamic in their life they're going to start forsaking everything in their life that they used to think precious to seek the one thing that is now. You're just going to see that. And by the way, if you don't see that exchange happening, you're probably not dealing with somebody who's discovered the treasure because it is joyfully that they do that. The things I used to think were valuable, the things I held dear, the things that were life to me aren't life to me anymore. And joyfully, I begin to sell everything I had. Some people, it is true, discover the treasure, recognize its value, they see its worth, they affirm it as treasure, but they view it from a distance. And you need to know that this speaks to a way in which as people entering the kingdom need to buy the kingdom for themselves. They need to seize it and secure it for themselves. Some people see the treasure, even say, yeah, that's really a neat thing. But they never seize it for themselves. They have a theology, and I think some evangelicals have this kind of problem. They have a theology that says, as long as you say, yes, that is indeed the treasure. Yes, Jesus is God. Yes, I need to receive him. And if you say that, you've got it. As long as you say, yes, that's the treasure, you have the treasure. No breathless gratitude. One of the marks of people who have discovered the treasure and see its value is that they start forsaking gladly the things that used to give them life. that isn't life. I see that as rubbish. Paul said those exact words. Philippians chapter 3. Paul is a guy who had money in the bank as far as things that he could get his life from. Circumcised the eighth day of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, as to law of Pharisee, what more can I say? As to zeal, a persecutor of the church, as to righteousness which comes in the law found blameless. I did it right. That was money in the bank for him. That was where he got his value. What is it for you? I don't know. as to the law, a member of the Baptist church, I don't know, whatever. But something happened. I found another treasure. The treasure is Jesus. But whatever things were gained to me, those things I valued, those pearls that were in my treasure, those things now I count as loss. I see them as a negative thing for the sake of Christ, more than just loss. I count all things lost in the view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. That is exactly the language of this parable. I've got a whole bunch of pearls, but joyfully I go and sell everything I've got to get this one. The surpassing value of knowing Christ for whom I would suffer the loss of all things and count them rubbish in order that I may gain Christ. Picture Paul for a minute. Paul, here's the treasure. It's grace, it's forgiveness, it's healing, it's an indwelling spirit. It's an empowering spirit. It's a kingdom life. It's incredible. You can be made clean. Leave your Phariseeism. Leave your religiosity. Leave your external power and all your fleshy striving. And Paul would look at you and go, is this a trick question? That's garbage compared to that. This strikes at something, again, I don't know if I can say this well, but people who really do see the treasure, you don't got to beg them to be committed. Oh, please act like Jesus is really what you like. I'm not going to do that. If you have discovered the treasure, if you have looked underneath, the fact is this, the ones who have seen it, joyfully forsake to come. Isaiah 55.1 says this come everyone who thirsts come to the waters and you who have no money come buy and eat come buy wine and milk without money and without cost there's a couple things in there that I want you to notice one is it's wonderful news if you're thirsty come and drink and it doesn't cost but two times in there it says buy did you notice that it says come and buy it's without money you don't you buy this and without cost you buy this so isn't your works that gets this treasure and it isn't your money that gets this treasure, but twice it says come and buy it. Buy it. Purchase it for yourself. What is the cost of this treasure? Everything. Everything. Everything that I am and everything that I have for everything that he is and everything that he has. And that looks like a good deal to me. See? If you see the treasure, that's a good deal. but see there was a scribe one day who came to Jesus in Matthew 8 and he said Jesus I would follow you anywhere I really like this treasure this looks like good stuff and Jesus said great come on but foxes have holes and birds have nests and the son of man doesn't have a place to lay his head and if you follow me you might not have a whole lot of comfort you see what it's going to cost you scribe is comfort and the scribe said no deal no deal no deal I'm not going to pay that price So I'm going to keep my comfort, and you can keep the treasure. And there wasn't a transaction made, and he got left on the shore, and eternal life left him behind. And there was another guy who came up to Jesus in Matthew 8, 21, a disciple, a follower of Jesus, and said, I will follow you anywhere. And Jesus said, well, then come. And he said, well, I've got to bury my father first. Remember that one? Only his father wasn't dead. Remember that? It wasn't like there was a funeral going to happen. His father wasn't dead yet. And what he was speaking of was there. I'll follow you, and I'll kind of move into this whole new thing, and I'll sell all my pearls to follow you and get this one pearl, but I've got to get my inheritance first. And when I'm absolutely secure, then I'll make these kind of major commitments. And Jesus said, basically, bye-bye, no deal, no deal. What's it going to cost? It's going to cost your comfort. It's going to cost your security. But the irony is this. If you really understand the treasure, they made a bad deal because they hung on to a comfort that wouldn't comfort, and they hung on to a security that wasn't secure for a comfort that was eternally comforting and a security that was eternally secure. and there was another one who came in Luke 9 and says I would follow you anywhere too but let me first go tell my mommy and my daddy and make sure they're okay with me and Jesus said if you put your hand in the plow and look back you're not fit you don't get it guys what you need to do is also forsake public opinion you're going to have to forget about what people think no deal that person said I'd rather have people like me than have the treasure here's what the kingdom looks like it looks like people who when they see the treasure say comfort you mean comfort is this a trick question you bet i'll give up comfort to follow that security is this again is this a trick question i'd let go of security to get that treasure because that is security and that is comfort. And people's opinion, it says in Mark 9 or 8 or wherever that was, don't fear men who kill the body, fear God. Get your fear right. More than anything, I want to treasure. I want to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering and the surpassing value of knowing Christ. I count those things rubbish. That is the voice of a kingdom heart. And Jesus is saying, so do those. Force it. I'm not going to tell you to do anything. I'm telling you descriptively, people who discover the treasure, do that. That's just the way it is. People who are not willing to do that, no deal. No deal. For the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, I suffer the loss of all things and count them rubbish in order that I may gain Christ. See, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field which a man found and hid. And from joy over it, he goes and sells all that he has to buy the field. This is life. This is all there is. I would die for that. Let's pray. Let's stand as we close. Father there are some here this morning who've never for the first time even received a treasure for salvation and I'm aware that words of men cannot make people see they can't make them look underneath but we've heard a word here today that even people who aren't seeking you, God seeks them. And in the name of Jesus, I ask the power of your spirit to be released among us for salvation. I pray, God, that you would move on people's hearts, that you would reveal to their minds and to their eyes the surpassing value of knowing Christ. Even without understanding all the nuances and all the phrases and all the stuff, that they would see the treasure right now and they would come and get it. I pray for other people who we don't really know where they are we would like to say yeah they're Christians and yeah they've received the treasure but it's like they're living with their foot in the treasure and their foot somewhere else too and God they're of most men most miserable Father I pray number one that you give them a view of the treasure so they can leave the death of their fleshly security and comfort in people's opinion and wallow in the wonder of your kingdom truth. Do your work among us. Give your gifts to your body. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
