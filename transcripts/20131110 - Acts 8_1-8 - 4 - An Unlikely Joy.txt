Music On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him, but Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison. Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there. When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he performed, they all paid close attention to what he said. For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. So there was great joy in that city. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Let's pray as we dive into Acts chapter 8. God, thank you so much that you move and live and breathe even right here in November of 2013. So I pray today that you would conceive something in us that gives birth to something very, very good. That you would conceive something in us as a community of people. And then in due time that we would give birth to something really, really good. Amen? All right. Well, I'm preaching today, people. I mean, that's just the deal. I mean, you can already tell. So Dave has been doing, I think, just a breathtakingly beautiful job of diving into Acts chapter 7, in particular, this gruesome and gritty moment where Stephen, one of the early church's greatest minds is taken out way before he should have been taken out. And he gets into an argument with some of the religious leaders of the day, and we read that he's so persuasive that they can't even keep up with him. He nails them to the wall. He exposes the fact that they're just as stick neft, stick neft, stiff necked as the ancestors that came before them. And they are so incensed by this that they do what people do when religious leaders and those who are in power get their power upended. They drove Stephen to the edge of a cliff, threw him off, and then started piling stones on top of him. And do you remember when Dave said they kept on going, meaning they were filled with anger, gnashing their teeth at him. And then we saw the vision that Stephen got, and Dave called it grace for your dying day. Remember this? That when Stephen was dying, he looked up and he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father. And he was seated. To be seated means the work is done. When Jesus went to the cross, went to hell, came back, and was resurrected and ascended to the Father, that meant the work of salvation is done. It's finished. So he sat down at the right hand of the Father. But in this moment, Stephen looks up and sees him standing up as if to say, on this, your darkest day, when you are not gonna be rescued, what you need to know, Stephen, is that I will accompany you through, all the way through. You're gonna die today, Stephen, but you're not gonna die alone. And you're gonna fall asleep today, Stephen, but you're going to wake up more alive than you ever have been. And so the picture that Stephen gets, the grace for the dying day, is not just for Stephen, Dave told us. He saw it so that we could see it too, so that when you know when your loved ones go through that day, and many of you, as we paused last week in November, and Vicki took us through a beautiful service, wasn't that beautiful last week? where we could remember those who we have lost. Grace for our dying day means that we can have confidence that Jesus stood up for those who have gone before us, amen, and said, I'm gonna anoint you for this so that you are not alone. I'm gonna take you all the way to my Father's arms. Grace for your dying day. The church needs that picture. A couple weeks ago, Dave looked at John, a vision that John got in Revelation 1. And we called it hope for those who remain. And this is what John was languishing on the Isle of Patmos, an old man at this point. He was discouraged. He was disappointed. The money of his life had been spent, and he was going to end up dying on Patmos. And you can imagine he was thinking back to the times that, you know, Jesus and the rest of the disciples were ministering to people and healing people and seeing people come to faith in Christ and how exciting and exhilarating that was. And even the early days of the church, the ups and downs, the best of times, the worst of times, but at least it was life. And now he was in exile on Patmos, discouraged and dying. And he saw a picture, a picture for those who would go on suffering, a picture in order to bring hope. And that picture was Jesus standing in the middle, remember this, And then this Jesus had white hair signifying wisdom, remember that? And blazing eyes signifying the fact that he can see what we can't see. There is a door and it's open. There is a throne and it's occupied. There is a lamb. standing as if to have been slain, but no, he has been risen again, and he holds the keys to hell and death, and he is the alpha and the omega. So lift your head up, church, in your suffering. You are not suffering alone. Jesus is right in the middle of it with you. Hope for those who remain. And for many of us, I remember sitting right back there during that message thinking, I need to hear that. This message is for me, and I don't think I was the only one thinking that in that moment. Amen? Hope for those who remain. Hope for those who have to go through a hard thing. Jesus is standing right in the middle with you, saying, I got my eyes on you. You're not alone. And that's good news for us right here in 2013. It's also very good news for the early church. Because on the day after, they mourned the death of Stephen, whom they loved. This is what happens. We read in Acts chapter 8, verse 3, But Saul, who later on became, of course, Paul, but back when he was Saul, he was one of the best and brightest of the religious leaders of the day, and he was intent on putting to death the church. Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison. So if it wasn't enough that Stephen died and they had to mourn that, Saul was now intent on getting the rest of them too. Can you imagine that? Men and women in prison. To which I say, what happens to the kids, right? In these little houses in Jerusalem. And the word to destroy, it can be translated persecuted. It can be translated ravaged. It's diagmos. It means to make, to run, or flee. to put to flight. It means to drive away. Have you ever been driven away out of fear? Have you ever been driven away because someone that had more power than you had said, you're not staying here, not on my watch, and if you're gonna stay here, I'm taking you to prison. Has that ever happened to you in any way, shape, or form? That's persecution. And that's what Saul was doing to the church. And so for this little community of followers of Jesus who, in Acts chapter 2, remember, it was the best of times, man. Everything was going well. People were being healed. People's needs were being met. Food was getting given to the people who didn't have any food. And they were growing in favor of the people day by day. Remember that in Acts chapter 2? I mean, it was like, woo, the church of what's happening right here and now. And they were growing, and it was amazing. In Acts chapter 8, it is a totally different story. It is game over. It's time to roll the credits, right? It's been a good run, but it's over now. And you can imagine really brave people might have been saying that. Listen, I mean, this was a good movement. But we got to take care of ourselves now. I mean, this is not time to be heroic. This is time to close up shop, go underground, hide for a while, and then see if we can build our life back together again. But because we have the unbelievable privilege to turn to Acts chapter 9 and Acts chapter 10 and Acts chapter 11, and we just read the story that happened 2,000 years ago, we go, of course the game wasn't over. Of course it's not time to roll the credits. Just read on a little bit, right? I mean, that's what we do. And we totally miss the tension that they were filled with a kind of fear that you and I maybe have almost never done, but they also knew something that Saul came to learn later in life. And he wrote about it in Romans chapter eight. And you know these sets of verses. This is the same Saul that went about persecuting the church. Later on in his life in Romans 8, he writes this. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or diagmos or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? Good question. But you can tell this is going somewhere, right? This is a rhetorical question for Saul because he's been through all of that. And he knows, no, nothing can. As it is written, he says, for your sake, we face death all day long. Sign me up for that. Right? We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. That's sexy. I want to be in that. No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors. And I was like, conquerors? I wasn't thinking conquerors. I was thinking survivors. Lower the bar a little bit here, Paul. We want to survive this deal. He's like, no, let's do conquerors and let's do more than conquerors. We are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced. And the word convinced means to be convinced. It means to be sure of something having already been through it. It means to have a knowing because I've been there, you guys, is what Paul is saying. I am convinced that neither death. And that's the first thing he mentions. Listen, you guys think the worst thing that could happen to you is death. I want to put that at the top of the list. I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation. There is nothing that can separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So lift up your head, church. No matter what it is that you are going through, we have one who stands in the middle of us, pointing us the way home and saying, It is not over yet. It is not time to roll credits. In fact, the party has just begun. Amen? Because in the church of Jesus Christ, death is not the last word. Death is only a beginning. The death of Stephen started something in the church that ended up going all around the world, and we are beneficiaries of that scattering. And it was because a young man stood up and said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This may cost me my life, but you're wrong. Unbelievable. So we read in Acts chapter 8, verse 4, something that, again, when you read this, you just speed right by it, right? But look at that verse up on the screen. And what do you notice? Those who had been scattered just went on preaching the word wherever they went. Like you do. When you get thrown in prison and when your neighbors are getting slaughtered because of it, you just go on preaching the word. Now, I don't think that they just went on preaching the word because they were incredibly stupid people who just couldn't learn their lesson. It's interesting, the word scatter, it's a Greek word, spiro, and it means to scatter, which can mean to run away, to be driven away. But if you think about the word scatter, what can it also mean? what does a farmer do what did Jesus talk about the farmer doing man he he liberally scattered seed everywhere it was all over the place some fell on rocky soil some fell on soil that was good some fell on soil that the birds came went on the path the birds came but the seed, the farmer's like, I'm just gonna put seed everywhere, every single part and parcel of this planet. I'm putting seed so that life might spring up because that's the kind of farmer I am. And if you don't like that, you might not wanna be a part of my co-op, but what I do is I spread seed everywhere. I do it liberally. And that's how the early church saw their scattering. They were just being sent out. so that the gospel could really be the gospel. And so people could come to know the Jesus that they came to know. And so they went everywhere preaching the good news because here's what they believed. Give it your best shot, Saul. Scatter us everywhere, and we'll just keep sprouting up all around the world because what you meant for evil, God has used for good. And Saul eventually, we're going to find out pretty soon, finds out that he's on the wrong side of the field. And he gets met by Jesus. And Jesus changes his life. But before that happens, we read about Philip. Acts chapter 8, verse 5, just moving on in the story. Philip, and do you know who Philip was? Everyone realize who Philip was? Philip was one of the disciples, people. One of the 12 disciples. Okay, people, we need to do a little education. No, Philip was also one of the seven deacons that was appointed in Acts chapter 6 along with Stephen when the leader said, man, we got some widows. Remember this? Dave just did this a couple weeks ago. We got some widows that aren't getting food. We got to do some preaching and we got to do some praying. So we got to raise up some good people, some people with godly wisdom, full of the Holy Spirit, and full of character. Philip was one of these people. And so Philip went down to a city in Samaria, we read, and proclaimed the Messiah there. And when the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs that he performed, they all paid close attention to what he said. For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who are paralyzed or lame were healed. So there was great joy in that city. Because Philip went and proclaimed, and the word proclaimed is a word we've heard over and over again here over the years. It's the word euangelion, and it's how we, it's actually what we translate into the gospel. And the euangelion would be a message that normally armies would send a little runner out when they had won a victory and they were headed back home. They would send a little runner ahead of them with a euangelion saying, hey, we've won. We're coming back with spoils of war. It's a great day. It's good news. And Philip was coming to this little city in Samaria that didn't believe in God, didn't believe in Jesus for sure. This little city filled with lepers and people that were demonized. And, you know, so that's a pretty exciting city, I would imagine, to live in. And Philip came with good news. He came good-newsing. And the good news was, Behold, the kingdom of God is right here available to you. Yes, even you, you unlikely people, you Samaritans. The kingdom of God is available for you, for the shrieks and howls, demons left people, and paralytics were healed, and people who were lame started walking, and we realized that the credit's far from rolling. The game is not over, that this is just the beginning. And then the last phrase, maybe you missed it, And that last sentence in those sets of verses were, so there is great joy in that city. The word joy, kara, from keris, which is where we get the word grace. And this one, literally the kara is the joy that comes as a direct result of God's grace showing up when you didn't expect it. Have you ever experienced that? Have you ever experienced a moment where God's grace just showed up in your life and you knew you didn't deserve it. You knew you weren't even asking for it. You weren't looking for it. You weren't asking for it. And all of a sudden, a mattress gets delivered to your house so that your little child can sleep on it. You don't even have to ask for it. A job comes and you weren't looking for it. It's way better than anything you ever would have hoped for. And you experience kara. It's outward. It's a shout of praise. It's the laughter of a child when something really, really good happens that you didn't deserve. See, Philip went to an unlikely place. And he preached an unlikely king who was dead but was now alive. And he did it to unlikely people. Lepers, people who were demonized. And the result was great kara. It was great joy. Can you imagine being in that city on that day and just sitting around the little hummus bars and going, I mean, did you see Larry? I mean, that guy's been a jerk for 18 years. Turns out it was a demon. Oh, my gosh. That city changed. Because Philip just went preaching good newsing to unlikely people and unlikely king. And Philip himself was an unlikely candidate. So do you know anyone like that? Do you know anyone like Philip who just kind of lives her life, lives his life, and they're just captivated by the love of Christ and so they're not angry about it. They're not, you know, overly obnoxious about it. They just go about their business being the love of God in the world. Do you know anyone like that? Well, I do. She's one of my heroes in life. Her name's Jenny. She's 29. She's right there to my left. That's Peggy Lang and Vicki Degner. I had a great picture, you guys. It's a little blurry. I'm sorry for that. But I mean, just a great picture. Three amazing women that I get to do some life with. But Jenny Hill is 29, and she was born with cerebral palsy, which there's a number of effects that that has. But one of the ways that that gets played out is that people with cerebral palsy have a very difficult time walking if they can walk at all. And so Jenny, her whole life, the first thing that people think about her and sometimes even ask her out loud is, what's wrong with you? This is her story, right? So imagine that as a kid. Be a kid. the first question that people think about you when they see you is, what is wrong with you? And so Jenny, when she was four years old, she spent six weeks in a body cast to try to correct some of what was wrong and she now walks, though with a limp, and you've seen her up here. And she's written this book called Walking with Tension, which I am wildly excited about. I wrote the forward to this book and when it comes out, we will let you know. I want you to buy 20 copies of it each. you think I'm kidding but I'm not because it's such a story of the courage of her life it's her life story, it's her memoir of walking with tension walking into unlikely places as an unlikely person and learning what it means to bring hope by just telling her story so she's a media specialist which is a new cool way to say that she's a librarian at the, right? she's like, I will kill you, Steve, right now. That was not kind. She is a media specialist at St. Michael Elementary, and there is this parent that's been affected by her whose kids go to St. Michael, and this parent wrote a letter to WCCO this week, and I want to read this letter to you. Would you mind if I read it to you? I don't care if you mind or not. I'm going to read it anyway. Shouldn't have even asked you. Hello, my name is, and I have permission to read this, by the way, from her. My name is Amy Libby and I have two kids who attend St. Michael Elementary in St. Michael, Minnesota. My oldest child, Peyton, has special needs from an injury at birth and is in third grade at St. Michael. Peyton struggles with expressive and receptive language disorder and global apraxia, both neurological planning processing disorders. We've been at St. Michael for three years and while we have met and interacted with countless amazing staff members, they are both in the regular ed and special ed classrooms. there's one person in particular who has had a huge impact on our family and who was making a huge impact on our entire community. Her name is Jenny Hill. She's the media specialist at St. Michael, and she was born at 29 weeks gestation with cerebral palsy. The very first week, our daughter Peyton, who was at St. Michael, came home raving about Miss Hill. I had no idea who she was, so I looked her up on the school staff directory online. I remember thinking, weird, she's just a librarian. When my husband and I asked Peyton why she liked Miss Hill so much, her response was, she's different, like me. I told you. I said, Jeannie, I can't read this letter. I'm going to cry my way through it. Little did we know that Miss Hill was actively teaching so much more than simply how to check out a book. Over the past few years, we've gotten to know Miss Hill and have been amazed at what a great asset she is to St. Michael and to our community. She's very open with the kids about her disability. In talking with her, we have been so encouraged to hear her mission as an educator, to make sure every student knows they are loved, appreciated, and respected. I once asked her how she's able to so freely discuss her disability after having such a difficult time growing up, feeling as though she was alone and without any friends. I know for myself, it's often difficult to talk about or explain my daughter's disability to others, but Jenny does it with grace and ease. Her response blew me away. She said, I've seen, Jenny said, I've seen that sharing my story has the power to provide hope, inspiration, and encouragement to others who are struggling. Wow. So this woman, Amy, goes on to nominate Jenny to be the WCCO Excellent Educator of the Week. And so this week, Jenny got a little visit from WCCO, and this is what happened. Check this out. School can be so tough for any child, especially if they have disabilities. But a local elementary school teacher who lives with a disability is doing her part to change that. That's why one of the parents at St. Michael Elementary wrote to us about Jenny Hill. Ms. Hill is the school's media specialist. Her mother is a teacher as well. And this morning, Edward Moody shows us why Jenny Hill is our excellent educator of the week. This is by National Geographic Kids. One of the things educators always try to do is get that lifelong learning going. Jenny's got that. - Famous, and they're famous for their pictures. - Sincerely, she loves her kids, and I know that it's important to her to try to educate people to know how to treat someone with a disability, because I think she had a hard time, and I think by teaching others, they can go out and help others. - Oh my gosh. - And you are our excellent educator of the week. - You're kidding me. - I'm serious, congratulations. - Oh my gosh, thank you. - You can give her a hand if you want, yeah. - I love you. Oh my gosh, thank you. You're so transparent and so open to everything about your disability and that's just paving the way for all the other kids and you know in the school and in our community with a disability whether it's cognitive or physical so just thank you for that. What was the first thing people always ask me? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Yes. What did I say I wish people would have asked? What is your name? What is your name? You're right. It's my secret. I think when you said just be real and be yourself, which is hard to do. I think when you have a disability it's like you're kind of putting yourself on display. Their company, their imagination, their smiles, the things they learn, their wonder. Ah, their wonder. Okay, so in that story, you saw Jenny Hill's mother and the mother who nominated her for our Excellent Educator Award. Jenny Hill was born with cerebral palsy. She says growing up different motivated her to teach acceptance not only to her students but throughout the community. She's been doing that with the Special Olympics in St. Michael Albertville, an active advisor. And guys, a fun fact, her mother is a teacher, teaches second grade. And the principal we talked to in the story, she taught Jenny when Jenny was in elementary school. Oh, how cool. So it's just come full circle. It's so great she can use her story, though, to impact young people like that, Edward. Thank you. Yeah, let's give it up for Jenny. Ah, yes! Jenny Hill. And after they had been scattered, they just went on preaching. Jenny, and if you read her book, she's going to talk about the death that she's gone through, the many deaths that she's gone through, but the life that she's partnered with God to see come out of her is actually breathtaking. And what's breathtaking about it is it's just rooted in the ordinary experiences of her life. Now, she's doing some heroic things, but she's just step by step seeing where God has put her in, you know, an elementary school. And, you know, by the way, you can't, you know, be a minister of the gospel in a school, a public school, of course. Don't tell Jenny that, right? She is. She is. Tell it slant. It doesn't matter. Jenny is preaching the gospel. She's good-newsing, and so can you. You have been scattered. Some of you are stay-at-home moms. You've been scattered in your home to your kids, and your kids are the unlikely people that you need to share God's love with. Some of you are in the service industry. So at Cub, at McDonald's, at a restaurant, you're going to interact with all kinds of different people, and you are going to good news because you've been scattered there. some of you are teachers, or some of you are in leadership positions around the community, and you have been scattered where you are right now so that you can proclaim the good news. That in Jesus, death is not the end of the story. In fact, it's just the beginning. That death doesn't have to have the last word. That Jesus stands in the middle of you as you go through your suffering. That if you go down, even if the ship goes down for you in your darkest day, you end up dying, Jesus will accompany you home. That's the story that is not just the story in the book of the Acts. That's the story that's our story, amen? That's the story that we live in right now. So two questions for you to maybe think about this week, wonder about where have you been scattered and what unlikely people are you drawn to these days? Write those down. sit with them, wonder about them, pray through them? Where have you been scattered? Where are you being scattered? What kinds of people are you drawn to? What kinds of people do you find yourself around? Maybe just like Philip, you can just keep right on good newsing because that's what the people of God do because we have good news to share. Amen. Let's pray. God, thank you so much that you are in the business of conceiving new life in us. And maybe you've done some of that this morning. A new seed of life has been planted inside of us. So God, I pray that that would grow to full term. And then that we would give birth to that life in this community and out into the world so that we might be scattered so that more and more of your life can grow. Jesus, you are still the head of the church. And so our future is very, very bright. all God's people said. Amen. Would you stand with me for the benediction? Benediction's a good time to breathe in, breathe out, and a benediction is a time to receive what God has for you. It's the one I always do. And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all times, in all things, having all that you need, you may abound in every good work. you
