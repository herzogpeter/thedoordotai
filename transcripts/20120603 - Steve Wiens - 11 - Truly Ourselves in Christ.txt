Let's pray as we dive into the talk. So God, here we are gathered again, your people, totally messed up, coming in late, feeling weird, feeling scattered and lost. And we just confess to you right now all the ways in which we are just not enough. We lay them right at your feet right now. and right now God we ask for the grace to receive your yes that right in the middle of our pain or sin you run right into our room throw open the windows let the sun shine in and you let us know who we are again let that be a truth that we receive into our deepest center of ourselves this morning. In your grace and in your name, Jesus. Amen. Well, we have been in quite a long mini-series that we've found just like one of those old records that just gets stuck on the same groove in the same passage of Colossians 3. And two weeks ago, my wife, Mary, gave a blessing on Mother's Day. And then Dave came up and gave one of the most profound talks that I've heard in years about the character and nature of God who is spirit and in whose image we are all made. Males are made in the image of God and females are made in the image of God. And Dave, in the way that Dave has done for many, many years, just threw open the doors of our understanding about God just a little bit more, didn't he? Just a little bit further than maybe some of us were comfortable with when he talked about the fact that, yes, God is Father, and God is the very best Father, but that God is also Mother, That there are so many instances in scriptures that talk about God carrying the feminine as well as the masculine. So we looked at the feminine face of God. So let that in. Is that your picture of you and God? We looked at this verse in Isaiah 66, which maybe needs to be just put on our refrigerators this week again. This is what the Lord says, I will extend peace to her like a river, his children, God's children. You will nurse and be carried on her arm, and then you've got to wiki search this word, dandled on her knees as a mother comforts her child. so will I comfort you. Some of you like that's all you need today that you can just check out right now you can just turn off and that's all you needed to hear. So I will comfort you and you will be comforted over Jerusalem. So two weeks ago we looked at the beautiful nature of God which is both masculine and feminine and we looked at the nature of God's church which is filled with both the masculine and the feminine. And we looked at men and women in ministry for quite a few weeks before we looked at the feminine face of God. And we found out that in many churches, women get sort of this message, right? Now, you could be here. You could be here. Just don't make too much trouble and definitely know your place. And so we looked at the scriptures and we dove deeply into the context and the grammatical integrity of many, many passages in the New Testament. And what we found out is that the Apostle Paul was, when he says weird things like, women, I want you to be silent in the church, was speaking to a very specific congregation in a very specific time, and that wasn't supposed to be a timeless truth. And we looked at the fact that at Open Door, when we say we believe that women can teach and lead at every level, we're not doing that because that's just what we want to do. We're doing that because we're trying to be faithful to the scriptures and what they teach. And we're doing that because we really believe that there was a prophecy many thousands of years ago found in the book of Joel, chapter 2, verses 27 through 29. And we read this, these words which ring out like a clarion call into the future, right into our day and past our day, into all the futures that will come. Afterward, God says, I will pour out my spirit on all people. And your sons and daughters will prophesy. your old men any any any men in here feeling too old any men here feeling like maybe you've you know rounded the last lap and maybe it's time to be done not so says god your old men will dream dreams your young men will see visions even on my servants both men and women i will pour out my spirit in those days. And here's what we believe as a church, that if God does not pour out God's spirit in these days, if God does not give us a supernatural empowering to do what God is calling us to do, then let's shut our doors. I mean, let's stop meeting. We do not need to hear pep talks. We don't need to sing together because it's good for our voices. We don't need to meet together for countless hours to plan many, many ministries if God's Spirit is not pouring out power to us to do what we could never do on our own. And so as a church, we humbly say, come Holy Spirit in just about every arena that we can think about. Come Holy Spirit and pour out your Spirit on young women, on older women, on young men, on older men. So you spent quite a bit of time talking about women in ministry. If you want to read more about this, there's several resources that we gave to you. The first is How I Changed My Mind About Women in Leadership by Alan F. Johnson. It's just a collection of stories of pretty prominent people in ministry that used to believe one way and kind of change their mind. Another one is called Equally Yolked by Rick McInnes. That's a good one to look at. And then the last one that we, though there are many, that we threw out to you was a book by Ruth Tuttle-Kinard, designer women made by God. And you can see all those in the message tool from a couple weeks ago as well. And all of this was sort of springboarded from this set of verses in Colossians, which we've been in for like a year now. And I'm not kidding you. Starting in verse 17 of chapter 3, I want to read these verses to you again. And even this first verse, I mean, you can just stop and go, okay, I got a little time to think about this one. Whatever you do, Colossians 3.17, whatever you do, whether in word or deed, which means everything, every single thing that you do, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, the Master and Lord of all, Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. So that's a challenge. And then we read the next sentence that Jan and I spent some weeks on. Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord. And husbands, love your wives, and don't be harsh with them. And children, obey your parents and everything. We're going to get to that next week. For this pleases the Lord, it also pleases your parents. It's kind of a, you know. Fathers, don't embitter your children. You could read fathers and mothers there. That's more of a, you know, parents, don't embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. And many of us adults are sitting in this room, having spent a lot of money on counseling because we had parents who discouraged us. Slaves, obey your earthly masters and everything, and do it not only when their eye is on you to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. And whatever you do, work at it with all of your heart as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance. You have to think about that one. what is our inheritance that we will receive from the Lord? Since you will receive an inheritance, you know, slaves, they're not thinking about inheritance. They're not thinking about 401ks. They're not thinking about their retirement account. And yet Paul is talking to slaves, for you know you receive an inheritance. From who? From the Lord. Oh, it's so good. Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord, not for human masters. since you know you'll receive an inheritance from the Lord as your reward. It is the Lord Christ you're serving. And I told you we were going to get to children obey your parents next week, because this week what I'm going to try to do is sort of bring the women and men portion of this passage to as much closure as I can. And when I say closure, I'm fully aware that it's just not going to come to closure for many of us. This is just a dot, dot, dot. This is a comma. We're putting a comma on the conversation because so many of us have received invitations and what it means to be a wife and a husband or a man and a woman that is fully alive. And so what I want to do today is on that journey of you receiving these invitations and healing from God is I want to give you a gift that you can carry forward in your journey. But first I want to do a little review about when we talk about men and women because we know it gets dicey. We know it gets weird. We know it gets heated. And so we have to go back to Genesis to find out what it means to be a fully alive man and a fully alive woman. We did this back in January. Let's just spend a couple minutes in review. Talking about men first. In Genesis 2, 20 and 21, we read, But for Adam, no suitable helper was found. And in the verses before it, it talks about God searched all of the animals. after God said, you know, it isn't good for the man to be alone. So he searches all the animals and says, well, no suitable helper is found. So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. And while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and then closed up that place with flesh. And what we looked at was three words. This is so interesting that as a man allows himself to submit to God and fall asleep, That's a very active, passive thing, if you want to put it that way. God was formed. Man was formed by God. And then God reached inside of man and took something out of him, making him at first feel incomplete. But at the very place, this flesh that God took the rib out of Adam, The Hebrew, it's just this wonderfully generative word and life-giving word right at the place in which something was taken out of Adam, in which at first he could have felt incomplete. That was the very thing that was going to make him complete. So what does it mean for a man to submit to God and allow God even to wound him so that life might be brought to others? So we looked at the definition of what a fully live man looks like, and this is what we said back in January. A fully alive man is formed and shaped by God. He's learning that God brings life to others from the very place where he gives something of himself away. So we and I challenged myself and men to say, what would it look like to submit to God? To allow God to do something to you where you might give something of yourself away, even to the point at which you might feel incomplete, so that life might come to others. So I'm sitting down here looking at Chad and Colin, a couple of our men's ministry guys, and they sent me an email a couple of weeks ago, and this was after, did anyone come to the Minnesota Teen Challenge Choir when they came here? It was my son's birthday, so I didn't come. I chose to be with my little boy on his fifth birthday, But Chad sent me an email the next day, sent a few of us this email that was like, oh my gosh, you're just not going to believe what happened. First of all, it was a great night. But second of all, this guy just kind of wandered in from nowhere. And he wandered in because he saw the big cross out front, right? And as he wanders in, he kind of sat down. And a couple of the Kingdom Warriors guys kind of noticed that and started talking to him and started to hear this guy's story. And this guy is in the middle of some very rough and difficult circumstances where he's making some interesting choices. And so these guys brought him back to one of the viewing rooms and prayed with this guy. Listen to his story first. And this guy's like, man, this is freaking me out. This Teen Challenge, people are up here telling their stories. It's my story. I don't even know why I'm here. So they start praying for this guy. And God starts to move and work in this guy's life. And lights start to go on for him. He calls one of the other guys that met with him, Kelly Peters. Kelly, Celine was the other guy. Two guys named Kelly, love that. And called Kelly Peters and said, man, can we have dinner? And Kelly's like, how about tonight? Wednesday night, Kelly gets together with this guy. And after hearing more of his story, this guy's like, I don't know what's going on, but I want to be back to this crazy place. I don't know what kind of church this is, but I'm coming back because God is alive and doing something. Now the reason why I share that story there is because the guys that are involved in Kingdom Warriors, you know, they do it all. I mean, these volunteers show up early on Tuesday afternoon, rush in there from work, get off work early. They stay late into the night. They email all the guys themselves. I mean, they create this whole thing on their own. They give much of themselves away. And it's, a lot of the time, it's pretty thankless. So guys, you giving of yourselves is creating life, actual life, for other human beings. Thank you for being fully alive, man. It's good stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And another guy, his name's Bill, goes to Open Door. Several years ago, heard that someone at Open Door needed a kidney. So he does what most of us would do. He goes, well, I'll give you mine. I have two. So he did that. And this couple gave it to the husband, this couple that goes to Open Door. They were so moved by that that a couple years later, the wife heard of someone else who also needed a kidney. And she said, well, I mean, you know, my husband's life was saved because of this. So, you know, I got two kidneys, so I'll give one away. She gives a kidney away. Now there's another couple at Open Door who their daughter is going through some crazy stuff. She's on permanent dialysis. And so we got to say, Bob and Ken got to say, hey, you guys, there's this great couple you have to talk to because they've been through this road. They've been down this road. Emails this couple with, you know, the husband got the kidney. The wife gave the kidney away. And they're like, oh, we would love to meet with his family. Pray for him. Encourage him. And, you know, that whole story that's ongoing, like dominoes falling, is all because a guy named Bill decided to donate one of his kidneys. You know, because that's what you do, right? Odds, you know, I got it. I don't. A fully alive man, that's not perfect, but is deciding to say yes. Men, to be fully alive, you do not have to get everything right. You do not have to get an A plus in everything. What you have to do is show up in your weakness and believe that God can do something more. That's what you have to do. We need fully alive men. What is a fully alive woman? Well, again, in Genesis 2.20, kind of repeating some of these words that we've already read. For Adam, no suitable helper is found. So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, And while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. We read that verse before. And then the Lord God made a woman from the rib that he had taken out of the man. And he brought this woman to the man. And the man said, wow, this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. So she shall be called woman, for she was taken out of man. And the translation suitable helper is sort of awkward, is it not? we have any women in the room this morning that have just said come on translators right because like this is the picture you get now I'm sure she's a very lovely woman that perhaps is full of strength and you know you can still make a pie and be a strong woman but this is not the picture that God had in mind when God created woman. In fact, the word suitable helper is translated, we've said this before, it's these two words, ezer, kinegdo. Ezer means help. It's the kind of help that God brings when someone is in desperate trouble. It's almost always only used for the help that God brings, ezer. And then kinegdo is from the root word neged, which means opposite. And so kinegdo means to be opposite to the man. And so Ezer Kinegdo, this is the picture. This is the definition. A face-to-face, that's right. It's a great picture. A face-to-face companion to man bringing strong, life-saving restoration. A face-to-face companion to man bringing strong, life-saving restoration. That's the picture of what God had in mind when God presented a woman to a man. face-to-face companion bringing strong, life-saving restoration. So what is a fully alive woman? Fashioned by God with intricacy and strength. It's like God spent God's time on woman. She's learning to open up and provide a life-saving environment in which people can grow and be restored. And so look at that for a second. A life-saving environment in which people can grow and be restored. And so the difficult work that women need to do is, with their strength, provide space for people to grow into who God made them to be. Sometimes that means coming in with life-saving speed and saying, this is going to happen right now because your life is in danger. and I'm not going to smother you with my own needs. I'm going to provide space for you using my strength to do that so that you can grow and survive. I was in a meeting this last, a little Bible study this last week where there's three guys and four women and the women were leading the study. And after a little while of kind of talking, we found out that the four women, every single one of them, was this kind of woman. that had spent enormous energy and paid an enormous price to take all of her strength and create space so that people in this church can grow and be nourished and have their lives saved. And at different points during this little time, I mean, we just like looked at one of them and looked at the next one and just were like, whoa, whoa, whoa. whoa, thank you so much for using your strength to create space. When I think about that, I think about the feminine face of God, and we think about strength. I got an email, we got an email a couple weeks ago after Dave gave his talk on the feminine face of God, and this woman writes this, I know this sermon wasn't about women's lib. It was about meeting the God who fills our cups. But there's the side effect, she writes, that when you recognize that God is as much mother as father, as much feminine as masculine, you also recognize me as a woman, as God's true creation, as much the image of God as my brother is. I hadn't realized until right now how much I was really, in my spirit and not just my mind, that's interesting, in my spirit and not just my mind, waiting for this message, hungering for it, just to be counted in. So thank you. Keep up the good work, and please, for the sake of those of us who so need this word, don't be afraid to keep going there. Well, message to you, men and women, we will not shrink back from going there. We will not shrink back from going to the places where God is calling us to go, no matter how much price we have to pay. Because the people of God, the women of God, the men of God are worth it. And so that is what we will do. Now here comes the gift that I said I was gonna give you. as you walk out this journey of becoming a fully alive man and woman. A couple weeks ago, I just had a terrible week. And every single arrow that could fly at you, sometimes they miss and sometimes you have the strength to deflect them, every single one went in. You ever have one of those weeks or days or years? And I said this to my wife. but it wasn't like ha ha it was like honey i'm serious i cannot believe how screwed up i am i mean i i just i cannot believe how utterly i am failing in these three huge areas of my life that i don't want to fail in and you know my wife um you know sometimes you kind of get a gift where you know not to go, oh no, you're great. You know, because sometimes that is sort of like, you're awesome. No, you're awesome. It's sort of like, just listen to me for a second, you know. I mean, thanks that you think I'm awesome. Thank you. Say it again. You know, like 20 more times, but later. Right now, I need to dial into the fact that all the arrows are going in, and I just really believe that for many of us, as you've maybe received this invitation to become a fully alive man, to become a fully alive woman, and maybe even on that Saturday or Sunday where you first got the message from God to stand up into who you are, and God raised you into life, and you walked out of this room feeling full, right, and feeling empowered, and feeling like yes, and then Monday morning an arrow flies in, and by that afternoon you're saying that. So here's the gift. I want to help us to start to do this to this beautifully messed up and translate that into something else. Some other message when you feel like you are failing. In Romans 8, 5, and 6, we read this from the message translation. I love this. This is an invitation to all of us. Those who think they can do it on their own, raise your hand in your hearts, if that is you. Those who think they can do it on their own end up obsessed with measuring their own moral muscle. Do I get an A? Do I get an A plus? Do I get an A minus? How can I get an A plus? Measuring their own moral muscle, but never get around to exercising it in real life. But those who trust God's action in them find that God's spirit is in them. Living and breathing God in you at the point of your deepest failure and weakness. Your very being is filled with the presence of God. I read this somewhere, I can't remember where God's address is at the end of your rope I love that, I think it was Dallas Willard Moving on in Romans 8, 6 Anyone guilty? Oh man, didn't get an A plus in that? I didn't get an A plus in being a father I didn't get an A plus in being a pastor I didn't get an A plus in being a husband Obsession with self in these matters is a dead end. It's an endless loop. I'm terrible. I'm horrible. I'm screwed up. I'm terrible. I'm horrible. I'm screwed up. What addiction can I move toward to make me feel better? Oh my gosh, I'm such a loser. I lost again to this addiction. What a terrible, pathetic loser I am. What addiction can I go to to make me feel better? Oh, I'm such a loser. I went to this addiction again. It's a dead end. It's a loop. Attention to God on the other hand, leads us out into the open, into a spacious, free life. So I wonder, instead of me getting to that moment where I realize my limits, which every single human being has them, why do we fight against recognizing our limits? That is the space in which God comes and moves, and God comes and brings God's power at the place in which you run out. And I think it's Satan's little maneuver, Satan's little trick to keep us from our limits so that we never experience God's power, so that we never experience God's spirit breathing new life into us. So instead of, oh, I can't believe how screwed up I am, what if we replace those words with this word? Well, I failed again. reach my limit again, what new spacious place might God be inviting me into right now in my weakness? What new space might God be allowing me into through the gift of this failure so that more of God can be present in me, so that more of God's spirit can be accessed in me, so that more of God's energy can flow through me, so that I can spend less of my life in the dead-end loop of trying hard to be a fully alive man. I'm going to be a fully alive man. I'm going to try hard to do that. I'm going to get an A plus in that. We're going to be so tired, so exhausted. I read this quote this week from David Benner. God gives us all that God asks of us. Meaning, every single thing God calls you to, God gives you the resources to do. Now, we're trying to do a whole lot of things that God's not calling us to do. And guess what? God's not giving you the resources to do those things. And so you have to say, well, the only thing I'm called to do today is what God is calling me to do. That's it. I'm not that's it I mean if God doesn't call me to do it Jesus said that the only thing I do is that which my father tells me to do that's all I do if that was good enough for Jesus Jesus left towns remember lots of people to be healed Jesus leaves the town so in closing here Romans 8 15 and 16 this resurrection life which is what we've been talking about in Colossians it's the number one message is the theme, it's the cliff notes of Colossians, resurrection life, life out of death. This resurrection life you've received from God is not a timid, grave-tending life. It's not based on fear. In fact, it's adventurously expectant, greeting God with a child like, well, what's next, Daddy? Can you imagine living life like that? Okay, what's next? Like, I have no idea how I'm making it out of this mess, but what's next, Daddy? God's Spirit touches our spirits and confirms who we really are. We know who God is and we know who we are, father and mother and children. And we know we're going to get what's coming to us, an unbelievable inheritance. Here's the gift. Could you believe in your journey of becoming a fully alive man and a fully alive woman that you will never raise from death to life without the power of God initiating it in you. You cannot raise yourself from the dead. You cannot do it. You cannot do it. It is God and God alone that raises the dead to life. Amen? It is God's power in us, enabling us to be a church that moves towards God's desires for us as a church. It is God's spirit that moves in a marriage that allows a marriage to move toward God's dreams for the marriage. It is God's spirit in a single person, a single person, that allows that single person to live an adventurously expectant life saying, what's next, Daddy? God's Spirit in you, giving you all that you need to what God is calling you to do. As we go to the table, I want to leave you with this image. It's an icon. It's been around for many hundreds of years, and when I saw it, I immediately took a picture of it, which is why the obnoxious flash is down there on the bottom of the right-hand corner. But this is a picture of Jesus. and a person that Jesus loves. And so I have this on my desktop on my computer, and I look at this picture as much as I can, and see, you can kind of tell which one is Jesus, correct? It's holding the book. What I love about this is what Jesus is doing with his arm. You see that? It's as if Jesus, and look at it, kind of, it's like the look on his face. They're both looking straight ahead, but Jesus is like saying, this guy, he's mine. This guy, oh, I'm never leaving this person. This guy right here, I walk through every single day and every single night with. I never leave this guy. I like this guy. This guy with the funny-looking hands and the little scroll and the weird, He's kind of, you know, a little saggy. I love this guy. And I am with this guy. This is the fundamental reality that Greg Boyd was trying to talk about last week. That we live every moment of every day in the beautiful, majestic, intimate embrace of Jesus Christ who gives us the power to do what we could never do on our own. And that picture allows you to come to this table even if you are so lost. It allows you to come home. Because you realize Jesus has been right there with you the whole time. If you are so starving for Jesus, you come to this table. And I was talking to a woman last night, and she goes, I came up to receive one of the crackers, and when the person reached her hand in there, she came out with this huge cracker. I was expecting this little tiny, and it was like enormous, you know. And it just spoke to the abundance of God. There is so much more than enough in the body of Jesus and the blood of Jesus. So come to the table and receive the life of God coursing through your veins. you
