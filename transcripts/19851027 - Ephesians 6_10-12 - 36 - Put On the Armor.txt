Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the full armor of God that you may be able to stand against the schemes, the methods of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but it's against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore, take up the full armor of God that you may be able to resist in the evil day. And having done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truthfulness and having put on the breastplate of righteousness and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace. in addition to all taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I have sensed the tension all week long as we have literally declared war on Satan and all his forces. As we come to this passage, it has awakened in me the fact that we are in a war. And we have the promise of victory because it's already won, but we so need to walk by your resource. Teach us how. Open these words to us that are written on this page to be alive and living and applied into our lives. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. I believe that we are in a place in our church that as a body of believers we need to bind ourselves together like we have never done before. I believe in my heart that Satan is moving against the church of Jesus Christ today. And that is nothing new. When I was thinking of this and it was going through my mind and I was thinking of the warfare that we're in and everything that's at stake, the principalities and powers that would move against us as believers. I began to think that, you know, it's really a sign of the times. It's really the end time and Satan's moving in ways he's never done. I don't know about that. I have feelings about that that are real strong. But I know that Satan has moved against every work that God has ever begun to establish since the beginning of time. Remember when I first came here, we went to the book of Revelation and we talked about those seven churches those great works of God that had tremendous impact and Satan moved against them and they weren't ready and they died even the book the church at Ephesus to which this letter was written one day died they left their first love they grew cold they didn't care for each other believers as we begin to move into warfare and prepare ourselves for battle I can't even preach my sermon until I put my arms of love as your pastor around you and say we need to be in this together. We can't leave anybody behind. This is vital. The book of Ephesians is so much more to me than a study. It's so much more to me than a series of sermons. I believe that the book of Ephesians to us, the church of the open door, has been the call of God to us. We have had to find for us what the body of Christ is, what it can be. When we're filled with the Holy Spirit and when we're experiencing the fullness of God and when we're taking off the old and putting on the new. We've been told who we are in Christ and what we have, the marvelous resources in chapters 1 through 3 and then in chapters 4 through 6. We spent about eight months talking about our response to who we are, our redemption and our salvation and our forgiveness and our freedom and liberty. But if those things are who we are, Paul says in chapter 4, verse 1, Therefore, I entreat you, beloved brethren, to walk, to live in a manner that accurately reflects who you are. You are redeemed. You have an inheritance. Therefore, walk in accordance with it. And the kind of walk that we are to have is a humble walk, isn't it? It's a gentle walk. It's a patient walk. It's a walk that is bent on unity. Those two things don't almost seem to go together, but we need to be fiercely protecting our unity and fiercely protecting our love for one another. We are in a war and Satan would destroy that unity and destroy that love. It's to be a Christ-like walk. It's to be a light walk, a wise walk, a spirit-filled walk, a submissive walk, a serving walk. And then it's as if Paul comes to this particular text and says, listen believers, if those things are going to be your desire and if you are going to be moving into those dimensions of the worthy walk, there's going to be another dimension of your walk that you need to know. Not only is it going to be a love walk and a light walk and a Christ-like walk and a unity walk, but it's going to be a warfare walk. Because if you begin to open yourself up to the power of God and He begins to move through you and change your life, you are going to run right into the enemy. You can't avoid it. If we're lollygagging around and we're playing church and we're just kind of coming and sitting and leaving, there's not going to be any big deal. But if we are in fact running the race that is set before us, that if we are in fact pursuing the high call of God that He has laid at the feet of every believer, then we are going to go against the grain. we're going to do that we are going to counter the system we are going to violate the status quo and if that's what you're moving into then welcome to the war because you're going to move into a war just as well Satan's going to be there and last week we introduced this whole concept of the believer's warfare by giving you three fundamental truths the first truth is what I've already said we are in a war and we really need to know it we can't anymore accept this idea that Christianity is somehow skipping through daisy fields. Without a care in the world, the Christian life is a warfare walk. Paul said at the end of his ministry, I have fought the fight, I have finished the course, and now I'm ready to go. And the only reason I'm ready to go with any peace is because I've fought the fight. Why did he talk like that? Because it was a war. When he said to Timothy, who was at the time struggling with his ministry and ready to quit because the pressures had become too much, He said to this, Timothy, my dear son in the Lord, be a soldier who endures hardness. Timothy, you need to expect that if you're going to stand firm, that if you're going to retain the standard of sound words, if you're going to speak the truth in love, if you are going to stand and fight the fight of faith, then you're going to be opposed. And Satan is going to move against you. I was reading something yesterday afternoon by Dr. Criswell who was reflecting on his ministry the great work that he has built by the grace of God in Dallas, Texas one of the biggest churches in the nation and one of the things he reflected on in the beginnings of his ministry was simply this when the opposition became the greatest I became convinced more than ever that I was getting closer to the truth because when we get closer and closer to the truth and begin opening ourselves up more and more to the deeper things of God we are going to run into the enemy Amos 6.1 says woe unto them that are at ease we can't be at ease anymore because we're in a war we're in a war again I need to reaffirm something that I said last week one of the things I love about our fellowship here is that we are coming so alive to the fact that we are not some sort of country club church where we just come and sit and watch we are a church we're a church and we don't come together just to make people feel warm and gooey and comfortable I believe that that aim we want people to feel comfortable but not comfortable in terms of easy. We want to see people growing. We want to see them being moved. All of us, myself included, out of positions of mediocrity, out of positions of being less than all that God would have us be. We have been called to light, to wisdom, to the fullness of God, to imitating Christ, to being filled with the Spirit, to stripping off the old and putting on the new. We have been called to war. against the enemy of men's souls. And so I say again, I pray that you don't feel comfortable here like we could float along. I pray to God you feel loved here. I pray to God you feel accepted here. I pray to God you feel the moving of the Spirit of God, God Himself. I pray that while you're here, you grow in the grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But I hope you never sit still. I hope you never sit still because we're in a war. And we're here to equip people for warfare. We are in a war and we have an enemy, Satan, the accuser, who is here to stand in the way, to keep everything that God would have us do from happening. He is the accuser, he is the adversary, the one, the Satan. Remember, the word means to stand in the way. Satan, if I Satan'd you, I would stand in your way and keep you from moving. And Satan stands in our midst and tries to resist all that God's doing. He is the devil. Diabolos. Diabolical. Diabolical. The liar. The slanderer. The one who would get us involved in all sorts of malicious things and lying things. But we ended last week with the fact that we have a resource. And Satan is beaten by believing the victory is already won. That victory was won on the cross and Satan has no dominion over us. unless we decide that somehow we can work this work by the flesh, that we can somehow do what God's called us to do without an absolute commitment to Him and a surrender to His will, Satan is beaten by believing. That's why it said fight to fight. It doesn't just say fight. It says fight to fight of faith. Believe, believe, believe, and call Satan a liar every step of the way. Now since it is true that the believer who is walking with God is going to run into a collision course with Satan, I believe it is important that we understand some of the ways that Satan is going to attack us. And maybe even now in your lives, in your families, in our church, be attacking even this very moment. I do not want to dwell on this. But I do believe, because I don't think we need to focus so much on what Satan is doing. This is the last time we're going to deal with that kind of thing. But I do believe that there are times in our lives that Satan would sneak into little cracks in our lives that we don't even see. And I believe by the power of the Spirit and the Word of God, we've got to shine a light on that place in my life and in your life, so that we, by faith, can rebuke him and move him out of there. The umbrella, I believe, that Satan uses his fundamental goal, his primary purpose in dealing with the church, And in dealing in the world, I believe his bottom line goal is this. He would like more than anything else. With all the little things he does, his ultimate goal is to undermine the character of God and destroy the credibility of God. Make God unbelievable. Undermine God's character. I think of this accident that happened this last week. And this precious one that we love, gone to be with the Lord. And Satan would move into there and say what? He is the liar. God doesn't love you. He doesn't care. How could he let a thing like that happen? And I don't understand and I don't like it. But Satan is beaten by believing, isn't he? And I'm going to believe God and I'm going to believe God and I'm going to be hurt. But Satan has no place here. Destroy credibility. What is credibility? Credibility simply defined. Let me put it this way. You know there's people you really listen to in your life? There are people who have clout in your life. What they say doesn't go in one ear and out the other. They speak and you listen. Why? Credibility, that's why. The words they say might be exactly the same as someone else who says the same words. But you see something in someone's life that is consistent and real and powerful and they have credibility. So when they speak, you listen. God would love to undermine, Satan would love to undermine God's credibility. And I believe, again, this is just for us as the body of Christ here. One of Satan's most diabolical schemes, I believe, is that I think Satan uses for destroying the credibility of God the same tool that God would use to establish it. And that is the church. How can he do that? He does it this way. When we stand in the pulpit and preach a message of power and redemption and freedom and love. But in our congregation we don't see power and redemption and freedom and love. When I don't see something connected with the words that we're speaking, that destroys credibility. When people come into a body of believers and there is no light and there is no fire and the people aren't moving to God. then all the words we say lose their power and we're very easy to ignore. Credibility is destroyed and God is easy to ignore. He's not believable. But when the Spirit of God begins to move among a people and people's hearts turn toward Him anew and afresh people can't stay away. Why? Credibility. The message and the reality is right there hand in hand. And we can talk, and мы can see it at the same time. And that's our prayer together as a body, isn't it? That people would come among us and not only hear the message, but they would experience that message because of you. He would destroy credibility by moving us to mediocrity. I believe mediocrity is the curse of the church. I really do. I believe mediocrity is the curse of the church. You let that, just play with it and go wherever you want with it. Dead churches are Satan's glory. I believe he would attack us at the points where we are most vulnerable. And again, remember the war? When we talked about the war last week, we talked about the fact that when the warfare gets the hottest, the potential for victory is also the greatest. And I believe he is going to attack us at those places that are most needful. I believe the most needful thing we have is to love one another. Where do you think he's going to attack? Right there. I believe one of the most needful things we have as the body of Christ is to stay united. Where do you think he's going to attack? Right there. And when he does, we need to see that and rebuke it and pursue love. With everything we've got, Paul says, when Paul says, let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech be he put away from you. He isn't saying that because it sounds nice and might fit in somewhere nice with a song. He's saying that, beloved, because we are in a war. And Satan would love to take bitterness and anger and strife and slander and malicious speech and use it among us to destroy the credibility that God has. A frightening thought hit me this week. We talk so often about the Lord using me. You know, we get up in testimony times and say, you know, the Lord really used me this week, or I want the Lord to use me this week, and that kind of thing over and over again. I do not believe that Satan has any dominion over the believer. I do not believe that Satan can possess a believer. I don't believe that. We're going to go into that theologically a little bit later. Not today. But you know what I do believe? I do believe that when I permit bitterness to move into my life, and when you permit bitterness and anger and strife and slander and malicious gossip to creep into your life, I want to tell you something. God's not using you. And God's not using me then. Satan's moving. And we need to be mindful of his schemes and shine light on the cracks that he's sliding and slithering into, even in our own body. He'd move us to mediocrity. He would destroy our love and unity. He would apply to us persecution. He would use peer pressure. That's the third one. He would frustrate the growth that has already happened. Paul said this, Listen, folks, beloved believers, don't you dare be naive. All those who are godly will suffer. Bingo. All those who are godly will suffer. If you want to move into the fullness of the Spirit and experience the fullness of God that is so graphically laid out for us in Ephesians, you will go through conflict guaranteed you begin to break away from the mediocrity you really begin to grow up in Christ and imitate him stripping off the old putting on the new one of the things that I believe and have seen this over and over again even as I was growing up as a young boy one of the tools that Satan will use is even other believers within the body who will come to you as you're breaking out of your mediocrity and breaking out of your pretense and really beginning to mean business with God. And he's going to use even other believers to come into your life and to pull you back to mediocrity. Hey, you're going too far. You're taking this a little too serious. You're on fire for the Lord. And Satan would bring other people into your life who would try to put that fire out. And I believe the most, the hardest for me to handle is when other believers do it. And it happens. You ever share your excitement and enthusiasm with another believer and they just kind of look at you like you're nuts? I believe that mediocrity in our Christian lives is so rampant very often that when someone comes who really is on fire he does look a little bit odd and that's a shame. We need to turn that around completely. so that the mediocrity looks out of place. The more you grow as a believer, the more you're going to feel that pressure to move back, to quit growing, to get back where it's safe. The third thing he's going to do is he's going to attack you with fear. Do you ever feel afraid? Do you ever feel afraid? You see, the exciting thing about growing in the Lord and really responding as we have, and I believe that. As a church, I feel we have grown together every week, taking another stride in understanding what it is that God has for us. And the exciting thing about growing in the Lord is that every day as we grow, we move into new territory, don't we? We move into new kinds of experiences and things we've never seen before. And it used to be that God was in a little box for me, and He operated right in here. And if all of a sudden something came out there, I didn't even understand it. But all of a sudden, those things were getting blown up for me. And God becomes bigger for us than he was ever before. And oh my goodness, when we have a share time like a few weeks ago, you remember that? All of a sudden God takes over, people come up and we're anointing them with oil. Bigger than the little box I keep him in. But I want to tell you something else about new territory. It is exciting and it is thrilling. And I don't want to live any other way ever. But it's unfamiliar and it's uncomfortable and it's real scary. and the impulse when I'm afraid is I get so weak and I want to quit I want to go back listen when God talks about exceeding abundance beyond all that we could ask or think the key word there for me is beyond beyond here wherever you are as a believer I don't care where you are I don't care if you're the super saint or you're just beginning to walk and beginning to open up yourself to the life of God. The word for you is beyond because that's where God wants to take you. Beyond where you're at. I don't care where it is. He wants to take you past that. He wants to take you into territory where you don't feel like you're in control. So you have to trust Him every day. Lord, bring us into that. And there's nothing wrong with being afraid. Be afraid. But keep on growing. And keep on going. And keep on trusting. I think of Gideon. I think of Hebrews 11 is where I went to when I was thinking of this. And all the great men of faith throughout history who were given to us as an example of how we are to walk. And time would fail me if I told you of Gideon and Jephthah, Samuel and David and all the prophets. Gideon. Remember when he came and he was going to do battle and God says you're going to have the victory. And so he did what was logical. he got all sorts of men and he was all there and he felt real strong and God says too many men cut it down huh and he did it again and before he knew it he was with such a small band of men he couldn't take anybody and God said to Gideon Gideon now I got you where I want you you're going to move into that territory and it's new territory and it's scary and I believe he was frightened but he did it anyway and it kept on going and Abraham same book Hebrews 11 went out not knowing where it was that he was going. God told him to go, so he went. Afraid? I think he was afraid and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. You know when something's wrong? When something is wrong, when that fear keeps me from moving, that's what's wrong. Samuel and the prophets called of God to preach to people who would never listen. Afraid? Yes. Did they stop? No. Old Testament one of my favorite texts in all the Old Testament was where the people of Israel had been promised the land and all they had to do was possess the land and that was God's charge to them believers children of God possess the land it's yours I promised it and I correlate that with the cross right now it is yours Satan is done he has no dominion over you possess the land go for it with everything you've got and then they sent out spies into the land and all the spies came back saved too saying they're big, they're strong we look like grasshoppers their wall is three miles thick we could never do that Joshua and Caleb came back and said yeah that's true they're big, they're strong we look like grasshoppers their walls are thick but we can do it yes I'm afraid but we're going anyway possess the land the tragedy for those people was that they didn't do it. And yes, they were afraid. But no, they didn't move. Satan would use fear. Satan would get us to trust our own resources. And you know why that's a danger for us? Because we have them. That's why. Because we have good leadership here. And the finances of our church is healthy. And the people are excited. And we have neat music. and we have resources that we could look at and say aha aha you know we're on the way we got it together and one of the greatest deceptions that Satan could throw at us would be to think aha we got it made in the shade this is easy it isn't easy and Satan would love to move in against us with pride churches don't have what we do he would attack us with discouragement discouragement is the same thing as fear it causes us to turn around and go back I think of the people of Israel when they came out of Egypt remember how boring it was in Egypt dead and stifling and they said oh send us a prophet get us out of here and then they got them out of there and all of a sudden they were in a place where they had to trust God every day and manna came and wonderful things and the Red Sea parted wonderful things and it was exciting and it was alive and it was real but it was scary and they wanted to go back to Egypt where it was safe even though it was dead discouragement gets me to want to go back we can't do it false doctrine would come into the church and it would muddy the waters so we wouldn't know what was right and what was wrong and which direction to go and we'd just get confused. Satan would throw a myriad of things at us. And now, if all that is true, that Satan's design is to undermine the credibility of God, if Satan's design is to make the church look impotent, mediocre, use peer pressure and fear, discouragement, false teaching, get us to trust in our own resources, you know, all those things could be working in us this is the deception. All of those things could be working in us even here right now and Satan's deception is that we never know it. So what do we do? I mean, it's so crafty and he is so subtle and he is so complex and cunning it's called the wiles of the devil. How do we deal with it? There's only one way I know. Verse 10, Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. Put on the full armor of God and on and on and on. Verse 13, take up the full armor of God that you may be able to resist in the evil day. Remember last week we talked about the evil day, what that was? The evil day is today. The evil day was yesterday when that young girl died. That's the evil day. Put on that armor so when that comes you can stand firm. Verse 14. Today we are going to very quickly, as I wrap up, talk about this first piece of armor that goes on. And we're not going to take long with this. The time is short. The first piece of armor is maybe the most important. It says, verse 14, Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth, or truthfulness. Truthfulness. The imagery here is very important, and I want us to get it very quickly. In Paul's day, people wore a tunic. And a tunic was basically just a great big piece of material that had a space for the head to go through and a space for the arms to go through. And what it did is it just kind of floated around in a breeze. And if you were kind of casually laying around at home, it was real comfortable. And it really felt nice, just kind of loose and free. And it was great. It was a wonderful thing. But if you were going to go into war and if you were going to do something really important, there was no way you wanted to have this tunic flying all over the place. You were going to get tangled up, right? No soldier in his right mind was going into war with his tunic flying all over the place. You had to zip it up and stab them one real good, slice them up real nice. All of a sudden you're in hand-to-hand combat and you've got these things tangling you up with other people and they're flying all over the place. You get caught on the edge of somebody else's sword and you're just wrapped up in all these things. It slows you down. So what would they do? They would gird up the loins with a belt, and simply that meant a belt, and they would take that belt and they'd wrap it around them and they would gather all the loose ends, all the loose ends of this tunic, and they'd wrap them around themselves and they'd get tight, ready for battle. And that's exactly what it means to gird up your loins. It means to wrap around yourself, to pull in all the loose ends, to pull in all the things that entangle you with the world, to pull in all the loose ends of bitterness and anger and strife and pull it all in. You're in a war. And you're not lounging around the house anymore. It means to wrap around yourself, gather all the loose ends of your life, the entanglements in the world, And bring them all in and wrap them around yourself. And truthfulness, that's what I wrap around. That's what it is. I take the belt of truthfulness. And that's the belt that pulls it all in. You got that? To gird up your loins means to be ready. To be alert. To be prepared. Truthfulness is the belt itself. And that is the thing that prepares me. Now, truthfulness, real quickly, can deal with two things. First of all, it can deal with content. Truthfulness of the Word of God. The truthfulness that Christ is. Truth in a general sense. But that is not essentially what is being dealt with here when we're dealing with truthfulness. We're going to deal with truth as it relates to content when it comes to the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. That becomes the weapon I use to fight the war. But the truth that is being dealt with here, this belt that wraps around me and pulls in all the loose ends of my life, is truthfulness as in sincerity undefiled purity of commitment. You got that? Wrap yourself with the belt of a pure commitment, an absolute commitment to the warfare that God has set before you. A pure, unmitigated, unabashed commitment to Christ and to the warfare that he's called you to. I want you to note something also that unless you put this belt on first, it's very significant that this is the first piece of equipment. Unless you put this one on first, you've got nothing to hang your sword on. You understand that? When we talk about the breastplate of righteousness, that hooks right into the belt of an undefiled, pure, without hypocrisy commitment to Christ. A hypocritical commitment to Christ would be one that would be more involved in the program than in my relationship to Christ. And Paul kept warning his people, my biggest fear for you is that you would leave the purity and simplicity of love and devotion to Christ. That's the belt. that gathers in all the loose ends. And that means that the only thing I care about is him. And it gathers in all the loose ends. People to whom the book of Hebrews was written were having a problem wrapping themselves around with the belt of an undefiled commitment. They were in a place where they were going back and forth and they were sitting on the fence. and all of these things about their relationship to Christ they knew the Lord and this was a brand new experience for them it was new territory for them and it was real scary and some of them were going back to the old way and in Hebrews 12 chapter 1 the writer of the book of Hebrews writes this therefore right after 11 with all those people who walk by faith he says this therefore since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us let us run the race that is set before us run the race that is set before us. Paul St. Baker, or not Paul, the writer of Hebrews. Some think it's Paul. I'm not going to commit myself. He says, listen, he said, listen, believer, if you are a believer, then get in the race. And there's no room for believers who are kind of sitting on the track, just sitting there already, and with all the resources of God, there's no excuse. but these believers were kind of sitting on the fence didn't know if they were going to go all the way or not didn't know if they were going to run the race with everything they had or not and he said this if you're in the race run it and then he even tells us how he says this is what you do you lay aside every encumbrance you ever see a track thing where they do that I mean they take so much clothes off it's embarrassing you know I mean they just take every encumbrance everything that would slow them down and to the believer he's saying the same thing take away and get rid of all those influences that would get you to go back. Whether it's fear, discouragement, false teaching, lack of unity, get rid of all those things so you can run the race. And the sin, that's another thing that stops us, which so easily entangles us. And maybe that's the bitterness and the anger and the strife that I need to get rid of because those just serve as big boulders in the middle of the track. Big weights on my back while I'm running. It looks pretty silly. With endurance. With endurance. And let us run the race with endurance. The Greek word there is hupomone. It means this. It just means this. Keep on going. Keep on going. Get rid of everything that's slowing you down. Deal with that sin that's tripping you up. And keep on going. I don't want to sound snipey or anything like that, but you and I have both, all of us, gotten into this kind of thing where we kind of are 100-yard dash people. We can go, wham-o, get all-sighted and really go. At the end of that, we just peter out and it's over. Run this race with endurance. I want to tell you something else. That word endurance doesn't mean run slow. We've got a long way to go, so we're going to go slow. It means run with everything you've got, Trusting step by step by step that for the next step, God's going to give me the strength to run it. You know what else Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9? He says, when you run the race, run to win. Run to win. Philippians 3, 14, 13 and 14. Paul says, forgetting what is behind and reaching out to what is ahead. I press on and I'm not looking back. I keep on growing. and I keep on changing and I keep on moving to new territory and please don't tell me to slow down because I'm pressing on. You know something very enlightening about that passage? We're all very familiar with it where it says I press on to the upward call of God and Christ Jesus and all that kind of thing and in the very next verse there's kind of a paragraph in my Bible and it's separated and it says all those of you who are perfect is the word, it means mature all those of you who are mature have this attitude in you also. And what is the attitude that we're supposed to have if we are mature? The attitude that mature people have is that we are pressing on, that we are not satisfied to be where we are. We want to move beyond everything I could ask or say. And the final question is this, what about those who don't? What about those who don't run the race? What about those who don't enter into the warfare? and are content to stay where we're at. I had someone say to me this week, and it was about something totally different than this. It was just in the course of a conversation. And they said, you know, you can't make people do things they don't want to do. And again, it was a totally different context, a totally different thing. But that phrase was bouncing around in my brain all week long. And I thought the truth of that began to hit me later in the week. And I thought, you know, you're absolutely right. You can't make people get saved. You know, when we bring a message of salvation to people, there's nothing. It could be the best. It could be so moving and the Spirit of God could move. But people can resist. You can't make people do it. You can't make people get committed. You can't make people grow. You can't make people read the Word. You can't make them pray. You can't make them get in the war and gird up their loins. So what do we do? What we do, first of all, is we do what Paul did. We preach it. And we exhort over and over and over again with tears if we have to, get in the race. Gird up your loins with truthfulness, with a commitment that is without hypocrisy. Bold faith, unveiled! And we lovingly, firmly, constantly bring that message over and over and over again. Please get in the race. But secondly, the truth is this, That for those who are moving and those who are committed and running the race, their responsibility is to fix their eyes on Jesus. The author and perfecter fix their eyes on Jesus. Fix their eyes on the goal. And what that means is when you begin to grow, you can't let anyone encumber you from that. You can't stop. And as much as that best friend of yours, you love them and you want to be their friend. And they're pulling you back. You've got to keep growing. Dear friend, you can't put out your fire so your friend feels comfortable. You can't do it. What you need to do is share the fire that you have got with them and ask them, hey, get in a race. High school kids, I just love you so. But I'll tell you a couple of you guys and I know some of you are on fire. But I'm telling you, if you are, and some of you gals are on fire, everyone in that group who isn't is going to try to douse it out. Don't let them. Older folks, same thing. I urge you, get in a race. Put on the armor. Break out of that insipid mediocrity. Gird up the loins of truthfulness and unbridled commitment. 1 Corinthians 9 25-27 says incredible things about this he says this Paul to the church in Corinth don't you know that those who run in a race all run but only one wins the prize run in such a way that you may win meaning give it everything you've got truthfulness without hypocrisy total commitment and everyone who competes in games exercises self-control in all things he's talking about physical sports and they understand the discipline. They then do it to receive a perishable crown, a wreath, and a war. You know, you do it to receive the prize. We do it for a prize that will never tarnish. And to me, that says it's worth it then. For that, I'll suffer the loss of all things. Therefore, I run in such a way as not without aim. I box in such a way as not beating the air. and I buffet my body and make it my slave lest possibly after I have preached to others I should find myself unfaithful. Listen, this is not lollipop Christianity anymore. We're here to discover as a body who we are. And we are here to discover as a body what he wants us to do. And we are here as a body to go into our neighborhood and find those people who have already had their lives ripped apart by the enemy and bring them back in here with their wounds bleeding all over the pews and put them back together and heal them and get a little dirty and take a few chances and share our faith. This is alive and it's real. And if it is, we've got to give it away. To touch people with the gospel. To reach out and touch them with the healing power of God in their families and in their jobs and in your relationship with that guy you share a locker with at school. And a guy you work with every day. You have within you and I have within me the power of reproductive power given to us by God. Share it. Give it away. I know it's scary. Do it anyway. But I want to tell you something. This isn't for half-committed people. It isn't for fence-sitters. It isn't for spectators. It's for soldiers. It's for soldiers. Put on a belt. Gird up your loins with an unbridled commitment. Are you ready? All of you. We're going. I know so many of you are I'm so thrilled I think the reason we're growing is because so many of you are but I want to tell you too so many of you aren't we've had new people come and some of you new people you know I don't even know some of your names and I don't know where you are I don't know where you are in this war but I want to tell you if you're new and if you've come in we don't want you to just be able to sit on the periphery we need you to get into the war with us I think for so many of us sometimes the belt can get loose can't it? you know we girded it up and we love the Lord with all our hearts and we wrap it around ourselves but it gets loose and all of a sudden those things that wouldn't tangle us start coming out again and the tunic just isn't tight anymore it's flapping around and we're in the war and we're getting tangled up and falling down and getting ready to quit. This morning, tighten it up. There's others of you who are right in the middle of the war right now. Even as I speak, Satan can be waging a war in your heart and your mind. And maybe you're ready to quit and go back and say, it's not worth it, it's too hard. I know it's real and I know it's right and the light of God's word has shined in my life and I know I've got to go there but it's too scary let me just say this to you and I don't even want you to hear me it's the words of Paul but I don't even want you to hear Paul I want you to hear Jesus God himself as he says this listen therefore my beloved brethren if you're in a war and you feel like you're losing be ye steadfast immovable always abounding keep going in the work of the Lord and here's the promise that will keep you going friend for even though you may be discouraged and hurt and ready to drop it your labor is not in vain dealing with your kids be steadfast and movable with your marriage be steadfast and immovable keep going dealing with things in the church be steadfast immovable keep going our labor is not in vain praise God let's bow and pray I thank you I thank you for the war and I thank you for the resource you give us to win it we love you Lord and we're learning to trust you fully that we can really be your church with all the power and glory that you've promised to us in Jesus' name. Amen. you
