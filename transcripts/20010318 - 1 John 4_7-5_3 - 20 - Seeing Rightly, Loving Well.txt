Last week in our continuation and discussion of what love looks like, born of our study in 1 John 4, I indicated that the agape love that John was calling for in this epistle, and in particular in this fourth chapter, is a kind of love that brings with it, by virtue of what it is, the ability to see other people rightly. As at the very least, bearers of the image of God. and that walking in an awareness of that fact about other people is at the root of what we've been calling rightly ordered love. Borrowing again from that quote by C.S. Lewis that I obviously like a lot, he said it this way, that rightly ordered love is the kind of love that is able to clearly see and discern that there are no ordinary people, that you have never met a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations, these are mortal, and their life is to ours as to that of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we work with, joke with, marry, snub, and exploit. Next to the blessed sacrament itself, your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses. Now, I think we would all agree that seeing people rightly as bearers of the image and being seen by other people the same way is a desirable thing. I mean, to be in a community of people, think about it. To be in a family or with close friends that know everything there is to know about you, but still see you as infinitely valuable, well, I think you might just feel safe in a family like that. You might just feel safe in a church like that. It might just be a context wherein which you and I could grow into the fullness of all that God has made us to be. But the question really isn't, is that desirable? The question is, is it possible? And if it is, what makes it so? Last week at the close of the sermon, I indicated that this ability to see people rightly at least begins with desire. That it begins with an awareness and an acknowledgement, maybe on the front end, that we really don't see each other very clearly and we maybe don't love each other well, but we want to, so God help us. And it brings us to a place, this call to love, of depending on God. You need to heal us and empower us to see each other rightly and love each other well. I think that's a start. A place to begin. Without desire for this, beloved, there is no hope for this. But wanting this does not fulfill this. Indeed, if last week desire was stirred in you to see people rightly and love people well, you might have walked out the door after church and kind of determined to do that, gone home with great resolve to love everybody you saw and your family and see them rightly, just can use x-ray vision right through all their stuff to the real core, only to come quickly present to the fact that something may still be missing in this process, that desire alone is not enough. And I believe that the missing piece, at least one of the major missing pieces for many of us in this is this. that desire and try as we might to see people rightly as bearers of the image. We will never be able to do it until we see ourselves rightly as bearers of the same. Until we see ourselves rightly as objects of God's affection, it's the apple of his eye. Now, in case you think I'm just doing this lovey-dovey thing here, this is the very core of John's whole epistle. John took great pains all through this epistle to establish this fact as the foundation of it all. Chapter 3, verse 1, Behold what manner of love the Father has given unto us, that we should be called the children of God, and such we are. Beloved, now we are the children of God, and everyone who has this hope fixed on him purifies himself just as he is pure. Stop right there. In other words, get this, what purifies me, use another word that we're more used to, What transforms me is not just trying to be transformed. I'm not just talking about love. I'm not the whole process of transformation. It's not just trying to be transformed or trying to be pure. But the text there says the process happens when I fix my hope on what? On the love of God for me as his beloved child. That is what has the transforming effect. Chapter 4, verse 19. We love. Why? Because he first loved us. It started there. That's the foundation. And if you don't know and you don't believe the love of God for you first, you're going to have a very difficult time seeing people rightly or loving them well. You may want to. You may know it's the right thing to do. You may even try to, but you'll always be operating out of this vacuum, out of this sense of emptiness, maybe hoping that if you love enough, it will somehow even fill this emptiness you have. In fact, in verse 16 of chapter 4, John speaks of this in a very personal way, of himself when he says, and we have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. And once again, if you don't know that, believe that, or if you have forgotten that, you have a very difficult time seeing others rightly, loving others well, because you can't give what you don't have. Let me say it this way. I do not believe that I can see you rightly, or love you well until I see him rightly as the God of love and mercy and grace and then see myself rightly as being in him. Scripture speaks a lot of Christ being in us, Christ in you, the hope of glory. You are the temple of God, the dwelling place of God. But Scripture also speaks in this kind of obscure way of us being in him. Galatians 3.27, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself in Christ. So let me say this little phrase that's kind of the thesis of my talk this morning, evening. I'll get it right tomorrow. I do not believe that I can see you rightly or love you well until I see him rightly and then see myself rightly in him. Let me ask you a question. It's going to sound like an odd question. I'll unpack it a little bit. What are you in? I don't think like that. I don't talk like that. Okay, let me ask it this way. What do you wear to protect yourself? What do you clothe yourself with? What do you surround yourself with to convince you that you have value? I think you probably do wear something. You may not be aware of it. What do you clothe yourself with, surround yourself with, to confirm to yourself that you are, in fact, the bearer of the image, a bearer of the image, the beloved child of God, the dwelling place of God. And the reason I ask all that is this, because while I believe that many of us are blind to the image of God in other people, a point we made in a big way last week, I also believe that many more of us are blind to the image of God in ourselves. Indeed, if truth were told, many of us find it easier to see the life of God in other people and believe it to be true of them than to see it in the mirror and believe it to be true of ourselves. So we put things on. What do you mean, we put things on? Coming from this sense of not knowing that I really do bear the image and that I am the beloved of God, I try to construct this image that will maybe make me more lovable. Construct an image that we desperately hope will somehow make us more noticeable, desirable, and then lovable. And if we're really good at it, we can actually begin to believe that the image that we've created is who we really are. But it isn't. Indeed, this image we've created isn't anybody real. Instead, it's what Thomas Merton calls our illusory self. It's what Brendan Manning calls our imposter self. It's what our own Judy Haugen calls our false self. Our own Judy Haugen. Right in there with Thomas Merton and Brennan Manning. Judy Haugen says, who is Judy Haugen? A couple weeks ago, I was given, I don't know if it was Scott or Jan, who gave me a tape of Judy on the subject of false self, true self. Judy is a regular here at Open Door as a teacher in our training center, community groups, leadership training. She's been at Northwestern College for eight years. She's been here at Open Door for nine. But the reason Scott or Jan, whoever gave me the tape, gave me the tape was because they could tell that where we were going with this love stuff and what she had been teaching in our leadership development stuff was really a match and needed to go together. So they gave me the tape and wondered if it would help at all. I listened to it four times. That's usually a clue that I liked what was there. In fact, so central do I believe that what Judy talked about is to what we're talking about these last weeks, and especially this week, to our ability to access and live out an authentic life of love that I asked Judy, along with our message team, to come back next week and unpack this a little bit more for us. Judy's going to be here next week when I'm in Belfast. But until then, let me give you this. In fact, one of the things I said to Scott after I got this tape of hers, I said, either I want her to speak or I'm stealing it. Either way, I'm going to steal all her stuff and not give her any credit at all. Let me give you this in terms of this false self, true self. And just work through some of the language here. I think you'll get this. Judy identifies, and I think rightly, the false self, this image we create to try to make ourselves more lovable as the self created outside the mind of God. I'm quoting her here. It seeks to live its life and be good apart from God. Because it is an illusory self, or what I refer to as this image we try to create, its focus is entirely external. If it were to look underneath the mask it has created, it would be terrified because there isn't anything behind the mask. Judy then identifies two common manifestations of the false self, and this is what I found the most helpful in connecting up with what I wanted to talk to today. She talks about a competent false self and then a degraded false self. Competent false self works like this. In response to all the negative messages we receive from a variety of sources in innumerable ways that we are irredeemably defective and we must earn love to get love, the competent false self rises up and says, then I will earn love. I will do what I have to do to get what I have to get. I will shut up these negative voices by proving through my competence and my performance that I am not irredeemably defective. Setting into motion what is almost a frantic drive, born of a desperate need to acquire what Judy calls external emblems of success, esteem, power, and security. Now, over the years here at Open Door, we have referred to this kind of person as the performer. This is the person who may be doing all sorts of positive things, but they're doing what they're doing in positive. I mean, these things they're doing are positive, but they're doing them to win the love of God and to somehow win the approval of people because they never quite feel like they have it. Brennan Manning in Abba's Child has maybe the best description of the person that we're talking about here when he refers to that part in all of us that tends to this as the imposter. Let me just read to you his description of the imposter and see if you notice anybody that you know. Maybe yourself. Imposters are preoccupied with acceptance and approval. Because of their suffocating need to please other people, they cannot say no with the same confidence with which they say yes. And so they overextend themselves in people, projects, and causes motivated not by personal commitments, but by the fear of not living up to other people's expectations. Living out of the false self creates a compulsive desire to present a perfect image to the public so that everybody will admire us, but nobody will know us. The false self buys into outside experiences to furnish a personal source of meaning. The pursuit of money, power, glamour, sexual prowess, recognition, and status enhances one's self-importance and creates the illusion of success. For many years, Manning admits here, I hid from my true self through my performance in ministry. I constructed an identity through sermons, books, and storytelling. I rationalized that if the majority of Christians thought well of me, there was nothing wrong with me. The more I invested in ministerial success, the more real the imposter became. the imposter prompts us to attach importance to what has no importance clothing with a false glitter what is least substantial and turning us away from what is real the false self causes us to live in a world of delusion the imposter is a liar maybe the best biblical example of this competent false self to borrow Judy's words this competent false self is the religious Pharisee religious Pharisees as you know they prayed aloud and long for everyone to hear. They gave large amounts of money when people were looking. They showed up at church every time the doors were open, but they had no authentic interior life of love or faith. Jesus called them whitewashed sepulchers full of dead men's bones who polished the outside of the cup and of the bowl to appear to be something that they aren't. And because these Pharisees and these competent to false self people evaluate themselves entirely on external things, how they look, how they perform, the bottom line in terms of their relationships is this. Where that goes in relationships is this, that they will evaluate everybody else on externals as well, which means this, that they can't possibly see people rightly. This is where this all ties in with love and how we relate to each other. They can't possibly love each other well. Indeed, these Pharisees, as you know from our study in this from time to time, were among the most arrogant, self-righteous, judgmental, petty, and small people on the planet, entirely lacking love. Judy identifies this other false self as the degraded false self. Now, the degraded false self is much like the competent false self in this regard. Both the competent false self and degraded false self focuses on externals. But unlike the competent false self, the degraded false self believes and accepts all the negative messages. You're a bum? I know I am. You're a loser? I know you're right. Based on the evidence provided by my own incompetent performance, I guess I am a bum. I guess I don't have any value. The negative messages are right. And this person lives with guilt and shame as kind of the way of existence. Now, breaking out of this false self system is not an easy thing to do. Neither is it an automatic thing. I wish it was. I want it to be, but it isn't. In other words, just because I got saved does not necessarily mean I automatically abandon my false self way of relating. I mean, I don't know, but I think you know that's true of yourself, probably. How many of you still struggle with sometimes what almost feels like a frantic need to look good and be right? How many of you still struggle, but maybe you've been saved for many, many years with a pervasive sense of guilt and shame if you don't look good? Or didn't do it right? How many of you go back and forth from feeling pretty good today because your competent false self looked good and didn't make any mistakes, at least not in public? And then you trip up in some way and you just dive into this pit of shame and guilt and you kind of go back and forth from how many of you do that? I thought I would all just go away. I want it to go away. It doesn't go away. You know why? Because there are no magic wands in this. We want a magic wand. I want a quick fix. That's why I go to the Holy Spirit Conference. I think there's a lot of good reasons to go to the Holy Spirit Conference. And I've had, and I'm just using that as kind of this analogy. And I've had major experiences with these events. And I want a swooning, and I want a filling, and I want a healing. And I want a big thing for me. I want it done. I want it. Tell me a way to get it done. but the process of transformation beloved is just that it is a process whereby over time i learned to live less and less in the arrogance on one hand or self-condemnation on the other hand of my false self and i learned to live more and more in the fullness and freedom of my belovedness as a child of god as i learned to live more and more in this process more and more in the fullness and freedom of my true self, which is hidden with God in Christ. Now, one of the most helpful things to me in my process of transformation, where I'm learning more and more to live less and less out of the false self and more and more out of the true self, is when people share with me in authentic ways their process. I mean, hearing that helps me. That's why relationships are important. That's why community matters. That's also why Philippians chapter 3 is such a gift to us. I want you to open your Bibles right now. Turn in your Bibles to Philippians chapter 3. If you would, if you have them. Because it is there that the Apostle Paul himself shares with us in a very personal and an intimate way his struggle with what I'm calling today the false self. beginning in verse 4 Paul says in effect this I'm not above this what Dave is talking about today I'm not beyond this indeed look at verse 4 middle of verse 4 if anyone has a mind or a tendency or a bent to put confidence in the flesh I far more let me just kind of translate that into words that we're using this evening if anyone has a tendency to do things and find ways, to inflate the false self, to create this image so people think well of them, I far more. This is the bent of my life, says the Apostle Paul. And then he makes a list of all the external things in his life that over the years he's tended to use as his source of security, confidence, power, and esteem. Look at verse 5. Circumcise the eighth day, that's one thing. that I used to create this image of the nation Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, as to the law of Pharisee, as to zeal, a persecutor of the church, as to the righteousness which is in the law found blameless. Now, what those things are, not as important as how Paul is using them. You see, I'm not that impressed that he got circumcised the eighth. day. In fact, in the Greek, it's kind of interesting here. It says, circumcised, the literal Greek is, as it relates to circumcision, an eighth dayer. So he's walking around going, yeah, circumcised, I am not, I don't have, big deal. And I don't think anybody here is getting any sense of value from that. I don't see anybody walking around here going, yeah, circumcised. It's not going to work. It just doesn't have any big deal. The fact that he was of the nation Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, does nothing to give him any kind of credibility or status among us. But it gave him status then. And the way he's using these emblems of status is to create for himself with them a patchwork of an identity, like a collage, behind which he can feel secure, behind which he can feel confident. Circumcise the eighth day. Again, it means nothing to you, but he'll put that out here and go, that's something I want you to see about me. A Hebrew of Hebrews, that's something else I want you to see about me. Of the tribe of Benjamin, I want you to see about that. A Pharisee of Pharisees. And all these things were little things out here that he constructed and worked really hard to get. And he put this thing right out here so that you would see this. And when he walked out in public and he moved among people, what he wanted you to see was what he presented to you. And that was those things there. Again, none of them mean anything to you. So where you need to intersect with this text is what are the things you use to create your little patchwork of identity. None of those is what you use. What do you use? On the way to Damascus one day, behind the strength of his false self, feeling incredibly confident, I'm quite sure, God gave him a gift. It came in a very painful way as these gifts often do, as many of you could give testimony to the fact, especially if you've got a very competent false self, meaning you've got this image that looks really good and everybody just thinks you're the greatest. What finally kind of got that thing to fall apart was some crisis in your life. Well, Paul is going to get a crisis on the road to Damascus. God literally hits him upside the head, knocks him off his horse, and blinds him in order that he can see. And what he is able to see spiritually, even though now he is physically blind by this encounter with God is this, that this false self that he has constructed, that impresses everybody around him, in fact, has no power at all to protect him, secure him, or keep him. That in all of his external competence and all of his external splendor, he is but a cardboard cutout of a man. He has a shiny but paper-thin veneer that fooled even him, but not anymore. Thomas Merton in his book, Palace of Nowhere, says this, Every one of us is shadowed by an illusory person, a false self. This is the person I want myself to be, but who cannot exist, because God does not know anything about him. And to be unknown of God is altogether too much privacy. My false and private self is the one who wants to exist outside the reach of God's will, outside the reach of God's love, outside of reality, and outside of life. and such a self cannot help but be an illusion. We are not very good at recognizing illusions, least of all the ones that we cherish about ourselves. And among the reasons that we can't see the illusions, the false self that we've created and how it really is false, among the reasons we can't see those things, I think is because we're afraid. That's why I'm blind at times to the false self that I want to create, because I'm afraid. What are you afraid of? Well, Merton goes on to describe what we're afraid of. We're afraid that there isn't any substance under the things with which I'm clothed. We're afraid that we will be discovered as being hollow, and our structure of pleasures and ambitions has no foundation, and when they're gone, there will be nothing left of me but my own nakedness, emptiness, and hollowness to tell me that I am my own mistake. Does that touch anything inside you? Well, the Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus had his greatest fear realized. If that would have been me, that would have been my greatest fear realized. I'm going to be exposed. This patchwork identity that he had spent his entire life constructing and then holding together, presenting to people and patching up where he needed to from time to time, was on the road to Damascus, exposed as being as flimsy as it really was. And there he was before God, naked, without anything at all to protect himself. Now, at that point, Paul had some choices to make. He had some options. And by the way, we have options too. If you ever get to one of those places where the false self that you're presenting to the world just becomes dismantled and starts crashing down, your performance doesn't look good anymore, you said it wrong this time, whatever, it's crumbling, you've got some options. So did Paul. Option number one, Paul could have shifted from living out of his competent false self, going to Damascus, feeling really big, feeling really strong. He could have just shifted from the competent self and gone to living out of the degraded self. He could have just sat there on the side of the road and said things like this, it's all gone. My cover is blown. I've been exposed. I really am a bum, a total loser, and then accept it. I'll take my place at the end of the line. And he could have chosen to live in shame and guilt for the rest of his life. Option number two, to suffer through the momentary humiliation, but then pick up the pieces of his shattered false self and rebuild his false self. Kind of go underground. I know this is going to take some time, and I'm humiliated for a while here, but I'm just going to back off, kind of lower my profile, what Clinton ought to do, you know, just kind of get invisible for a while. But then, just very carefully, if all those pieces are going to, Pick them up real quietly while no one's looking and put them back. Just put them all back. And over time, I'll rebuild this whole thing and then be able to go out in public again. Redouble his efforts. Work harder than ever. Try, try again. How noble. Try, try again. If you first don't succeed at keeping your false self intact. There's a third option that was available to Paul. and it's also available to you and it's available to me. It's the gospel that we preach. The third option is this, to repent and believe that the gospel is true. And by the way, the person who's going to hear that as the best news on earth is the person whose false self has just been exposed as being as flimsy as it is. So some of you who didn't want to come to church because your life was falling apart today, this is exactly where you belong today. It may be that nobody else is really going to even be moved by this word. The third option is to repent and believe that the gospel is true. Borrowing Frederick Buechner's words, we can turn around and believe that the good news that we are loved, even in this naked, exposed place, is better and more full than we have ever dared hope. And that to believe in that good news, to live out of it, to be in love with it, and the author of it, is of all glad things in this world, the gladdest thing of all. Well, to Paul's eternal credit, to Paul's eternal benefit, and quite frankly, to our eternal benefit, Paul chose the third option. He didn't just shift from a positive false self to a negative one. He didn't try to rebuild his false self. He repented and believed that the gospel was true in his nakedness. with nothing to protect him. He went running for the clothing that is provided only through the amazing grace of God and intimacy with God. Listen to his running to this. My paraphrase of the next few verses. This is after he talked about his false self and how he used to get his life from that. Now he says this. I used to spend, this is my paraphrase again, I used to spend all the energy of my life constructing, projecting, and protecting an image that I later came to discover had no power to hold me, secure me, or protect me. But oh, how my ambitions have changed. For whatever things, verse 7, were gained to me, these things I count as lost for the sake of Christ. Indeed, I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, but don't feel sorry for me. For I count them as rubbish in order that I may gain Christ and that I may be found in him. In him. There's that word. What are you in? That I may be found in him, clothed in him, wearing him, not my performance, but now wearing him and his grace and his love and his declaration that I am his child. No longer wearing a righteousness of my own, derived from my own performance of the law, that simply inflated my false self, because every time I did the law, it just made me feel better out here. But now a righteousness or a clothing, which comes and is acquired by believing in Christ as my only hope. A righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith. The passion of my life, The essential energy of my soul, would say Paul, is this. I spend all my energy now in a different direction. I spend it all now trying to figure out ways that I may know him. And the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings. Being conformed even to the image of his death. And then he adds in verse 12, I think importantly, not that I've arrived. I have not obtained it yet. In other words, what? There wasn't a magic wand even for me. Always want a magic wand. not even one for him. I haven't arrived. I haven't obtained it. But the trajectory of my life is set. I press on in one direction that I may lay hold of that which I was also laid hold of by Christ Jesus. And that which laid hold of him was the furious love of God, was the amazing grace of God. Here's the deal, beloved, to pull this together. When we begin to see him rightly, as a God of love, mercy, and amazing grace, as the God who loved us first, then we begin to see ourselves rightly as being in him, as being ourselves the beloved children of God. It is then, it is only then, that we will begin to see each other rightly and love each other well. And that is why, beloved, the stated vision of our church is simply this, that we will labor till Christ be formed in you. Why? Because as the life and love and heart of God through Christ is being formed in you, and Christ is dwelling in your hearts more and more, richer and richer through faith, is being formed more and more in you, more and more you will be seeing him rightly. And more and more you will be seeing yourself rightly as being in him. And as that happens, more and more you will be able to see each other rightly as bearers of the image. And more and more we will be learning to love each other well. Not that we've arrived. Not that we've obtained it or become perfect. No. We still have a mind. I still have a mind to put confidence in the flesh. In fact, if anyone in this church has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more. but I tell you what the deepest desire of my heart and if we could corporately say it the deepest desire of our heart is clear indeed the covenant that we are inviting people into is a community of faith here at open door is set here is what it is we want to know him that's what we want to do together we want to know him more and more and more. We want to be found in him and be just like him. We want to press on in order that we may fully lay hold of that which has laid hold of us, the life and love and grace of God. Let me ask you a question. Do you think that if we more and more and more began to experience this kind of thing, people among us would get loved more and more and more? Do you think if you were able to see him rightly and see yourself rightly, people among us would be healed? People among us would be redeemed? The city called Minneapolis would be affected? I absolutely believe that. I think it's how it happens. His name was John. He lived in Milwaukee. He taught high school. He died in 1987. John was a flawed man. With inconsistencies and irritabilities, he was an ordinary person. He never wrote a book. He never appeared on TV. He never converted to masses. He didn't gather a reputation for holiness. But he was a man whose soul was seduced and ravished by Jesus. Thus writing in his journal these words to himself and made available to us when his daughter found them and published them. Here's what he wrote to himself. John, the heart of it is this, to define yourself radically as one beloved by God. In repentance, therefore, take your shadow self to the cross and dare to live as a forgiven man. And to laugh, after all, at the preposterous idea of your worthiness. God's love for you and his choice of you constitute your worth. This is the essence of your true self, not possessions, not talent, esteem, reputation, not applause or appreciation. I stand anchored now in God, John says, before whom I stand naked, without my shadow self to protect me. I stand before this God who says to me, the real me, you are my beloved child, John. You are my chosen one, John. Isaiah 43 says it this way. don't be afraid for I've redeemed you I have called you by name and you are mine the mountains may depart the hills may be shaken but my love for you will never be diminished and my covenant of peace with you will stand forever and beloved that is what has the power to draw out the imposter that is what reveals the emptiness of the false self. That is what empowers us to live in the fullness of our new identity in Christ. You see, it's something more compelling than fear. It's the love of God, our Abba. It's something more powerful than law, amazing grace. It's something more motivating than the threat of loss, the possibility of great gain. That I may gain Christ, that I may know him intimately, that I may be found in him, that I may be just like him. No, I haven't arrived. And yes, I wish there was a magic wand. But the course of my life is set. I'm going to press on toward the upward call of God in Christ, which means more and more and more, my passion is to know him, be found in him, be just like him, more and more and more to see him rightly, more and more and more to see myself as being rightly in him. loved by him and because that's true more and more and more be able to see you rightly and love you well let me close with these words by Henry Nouwen in his wonderful book Life of the Beloved when the night is bad and my nerves are shattered and infinity speaks when God Almighty He shares through his son the depth of his feelings for me. When his love flashes into my soul and I am overtaken by mystery, it's time to decide. Shivering in the rags of my 59 years, I decide either to escape into skepticism or run to intellectualism or, with radical amazement, surrender in faith to the truth that I am loved by God. Repent and believe that the gospel is true. And as we more and more and more come to believe that and find ourselves in relationships that confirm that, more and more and more we will be able to see him rightly. And more and more and more we will be able to see ourselves rightly as being in him. And from that place we will be able to more and more and more see each other rightly as bearers of the image, learning more and more and more to love each other well. I didn't mean to do it. I didn't set out at the beginning of this week to accomplish this, but what I did this week, whether you know it or not, was preach our vision, was to declare why we're here as a church and what we're about. Because what we're about is this. It all comes down to this. we will labor together till Christ be formed in you. More and more and more. That is the passion. That more and more and more. It's why we do everything we do. From preaching and worship to recovery groups and calls to service. From pleas for stewardship and giving to a membership process that is calling our people into covenantal community. And if you don't know what that means, then get in the membership process. From trips to Haiti to ministering to our children's hearts, the vision, the passion is this. Till Christ be formed in you more and more and more. And no, we haven't arrived. But more and more and more, it's what we want. And more and more and more, it's where we're going. and as we do that we will find ourselves being healed and we will find ourselves growing and we will find ourselves serving more and more and more and as we more and more and more see him rightly and see ourselves rightly as being in him we will more and most see each other rightly and love each other well that's why we're here and from there it goes. Let's pray as we close. Father, I pray that you would take this word and bear much fruit. And I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
