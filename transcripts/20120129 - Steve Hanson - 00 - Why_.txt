Just a few weeks ago, sometime in mid-September, I sit up here with Cheryl and Steve Hansen to recognize and celebrate 25 years of ministry here on staff at Open Door, particularly Steve being on staff at Open Door. And today I'm going to be standing here again with Steve, who will come up in just a moment, to recognize and celebrate a pretty significant shift in all of that, where Steve, while still connected to our church in very meaningful ways, is moving from the staff position that he's held in this church for so many years, and we just want to tell you a little bit about that today. The process involved in coming to this was actually, actually, quite exciting. As we began to consider some possibilities that were a little outside the box, but in some ways they were actually dream come true kinds of things to Steve as we came to realize. Fact is, over the last several years, Steve's passion for and called to the least and the lost in places like Haiti and Africa and Indonesia and other places all around the world as well has grown. And so has his vision for Beyond Our Door, which is what we've called his particular ministry in our church, Beyond Our Doors Ministry. So that last year, when we started having conversations about this kind of thing with Steve, and particularly about our new staff structure and inviting him into joining this new lead team that we've recently formed and we've told you all about. We started to wonder with Steve if his vision and direction would be better served by doing what he's doing connected to Open Door but outside of Open Door. And so it is today I'm declaring and kind of announcing to all of you what many of you already know. It's this that instead of joining the lead team, Steve chose to pursue this dream of Beyond Our Doors as being an independent, non-profit organization. Now, while Steve is in fact leaving our staff, he is not leaving our church, and that is very good news. Indeed, we're going to be doing what he's doing in partnership with him, have a financial and ministry agreement with him, where for the next, at least the next five years, we will continue to hear from Steve annually and continue to interact with him and with our partners in places, again, like Haiti and Africa and Indonesia. All of which means this, that Steve will continue to have a presence around here. Although he's no longer on staff, he will continue to be a pastor of Church of the Open Door. He will be here on the weekends that he's not out of the country doing other things in other places. And when he's here, he'll be hanging out in a gathering place, putting smiles on people's faces and giving hairstyle advice. to anyone who's stupid enough to ask. Come on up here. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Just a quick word. As we were praying last night before the service and asking Steve, what can we pray for you about? And he just kind of expressed some nervousness about doing this talk. But then it kind of dawned on him out loud that I've been preparing this talk for 25 years. And you have been planting these seeds for 25 years. And the things that were very fragile have grown tall and strong. And it speaks to substance. It speaks to longevity. It speaks to passion. And it speaks to you. And we're very grateful for you. Thank you. We love you. Thank you. God bless you. Now, you don't refer to me as Pastor Hansen anymore. You refer to me as President Hanson. Or Executive Director Hanson. Or Steve. I want to say thank you to David Johnson. I want to say thank you to the executive team at Church of the Open Door. And the governing board. For listening to me. When sometimes I couldn't even hear me. For seeing me when I felt invisible. For asking me some questions, thoughtful and profound questions. And then listening to my answers. And those questions and those answers have led to this new ministry. This new non-profit, this new 501c3 with an old name beyond our door. This new ministry with 25 years of history. And that 25 years of history with Pastor Deojan in Haiti, that 25 years with Dr. Katanga in the Kawangori slum of Nairobi, Kenya, 25 years with Pastor Josiah Usaba in Kampala, Uganda. History that began right here at Open Door. By some of you in this room. And you know who you are. And so I'm so grateful to have this opportunity to share this morning about what's on my heart and what's on our heart. and how we can proceed. Let's pray. Lord, I pray that on behalf of Deosian and his people, on behalf of Dr. Katanga and his people, on behalf of Usaba and his people, that you might make my words clear. That you might make me a vessel who speaks up for those living in misery and I pray that you might give us ears to hear our part. In the name of Jesus, I pray it. Amen. This morning I'm going to be asking you to continue adding to that history. I'm going to be asking you to take that card in your bulletin and take it home and read it. Take it home and consider giving us your contact information so we can communicate. I'm going to ask you to continue to pray about is there something on that list of sponsorships that you might be a part of just to join us in those things. This morning I want to begin by sharing two images of two two-year-old boys. I want to introduce you to two two-year-old boys. One is my grandson, Max. And that's the best you can do. And that's the best you can do. That's my grandson, Max. He's two years old, and Max knows all about books. Max knows all about baths. He knows all about bedtime stories, about hugs, toy trucks, balls, Legos, and hopefully soon Lincoln Logs. But I need you, who have Lincoln Logs in your closet and you're finished with, to contact me. Max knows about the zoo. He knows about Minnehaha Falls. He knows about camping on the North Shore. He knows about bike riding with his mom and dad. On Fridays, he comes over to my house and my wife's house. On a Friday morning at 9 o'clock, we go over to Jack's Bakery for a chocolate-covered donut. He loves that, and I do as well. Max's life will be defined by choices and opportunities, And they will because he's born in the States. He has a mom and a dad who are committed to each other, who intentionally planned his birth. All this will give Max a huge head start amongst two-year-olds of our world, for which I am humbly grateful. And Max can take his head start, make some good choices, and get some luck. And who knows where that can lead. I want to introduce you to another two year old and his name is Ronnie Max and Ronnie are two they're both boys but their experience will be totally different Ronnie is born in Port-au-Prince he was born underneath a tarp in the La Plaza tent city a tent city of about 20,000 people it's one of 1,400 tent cities as a result of the January 12, 2010 earthquake. An earthquake that found its epicenter right downtown Port-au-Prince. An earthquake that buried some 300,000 people that left half the city homeless in less than 50 seconds. To a city, to a country that didn't have a word for earthquake. Ronnie's mother, I don't know what her name is, but she appears to be somewhere in her teens, middle to late teens. And my hunch is she'll know nothing about children's books. She'll know nothing about toy trucks, the zoo, waterfalls, bikes, balls, or Legos. But I'll bet you she'll know about hunger. I bet she knows about heat. And I bet she knows about filth. I'm guessing Ronnie wasn't conceived because of two consenting adults. I'm guessing he was probably conceived because of a group of boys in the evening found a tent, opened a flap, and they had their way with a young lady. And her screams were unheard. Ronnie, like his mom, will have few choices, few opportunities, and almost no voice. These are two boys, two two-year-old boys. Take these two two-year-old boys and put them on the world stage with other two-year-old boys. My guess is Ronnie's probably closer to the norm than Max. I just want you this morning to let that in. There's probably more Ronnie's and his experience than Max and his experience. When you consider the fact that the 7 billion people on this globe, two-thirds of them live on $2 a day or less, have little or no access to clean water, health care, or education, there's probably more Ronnie's. This morning, Max and us are probably the world's minority, and Ronnie and his mother, family, and friends are probably the majority. Since the earthquake, since the earth moved in Port-au-Prince several years ago, something's changed in me. It's like since that moment and the tremors that followed that next 40 hours until we were able to leave, I have images in my brain and smells in my brain of decaying people. I have images in my brain of dogs and chickens and pigs pecking and chewing on people. I have images in my brains of people crying, of people walking with this distant, disconnected look with toothpaste in their nose so they didn't have to smell the smells, dust and dirt. Confused looks. For people that didn't have a word, earthquake. And since that time I've thought about maybe obsessed a lot about the poor. See you take the word poor and you add to it disease like cholera or malaria or HIV and you don't have poor anymore. You have misery. So you take the word poor and add to it civil war or gender abuse or forced labor. You don't have poor anymore. Did you know that forced labor, slavery, is bigger today than ever before in the world history? There's more children, more women, more men, slaves than ever before. You take the poor and add to it natural disaster like a hurricane, typhoon, a drought, or an earthquake. And you have that happen in an impoverished, corrupt country. And you don't have poor anymore. You have misery. You have misery. Some people aren't just poor. In fact, I know poor who are living in misery who would like to be just poor. I know poor that would like to be just poor. They live every day in misery every day. Next week will be the same. The following week will be the same. And there's no hope for change. And that just kind of wears on you. In Proverbs 31 9, the author of those words says, Steve, speak up for those who can't speak up. Speak up for those that can't speak. Speak up for those that have no voice. Speak up for the rights of those living in misery. Speak up for justice. Against injustice. Speak up for the poor and the needy. And those words in Proverbs 31, they're words of God. they're inspired words of God just like John 3.16 the first verse I memorized and probably many of you did just like the 23rd Psalm just like the Lord's Prayer just like Romans 12.1 and 2 just like Hebrews 1 and 2 these are words of God these also are words of God and just as important there are thousands of words in this book about what we're talking about about the least of these about the ignored, the overlooked, the orphaned, the widow, the hungry, the sick. And responding to what we see is a major theme in this book. And since 4.53 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon, January 12th, I felt, as the earth moved, a renewed call to speak up. I felt a renewed vision. Something changed in my heart. something changed in my head. And that change was hard to put words around. But we have. And these are the words of our mission statement for Beyond Our Door. And I want to read them to you. We invite those who are keenly aware of their abundance and humbly grateful. We invite Max to join us in offering hope and healing to the most vulnerable, Ronnie. especially women and children, through carefully chosen and entrusted indigenous leaders beyond our door. These words just wasn't written over the last several months as we formed this new nonprofit. They've been written over 25 years right here. They were shaped and formed right here by people in this room. And many of you can see the outline in this mission statement. You understand abundance. You understand being humbly grateful. You understand the heart of God. You understand Dio's passion for the poor. You understand Katanga's passion for the poor. Usaba's passion for the poor. One person at a time, especially women and children. There's a letter in the New Testament written by James, the brother of Jesus, and he's writing to Christians. that are scattered all around the world. Christians scattered all around the world. Been forced away from their land, away from their home, away from their church, away from their family, away from their language, away from their clothes, their food. Away, away. And now they're in a different world. And James' word to them is religion or worship that God thinks is pure and faultless. now think about reading that phrase and if you didn't know this verse what would follow if you were writing this religion that God thinks is pure and faultless in my list would be totally different than what James is writing here until God thinks religion that's pure and faultless is looking after visiting, caring for, reaching out to the orphan and the widow the homeless, the loveless the ignored, the overlooked, those with no voice those that are in the margins to look after, to care for and anytime God or anybody in this book, Jesus visited, crossed paths with there was life delivered when Jesus crossed paths with four fishermen changed their life when Jesus crossed the path of a leper or a blind man or a crippled man or a 12-year-old girl who was dead. Something changed because he saw something and responded, because he noticed something and responded, because he knew he wanted them and they wanted him. When Jesus crossed the path of a woman at a well, his words, if you only knew, if you only knew how good I am, you wouldn't be settling for what you're settling for. he crossed paths with a woman that probably had this much voice and radically changed her life over the past 25 years we've visited people who are like those kinds of people and I want to invite you to visit with me for the next couple minutes I want to invite you to visit Uganda the city of Kaswa in a church called Kaswa Seventh-day Adventist. A church that 10 years ago I had a chance to visit. And while I was in that church, there was a group of leaders from the community meeting and wanted to give me a presentation. And this is that church. A church that has no roof, has a dirt floor, no windows, no doors. And so I'm the American walking into the church and there's a bunch of people wanting to teach me or tell me something. And what would you guess they want to tell me. Join us in finishing our church. They didn't. What they wanted to tell me was would you join us in assisting the grandmothers in our community who because of the death of their kids are now needing to take care of their grandkids. See HIV was taking a whole generation of people in southern Uganda. There's more orphans in southern Uganda because of HIV than any place in the world. And this church and other churches in the area had noticed that, and they were coming together, putting everything on hold. We don't have time to argue about baptism. We don't have time to talk about how you spell God. We don't have time to talk about how you do this and this and this because there are grandmothers that are needing assistance. Grandmothers are stepping up to take care of their grandkids because their parents are dead. And they said, Steve, would you join us? and you know what we've done since that time? We, I'm talking about we, we built 40 homes. 40 homes. First of all, the first slide is going to be of a grandmother, I think. This is a second home, a second woman that we joined and these were her grandchildren and she's at the age where it's really difficult to care for kids. These six dresses here were sold by several ladies in this church, by the way. I've had a chance over the years to deliver about a thousand, maybe more, brand new dresses, handmade. And this may mean nothing to anybody except the fact that, see, because we have new clothes on all the time, but do you know what a smell of new clothes is like? For these people, they've never smelled new clothes. And for these little girls that put on a new dress, it's like wonderful. Well, some ladies in this church have helped us do that. We built her house. This is a picture. and we built 40 of these for zero over these years this partnership with Pastor Yusaba we built 40 homes for grandmothers who've inherited their grandkids so these grandmothers have an opportunity to leave their grandkids with something they've taken that responsibility and that's in southern Uganda with Pastor Yusaba and not only have we been I want to also show you the picture of the church before I move on. They never asked for anything. I remember speaking some of these words 10 years ago in this church and somebody came up to me after the service and said, Steve, we grew up in this kind of a church background and we had such a positive experience and we'd like, could we assist in finishing that church? And I said, well, let me check with my partners and I'll see. And they gave me a check several weeks later, and that's the result. They never asked for the church, but now that is the community center in that area where people come together and discuss the needs of that area. Not only do we build homes with our partner in that area, but also we provide small business loans. You know, if you find an active poor who has a good income-producing idea, You can change her life. It can go from being 50 cents a day to $1 a day, $3 a day, without a lot of work. You provide a woman with a good business head some capital, she can go from what she was doing to what she's doing. It radically changes her life. And these women get together in small groups that are tied to the church. They talk about hygiene, they talk about family, they talk about marriage, They talk about God. Join us. Join us in continuing to do small business loans to the active poor. In Kenya, in the area of the Kawangori slum, remember 22 years ago I met David Katanga. David Katanga was a pastor in Nairobi, a large Baptist church, and he also was an overseer of about 100, 150 pastors throughout Africa. And he had just gotten back from an extended short-term mission team to southern Sudan. And he said, Steve, I'm leaving my church. Steve, I'm leaving this job of overseeing these pastors because I need to work with the poor. And I felt called to go to the Kawangori slum, a slum of 300,000 people. and said, Steve, what do you think about that? Would you join me? And I said, yes, David, I'm supporting you. We began with a Saturday morning feeding program. With children, children, come and eat. Saturday mornings, come and eat, come and eat, come and eat. And now that particular ministry has grown from a Saturday morning feeding program. It's going from that to a church of 600 called Huduma. It's a Swahili word meaning serving. A Bible school, many church plants. A school of over 1,500 children. A school of over 1,500 children. That started as a feeding program. You know, my hunch is Dr. David didn't have as his five-year plan all this planned out. It just happened because he was in the right place at the right time and the right person and serving the right God. Two HIV trade schools, one HIV clinic where HIV testing and maintenance and education and visits and emergency packages. When Elizabeth Puna, which is on the right, when she goes and visits the HIV sick and she says, they need a new mattress. We provide a new mattress. They need rice and beans. We provide rice and beans. Three times a year, Lizapunya provides what we call hope conferences where the 200 or so of our clients come together to worship and to pray together, to touch each other. HIV people are shunned in most. They pray together. They learn together. They plan together. And they learn about God together. Visit with me for a minute Haiti. 24 years ago, we met Pastor Dio. And I didn't go to Haiti to create a ministry. I went to Haiti to join one, and this is the one we joined, and joined we did. Pastor Dio at that point was a young pastor of a church of about 30, 40 people. Now there's nine churches that he calls the Ebenezer family. There was one school of about 30, 40 children. Now there's nine schools as part of the Ebenezer family. His church in Delma, which is one of the epicenters of the quake, he had a church of about 300 people. The church was almost finished. It was almost finished. And now it's rubble. Well, that church of 300 now is over 1,000. meeting underneath a tent. This past week, I see some of the team members right here in front of me. We were in Haiti and we went to a baptism. A baptism they have every month or so. A baptism of this time of 39 people in a concrete tub surrounded with people and rubble. Watching people who have learned about Jesus and now are following him in the waters of baptism. it's called transformation it's called transformation in these years these people living in tents has that showed yet? there's a million people living like that and they're not camping there's no tree and there's no lake shore and there's no river and there's no playground this is how they live outside it may be 95 degrees but go inside that tent might be 120 degrees. And we've joined Pastor Dio and some of his people in building homes and we've built now three quad. We just finished our third quad, a quad home. There's 12 families now that no longer live in tents but living in those solid, secure, safe homes. And it may not seem like a big deal unless you're one of those 12. And then it's called a miracle. in that little housing development right now. We'll start our fourth quad next week. And so far in our year of some people living there, we've had one baby born, had one marriage, one pregnancy, one engagement. It's hope. It's hope. It's hope. A number of years ago, we started the Maffi-Bochette house in Haiti. Why don't you flip that picture up here too? That home was built with coins. You all know Project Mercy. It was built with coins and some paper, which I'm grateful to. And right now there's 22 special needs children living there, a staff of 16, 17. I remember the first boy we interviewed, his name was Pukisa. I want you to show the picture of Pukisa. This is four or five years ago that we met Pukisa. They had carried him down the tree coat. He was naked. Very large head. Very large head. Couldn't hold his head up. Pukisa couldn't walk. He couldn't crawl. He would drag himself. He was filthy. We washed him up, put some clothes on him, and then Madame Dio began to ask him questions. And those folks had brought him down, which weren't his parents. And he said, please take me, Madame Dio translated, Please take me. I can go three days without eating. How does somebody know that? He knows it because he's gone three days without eating. Where Pukisa would eat would be underneath a tree. Some fruit would fall off a tree. Or in a garden where some fruit had fallen off the plant. Or off of somebody else's table. Or in the marketplace when some food had been dropped on the ground. That's how he fed himself. But we did take him. And right now he eats three meals a day. And right now he sits in a wheelchair. Right now he sleeps on a mattress. Right now he goes to school. Right now he goes to church. Several months after we took Pukisa, Madame Dio said, Steve, I need to tell you something else about Pukisa. And I say this name over and over and over because I want you to hear this. Madame Dio said, Steve, his name means Y. Bukisa in Haitian Creole means Y. He was named Y. Your names have a way of going inside, nicknames. Many of you had nicknames that were hurtful. This is his name. This is a name given to him by his mom and dad, Y. Y. His other name is Kotek, which means big head. I'm named Y Big Head I told a team that for the next team that showed up in Haiti with me that team led by Nancy Abbott one of our elders here she said we should pray about that we should think can we change his name and one of the things that team did they met in the back bedroom with Pukisa and several of the staff in that team, and they prayed over this young boy. And he prayed, blowing out that name and breathing in a new name. And his new name was Kenz Pierre, named after Pastor Dio and Madame Dio. His new nickname is Kenzie. And that was a moment of him of transformation, such that he wrote the music and the words to a song, a song that every team that goes down there has an opportunity to hear. And this is him singing at the fourth anniversary party that we just had several weeks ago with different parents who were able to come. So I invite you to listen to Kenzie Pierre singing Thank You, Jesus, for Maffie Bouchette. You transformed my life. Thank you. Jésus, merci Seigneur, merci Seigneur. Pourquoi t'es où, t'es joigné moi? Pourquoi t'es où, t'es pas moi? Où m'est-ce que mes filles, beau chère? Merci pour j'en vous transformé moi. Merci à peu, Jésus. Amen. Amen. Right behind Kenzie, you didn't see her face, was a girl by the name of Shelom. And if you were watching her, you might have seen her also enter into that worship because she too has been transformed. She too has been transformed because of many of you who have joined us through Project Mercy in this transformation. Open Door, I invite you to join us in this new journey. This new ministry with the old name. Take one of these cards that you find in your bulletin and take it home and read it. And give us your contact information so we can include you on our travel blogs or our information or our desires or our needs. I'm going to ask you to consider helping us continue this next 25 years. I'm going to ask you to consider including Beyond Our Door in your 2012 charitable giving. There's a list of options of things we need support for this coming year, our 2012 budget. I want to highlight two of them. I'm looking for sponsors of people like Kenzie and SheLove and Dadu and Manu and Andres and Wheat. I'm looking for people that will sponsor a child in Haiti. We're also going to start something new. It's called the HOPE Conference in Haiti with Pastor Dio. Pastor Dio is putting together about 100 leaders to come to a conference and just talk about hope. How do we talk about hope in Haiti? These are people that go back to their communities. They're leaders. And people want to know, why should you follow Jesus? What kind of hope is there there? Life doesn't get any better. It doesn't change. Well, we're going to do our first conference this year. And our first speaker that Pastor Dio wanted for our first conference was Pastor Dave Johnson. And so Pastor Dave Johnson will be going down to Haiti in April and offering that. And the series that Dio wanted him to talk from was a Beatitude series. Blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are the broken. My only hope is Jesus. And so that first hope conference comes out of this body as well. Open door, I want to thank you for 25 years of ministry together. And I look forward to the next 25 years. I look forward with joy and anticipation of what's to come. And so let me close in prayer. Let you stand. Lord these are just words but they're real stories these are real people that have and need to experience you in new and different ways Lord I see me and us as people who've been given abundance simply by being born here and I pray that you might take us and that gift you've given us and cause us to be people of generosity of looking for ways to invest those gifts in ways that are beyond ourself in ways that we can never see come back to us. They can never fully thank us. Except for like songs like Kenzie just sang. Thank you, Jesus, for Maffi Boshette. You transformed my life. In the name of Jesus, I pray it. Amen. Thank you.
