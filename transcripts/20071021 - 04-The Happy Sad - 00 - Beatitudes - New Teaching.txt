word. For words of life that call forth life, I pray. It seems to me that that's what you are about, Father, is calling things to life and calling us to life and calling things in us that are dead to life. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. As most of you know, in the broader context of our study where we've been coming to know Jesus as our rabbi, our master teacher, we've begun of late to examine his actual teaching as embodied in the Sermon on the Mount. It's found in Matthew 5 where for the last few weeks we've been looking at the introduction to that sermon known as the Beatitudes. Today the second Beatitude, Matthew 5 verse 4, blessed are those who mourn. Blessed or happy are what sounds like the sad, which, as we've said before, sounds weird, standing in contrast as it does to what we've been calling conventional wisdom, which actually is something Jesus consistently does with his teaching style, teach against and confront conventional wisdom. Conventional wisdom says happy or blessed are the happy. Makes sense to me. But it also, this beatitude, at least on the surface, seems to stand in contrast to, maybe even in contradiction to other scriptures. One that comes to mind right away is Galatians chapter 5, where Paul indicates quite clearly that the fruit of the Spirit, the indicator that you are moving with the power of the Spirit and under the influence of the Spirit is, among other things, joy. Not mourning, but joy, right? Or Proverbs adds to the confusion when he says, Proverbs 17, 22, that a merry heart, a happy heart is good like a medicine. That a happy heart is a healing heart. It's a healing thing. So don't worry, mourn, be happy. Well, I think it's obvious, at least I hope it is, that there's something more going on here in this beatitude, something that I think is important indeed something that may be a precursor to at the root of an authentically happy hearts and not just a pretending to be happy heart at the root of real joy and a clue to that i think is found in the second part of the beatitude the second part of that verse blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted for they shall be comforted which means i think that those who are able to mourn are blessed, at least in part because they are able by their mourning to gain access to something that those who do not mourn or cannot mourn have no access to, comfort. And without comfort, there is no joy. And without an ability to mourn, there is no comfort, which means if I'm right, we all have to mourn. At some level, we have to learn how. At times when it's appropriate, we have to learn how. Blessed are those who learn how to, and this is the way we've said it here at Open Door before, it's become almost a cliche, get out here, what's going on in here? Blessed are those who get out here, what's going on in here? We've talked about this enough in the past for you to know, many of you know, that the Greek word for mourning here is penthos. It's a very specific word. There's nine words in the Greek for the concept of mourning. which means there's a lot of different ways to do it. And this particular word speaks to an external expression of an internal reality. So there's something about the expression of this, getting these things that we stuff inside, outside, that is the blessed part of this, and put you in a place where you can experience comfort. Now, in some ways, we know a lot about mourning. We already do this. Because there's actually something quite basic, almost primal, certainly unavoidable when it comes to this common to man experience. One writer said it this way, and this kind of just kind of puts you in touch with the universality of it, the unavoidability of it, when he says, we come into this world, all of us do, crying. I mean, think of it. The first thing you did, you weren't conscious of it, but one of the first things you ever did was what? Cry like a baby. We go out the same way. surrounded by mourning and tears, if not yours, the people around you who are losing you and needing to let you go. So in the beginning, we cry, and in the end, we cry. And in between, says Eugene Peterson, is what he calls a substratum to our lives. Think about this. Does this resonate with any of you? It's kind of underneath the surface. The substratum in our lives, it has to do with mourning. It's just there. Sometimes unadmitted, sometimes unconsciously there, but just beneath the surface, it's there. So in one sense, when Jesus identifies it and calls attention to it, as he does in Matthew 5, verse 4, he's legitimizing it. He's saying, in effect, it's all right to mourn. It's all right to feel this thing under the surface that you don't understand, but you can't deny. You feel this thing. It's all right to feel that. It's all right to do what you do. indeed in some strange way it's blessed. Blessed are those who can actually feel that and be aware of that and do this thing. Think about mourning with me just for a bit. The reason at a very basic level that we mourn is generally, I think, quite simply because of loss. Some sense of loss. and sometimes the loss is easy to identify. We can name the loss, which in some sense, if you can name the loss, it makes mourning easy when you can name it. And sometimes you can't name it because what you lost was a friend or a job. What you lost was a marriage, maybe a loved one, maybe even a child. And if you've lost enough things over the course of your life, you'll notice that you've lost some other things like your confidence. Where'd that go? Whoa. Or your sense of what's normal. You used to know. And enough things just kind of knock you off center and you've kind of lost the sense of normal. But when you can name it, because you've lost a friend or a loved one, when you can name it, you don't wonder why you have this sense of loss. Because our sadness and grief make sense, we can name it. We know why we're sad. We can name it the loss. We lost a friend, a marriage, a loved one, a dream. And in that sense, at that level, we're fortunate, maybe even blessed, because sometimes we can't name it. Some of you I know battle at times with depression. I know that not because I know your individual stories. I just know that people do. and we happen to have people in this room. I do from time to time. And when I do, at least part of the darkness that I feel, I don't know about you, but part of the battle I fight comes from the fact that when I move into one of those kind of depressed times, I don't know why. And it's almost the worst part of being in this place where you're feeling kind of depressed because I can't name anything. So in terms of feeling bad, I'm nuts. Indeed, as I've tried to describe the feelings I have around that kind of stuff that happens from time to time, I've described it this way. It's like, in fact, I can hear myself describing it to my wife. It's like the tide, the ocean tide that just seems to come in. And when it comes in, I don't know why it came in. And then it just kind of goes out. And when it goes out and things lighten up and I can see more. I have no idea why it went out. And that drives me nuts. I remember when my dad died some years ago. That was a strange season in my life and in my family's life. Because more happened in that time for me than my dad just dying. I remember at my dad's funeral. I can replay the tape. We were in his church. The funeral was over. We were kind of having the fellowship time with friends, and a friend came up to me and told me that one of our best friends in Chicago during my dad's funeral had died. So Jody is gone, and my dad is gone, and about two months later, Dave Busby, who was a dear friend of ours as a church, we miss his voice, and a dear friend of mine as a person, he died as well. And I remember feeling lots of things during that season. Sad is actually not quite the right word. Scared, I was a little closer, lost. A sense that I'm not ready for this, kind of like you're going down a roller coaster ride and I'm not ready for this, too late. Ready or not, here you go. But what I didn't do was wonder why. I was feeling all those awful feelings. I didn't wonder why. I could name it. My dad died. And so did Jody and so did Dave. So there was this odd sense. I don't know how to say this. I'm afraid it's not going to be clear. But there was this odd sense of freedom to feel. And that freedom felt good. Not the grief didn't feel good. The fear, the feeling lost. But the freedom to feel those things and be able to name why I was feeling those things felt good. It was later. that things got weird. When feelings would come, but I could no longer name them, identify them, connect them to my dad or to Dave. And some of that was worse than when they died because I couldn't name it. It's as weird as like three years later somebody helped me connect some dots around this. And I don't know if this is making any sense for some of you if you've experienced these kinds of things. I think it's pretty human. I don't think I'm totally goofy here. But it was three years later, around this time of year, which is around the time my dad died several years ago. But it was three years into that, after that, I just went into this funk. And a friend just kind of randomly said, wasn't it around this time of year your dad died? Yeah, and he goes, well, you're probably doing anniversary pain. And my first reaction was, you are such a, I hate all this psycho babble garbage. Anniversary pain, whatever. But you know what I did? I grabbed onto it. I decided this is it. This is it. Because I needed somehow to name it. And naming it helped. Now, to what I just shared with you, I want to take the reality of that and put it into a bigger context, into what I think may be, and you'll have to decide if it's true, a universal context that is beyond my individual story or your individual story. And I want to do this with a little help from Eugene Peterson again, who suggests, among other things, this, that maybe the reason that the substratum of our lives, this thing under the surface, is often marked by this vague sense that something's wrong is because in ways that we cannot name, that we're not conscious of, something is wrong. And it's something that this side of eternity, we can't completely fix. And what's wrong is this, that since the fall, we are living east of Eden. We've been cut off from what it is we were created for, from who it is we've been designed to be, that things are not the way they're supposed to be. That paradise is lost, and this side of eternity will never fully find it. Don't get me wrong. We will one day see it, and we will one day see it fully. And even now, we get glimpses of it. From time to time, for reasons sometimes you can't explain, just like you sometimes can't explain why you go into a flunk, at other times, reasons you can't explain, there's a sense of transcendence. We like to think that we can experience it sometimes in worship. We don't always experience it in worship, even when you do experience it in worship. It comes as a gift to something transcendent. Somehow your spirit and soul is connected with something bigger than you, the bigger story. You don't even have words for it, the taste of the eternal. But even when we do touch those things, experience those things, those things are fleeting and often unexpected where things just kind of line up and converge. And you feel just this wave of love and you know you're loved. which is not something you always know and you notice beauty you really see it you look at this thing you see every day and for some reason today I see this thing or this person and you feel safe and connected and you think the kingdom's come this is a taste of heaven but then you wonder five minutes later five days later where'd that go? it doesn't last it's much like Peter in my mind on the Mount of Transfiguration when Jesus pulled back the veil I love that phrase even he pulled literally the veil of his flesh back but every once in a while we get to experience that for reasons you can't control but the veil gets pulled back and you see the glory of God and you just fall on your face but it didn't last It didn't last for Peter He got it, he saw it He wanted to stay there but he couldn't So with a hunger for this kind of thing I think deeply in our DNA Christian or not God conscious or not Every human being hungers for this We try to create it Manufacture it Believing maybe or hoping anyway That we can control it Investing enormous amounts of time and energy Trying to manage certain events desperately wanting them to be perfect. You relate to that at all? You want the perfect vacation or the perfect wedding? By the way, before I yell at you for doing that, because you can't do that, would you just add, just kind of spin this in. The very desire that you and I have for something to be perfect is I think a memory, is born of a memory of Eden, of what we were created for. Think of your wedding day. I mean, some people, you know, this is true from the time they're little kids. They dream of their wedding day, and it's just this wonderful picture. You know where people will stand. You know what people will say. You know how they will look, and it's just gonna be perfect. They have a friend who married someone, and they had the processional, and they got up into the front, and it was apparent that as they were about ready to move into the vows that something wasn't perfect. Someone didn't walk down the aisle right, so they did the whole thing again. It's like run for your life. Oh, and that doesn't need to be pushed down and confronted, but there's somebody who's wanting Eden. You can't have it this side of eternity, It's, there's something in you. Well, you girls, I think, will dream of it. Guys, I'll let you in on dreaming of your wedding night. Anyway, so we got it all planned out. Yeah, right, okay, beautiful. Here's the deal, here's the deal. Nothing wrong with any of that, but here's the problem. Even if they are perfect, think of that vacation, that whatever it was, that was perfect. Even when they're perfect, somewhere in the middle of all that perfection, I think you know it's true. will come this vague sense of dis-ease. That even though it went just the way you thought it would, it still didn't do what you thought it would do. And you're not even sure what you thought it would do. You're just sure it didn't do it. Whatever it is. Because even on our best day, says Peterson, we can still feel this vague sense of loss in our very existence, that we are incomplete, that we've been cut off, that something's not quite right, but the very fact that we know this, that we have this sense of loss, incompleteness and cut-offness, gives evidence of a memory, an instinct for Eden, for wholeness, and for God. But most of the time, we don't connect that. We can't name that sense of vagueness. We can't identify it. And if we can't name it, like I'm trying to do today, we can't use it to do what it's designed ultimately to do, which is to bring us to God. To stir in us a deep and profound, ravenous hunger for God. Instead, we have all sorts of ways of avoiding it, medicating it. Most of the time, we just deny it in a variety of ways, figure out ways to avoid it, not to have to feel it. Among the most popular and universal ways of avoiding and not feeling is simply trying to appear as if everything's under control, even if things aren't under control. but we've got it all together. We smile a lot. By the way, I'm not just talking about Christians. I'm talking about, this is just the human thing. I mean, the billboards. You don't see anybody. And billboards, it's all a big happy smile. Everything's a smile. But often it's what I would actually call these smiley things. It's a cheery-faced, look-on-the-bright-side band-aid designed to help us avoid, deny, not feel, loss. And while I think everybody does this, we all do it. At one time or another, Christians, in fact, can be particularly irritating on this score. God bless us, everyone. One place I've seen it a lot, and you've heard me make references. I grew up in the church. I'm so grateful. I am. I am so grateful. But I've just seen weird stuff my whole life. And one place I've seen this happy face thing a lot is at funerals where it's almost like you can't be sad. Not even most funerals are that way, but enough to go, what is this weird? Have you ever been a funeral like that? It would probably be a Christian funeral. Have you ever been around people like that where it just wasn't okay to be sad when it was a very appropriate place to be sad? Because look on the bright side. They're with Jesus. They're in heaven. I remember somebody told me that when Busby died. I was at his funeral. I could just see him running. Okay. Well, good. Does that help you? How does that help you? Look in the bright side. He's with Jesus. I know. But what if I want him here with me? That's selfish. I know. That's what I am. You know, it's like you almost have to become rebellious to grieve. And what if it's not time to look in the bright side? yet. Because what if it's time to mourn? Actually, I've heard people say some awful things, and they never meant it to be awful. In fact, they wanted it to be comforting, like when a child dies. I mean, I heard this once on TV. It was coming, there was some family was going through grief, and the TV covered the funeral, and there was a little blurb from the pastor, and it was just this thing that was, you know, everybody kind of, even in the news, going, oh, yes, but it was, God must have needed another angel. It's like I'm going, does that really help you? See, some I'm sure see that stuff and that kind of talk as the manifestation of a deeply rooted faith in God who is our hope. But I wonder if it has a lot more to do with this desperate fear we have to fully feel loss. This desperate fear we have, and the fear is kind of underneath the surface as well. It's a fear of acknowledging that we really are east of Eden, and we can't fix it. Not yet. The paradise is lost, and in this side of eternity, we can't find it, just get glimpses of it. So we deny it and medicate it and find creative ways to avoid it. I have a running joke with my kids. This is really true. They think it's morbid. I think it's funny. the more they go, dude, I just keep pushing them on this one. It's that at my funeral, if I'm still young enough for like 10 people to remember me, I don't want, I've told them this, in fact, kids, you got to be in charge because somebody else might take over and turn this whole thing. I don't want any celebrating in my funeral. I don't want anybody singing happy songs that I'm in heaven because I want people to be sad when I'm dead. In fact, I told my kids, I want it to ruin your whole day. which you know okay okay you know what i'm doing here that that has a whole lot more to do with my narcissism than it has to do with any lesson on morning but i thought we needed a little break in this sermon i remember in my family um growing up in church occasionally hearing a critique of other people from other faiths at funerals who if they mourned in ways we thought excessive or sometimes even if they mourned at all we assumed it was because they had no hope like us we had hope and that's why we did that at funerals now sometimes it was true and i have been in funerals where the people had no hope and it's a desperate thing. It's a desperate thing. But sometimes it wasn't true what we assumed of people who were in deep grief because they actually had a profound faith in God and hope of heaven. They just felt free to feel, to mourn in ways that we didn't. All of which makes me think a different thing now that maybe if we really do have hope like we say we do, that maybe we above all people should feel free to fully feel and that maybe faith in this context is believing that if I allow myself to fully feel my loss, my regret, my doubt, my fear that God will meet me right in the middle of it and bring me through it. That the healthy, you cannot jump over it. I love the story in John 11, where Jesus came to Lazarus' tomb too late. He's already been there four days dead, and when he, that is Jesus, saw the scene of people weeping in verse 33, he didn't immediately cheer him up. With a look on the bright side, Band-Aid. And if you think about it, if you know the whole story, because he's about to raise Lazarus from the dead, his look on the bright side band-aid would have been a whopper. Hey, don't worry. We're going to raise him from the dead. Quit your crying. But it says in verse 33 that when Jesus saw her, that is Mary weeping, and her friends weeping also, he was deeply moved in his spirit and troubled. And when they brought him to the tomb, he wept. John 11, 35. And if you're a little kid, Bible memory, that's your favorite verse. Here's my verse for today. Anyway, he wept. Which means, among other things, this. That he didn't deny it. That his soul was deeply troubled and moved. He didn't avoid it. He didn't slide around it. He didn't numb it. He just felt it. Fully felt it. And ironically, it's when you do that, I think you get the comfort. And you actually are able to then let it go. Get the picture. It's actually fascinating to me. Anyway, here's Jesus, totally connected with God, in union with the Father, full of hope in the resurrection. You know? Again, I flash back on all these funerals I've been in where it wasn't okay to be sad. Jesus, more than you or me ever, full of hope and confidence in the resurrection, still allows himself to fully feel. It's actually kind of weird if you think about it, that his faith and hope and confidence in God did not provide some sort of supernatural exemption from the common to man experience of sorrow and grief and a deep sense of loss because sometimes we think it does. We think it should exempt us. We think that's what faith looks like. That if you really believe in God you'll just not feel stuff. Philip Yancey in his book entitled Pain, the Gift Nobody Wants, she wrote in collaboration with a medical doctor, argues from a physical perspective, and then works back toward the spiritual, saying that when you feel physical pain, it's actually a healthy thing, and proof that you're still alive, and that you're still aware. Spiritually, then, they make the same connection, saying it's the same spiritually, that when you allow yourself to feel sorrow, regret, disappointment, and to mourn, it's proof that you're still alive, that you're still engaged, and that you still actually care, which brings me to something that's very important, I think, to say and make a distinction, because authentic mourning is not passive pessimism. because some people can just get in fact the polar opposite actually of looking on the bright side mindless optimism is looking on the dark side some people that's all they ever look at and might even it would frustrate me take a sermon like this as kind of see I'm just always down in the dumps and that's why no that's not this is the polar opposite of looking on the bright side looking on the dark side deep pessimism which is actually just another creative way to disengage, to avoid feeling pessimistic. I don't care. Blessed are those who do care. Blessed are those who care so deeply, sometimes they weep. You've got to be alive to do that. You've got to be engaged to do that. It's not blessed are the mopey. That's not this. You know, that's just neurotic. I have a friend who told me once, it's a fascinating statement, he says neurosis is actually the coward's way out of avoiding real suffering. See, instead of really pressing through your suffering, you get weird. And now nobody can know, well, yeah, they're weird. So everybody else has to kind of face stuff, but not you. You can get weird. Okay. It's not this. That's not what this is. See, the reason Jesus weeps, being deeply moved and troubled, was not because he was neurotic. It was not because he was so weak and lacking faith. It was because he was so strong and full of faith and so alive. And being fully alive is what gave him the capacity to deeply feel. Again, I love how Eugene Peterson says it in his quiet, unassuming way, that it's hard to be human. In fact, what he meant by that was it's hard to admit that we are human. One evidence of that, he says, is the outrageous schemes we devise to avoid feeling human. We just want to rise above it all the time, jump over it all the time, So we deny and we pretend that there is no loss, that we aren't hurt, that we don't care. But losses are all over the place. Beyond this loss of Eden that we all vaguely sense just beneath the surface, some of us have lost things on the surface that we can see. Some of us have lost our parents or our spouses. Maybe you've lost a friend. There's a divorce. there are divorces in this room profound senses of rejection some of you lost your job maybe a dream you had since a kid you've been building your whole life around the dream and now you're at a place where you know it's just not going to happen maybe it's your innocence that's lost and maybe you lost your innocence because someone took it from you or some of you lost it because you gave it away way too cheap or maybe it's your youth you've lost and your capacity to produce. You know, sometimes even in the context of really good things, there's a sense of loss, and when that happens, you don't know. I've spoken with young women who've gotten pregnant and are so excited about the life that's growing in them, but they're losing things, like their body. It's going to be different now. And I wonder, what's our marriage going to be like? We know how to be together, just us, and now there's a little one. And it's so wonderful, but what's it going to change? so who do you talk to about that because we don't know how to do that we suppress the evidence that there's loss partly because mourning involves being vulnerable to God and to people and admitting that you need God and people it's hard to be human in part because to be human means you need God and people and most of us don't want to need anything or anyone blessed are those who mourn who have the courage to fully feel for maybe just maybe they are the ones who will find God the comfort of God and maybe the comfort of some friends as well next week I want to talk a little bit about that what it means to be a comforter blessed are those who mourn they shall be comforted let's pray as we close would you stand with me as we begin I just I'm going to ask the anybody here from the prayer team to come and just make yourself available this morning to anyone who needs prayer I would just assume that talking about stuff like this might stir things that are very present to people and they need to be with someone father I thank you for your word I thank you I thank you father for your example of one who had the courage to fully feel. Even though you were God and in union with the Father and full of hope in the resurrection, you showed us how to be human at the same time. You are amazing. Pray that you would help us step into these kingdom realities with fullness of faith and awareness of humanity and desperate need for you and for each other to live this life. We pray these things in Jesus' name and all God's people said, amen. God bless you as you leave. If you need prayer, come. The rest of you are dismissed. Thank you.
