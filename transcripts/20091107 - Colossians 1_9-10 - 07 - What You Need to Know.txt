Lord, I pray that you take this word And by the power of your spirit Use it to fill us up With an in our bones kind of knowing Of your desire for us Of your love for us Of your amazing grace toward us And I pray that in your name Amen Well, last Monday When Bonnie and I returned from a conference That I spoke at in Chicago So in the evening, I was catching up on my emails, and I read one from a friend of mine who said, among other things, really glad you wore your old jeans. What? What is that about? I mean, honestly, I thought I was having like a senior moment. I'm like, did I say something to Wayne about this and forget? Because, man, this is bad. And a few minutes later, after I finished my email, still wondering about that, I listened to Steve's sermon from the day before. And, you know, there it was. If you were here, you know what I'm talking about him. telling you about that story of how I was going to this conference, and I wanted to buy a pair of new jeans, and I looked in the mirror of the store, and it really was. I got this little thing that said, wear your old jeans, and that became kind of a symbol to me. I've been in a place that was kind of intimidating to me. The word from God was, be yourself, just be yourself, wear your old jeans, and I did. But when I heard Steve say that stuff, there was something that said, honestly, that it felt good to me that you knew. Not about the genes. But it felt good to you, for me, that you knew what I was doing. Because more and more, I don't want to do stuff like that. I don't want to do that stuff alone. The fact is, I don't. When I do minister other places, and I think you know I do that, I don't go alone. I often bring someone with me. Actually, a lot of times it's Bonnie. That's my favorite. But sometimes I bring a friend or some person on staff that is easy to be with and it's just a good time. But I always have somebody in on it with me, so I don't go alone. People are praying and staff and elders and friends. But I don't often tell you about that. I'm not sure why, but I am sure I don't want to do that anymore because I don't want to go alone. And I don't want to carry stuff, especially there are certain ministry things I do that have more weight. I can feel it in my body. They're harder to carry than others, and I don't want to carry those things by myself. Which is why I want you to know that this Wednesday night, Bonnie and I are going to be boarding a plane for Belfast, Northern Ireland. There's a story there, if you've been around Open Door at all, you know kind of a history that we have with this church in particular. This is my fifth time to go there. It actually started a little over 10 years ago when I was invited to speak at a thing called Mandate. Mandate is the Northern Ireland's version of Promise Keepers, and we were going to that, and then there were a couple other churches, but there was one church in particular that we kind of got hooked up with. And we'll never forget, Bonnie and I remember this often, that very first time we were there, the whole time we were there, speaking at Mandate, the pastor's conference, then these churches, how did they know us? How did this even happen? And on the last night of our first time there, these people in this one particular church, Newton Breida Baptist Church, kind of gathered us together with some friends, sat us down and they told us the story of how some tapes had been circulated and they came to know us. And since that time, this relationship has developed to the point where I have come to realize that this church is a church that I carry in my heart. In fact, a year and a half ago, a year ago May, I remember where I was. It was the last night of our time with them, a year ago May. And it was evening service, the place was packed, and I remember it dawning on me, this church is in my heart. I'm carrying this church in my heart. And it was a little weird because I'm the pastor here and I know I didn't belong there, but I was carrying more than one church in my heart and I didn't even have a paradigm for that except I have since then. The Apostle Paul carried more than one church in his heart. He carried Philippi and Ephesus and Corinth and Galatia. Oh, that's what that is. But here's my request to you, open door, that you would carry them in your heart too. I really mean that. As I go, that we go. Doing something I haven't done before with the help of my wife, who would know how to do this. I maybe would want to do this and wouldn't know how, but we're posting a blog on our trip. It's already on our website. You can dial into it right now. And we're gonna do our best to kind of keep you updated and show you and tell you what we're doing and encourage you to dial into that. But one of the things I want you to be aware of, because this actually does tie into Colossians. It really does. I've been thinking about this for a long time. Because the people I'm asking you to carry in your heart are people you do not know, that you have never met and you probably never will, and I'm asking you to pray. Not just for me, I'm sure you'll do that, but I'm asking you to pray for them, a lot like Paul did for the Colossians. And this is very poignant to me. As he writes, as Paul's writing this letter to the Colossians, a group of people he has never met, but he holds them in his heart. How'd he do that? He holds them in his heart. In fact, he even says, I struggle on your behalf, though I've never met you. He says in chapter two, verse one, even though I've not personally seen your face. He says it right there at the end of that verse. I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf in order that your hearts might be encouraged. And part of how he does that encouraging on their behalf is to pray. So today, as we dive back into the text, we are going to meet Paul, the prayer. We've already met Paul, the apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and then we found out it was also by the grace of God. And a couple weeks after that, we met Paul, the slave of our Lord Jesus Christ. So today, as we just kind of go through Colossians, we're meeting Paul, the prayer. Indeed, he's praying for all the churches that he held in his heart. It's a characteristic trademark of his and all of his epistles. Colossians is no different. So if you have your Bibles with you this morning, I'd like you to open them to the book of Colossians, the first chapter, where in verse 3, we find his first mention of this praying thing when he says, Colossians 1, verse 3, we give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you. Ever since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for the saints because of the hope that's laid up for you in heaven, a hope that was born in you, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel, the euangelion, the good news, and came to understand the grace of God in truth. And then moving down to verse 9, he says it's because of that. Or for this reason, since the day we heard of your faith and hope and love, since the day we heard of that, we haven't ceased to pray for you. In part, I think, because Paul knew that things like faith and hope and love are precious things. and like many precious things precious things are often quite fragile and need to be protected and nurtured and guarded sometimes fought for how many of you know that precious things are fragile things how many of you know that sometimes your faith and your hope is a fragile thing and if it isn't protected and guarded and if somebody doesn't fight for it particularly in places like Colossae I mean we've been telling you the story where the malevolent presence of Rome was an everyday reality and always posed the threats to these Colossians. And it was a threat physically to them, but it was also a threat to their faith and to their hope. Because when you're constantly being crushed, you can lose hope. Unless you have a bigger perspective, because this Colossian reality with the presence of Rome produced in a lot of people not faith, but fear. Not hope, but despair. not love, but deep resentment, particularly of Rome. So Paul says, since the day we heard of your faith and hope and love, a faith and hope and love that's clearly under fire, we just want you to know we're with you. We have been praying for you ceaselessly. Since we heard of this life, and this is what we're praying for. He says, when we're praying for you, middle of verse 9, that first of all you be filled. I love this, that you would be filled up with the knowledge of his will into all spiritual wisdom and understanding, and that by that being filled with the knowledge of his will, you would be able to walk in a manner that is worthy of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. It's an amazing prayer, you guys. It goes all the way down to verse 14, does this prayer from verse 9. And what I want to do, I just want to read the whole thing in just a minute, And then we're going to come back and I'm going to unpack the beginning, actually, of this prayer. But as I read this prayer, and just read it through from beginning to end, I want you to imagine, as I read it, what it would look like. And what it would feel like if this prayer that Paul is praying for the Colossians would be fulfilled in you. Can you imagine? To be a person who is filled up with an in-your-bones knowing the knowledge of God's will, walking worthy of the Lord, pleasing Him in every respect, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing the knowledge of God, wow, what would that feel like if that was fulfilled? And then what I want you to imagine is I want you to imagine praying this prayer for someone other than you, for maybe someone you've never met, like a church in Belfast. This kind of praying is a really good discipline for people you don't even know. Or imagine praying this prayer for someone that you know who's really going through a hard time right now. They're in a big struggle. Imagine praying this prayer for something other than you who's maybe not going through a struggle. Maybe it's a friend. Praying this maybe for your spouse or your kids or your parents. We have a lot of students here and mentors and mentor coordinators. I want to dial, think about praying this for the kid you're mentoring or the mentor you're mentoring or maybe you pray this for our church. Because sometimes we don't know how to pray. You know, you pray for the, if I knew more about you, I'd know how to pray. And well, what if you don't know anything about them? What if they're the Colossians? How do you pray then? My wife actually wrote an article for the latest publication. Somebody I see have it, this thing called At the Door. It used to be called Kingdom Now. Now it's called At the Door. And my wife is an amazing lady. She, the last couple of years, has become a spiritual director. She was taking these classes for two years. I call them her holier-than-God classes. But she's an amazing lady. She knows how to pray, but sometimes she doesn't know how to pray. And that's what she talks about in the article. And she's really found a richness in certain times and contexts memorizing prayers. And she commends one to you there in this article. And I would commend this one to you. To hers, I would add this. I'm really serious indeed. I would commend to you the committing of this prayer of Paul's to memory. And you can do it simply by reading it, praying it maybe every day for your husband or your wife or your kids or somebody you don't even know. And I think you'll be surprised if you just read it, just kind of over and over and kind of let your spirit engage with what you're actually praying for here. I think you'd be surprised how it gets inside of you. So when you pray for your friend or your wife, your husband as they do what they do, or their kids, your kids where you don't even know where they are maybe today if they're older kids, you pray this way, dear Father, my deep desire is this, that they, wherever they are, would be filled with the knowledge of your will and all spiritual wisdom and understanding so that they may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord. Phew. To please him in all respects, bringing fruit in every good work, increasing the knowledge of God. I pray this for my kids and our friends, strengthened with all power according to your glorious might for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us. Help them to remember that they have been qualified to share in the inheritance of the saints in light and help them to remember, my friend, my husband, my wife, my kids, that they have been delivered from the domain of darkness and transferred to the kingdom of your son in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. So that's Paul's prayer. The first part of which I now want to unpack just a bit back to verse nine here is where it starts, that you be filled with the knowledge of his will with all spiritual wisdom and understanding. Let's just break it down word at a time. The word knowledge comes from the Greek word epigenosis. You can see it on the screen, kind of a weird sounding word, epigenosis, which speaks to a kind of knowledge, I've kind of already been referring to it here, that is beyond the cognitive. It's an intimate knowing, a deep knowing, what I've been calling already this in-your-bones kind of knowing, like when you know someone loves you. Not because they said it, but you can feel it. In your bones, it's something that you know. And it's also a weird thing. You could have someone in your life who's always saying that they love you, but you don't feel it in your bones. So you hear the words and cognitively, yeah, they say they love me, but you don't know it. The prayer is that in your bones, in your bones you would know. So my prayer is that you'd be filled with this in your bones kind of knowing of his will, it says. Let's talk about that just a bit because when I first heard that phrase that way, it kicked me right into the whole will of God thing. Maybe it did that for you too, as in what's the will of God for my life? Am I in his will? Am I doing his will? And if I am doing his will, is it his permissive will or his perfect will? Because I don't know if you knew this, but you can be doing his permissive will, but miss his perfect will, which you really don't want to do. It kind of puts God in this place where, okay, I'll let you do that, but it's not my best. And when I was thinking about this this week, it reminded me, when I was a kid, I'm like high school, early college, we used to talk about this kind of stuff, all the time. And with no small amount of anxiety when we did, because you just didn't want to miss his perfect will. May God forbid you went to the University of Minnesota instead of Bethel, you know? Or Bethel, you know, instead of Northwestern. Because Bethel would be his permissive will, okay. But Northwestern, oh! Yeah, you know? You know what? There are people who actually think like this. I'm serious. Now, while I just brought all that stuff up, and you're curious and wondering, boy, he's going to fix it. While all that stuff I just brought up is a topic worthy of discussion, and we might even come back to it sometime soon. The fact is, that's not, I don't think, what Paul's praying for here. Because the reference here to what Paul calls his will can also be rendered, and I think is best rendered, his desire. So hear the prayer this way. For the Colossians, it's this. My prayer is that you would be filled up with this in-your-bones kind of knowing of God's desire for you, of his will, of his desire for you, of his love for you, because that's what he wills for you to know. I'm going to explain it to you this way and I think you'll get it a little bit more when you think of a will God's will, a will think of it as a last will and testament there's a true story last week when Bonnie and I were on our way to Chicago on this flight it was a horrible flight, constant turbulence as bad as we've ever experienced the bottom dropped out, you ever been on one of those flights boom, it just drops out several times and I'm just sitting there kind of going okay, is this thing going to hold together because the wings are flapping. And I really don't get scared in that, but I do a lot of stupid things in my head to kind of make it funny to me. And it may not be funny to you, but a bunch of stuff's going through in my mind. And as we were hitting the bottom, I'm going, so, is this how it feels? You know, like if we were to drop once and not hit the bottom, but you'd hit the bottom like way at the bottom? I wonder if this is how it feels, and it'll be over soon. And, you know, if I die in a plane crash, it could kind of mess up the conference. and then I thought I hope it does you know I hope if I die it kind of messes them up a little bit which is this huge narcissistic thing I still need therapy for but actually that bad plane ride inspired a text a text message when we landed and we got settled Bonnie and I were having lunch and I texted all my friends and I said horrible news the plane went down we're all dead see ya anyway but actually no actually i did send that text but but i truly did have this thought when we're going through this turbulence and i actually did whisper this to bonnie i i said honey we really need to update our will back to you thought i didn't have a point here did you and a will what is a will what is what god's will what is a will well it's a number of things but in this case it is the legal expression of someone's desire as it relates to the allocation and the distribution of resources. And I really do want to be sure, make sure that our kids have easy access to all our resources. Let me say it this way. I want my kids, and finally I want our kids to be full of an in-their-bones knowing of our desire for them, of an in-their-bones knowing of our will for them, our love for them, our yes toward them, and that's Paul's prayer for them, that he did not cease to pray for them, right in the middle of Colossae, in the shadow of Rome, with people who had lots of reasons to be afraid and to lose hope. I pray that you would be filled. I can't do much for your situation. I'm not even with you. Here's what I pray, that in the middle of that, you would be filled with this in your bones knowing of God's desire for you, his love for you, his yes towards you, that he actually is for you. And if God is for you, even in the midst of difficult circumstances where you might even lose your life, if in the middle of that God's for you, who can be against you? Romans 8. And who can separate you from that love of God? Tribulation, he asks in Romans 8, distress, persecution, famine, all horrible things that destroy some people's hope. How about Rome? Could that do it? Separate you? How about a Roman prison, which is what Paul was in when he wrote this? Could that separate you from the love of God? How about a divorce? Could that do it? Or the betrayal of a friend? Or disease? See, the upshot of all of this, relative to Paul's prayer, is this. Paul understood that when you're full of this kind of knowing, it actually provides, and you know this is true instinctively, it actually provides the internal kind of strength that's necessary to walk. And then to keep on walking through some things like persecution and distress and a Roman prison and maybe the betrayal of a friend. But to know in your bones that God loves you and he's with you and he's for you and he's cheering and he's weeping gives you strength to go through like Jesus did, actually. Jesus, I think a lot often of how he could have, I don't know, could he have done redemption by just going, I'm God, I now command you forgiven. You are done. He went through the cross. God's people go through. So when you're going through, you're walking like he walked. when you're walking through, so you're walking worthy of him, desiring to please him in every respect. Verse 10, bearing fruit in every good work. Question about that. What kind of people desire to please him in every respect? Because not all do. So who are these people who really desire to please God in every respect? Well, some people get into a cycle of wanting to please God in every respect, but it doesn't come from a place of knowing deeply God's love for them. They're really quite uncertain of God's love for them, and they're kind of on this treadmill of trying to earn God's favor. And so they're trying to do things that would please God, hoping that God will maybe someday love them, and that's just like this journey to nowhere, and it's so exhausting. But who are these people who are living with this in their bones, knowing of God's love for them? Who are they? and therefore desiring to please him in all respects. Well, I found that it's usually the kind of people who love him, duh. But quite often you will find that these people who love him like this, and it gives birth to this desire to please him in all respects, you'll often find that those people have been filled up one way or another. Somehow they got filled up with this deep in their bones knowing of God's love for them, of his desire for them, of his yes toward them. And that knowing seems to provide for them an internal kind of strength and energy and desire to walk. And then in their walking, when it gets even harder to walk, they keep on walking through. And they do it in a manner that's worthy of the one who so loves them. And you'll also notice quite often in people like this who've been filled with the knowledge of God's desire for them, you'll often see in them a deep desire. It's actually kind of weird because when you're filled with the knowledge of God's desire, it stirs desire to, here we go, please him in all respects, bringing fruit in every good work, and increasing the knowledge of God. It's just funny how it works like that. When you know you're deeply loved by God, when you know you're deeply loved by anyone, it stirs things. it strengthens things in fact is what I'm trying to describe here is something we experience on very human levels and it illustrates how important it is and we've talked about this to experience the love of God through people we talk about Jesus with skin on and people really do come to understand the love of God often through how they experience people like you and me but I was looking through some old sermon notes this last week and I ran across an old story that I had kind of forgotten about When I saw it, I go, I do remember this, but it was kind of off my radar screen. It was a story about my son, Christopher, when he was about 11 years old. He loved football, and we kind of signed him up for football teams every year. But because I had forgotten to sign him up on time, this particular year, his 11th year here of life, he didn't get on a team he wanted to get on. And big deal, you know, deal with that. Except the team he wanted to get on was the team he had been on the year before, and it really made sense that he would be on that team, because it was all our neighbors and our friends. The kids all went to the same school. They lived on the same block. And the team that he was on the year before won every game. So he just wanted to be on that because they're all your friends. But he wasn't going to be able to be on that team. He was on a team with nobody he knew. Well, in the middle of all that, and it didn't look like we could do anything about it, the coach of the team he was on the previous year came over to our house, along with his son and a bunch of other kids who were on that team that Chris couldn't be on this year. they came to our house, and they just started talking to Chris. And they couldn't stop talking about how much they wanted Chris on their team and how much they missed him and how much they loved him. And maybe we can fix this thing. We'll do what we can. And then they left. And when they left, I was alone with Chris, 11 years old, 11 years old, and his chin started to just quiver a little bit. And he says, Dad, it's okay if I'm not on that team. But it feels really good to be wanted. And it's weird. Being wanted healed him. It strengthened him to go through not being on the team. That's no big deal. Well, it wasn't when he was 11. That was a big deal. But he found strength. Why? They want me. So last week, Tuesday and Wednesday, we went on a staff retreat. Our whole staff, we just went off. And it was a great retreat. We had a wonderful time together and created an environment where we could talk. There were some interesting, lots of changes going on. And we talked about what are you afraid of, what are you excited about. And it was just a wonderful time. But one of the highlights of the whole thing, I don't know if everybody would say this, but maybe most, was this thing we did Tuesday night. We did karaoke. Terry brought all this. Yeah, it was crazy. And it was only Christian songs, so it was cool. Yeah, woo. Not. And, but we just had a ball. And, you know, it was just a memorable time. Katie Beasley, you know, you didn't expect to get announced, but she won the whole thing. She's an absolute maniac. It was really exciting. And I, of course, was quite the highlight. I called Bonnie that night and I couldn't hardly speak. I lost my voice. I was actually worried about preaching today because of my voice. And she said, well, did you sing? I go, does it sound like I sang? I was yelling. That's what we were doing. But the next day, in a smaller group, we were talking about this karaoke thing and why, you know what, as goofy as it was, it somehow mattered. It mattered that we were all together and cheering for each other and being for each other. And in the context of that smaller group, Chandler Murphy, who is new to our staff, most of you, maybe some of you know Chandler, but most of you probably don't. She's a sweetheart. But she has a horrible voice. She's a horrible singer. But I could play like a movie in my mind when Chandler was singing. She just went all out. And she was, you know, playing the fake guitar and doing this. And when it became time, you could sing along. She was sticking the microphone and other people. And she just went all out. And in the smaller groups the next day, she was talking to us about how it felt to have people for her and cheering for her. And I think she feels like she's part of this, but she's kind of new, and it healed something in her. It strengthens something in her. Stuff like this heals people. Stuff like this strengthens and enables you to do things and walk through things you wouldn't ordinarily be able to do, like sing badly in public. A little side note here. On the prayers of Paul generally, I think this is important because one of the characteristic trademarks of Paul's prayers in his epistles was that he rarely prayed specifically for circumstances to change, for God to keep them safe or even to keep them healthy. Or in the Colossians' case, it's notable. I mean, after this thought dawned on me, I started looking for examples that would kind of refute what I was saying, because for the Colossians, he didn't pray for God to get them out from under the thumb of Rome. And even in his own case, I can't find any places where he said, would you please pray that I get released from prison? I think he wanted to be released from prison, But he didn't pray those things. Not, hear me, this is important, not that there's anything wrong with praying for those things. To pray for our kids to be safe, and our marriage to be healed, and our disease to be cured. It's just interesting to me that Paul didn't pray for that stuff, not even for himself. When he was in prison, get me out. Choosing instead to pray ceaselessly, he says, for the kind of things that I think could effectively sustain the people of God and himself, regardless of the circumstance. Get out of prison, don't get out of prison. Get out from under Rome, don't get out from under Rome. Maybe get crushed by Rome, nailed to a cross because of Rome. What could I pray for you that regardless of the circumstance would keep you strong and give you what you need to go through. Because Paul knew that sometimes the circumstance wasn't going to change. That sometimes the prison door wasn't going to fly open and the persecution wasn't going to stop and so he prayed for things like this. In the face of whatever the circumstances, I pray ceaselessly that you may be filled with this in your bones knowing of God's desire for you, his love for you, his yes towards you, that he really is for you. And if God is for you, who can be against you? And who can separate you from this kind of love and desire? Tribulation? Oh, it's horrible, isn't it? And your hope is under fire in tribulation and distress? How about that? Can that separate you? Persecution? Famine? Rome? A Roman prison? no no for I'm convinced of nothing absolutely nothing Romans 8 not death not life that's where death is I don't want to minimize how scary that might be but sometimes life is harder because in life you have to keep going our principalities and our powers our things present our things to come shall be able to separate us from this love Indeed, so central is this kind of knowing to the hearts of believers who hope to persevere through whatever, particularly through circumstances that aren't going to change. That in places like Ephesians 3.14, Paul says things like this. It's for this very reason. This very reason that persecution does come. In fact, in Ephesians 3, 13, he indicates that the Ephesians were struggling with losing heart. And so he says, for this very reason, that you're about to lose heart, I bow my knees before the Father. I don't know how to fix your situation, Ephesians, but I'm gonna pray. Before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and earth derives its name, that he would grant to you, according to the riches of his glory, that you be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner person so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and grounded in love. Think about being rooted. What are you rooted in? To be rooted and grounded in love from that grounded place in love and God's desire for you that you may from that place be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know epigenosis, the love of Christ, which actually surpasses cognitive knowing. This is something you need in your bones in order that you may be filled up with the fullness of God because Paul knew that being filled with this kind of in your bones knowing had the power to produce a kind of internal strength that was necessary to walk and then to keep on walking through in a manner that is worthy of the Christ who so loves us. And so we pray ceaselessly that you may be full. And with that, now imagine in your mind what it would look like, what it would feel like for that prayer to be fulfilled in you. Because, you know, I think we, I don't know. I've been a pastor a long time. I wonder if you assume. It must be easy for you, Dave. See, there's, how many of you know people that you've told them you love them? You've shown them you love them. It just can't get in for whatever reason. You start going, I just, the Holy Spirit, come. They have eyes that are blind, and I don't know what their wounds are, but the Holy Spirit, come. Imagine what it would be like if this was fulfilled in you, but also imagine beginning to pray this prayer for someone other than you. It's part of why I said it'd be good to memorize this when you pray for your kids, for your husband, for your wife. He's going off to work. They're doing what they have to do, going to school, whatever. That grumpy old guy had a fight today. Prayed for your husband. Lord, pray to fill him up. But then in his bones knowing of your love, pray for your wife, for people you don't know. You know what I believe? Start to pray like that. Just fill him up. Let him, give him glimpses. It activates, you start praying that way. It starts activating things in you. It will start activating, well, love. in you. You might be surprised how God gives you some real practical ways to while you're praying for someone else to be filled up with a deep knowing of God's love. You might be surprised how God begins to show you ways you can help them see that through you. These things are very formational. I really encourage you to enter into this prayer of Paul for people he didn't know whose circumstance he couldn't change. These are very important disciplines to be in situations where you can't fix it. So what would I give them? This would be a good place to start, wouldn't it? Wouldn't it be incredible if even in a situation we can't change for them, they would be filled up with an in their bones knowing of God's amazing grace and love for them. Amen? Amen. Let's stand as we're close. here's a benediction that God would grant to you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner person so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge in order that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God in order to walk and then to keep on walking through. God bless you as you leave. You're dismissed. Thank you.
