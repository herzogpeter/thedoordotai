Open your Bibles, Exodus chapter 20, verse 12, as we come in our study of the Ten Commandments this morning to the fifth commandment. And the fifth commandment is this. Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you. This commandment marks not only the halfway point of our study in the commandments, but also a significant shift of emphasis, which is important to note. Jesus in Matthew chapter 22 condensed all of the commandments in the law to two things. Number one, you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. And number two, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. Put even more simply than that, number one, love God. Number two, love people. The order of those two things is really important. For it is out of our rightly aligned relationship with God that we begin to experience rightly aligned relationships with people. Indeed, so connected are these two things, that if your relationship with God does not have an effect on your relationships with people, it has the power to call into question your relationship with God. John in 1 John 4, 10 rather bluntly says that this way. If someone says they love God and hate their brother, they're a liar about saying they love God. In light of that, I believe it's worth noting as we get into this that the Ten Commandments are broken down into two parts as well. The first four commandments speak of how we relate to and love God, the vertical relationship. The first four commandments will put God first, accept no substitutes, revere his name, observe his day. The remaining six commandments speak of how we relate to and love people. The shift from God to people begins here in verse 12, with the first relationship that any of us have ever had on earth, our father and our mother. What God says to do here is this. Relative to them, honor them. Honor them. It was interesting to me when several weeks ago we began this series on the commandments. In fact, it was eight weeks ago. I was still in the introduction of this series. I spent two weeks, if you remember, on that before we ever got to any of the commandments in particular. How many people, before we got to the commandments, came to me expressing concern and wondering what I was going to say. among all the commandments about this commandment, the fifth commandment. You're not going to say this, are you? You don't mean that, do you? Because if you knew what my parents were like, Dave, well, you'd just know that I'm going to have a very difficult time with this fifth commandment honoring my parents. In fact, no one said this exactly to me, but I would say that sometimes in our hearts there's this perception of ourselves that in fact it's impossible, given our situation with our parents, to ever honor our parents. Unless maybe, Dave, you're going to do one of those kind of cool word studies on the word honor, and we're going to find out that in the Hebrew, the word actually means despise them forever, because if it means that, then I can't do that. Well, the fact is this, that eight weeks ago I had no idea what I was going to say about what it means to honor your parents. But that reaction that I was getting early on before we even got into the commandments caused me to put a little flag around this verse, knowing this, that this commandment for numbers of us is going to be a big one, that it will for some be a hard one, revealing and touching, not just for some, quite frankly, for every person in this room, this commandment is going to touch on some lifelong core pain. For the fact is this, there is no relationship that any of us will ever have that has had more power to shape us, to help us, and to hurt us than that of our parents. But please know this, that regardless of our parents' influence, be it bad or good, and quite frankly, for most of us, the influence of our parents has been bad and good. Regardless of that, however, the word here simply says, kind of in your face, honor them. and do it, this is vital, for your own sake. Verse 12 affirms that. Honor your parents, why? That your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you. Honor your parents, why? That you may be, my paraphrase now, a possessor of the things God has prepared for you in your life. That you may experience, literally, the fullness of your life. The Apostle Paul in Ephesians 6, verse 2, calls this commandment, the first commandment, with a promise. The promise, according to Paul, is, and he says it this way, that it may be well with you. That it may even prolong the days of your life. Meaning, that it will have for you not only emotional, spiritual, and relational benefit, but physical, oddly, benefit as well. Whatever else that means, it means this, that this commandment is pervasive. That our relationship with our parents, whether it be good or bad, helpful or hurtful, honoring or dishonoring, has an undeniably profound effect on fundamental issues of life. Issues like your career choice. Dan Allender, in his book Bold Love, tells of how one young man that he knew chose a career as a lawyer as a means to live out his crusade against all pretenders and fakes. Well, that's a good thing. We kind of applaud that kind of thing. Where did that come from? Where it came from was his father, who was a pompous, arrogant businessman who used his position and power to humiliate people. This man, in reaction to his father, wanted his father to pay. He was brimming with the furious tempest of vengeance, and the practice of law provided a vehicle for well-paid, societally-sanctioned retribution. Interesting thing about this young man, he couldn't prosecute his father. In fact, he couldn't even speak a disagreeable word to him. But he could make other cruel men pay a problem in all of that. In his effort to do that, he became cruel himself. Our relationship with our parents affects issues of life. Like our career choice, like who we marry, like why we marry, like whether we marry, like how we relate to who we marry, like whether we stay married, like how we parent. It affects how we relate to people generally. It affects struggles with intimacy, issues of identity and self-esteem. It affects propensities that we might have toward alcoholism or drug abuse, physical or sexual abuse. I don't mean being physically or sexually abused. It affects our propensity toward doing those things ourselves. It affects struggles with obesity and anorexia, promiscuity and frigidity, homicidal rage and impotent passivity. All of those things are traced by many health care professionals back to unresolved issues, undealt with pain, unhealed hurts from our father and our mother. It is amazing to me that once again the word of God speaks to us with clarity and contemporary power. For this call to honor our parents is at the core of a call to deal with all of those unresolved issues. For until you do, you'll never be able to authentically honor them at any level. And you'll never be able to experience the fullness of what God has designed for your marriage, for your career, or for your life. About a year and a half ago, my wife and I, Bonnie, we're doing something we do from time to time. Can we just kind of take an inventory of our life. You know, he can sit back and just kind of talk. How are we doing? And quite frankly, we felt by all accounts pretty good. We love each other like crazy. The kids are doing well. We just enjoy them enormously. But as we were kind of noticing where we were in our life, we're kind of around 45. Two of our girls are pretty much gone in college and they come back from time to time and it's great. Our boys are in high school and we're not there yet, but we can kind of smell the empty nest thing and it smells really good Most of the time. But we're kind of looking at each other, just recognizing not an enormous problem, but we're going into another phase in our life, and it might be a good time to talk to somebody. And we both acknowledge a kind of ache in our hearts for more, in particular, more intimacy with each other. So let's go talk to somebody. So we did. We got some counseling, and we just got to talk about some stuff. Well, my expectation around this deal was that we didn't need very much. Kind of the analogy I had, probably a little spark plugs maybe, two or three, change the oil, send us on our way. I halfway expected, in fact, after this guy hearing us discuss our life together, just kind of laying it out before them after a couple sessions, that he'd just kind of give us our money back. You know, hey, you guys don't need any help. You know, I've quite frankly never seen a couple who's more wonderfully matched and finely tuned as you two individuals. In fact, I expected, I had those little fantasies, and in fact, I tend to live in a fantasy world half the time. But, you know, I was wondering, I was expecting him to say, if my wife and I could come and maybe see you. Well, it didn't go like that at all. And among the very, and among the many irritating things that this guy started poking around at, one of the most irritating things for me was he kept asking us questions, and me in particular, about our parents. Tell me about your dad. Tell me about your mom. I don't want to talk about my mom. I don't want to talk about my dad. I don't want to talk about my marriage. I want to talk about my wife. I want to talk about my kids. I want to talk about intimacy. I want to talk about communication. I'm starting to get mad. I want to talk about nurture. Okay, he said. Tell me some more about how you feel about your mom. And about your dad. Question. Why'd he go there? Answer. Because that's what counselors do. They learn that at counselor school. Telling you it's just a bunch of psycho babble. When, you know, were you abused as a child? Did you wet your bed? Did you suck your thumb? my favorite, how does that make you everyone, feel grr I'm a great client good, it made me feel good, I like sucking my thumb, I still suck my thumb yeah well yeah, good, at this point the counselor guy lowers his glasses and says I sense resistance yeah I'll give you resistance actually the guy I I was sitting and talking to when I would act like that he would just laugh his head off because he knows I'm an idiot here's the truth about all this I don't know for sure why these guys go there the only thing I know is why it's a really good idea that they do. You know why? Because woven into the fabric of the universe is a law. And amazingly, it is a law that is rooted in the fifth commandment, Exodus chapter 20, verse 12. The law is this. You cannot dishonor your parents. You cannot, another way to say it, ignore unresolved issues with your parents and at the same time fully realize fruitfulness in your marriage, in your career, in your relationships, in your life. For unresolved issues with mother and father that are manifested in dishonor, sometimes full-blown hatred, inevitably, according to the word of God, diminish your life, even to the extent of your health. For rage, anxiety, stress, drivenness, and denial undealt with makes people sick. And that is why God in Exodus chapter 22 verse 12 calls his people to enter into whatever process it might take to get to the place where we can at some level honor our parents. But that raises a question, and this really is the million dollar question, and it's why this word about honoring parents is going to take more than one week. The question is this, what does it mean to honor? And how on earth do I authentically honor a parent who, quite frankly, is not worthy of it, who abused, abandoned, or deeply wounded me, and who, quite frankly, has never repented, who either won't even acknowledge or can't even acknowledge the damage that they did to my heart? Well, let me back off that question directly and tell you generally where I want to go with this over the next couple of weeks. And just so you know, next week I'm going to be preaching, but not on this. It's going to be two weeks from now. We're going to do some really important church things in terms of our vision and direction and kind of fall. Very important stuff. I invite you back. But as it relates to this issue, it's going to be in two weeks. And where we're going to be going generally is around three things. First of all, point number one, we're going to start with the essence of honor. I'm going to do that today. What does it mean? So I have some tracks to run on. Secondly, I want to talk about the undeniable necessity of honor and kind of hit on it even more than I already have this morning. And third, I want to talk about, and most importantly I think we'll deal with this, we want to deal with the process that is involved in coming to a place where we can authentically honor. The kinds of thing it often takes. It was interesting, this last Wednesday at staff meeting, I almost always ask for a little bit of time at our senior staff meeting to talk about the sermon. I love to pick the brains of these men and women on our senior staff, and it almost always helps. Just give me ten minutes. What does honoring your parents look like, especially to people who have parents who aren't worthy of honor? Well, this ten-minute talk turned into an hour and a half. And it just kept going. And you know what? Even around that table of people who I think are reasonably healthy people, every one of them had a story of their process of coming to a place where they could authentically honor their parents. And there was a process involved in that. And for some it was a very painful one. Among other things that became clear to me was, first, this is really a big issue. Another was this. There is no formula that applies universally. Like, because I went through this process, or this was the cycle of events that I went through to come to a place where I could really honor my dad or honor my mom, that that's the way it's going to work for you. It could be totally different. That makes this difficult series to preach. You have to be careful not to give you some hard and fast formula, because there aren't any formulas. People come to this differently. Let's begin with all of that in mind with this point number one, the essence of honor, a definition. The Hebrew word for honor, at its most basic level, speaks to, interestingly, weightedness. Let's just start there and just go on and build on that. To ascribe to your parents appropriate weight. With that in mind, it occurs to me, just right off the bat, that some of you who have been by parents, abandoned, could maybe never come to a place in your life where, in relation to your parents, you can give much more honor to them or weight to them than this, the respectful acknowledgement that they gave you life. I mean, you couldn't give them any more weight than that because you've never even possibly had an interchange with them at any level. They are bearers of the image of God, and through them the image of God came to you through your very existence and maybe through a lot of work in terms of your abandonment, you can even come to a place where you can say, well, you know what? I can honestly, authentically say I am grateful that the image of God, my very existence came to you, and at that level I'm going to respect you. Sad, but true for some. That would be the appropriate way. The only level at which you could authentically honor them. People who really struggle with this matter of honor, Parents often don't know they're struggling with it, but can sometimes self-diagnose a struggle you didn't know you have because they tend to view their parents in an extreme, either to deify them, which often means you're living in denial because most of us have parents who did really well and really poorly, who really helped and really hurt us. And to deify them means you're real. There's some weird stuff going on there. The other extreme, however, is to vilify them. sometimes we minimize the weight of our parents influence and live in denial it's no big deal i'm not going to go there or maximize the weight of our parents influence and live in a kind of i've already said this idealizing them or on the other end of it blaming them for every single problem you've got as if you are somehow not responsible for your string of failed marriages and string of irresponsible decisions to them. The question that faces us in this first session around this topic is, how do we come to a place where we can somewhat accurately ascribe appropriate weight to our parents, to our mother and father? Well, I believe that whatever else is involved, and there are many other things involved in coming to this place of ascribing appropriate weight, One thing that is clearly involved is the issue of remembering. Sometimes what we remember is good and helpful. Other times it is bad and hurtful. What I want to do in the remainder of our time is try to illustrate how we can honor or ascribe appropriate way to our parents when it's either been good or been bad. Let's start with good. A year ago last Tuesday, my dad entered into the final week of his life on earth. Now, most of you don't remember that it was maybe last week, but you remember when that happened because it kind of happened to me, and I shared it with you, and you knew that. He was staying at our home, had come up to visit my two brothers and myself, and was staying at our home at the time when he became very sick, had difficulty breathing. He couldn't walk, and he couldn't go to the bathroom unassisted. What that necessitated was someone carrying him and helping actually to clean him as well. On this particular Tuesday when he got so bad he ultimately had to go to the hospital, I was pretty much alone with my dad. And so that responsibility of caring and cleaning fell on me. And I remember being very uncomfortable with that, especially on the front end. I mean, this is my dad. You know, Dad, come on. You can do it. And it just felt, I even felt bad for him because I knew this was a humiliating experience for him. What helped me snap out of that discomfort, it wasn't that somebody told me, this is what you're supposed to do. Well, what happened was I remembered something. And what I remembered was this. This guy that I'm carrying right now carried me all my life. And I'll tell you what, I can carry him now. And all of a sudden, the carrying of my father turned into, for me, an honor for me to carry him. What I know about that experience was this, that carrying him and cleaning him humiliated him. You know what else it did? It honored him. It honored him. A week and a half later at his funeral, my two sisters and two brothers spoke of my father. They did it out of what they remembered. They didn't make anything up. That does not mean none of us had issues with my dad that we needed to work through that were hurtful. We did. But when we remembered at this particular event the treasure hunt we went on, and by the way, finding good things, sometimes because we've been hurt, requires what you might refer to as a treasure hunt. It's a good discipline. Go on a treasure hunt. We didn't have to look real far. We had a wonderful father. But they spoke out of what they remembered. And my brothers and sisters and my mom and myself ascribed to my father in that process appropriate weight. The natural result of ascribing to him appropriate weight was that what we said honored him. A word of exhortation out of that. While some of us are indeed having to deal with grievous issues of abandonment and abuse relative to parents, I am going to venture an assumption that most of us had parents that could best be described as normal sinners, meaning they were men and women who were flawed human beings with feet of clay who loved you, who didn't know completely how to love you for a variety of reasons, but quite frankly, they very possibly loved God, too, and loved you. They loved it, they loved you in a way that did not meet every need you had. In fact, gave to you some wounds that you've had to do some work around. You would do well, if your parents were normal sinners, to go on a treasure hunt from time to time, enter into this discipline of recognizing, you know what, I've got some work to do over here about the hurts I have, but one thing that's even going to help me do that with some balance is to equally work a treasure hunt, where I remember some things about them that they were able to give to me as gifts. And as you do, it may begin to dawn on you that given their background, given even the era of time they lived in, some of them coming off of the Second World War, and whatever that meant to them, Given the limitations of even what churches were understanding about people and marriage and tools that were available to them, put all that stuff in the pot and you might even begin to get the idea that they did a pretty decent job. Did they give you everything that you needed? No. In fact, some of you, if you did a treasure hunt on what they were desiring to give to you, might even come up with an idea that given their entire situation and their own background, they might have acted heroically toward you. Speaking of heroic, some of you have grown up in, or maybe are right now growing up in, a single parent home. And if being with a mom and a dad together still doesn't give you everything you need, maybe being all by yourself with a mom or a dad and one of the others being gone for whatever reason gives you even less of what you need. If you grew up in a family like that, a home like that, you might be dealing, not necessarily, but you might be dealing with some significant pain and maybe even some, what I would call legitimate anger that you honestly need to deal with. And the worst thing you could do is just shove that all down and pretend it isn't there. But another piece of work you might have to do is sometimes remember and become aware of the fact that sometimes the one who gets some of your legitimate anger illegitimately, who gets illegitimate anger illegitimately, is the one who stayed. I'd like some of you who came in situating to stop for a second and try to remember that maybe the one who's there, who you have a tendency to constantly blame and consistently assault, it'd be important for you to remember that that's the one who stayed. That's the one who stayed. Doesn't mean you don't have issues. Doesn't mean you don't have a lot of work to do. But somewhere along the line, let rise up in your heart little things like this. Thanks, Mom. thanks dad for staying you know who that really helps? well it helps a single mom and a single dad yeah it probably would, you know who else it helps? according to the text, this isn't talking about helping mom and dad, according to the text it's going to help set you free that your life may be prolonged that you may begin to live in a kind of freedom because some of us go into our marriages and into our parenting having embraced a rage about our parents that we think we are totally justified in heaven. And you're totally justified in being hurt. Wounded, but the embracing of rage hurts you. But what if, Dave, the truth for me is, you're talking about remembering here, That when I remember, all I can remember is the pain. You know what I mean? You're telling me to go on a treasure hunt for good, and I tell you, I've done that, and I can't find anything good. The overwhelming experience of my life was hurtful. Indeed, for all the pain, I can't see any good. Well, let's deal with that now. Let's talk about that harder issue. To get to that, I want to tell you a story. Get to it this way. If this were, instead of a church service, a classroom, where we were studying the issue of how to honor parents who we don't think are worthy of honor. One of the assignments that I would give you would require you to go to a movie. I think it would require you to go to a movie that I saw this week. It's called Smoke Signals. I want to tell you about it. It tells the story of two young Indian boys, Victor and Thomas, growing up in a rather bleak Indian reservation out west. Thomas, little boy, when he was an infant, lost both of his parents in a fire, and he was raised by his aunts. Victor was abandoned by his alcoholic abusive father when he was 12 years old and raised by his very loving mother the scene of his father's abandonment was quite poignant it went like this confronted by his wife for his drinking Victor's father became enraged hit her full in the face with his fist and ran out of the house swearing to never return Victor, this 12 year old boy watching this whole scene became livid at his father's abuse of his mother, but at the same time was terrified at the thought of his leaving. Broken heartedly, he ran after the truck and climbed into the back of the pickup truck before his dad was able to pop the clutch and get away. Stop right there and put together the conflicting emotions that I just described to you. On one hand, he was rageful at his father for hitting his mom. At the same time, he was terrified that his dad would leave. At the same time, he was brokenhearted, and tears were streaming down his cheeks as he ran after this truck. Those are three pretty confusing emotions to be going on in a 12-year-old boy, hard to sort out, wouldn't you say? Well, when he climbed into the back of the pickup truck, his father slammed on the brakes. He threw open the door, came around, and grabbed Victor. And in the context of what was going on, You halfway expected him to then hit Victor. He picked Victor up and hugged him. Gave him a big bear hug, put him down, and left. Feel the conflicting emotions. Now, he picks me up. He puts me in his arms. He does what I want him to do. He's holding me. He's hugging me. He loves me. He put me down. He's leaving me. This kid is rageful. He's terrified. He's brokenhearted. He thinks his dad loves him. His dad just left him. 12-year-old kid. Deal with that. Zoom in on little Victor's face, and you can see, as his father drives away, never to return, Victor's hurt turns in that instant to hate, became all hate. In the very next scene, Thomas, Victor's friend, not maliciously, but stupidly, asks Victor, Victor, why did your father leave? Did he hate you? at which point Victor exploded with full-fisted rage all over Thomas. Interestingly, in that scene, Victor, by pummeling Thomas in the face, was becoming like the father that he hated. Ten, twelve years pass. Word comes back to Victor and his mother that his father had died in a nondescript place, little tiny trailer, dusty place. All he had was this trailer home where nobody else lived in a little pickup truck, come and get his stuff. Victor, after struggling with whether he wanted to do that, finally relents, bringing Thomas' friend with him to go on this pilgrimage to pick up his father's things. When Victor gets there, he meets, unexpectedly, some people who don't hate his father. Figured everybody would know this guy was a jerk. Who, instead, see his father through different eyes. Who speak of him in tender terms. and begin to tell Victor of a father who spoke to them often about a son that he adored named Victor. What? He adored? He adored? Oh, yeah. He made up stories about you. And every story he told us about you, you were the hero. Well, I don't know about you, but I don't know what you would expect those stories would do. But those stories didn't help Victor. They didn't go, oh, he loves me after all. What they did was they confused him and angered him even more. You know why? Because now he was put in a position where he was going to have to decide again. Who is my father anyway? Is he a drunken bum who abandoned our family, beat my mom and beat me? That's who I decided he was. Or is he this likable guy who cared about people and was able to have friends and even somehow cared about me? Which is he? Well, guess what helped Victor? Ascribe to his father the appropriate weight. It was when Victor realized that his father was both those things. He was an alcoholic. He did abandon the family, and he was responsible for all of those things. Victor did not get into minimizing or denying the damage that his father did by realizing that his father was both of those things. He did not minimize the pain that he inflicted. He was a terribly flawed human being. But he was a human being. Victor never knew that. Final scene. Shows Victor pouring his father's ashes off a bridge into a raging river on the reservation. And as he's pouring these ashes into the river, from the depths of his soul comes this primal scream that in the movie lasted. It seemed like a minute and a half. He just screamed and screamed. And as it continued with the music behind it, I began to interpret what the scream meant. and I think accurately, for it was filled with paradox and contradiction, remorse and release, anger and understanding, loathing and love, fear and finally forgiveness. And that screaming that buckled him finally at the knees and left him in a pile on the bridge, you know what that did? it honored his father. For that agonizing work that Victor did there gave appropriate weight to his father's life. His father did damage to him. Thus a primal scream. But somewhere Victor, through all of that, was able, and we have to talk more about this next time, how people come to places like this where he was able to understand something of his father's condition and even come to a place where he could release some things and forgive some things. And when he did that, it didn't change his father. His father was dead. It changed who? Victor. And it set him free to now move on with his life and experience what the text calls about a fullness of life. that your days may be prolonged. And you can begin to walk in the fullness of what God has for you. Don't give me that mother, father, honey. Yes, you do need. Unresolved, yes, you do. Today we dealt with the essence of honor. And what it is is to ascribe the appropriate way. Two weeks from today, we'll get to point number two, where we reiterate the vital necessity of honor. And point number three, talk about the process of what kinds of things does it take to get to that place. Just in closing, one final word to kind of blanket over this whole thing, even as you go through some personal processing yourself of this, and that is that you would hear the heart of God on this whole issue. Out of the last two verses in the Old Testament, Malachi chapter 4, verse 6, where God says this, my heart for you is this, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and turn the hearts of the children to their parents. Think about that. You want to pray for something that will heal the land? I don't mean just heal you and maybe help heal your marriage or bring revival to our church, which it would, but you project that kind of dynamic out into this city and out into this incredibly torn culture. You want to pray for something that will heal the land? Pray for that. the hearts of the parents turn to the children and the hearts of the children turn to the parents honor your parents honor your father and your mother it's the first commandment with a promise the promise that it may be well with you that your days may be prolonged that you may be a possessor of things God has prepared for you and that you may experience in freedom the fullness the life God desires for you. Let's stand as we're dismissed. The altar team is going to be here for anyone who needs prayer for anything. And I would be a bit surprised, quite frankly, if we would talk about something this pertinent, I think, to everyone, that if there weren't significant numbers of people who needed that. And so we just invite you to take advantage of that. If you need someone to talk to, they will be here for you. But let's just pray as we close. Father, you are our father, and you are our mother, and you are the only one who can give us what we need, and you gave us parents, and all of them were flawed, some of them horribly. And I pray in your name that as we come to grips with this word you have given us that is designed for our freedom, that by your spirit you would help us and give us courage to walk into whatever process it is going to take to get to places where we can authentically, not in denial, but in reality, give appropriate weight to our father and our mother so that we can walk in freedom. As we are fathers and mothers and husbands and wives and friends and co-workers and just people living life in freedom. You call us to that. You empower us for it. Do it among us in Jesus' name. Amen
