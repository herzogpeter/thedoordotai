How y'all doing tonight? Better than our president right now, I can tell you that. I'm telling you. Sorry! That was cheap, but, you know. Gotta laugh out of the crowd. We're going to, in a little bit here, have some overheads maybe. That may be coming. but whether we have the overheads or not, what I want to do is talk a little bit on the question of responding to the questions of unbelievers in our age. This thing was titled Answering Skeptics from the Word. And I have no idea, I have some idea, who came up with that title. It wasn't me. Because if you think about it, you don't answer skeptics by the Word, or from the Word. If quoting the Bible meant anything to them, they wouldn't be skeptics. So it's not so much a question of answering skeptics from the Word as to answering skeptics and unbelievers. What is that? Oh. Is it you, Lord? The last trumpet shall sound. Well, it's a bad trumpet. Maybe that's it. but answering on believers on the basis of the word but not quoting from the word let me read you a passage of scripture here which I think forms a very good model what I want to first do Dave you're wonderful last minute kind of thing I thought this started a quarter after seven so I no hecklers in the crowd ushers could you usher him out and bring him to some clinic or other. I don't know. How's that looking? Hey, how's that? That good? All right, good deal. Answering skeptics. I want to do a little preliminary consideration, and then we'll move into the substance, what we want to talk about. The model of the dialogue, dialoguing with nonbelievers that I'd like to refer to, comes out of the book of Acts, chapter 17. It's probably a little small for some of you. that's okay it's mainly for my sake anyways i can follow my nose so i can read it what do you care acts chapter 17 verse 22 then paul stood in front of the eragopagus which was a meeting place for intellectuals and said athenians i see how extremely religious you are in every way he was looking at the various idols that they had all around, and he says, I see how extremely religious you are in every way. For I went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, your idols. But know how he kind of politely says, your objects of worship. I found among them an altar with the inscription to an unknown God. What therefore you worship as unknown, this I want to proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth does not live in shrines made by human hands, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things. From one ancestry he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence in the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps grow up for him and find him, though indeed he is not far from each one of us. For in him we live and move and have our being, as even some of your own poets said, for we too are his offspring. Since we are his offspring, we ought not to think that the deity is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals. Since we are the creation of God, we ought to think of God as at least as good as we are, not beneath us like these stone objects that you have dedicated to different gods. Let me say a word of prayer, and then we'll jump into this. Father, I pray, God, that you'd give me clarity of thought and give all of us clarity of thought and hearing. And what we want to be about, Father, is kingdom work. You've put us here as citizens of heaven, but missionaries on the earth. And we are to be carrying out this missionary endeavor furthering the kingdom of God, taking back territory that rightfully belongs to you but has been stolen by the enemy. And part of what has been stolen by the enemy, Lord, is people's minds. And connected to the minds are people's hearts and spirits. And so, Lord, we want to use this time as a way to equip the army of missionaries who are called to spread the word here. Use it effectively for your glory. Be present here. Infuse it with your spirit, we pray in your name. Amen. There's a lot of, I think, a lot of true things that you can get out of Acts chapter 17, but there's just a few points that I want to bring out at the very beginning regarding what our approach should be to non-believers. And the first thing is, I want us to notice Paul's attitude as he's talking to these Athenians. He's, first of all, respectful. He doesn't come in there and bash them over the head with what he sees as being wrong with them. The way he talks is very respectful. He's courteous. So he says, I see that you have, I perceive many objects of worship. And he's not foaming at the mouth and quivering at the lips and pounding a Bible when he says it. He just is noting something. He affirms them. I note that you're very religious. You're really searching for something here. There's one temple or idol that's dedicated to the unknown God, and that's what I want to talk to you about. But he doesn't start by bashing what he sees as being wrong. He finds a point of contact and then starts elaborating on that. He's humble. He doesn't come in there as the know-it-all who's going to teach the blockheads what is true. In fact, he quotes two Stoic and Epicurean philosophers and poets in the course of his dialogue with these Athenians, saying that, you know what, some of the people that you read and look up to in the philosophy that you study, they've got some true things. In fact, he reasons with them on the basis of their own respected authorities. Notice that. He says, of God is, as you know, from your own writings, from the people that you respect, from the Stoic and Epicurean philosophers that you quote, God is everywhere. We live and move and have our being in God. That comes out of Stoicism. So Paul has a humble approach. He doesn't come in as the encyclopedic know-it-all. And finally, he's loving. His concern is not to win an argument here. See, A lot of times when we get in dialogues with people who are non-believers, our first objective is to win an argument. You can win an argument and lose it. You can win the battle and lose the war. Far more important than winning the argument is how you go about stating your argument, or how you conduct yourself, or the attitude, the spirit, the demeanor that you have as you present your case. And it can even be the case that you might intellectually lose an argument, but the demeanor might leave an impression on them that will be a seed that's planted there. As we dialogue with nonbelievers in our age, sometimes it is very frustrating. I'm speaking from experience. Sometimes it's very frustrating. Very, especially if you're related to them. It's extremely frustrating. But it's crucial that we have, in all of our dialogues, a real Christ-like demeanor, an attitude that will, That communicates as much, if not more, to the people you're talking to than does the content of what you're saying. Something about our approach is very simply, first of all, Paul, we see here, found a point of contact. He, instead of starting off by stating what he was against, he starts by trying to find some area of agreement and launching off of that. Try to find a point of contact, some kind of commonality, something that we have in common that we can begin our discussion on. In this case, Paul quotes two philosophers that he knows will have clout with the people that he's talking with and he uses them as a starting point to go on towards Christian truth. He also finds this point of contact, namely that they've got an idol that's dedicated to an unknown God. They had many, many idols dedicated to different gods they knew about, but they wanted to make sure that they had their bases covered, so they dedicated one idol to an unknown god in case there was one up there and they didn't want to tick him off or offend him or anything. So they dedicated that to him if he'd be out there. And Paul starts by saying, I want to talk to you about that. You admit that there's an area in your theology, an area that you don't know. Well, let me kind of start to fill in the details here. Paul, his methodology is to try to complete, try to offer Christianity as the completion of what they already believe. Now in the course of that, of course, there'll be a lot of things to confront, and Paul does confront them there. He tries to get them to see on the basis of their own presuppositions how some of what they're doing doesn't make sense. If you also believe that in God we live and move and have our being, and that we are his offspring, then let's think about that now. Why could God be honored by graven images? Graven images are beneath us. We're his offspring, therefore the graven image must be beneath God. So why are you doing this idolatry? But he comes at it kind of through the back door. He comes at the negative on the basis of the affirmative, on the basis of the starting point that he has. In our dialogues with people, I think it's so important as we conduct ourselves that we don't, first and foremost, engage in what we disagree with. I don't know what it is about evangelicals, but a lot of times we just feel the need to do that. You know, the person that we're talking to is God, you know, they're living with somebody, or they're gay, or they're on drugs, or whatever, and we just feel like we're condoning their lifestyle, or their habits, or their whatever. We feel like we're condoning it unless we say out loud that we disagree with it. But why think that? The most important thing is to begin to develop a relationship with people. And if you come to me and the first thing out of your mouth is what you don't like about me, you're going to have a hard time getting to point B to establish any kind of relationship. So it's important. And the other thing is that, you know, we just got to understand that you can even get a person to quit doing this behavior or quit doing that behavior and quit doing this, that, and the other thing. And they're no more saved before they were when they sort of cleaned up their act. You haven't really helped them. Maybe you feel a little bit better about yourself, but that's about you, not them. What they need is a Savior. What they need is a relationship with Jesus Christ. And if you have a relationship with Jesus Christ and you're basically a decent person, or if you have a relationship with Jesus Christ, or wait, no. If you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ and you're a basically decent person, or if you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ and you're an indecent person, it doesn't make a lot of difference. You don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ. And what we're about here is ushering people into a beautiful relationship with Jesus Christ. Don't let the things first and foremost get in the way. Now that can get complex, but that's, I think, a good starting methodology. The second thing about approach is this. Be informed. And that's what this class is about. Be informed. I got time I shoot here. Peter says, always be prepared. Easy, easy. Always be prepared to give an apologia in Greek, to give an answer or a defense. We get the word apology from it, but it doesn't see, no, it doesn't mean it's going on saying I'm sorry. I'm an apologist. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry. No, it's give a defense, a rational defense. Give a reason for the hope that you have within. Always be prepared to do that. We ought to have, on the basis of scripture, but also just on the basis of the culture in which we live, Christians can't afford any longer to go around and reciting out there, God said it, and I believe it, and that settles it for me. God said it, I believe it. Though some may doubt that his word is true, I've chosen to believe it. Now how about you, God said it, I believe it. And that saddles it for me. Wonderful! Praise the Lord. That was a very good song. And now I shall give a rendition of... There's nothing wrong in and of itself with believing God. You know, you just believe God. Some people have this childlike faith and they can just believe God. And if you have a strong faith that can just do that, I don't want to come and shake you up and say that you don't have a strong faith. On the other hand, what I can tell you is this. Our culture no longer shares the assumption that the Bible is authoritative. It no longer shares basic fundamental presuppositions about what even truth means. And if that is the case, and it is the case, you can't expect to convince a whole lot of people who have very much going on upstairs that Christianity is true just because you say so or because the Bible says so. We need to be able to, to some degree at least, we don't have to all have a PhD in apologetics, but to some degree, be prepared to give a defense for the faith that we have within. Now, your testimony can go a long ways in some instances. Say what God has done for your life, and the Holy Spirit can use that and convict people's hearts, and I don't want to minimize that. At the same time, you've got to know that when you give a testimony about how Jesus Christ changed your life, we now live in a culture where most people have heard about how Allah changed the Muslim's life and Shiva changed the Hindu's life and Euryanthea changed this person's life or what have you. I mean, testimonies are all over the place. So that alone doesn't decide the truth issue. It doesn't determine, it doesn't help people decide what is true and what is false. For this, you need some reasoning. And what I want to do in this two-session course is to treat four, I sat down and I thought, what are the four most crucial apologetics issues that we face in contemporary American culture? Crucial apologetic issues in contemporary culture. And I think that there are four. I'll try to get through the first two tonight. That'll be a stretch. And I'll try to get through the next two next week. But I may only get through the first one and a half tonight. We'll see how this goes. What is the nature of truth? What is the nature of ultimate reality? Okay, this is a big issue today. We're basically talking about God. Is there a God? And if there is a God, what is he or she, as the case may be like? Okay, so the nature of truth, the nature of ultimate reality, the nature of Jesus Christ. Who is Jesus Christ? there are a billion and 16 different opinions about him last I counted. And so we need to ask the question, who is Jesus Christ? What is his nature? What is his role? What does it mean to say that he's the way of salvation? Does that mean all Muslims are going to hell? And questions of that sort. Very important questions that we need to ask. And the final thing is the nature of the Bible. What is the Bible? Aren't there a lot of people who have solid arguments against the Bible? Doesn't it contradict itself? Is there any way, can you give anybody any reason to think that the Bible is the Word of God? And what I will argue is that there are some very good reasons. In all of this, I've tried to break it down to its very essentials, knowing that we've only got two weeks, knowing that we have an audience that's very diverse, and we're all on different levels. So I'm trying to, some of the stuff you can really get into and get heady and all that kind of stuff, but we're going to try to, as much as possible, keep it at a level that we can, first of all, assimilate and understand, and then maybe communicate to the people that we come in contact with. Okay, first let's talk about the nature of truth. The nature of truth. This is a huge issue in our culture. It didn't used to be. It used to be the case that when you talked about truth or you talked about error, you talked about right and you talked about wrong, People maybe disagreed with you about what was true, but they agreed that something was true. Something was true. And something is right and something is wrong. Now maybe we disagree about the exact content of what is right and what is wrong, but we would both agree that something is right and something is wrong. We are now in an era, and we have been for over a decade, but it's increasingly becoming this way, where that very concept is called into question. the very notion that there is truth is called into question. What permeates the thinking of a lot of people, and I'm sure most of us have come into contact with some of this, is what is called relativism. What's called relativism. And there's a lot of different kinds of relativism. I don't care about those right now. I'm just talking about the concept of relativism itself. The basic idea of relativism, the basic notion of relativism, is that everything is relative. That is to say, what you believe to be true, in fact, what is true, is relative to you. And what is right and wrong is relative to you. It's personally conditioned to your desires, to how you were raised, to how you think. So you hear stuff like this. This is huge in our culture. What's true for you may not be true for me. What's right for you may not be right for me. Truth is subjectivity, Kierkegaard gets misquoted as saying. And so we each have to kind of define our own truth. This is rampant. And we have to kind of create our own realities and create our own moralities and kind of forge our way ahead. It permeates everything. And this is an extremely important point to note because if you're dealing with a relativist, what I'm finding is that a lot of Christians are relativists, or at least they're influenced by relativism, but they don't know it. At Bethel College, I get kids who say, Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior for me. But who am I to judge? What right do I have to say? And they don't stop and think about the implications of what they're communicating. bottom line is that if you're talking to somebody who's been significantly influenced by relativism it's very hard to talk about christian truth because they'll keep on saying well that's that's good for you uh that's does that help you live um does that help you actualize yourself that's really good i wouldn't want to you know even argue with that uh you know i i like transcendental meditation but you know for you that that and it's very hard to communicate it because you want to say, no, this is important for you. But you keep on running into this relativism. As long as a person believes that truth is relative to you or relative to me, you can't talk about objective truth. They may even say, well, yeah, I can say Jesus Christ is Lord for some people, but not for others. And it just doesn't go anywhere. Let me make two points about relativism. How do you Handle someone like this. Option A is to get very, very frustrated, mad, angry, lose your temper, start swearing, ruin your witness, and then walk away feeling self-righteous. Or, you can take the Greg Poy apologetics course. Call now. Okay, one thing is you can really help a person. If you can show them, and this is what Paul did, he's trying to say, okay, you Athenians, what you're doing with these idols is kind of inconsistent here, okay? You believe that in God we live and move and have our being, right? You believe that we are his offspring, right? Now, what about these idols here, these little graven images that you are worshiping? See any, do we have a problem here? Okay, he's trying to gently get them to see that there's something wrong with their thinking. Yeah, let's turn a light on here, okay? If we can do that to people who are holding relativistic presuppositions, we will do them a great favor. Here's a little inconsistency in relativism, and I'll talk both about what's called ontological relativism, or sometimes epistemological relativism, as well as moral relativism. Scratch all of that. I'll talk about truth relativism first. The claim, the claim that all truth is relative. Does anyone see a problem with that claim? Right, it's a non-relative claim. It's like, it's as if, it's a self-refuting claim. All truth is relative. Really, is that absolutely true? It's like if I say, hey, everything I'm going to say tonight is a complete lie. Well, see, if that's true, then it's false. Because what I just told you was a lie. It's called a self-refuting statement. All truth is relative. If that is true for all people, then it's an absolute truth claim. In that case, it can't possibly be true that all truth is relative. There's at least one absolute truth, and that is that all truth is relative. But if there can be one absolute truth, maybe there could possibly be two. And maybe the absolute truth is that not all truth is relative, since you've already given me one example of a truth that's not. Had a conversation with a man about a year and a half ago now, and he was going through this one New Age sort of indoctrination, and that's what it is, a New Age indoctrination course. And he held the belief, he was saying that all truth is relative, and his belief was that believing anything absolutely is a rut. You get stuck there. You need to always be growing, we're always changing, always actualizing ourselves, kind of developing, And that's important. And he said, you know, when people, and he was really getting kind of mad at me because I was coming at them like I'm coming at you right now, and that's really frustrating if you're a relativist. And he was really getting frustrated. He says, you know, you have these beliefs that Jesus Christ is Lord, that the Bible is the truth, da-da-da, and beliefs are ruts. They're just ruts. People believe stuff, and they get stuck in it, and they stop growing there, and they just hanker onto it. Beliefs are nothing but ruts. And I said, you really believe that, don't you? And he said, absolutely. Absolutely! See, the bottom line is that you can't, there's no way you can even make a statement about reality without it being some kind of a truth claim. There is nobody who is a consistent cognitive relativist, or believes that truth really is relative. They may think that way, and it's really kind of politically correct and academically respectable to talk this way when you're on an academic campus, but I guarantee you that if you're in the middle of the road late at night and there's two shining headlights coming at you, you're not going to stop and if I say there's a semi coming right at us right now, the person's not going to say, well, is that just true for you? Is that your perception of reality? No, when the rubber hits the road, we all act as though there's an objective reality out there that we both have to intersect with and there's an objective reality out there that is both going to impact us very quickly if we don't get out of the road. We believe there is objective truth. People also believe, though they deny all the time, that there is objective morality. They don't hold that everything is morally relative. They say they do, but they don't really believe that. Steal their parking spot sometime and see how they respond. Here's kind of the inconsistency that is so prevalent. I had a professor when I was at Yale who was a real cultural anthropologist relativist. She was really big on defending the rights of pygmies, certain pygmy tribes, to practice cannibalism. And it was terrible that we Westerners were going in there and these practices have been around for thousands of years. How can we impose on them our Western morality? Fine. I heard it before. But what was really interesting, and I never got a chance to talk with her about this. I'm not sure how she would reconcile it. But one evening, there was a special lecture given in a certain hall on, is given by her, on why the United Nations should make women a protected group and be given human rights status to the point where any culture that did not treat women appropriately should have sanctions put upon them in just the same way that any culture that now takes political prisoners and whatever, we impose sanctions on them. We agree an international code of human ethics that the global community is to live by. She was saying that how women get treated should be part of this, and that's an issue that's still going on today. They had a huge conference in Beijing several years ago, the Women's Conference, and they were arguing just for that. Now, I think that they've got a real good point. I'm for it. I think that some of the practices that go on in some of these African tribes with circumcising young girls for the later pleasure of men are barbaric, and I'd say that they're barbaric. They need to be enlightened. They need to be taught some of this stuff. Now, I know that sounds Eurocentric, etc., etc. That's not even the issue I'm talking about, But I can say that women should be that because I believe that there is a standard of right and wrong that transcends cultures. If you don't believe that there's a standard of right and wrong that transcends cultures, how on earth can you ever say this culture, on any practice, is wrong? You see? What gives you the right to say that infanticide in India, where one out of four little girls are set aside to die, what gives you the right to say that that is wrong? They've been doing that for thousands and thousands of years. never could quite figure out how that is different than eating people it just i just doesn't click for me i don't know may i'm dull but okay so the point is many of those who are right now involved in the feminist movement trying to arrive at global standards of treatment minimal standards of treatment towards women which i am in favor of many of those are also individual or cultural relativists that is to say they believe that morality is relative either to personal preference or to a culture's preference, but they're inconsistent with it. And I would argue that they're necessarily inconsistent with it. I think it's impossible to believe otherwise. It's impossible to believe otherwise. We do this all the time. I had a debate with an atheist, Gordon Stein, several years ago at the University of Minnesota. And he was arguing that morality is all cultural indoctrination. We agree upon certain standards of behavior. We internalize them. They become our conscience. We call them right and wrong. It's all cultural relativism, and it's the standard stuff you're going to get in secular textbooks on the issue today. I asked him, however, then, sir, do you believe that if the Nazis would have won the Second World War, it would, right now, really be the case that it was a good thing that six million Jews got exterminated? Because we'd all be Nazis right now. And see, he was in a tough space, because he doesn't want to say, yeah, it would be right that six million Jews got slaughtered. He's in a university campus. That's not going to be a real fast sell. But neither can he say, no, it would have been wrong. It would have been a terrible thing if the Nazis would have won the war. Because he knew where I was going with it. So he said, well, Hitler didn't win the war. Duh. I'm sorry, that wasn't respectful. I apologize for that. But it was irresistible. But I responded by saying, but he could have won the war. In fact, for a little while it looked like he might win the war. Bad guys sometimes win. And he responded by saying, no, he couldn't have won the war. Because there is a... Well, he really couldn't articulate why Hitler couldn't win the war. It's something about basic human optimism or something. But I asked him, on what basis can you say there's some kind of a good principle, a good metaphysical principle that prevents bad guys from really winning big? What is this? In your view, you would have to say that Hitler could win the war. Bad guys sometimes do win. And if he had won the war, then we'd right now be saying that it was a great thing that six million Jews, including one million children under the age of five, got exterminated in Nazi Germany. But since you don't believe that, you ought to admit that there are transcultural standards that we appeal to by which we can say that something is right and something is wrong. Even entire cultures can, to some degree, be wrong. Okay, so you show the inconsistency of relativism. It's impossible to hold in a consistent way. Secondly, you do a great service to people if you can show them the dogmatism of relativism. Zm-zm-zm-zm-zm-zm-zm. The dogmatism or the narrowness of relativism. Here's what I mean by that. The cultural assumption. I know you've been confronted with this if you've been out talking to people at all. The cultural assumption today is that enlightened people smart people more mature people understand that we're all at different places along life's way and we all have a different perspective on reality and we all define truth and and we no one has the right to impose on anyone else their own beliefs about things and then the little christian comes along and says well i i believe the bible really gives us the standard for all time, for all cultures to live by. There is a distinct looking downness that happens when you do that. Oh, you're one of them, little Christian. It's like you obviously haven't arrived yet. You're not part of this elite culture here, the intellectuals in America. You still believe in those kind of things. That's portrayed as being a narrow belief. To believe that, as I believe, the Bible is the word of God, and it's the only book on the planet that really is the word of God in the full sense of the word, that Jesus Christ is the son of God, and he is the only person in all of history who is the son of God, to believe that. To believe that, you know what, salvation doesn't come by Buddha, and it doesn't come from Islam, and you know, to believe that is so narrow. It's so narrow. Broad people say things like, all roads will get you there, okay? And And it's just seen as being kind of a narrow thing to disagree with that. Here's the thing that you can really help people with. The belief that all truth is relative or that all roads will get you to your destination is just as dogmatic as the belief that only Jesus Christ will get you to salvation. The two beliefs are just as narrow. Here's an analogy that I've used. I give you license to use it whenever you see fit. Let's say that we're in the middle of the woods. and there are 10, there's 10 people and there's 10 routes out of the middle of the wood, 10 routes, routes, 10 ways, 10 paths, okay, to get out. And we forgot how we got there. We're one of us, me, and we always forget how we get anywhere. So here we are and we smell smoke, the forest is on fire. That just sort of symbolizes that you don't have all the time in the world to think about this stuff, you're going to die. Now the question is, what's the right path out of the woods? What's the right path out of the woods? And so person number one says, I believe we got here to this path. If we take this path, we shall surely survive. The next person says, no, if we take this path, we shall surely survive. The other person says, you two guys are stupid. If you take this path, you shall surely survive. Then the fourth guy says, no, you guys are all dingbacks. This is the path. Number four is the path. If we take this path, it will get us out of the woods. All ten choose, let's say there's nine paths. All nine, nine of them choose a different path. But then there's one person, person number 10, who says what our culture says today. You silly, narrow people. Become enlightened. Don't you know that, of course, we will disagree about these things. What's important is that we love one another and tolerate each other's differences and appreciate each other's differences and get along. And whatever road you choose will get you out of the forest quite safely, Differently for sure, but in the same destination. Now, here's the question. Which of those decisions, including number 10, has the higher percentage of being right? All other things being equal. They all have exactly the same probability. They have a 1 in 10 chance of being correct, of getting out. The guy who says, well, all roads will get you out, he might be right, but it may be the case that only 1 will get you out, And so he's got a 9 in 10 chance of being wrong. The probability is the same. If he says, well, I'll roll with a good yell, so I choose this one, well, he's got a 1 in 10 chance, all other things being equal, of surviving. But the point is this. His belief isn't broader than anyone else's. It's just as narrow. What makes a belief broad or narrow? This is an important point. What makes a belief broad or narrow is not what you believe. but why and how you believe it. Think about this. For anything that you believe to be true, there will be an infinite number of alternative things that will be wrong. Stupid example here. This is a pitcher of water. There's one thing that it is. It's a pitcher of water. But there's an infinite number of things that it's not. And if you think it's any one of those infinite number of other things, you're wrong. It's not a cow. It's not a bird. It's not a train, a plane, or Superman, or anything of the sort. It's a pitcher of water. Truth is always singular. Error is always infinitely multiple. So any belief that you hold about anything, including the belief that all things are relative, is going to be very narrow and singular. What makes you a broad-minded or a narrow-minded person is, have you considered why you believe what you believe? This is the crucial question. As we argue about which path to go on, I hope somebody would have the brains to think, okay, let's start looking at evidence instead of just spouting out of our opinions. Here we see the path is a little more worn than the other paths. That means maybe this was the path that we more recently walked on. Here's an article of clothing that matches that little rip in your pants right there. Maybe isn't that an indication, a piece of evidence that in fact, see, now we're talking evidence. Now maybe you can give me an argument to the contrary. I'm broad-minded if I listen to you. Not if I equivocate on my convictions, but I'm rational. That's what makes you broad. But just to have the opinion that every road will lead you out is as narrow as any other belief you could possibly have if you don't have any reason for believing that. You see, don't buy the lie, the assumption of our culture, the mishmash, potato thinking, mishmash, potato thinking, That somehow there's a higher truth in believing that all truths lead you out. Okay, that's the issue on the nature of truth. Let me move along here to the nature of ultimate reality. If you have a question about that, I'll be glad to take that. The nature of ultimate reality. And man, there's a lot you could say about this. There is at least, to my mind, 22 different arguments for the existence of a personal God. I'm not going to give you any of them. What I'm going to do is to give you something that I think sometimes works on a person-to-person level in talking about the nature of things and the nature of God. This is the question of what is the ultimate nature of the reality that we live in? There are a lot of people today who believe that the ultimate nature of things is just absurdity. It's just matter. It just is there. We can't know it. We can't think about it. It's just there, ignored, and try to earn a lot of money on Wall Street. There are others who believe that the ultimate nature of reality is sort of this impersonal force, some kind of higher power, but you can't say much about it. It's impersonal and whatnot. So what can be said as we dialogue with other people about the ultimate nature of reality? Christians believe that the ultimate reality is a triune God, the triune God, whose essence is love. He's rational, he's personal, like we are. and he's moral and he created us for a reason and he expects something of us. We are accountable to him. There's a personal God whose essence is triune love, who is like us in terms of having personal characteristics, although he's certainly beyond our limited capacity to be personal. There's other ways of thinking about that. Now, what can be said in defense of the Christian view? Let me give you several considerations here. Number one, this is what I call the argument from desire. And this works, I think, very well to people who don't believe that there's any, they're inclined to believe that there's no life after death, they're inclined to believe that there is no personal God up there, that life is here and now. This is a good kind of thought process to invite secular people on who are really secular. They're just the ordinary people who go to work, come home, eat, go to bed. They're just normal people. They don't think a lot about ultimate things. Here's the question. I think it's a very, very good question. How is it that our desires outrun nature's, this should be ability, nature's ability to meet those desires? Here's a question to ask yourself, just to be thinking about it. How is it that our desires, our longings, our aspirations, outrun nature's ability to meet those longings and aspirations? That's the question. Let me give you an analogy. If you look at a fetus in the womb, you'll see that that fetus has lungs. But there's no reason why it would need those lungs, really. I'm probably talking about my ignorance here, but it's not. It looks like those lungs are made for something beyond the womb. You note that that fetus is developing feet and toes, but why would it possibly in the womb need those feet and toes? It's developing eyes, but why would it need eyes inside the womb? And it's developing all sorts of things that don't seem like they belong in the womb. It's got too much equipment. It's over-endowed for the womb. Even if you, for some weird reason, having lacked Anatomy 101, didn't know what was going to happen to that baby in a short amount of time, even if you didn't know what its destiny was, and all you knew about it is that it was in this location in the womb, you ought to be able to infer that wherever it's going, it's going somewhere beyond the womb. Aristotle said this, you can tell destiny by examining nature. You can tell destiny by examining nature. Look at the nature of this forming baby and you can tell that its destiny is outside the womb because it's got things that are part of its nature that way outrun the womb's needs and capacities. So it is as we look at human nature. Look at human nature. Adios Huxley said this one time. He said, and he was a famous agnostic, he said, there comes a point in life when even after Beethoven, Mozart, and Schopenhauer, you ask the question, is that all there is? Is that really all? What he was saying here was that even in the peak experiences of life, even when life is at its absolute greatest, you've done the American dream, you've arrived, you're there, everything is kosher, you've got your money, and you're all filled up with stuff, There is inside something, if you're honest with yourself, that says, is this it? Is this it? There's an emptiness there. This is, if nothing else, is a common ground with people. Paul was looking for that common point of contact. Emptiness is everyone's point of contact. Now, they may deny it because they don't want to look at it. They may just completely walk away from it. They may say, I'm as happy. I never worry about that stuff. They're lying, at least to themselves. But you can know that it's there. We hunger for stuff. We long for stuff. We long for life to make sense. But if this life is all there is, it just doesn't make sense. We long for our life to have meaning. But if this life is all there is, ultimately our lives are utterly meaningless. But we long for meaning. How is it that we long for meaning and we long for things to make sense? We long for morality, however much people may deny it. We wish that good would conquer evil. But if this life is all there is, and in the end you die and become maggot food, then good does not overcome evil, love does not conquer hatred, right does not conquer wrong, in the end, the chemicals win. It doesn't matter whether you've been a Hitler or a St. Teresa. It just doesn't matter. The universe doesn't care. It goes on in its cold, black nothingness forever and ever, and what difference would it ever have made whether you were born or not? It's a dismal, dismal picture. We find that hard to believe. The question is, why? Why is that so difficult? Jean-Paul Sartre, a famous atheist, in a book called Being and Nothingness, he said this. He said that being an atheist... No, in that book he said this. He said a finite point without an infinite reference point is essentially meaningless. A finite point without an infinite reference point is essentially meaningless. We are finite points. But if there is no infinite reference point, then our lives are utterly meaningless. What he's getting at here is this. A finite point, it comes into being, it goes out of being. Before it exists, it doesn't matter whether it exists or not. After it exists, it doesn't matter whether it exists or not. So whatever it does, it's meaningless. It comes to nothing. You close your eyes only for a moment, and the moment's past. How's that song go? All we see crumbles to the ground, but we refuse to see. dust in the wind, dust, all we are is dust in the wind. Dust in the wind. All we are is dust, all we are is dust. Okay. The point, okay, so here's the thing. You look at anything else, and you can talk to people about this. Look at, find me any other area in nature, any other area where nature naturally produced creatures who had needs that nature couldn't meet. It doesn't exist. uh you know we thirst but there's water thankfully we hunger and there's food you have sex drives and there's sex you have a craving for oxygen and there's oxygen nature in the animal kingdom always it creates creatures i'm talking like they talk now creates creatures that nature can supply but what kind of a bizarre cosmic freakish joke would it be if nature produced creatures like us who long for stuff to the point where we sometimes kill ourselves because we don't think we can find it who long for things that never could exist we long for meaning but there could never be any meaning there never was such a thing as meaning we long for love to conquer but that's an impossible idea it never could happen in this universe how could the world produce on by natural evolution or whatever beings who long for something that could never exist it's like the people in the amazon uh craving to go out skiing um and there's there's it's never snow down there wouldn't you have to explain that isn't that absurd there must have been someone a missionary somebody who told them somewhere there must be snow folks if you crave it uh what would it be like to crave something that doesn't exist well that's the problem of trying to explain us human beings unless you suppose that the ultimate reality is something like us if you suppose that there is a being who is personal like we are, and we are his, Paul now, offspring. Now who we are makes sense. Okay, now I can understand why I have these cravings and desires and longings, and why life makes me unsatisfied as it is. The reason is because I'm a little embryo developing, and I'm not, this world is not the stopping point. It was never meant to be the fulfillment of all that I am. I got these lungs and I was meant to breathe and I got these feet and I was meant to walk and I got these eyes and I was meant to see. So also I got a longing for love that implies that there must be some reality that fulfills all your longing for love. Isn't that a wonderful thought when you think about it? I really believe that all your dreams will come true because you wouldn't have those dreams unless they could someplace come true. Nature can't produce beings who outrun itself. We outrun this physical reality, and that just tells me that we're of a different sort of reality. So the question is this. This is the argument from Desire. If we crave rationality, how could ultimate reality not be rational? How could an absurd universe produce creatures who reason like we do? If we crave morality, good to conquer evil, love to overcome hatred, etc., how could ultimate reality not be moral? If we crave meaning, how could ultimate reality not be purposeful and meaningful? We want our lives, I think, I personally think that's one of the greatest drives is to have some significance. To matter. To make, to be to somebody important. And to, the thing is that death laughs at that idea unless there's some meaning that goes beyond death. If we crave love, how could ultimate reality not be loving? let me close with one related issue i'm not going to get into the problem of evil we'll start with that next week but here's here's a final related issue it's getting increasingly big in this culture there's a fundamental different perception of reality between the christian worldview and the eastern worldview and the eastern worldview with the new age movement and stuff is really beginning to permeate our culture so we need to know about it the eastern worldview basically says this the highest thing that can happen to a person is to become one with the universe. Okay, and some of you have heard that, right? To become one. In fact, you know, you've got people out there saying, I am one with the universe, I am God, we're all God, you know. And to experience absolute absorption in the cosmic hole. Okay, and that's really huge. It comes out of the Upanishads and the Vedas and Eastern teaching. The Christian worldview is fundamentally different. The Christian worldview says this. And I'm not even going to talk about how to resolve this issue. I just want you to note the difference. The Christian worldview says that the highest goal is not absorption, but love. And love implies differentiation. I can't love you if I am you, you see? We have to be different in order to love one another. Love is this striving for unity amidst difference. In the Christian worldview, people never become God, though God does become a people. And he does it out of an act of love. But the eternal picture is for us to be participating in his divine nature, 1 Peter 1.4 says, which is, John 17 tells us, participating in his love, participating in his triune love. We're caught up in the love that the Father has for the Son throughout eternity, and the Son has for the Father. We are not the Father of the Son, but we're the Bride of the Son, and we participate in that. The Christian vision is a vision where we will always eternally have our distinct identities, but they'll be perfected identities, and the core of the whole thing will be Trinitarian love, ecstatic love, an eternal dance celebrating the love of God reflected in all of our lives. That's the vision. In Eastern thought, the vision is simply to become one with everything, to be absorbed. absorbed. Just portraying it like that can help people begin to think about the issue. What is really more attractive to you? Do we not? Is there not something in the core of your being that says that the highest goal of everything is love? And I think most people in the core of their being think that. It's love. But in Eastern thought, love is a preliminary step to yet a greater thing, which is absorption. Two very different worldviews. Christianity is the only view, the only worldview with its view of God as triune, that can say consistently that God throughout eternity is loving. Because there's some kind of loving transaction that occurs within God's own being. For every other view of God that you would hold, whether it's the eastern view or the Islamic view or whatever, love is a verb that God does, but it can't be a noun that God is. Whereas in Christian thought, God, the noun, is the verb. He is eternally loving within himself. And so loving is the core of his nature. It's not an accessory thing. Now, how are we going to handle this question thing? Help me out here. It's 8 o'clock, and we wanted to have 15 minutes of questions. We have the people coming down. Come on down. We've got a nice, what do they call it, grunge pit? What do they call that? A mosh pit. Mosh pit, yeah. Let's do it. If you have questions, just wait and send them into the aisles. I heard the first question, and it was, could you please sing that God Said It and I Love It song again? I'll dance it, God Said It and I Believe It. And that settles it for me. i believe that my salvation is through the blood of jesus christ is it contradictory to believe that other religions such as hindu that seem very spiritual even more so than most christians have other ways to get to god okay very good um and i'll have to on all these questions i want to get to as many as possible so i'm going to try to abbreviate my answer as much as possible i'll make two qualifications there. One, I'll have to give an abbreviated answer. I'll stick around for about a half hour afterwards if you want to come up and talk more about it, okay? The second thing is that I'm giving here my opinion on stuff. If Dave Johnson disagrees with that, that's because he's wrong. But there's room for differences of opinion here, but since I'm being asked the question, I'll give my answer. Here's how I think through this issue, okay? A couple of things. It's always a good theological principle. In fact, not just theological, but just in life. To work from the known to the unknown, okay? So we got something that doesn't make sense to us here. Let's see, a lot of people start with what they don't know, and then they try to qualify what they do know on the basis of what they don't know. No, settle what you know, and then work to the unknown. What I know is this. The Bible, number one, says that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. No man goes to the Father except through him, John 14, 6. Throughout the Bible, you have the idea that there is no salvation outside of Jesus Christ. And that's not just a truth that doesn't fit anywhere. It's a central kind of a truth because the central teaching of the New Testament is that without the shedding of blood, there's no remission of sin. The whole idea is that Jesus Christ isn't just some kind of better than other prophets. He's of a different caliber altogether. He's God incarnate. This is God taking on our flesh, taking on our sin, paying the price for our sin, so that we may be rightly related to him. Without the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, there's no salvation. Okay, I know that. That is, I think, really clear. All Bible-believing Christians would agree with that point. A second issue, however, that I know is that I know that there are people who didn't know him who are going to be in heaven. The Old Testament's full of them. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, da-da-da-da. Even some people who weren't part of the Israelite lineage, seemed to be treated as heroes of faith in Hebrews chapter 11, so they're in heaven. So that tells me that, but the other thing is that they needed to be saved as much as I did. They were as much sinners as I am. They had to be covered by the blood as much as I do. So they had to go to heaven through Jesus Christ as much as I do, but there's no way they could have known about Jesus Christ because of certain things that were beyond their control. The conclusion I draw from that, and there's a lot of other things we could get into about these particular verses and whatnot. But the conclusion I draw is that, there's a third thing I know for sure, and that is that I'm told in no uncertain terms to preach the gospel and to treat that as an urgent matter and to work on the assumption that unless a person enters into a conscious, willed relationship with Jesus Christ, they can't be saved. Okay, there's a whole thrust of that. So you have three motifs. Jesus Christ is the only way to be saved, but there are people who don't know Jesus Christ who are saved, and yet it's urgent that we preach the gospel to everybody. Otherwise, we have to assume that they're not saved. The conclusion I draw is this. I have an outside hope that there are people outside of the Christian faith who are saved. But I don't know anything about that. I'm not God, and I therefore am not going to, I can't be certain that they're in hell. But I can't at all celebrate with any assurance that they're in heaven. So I have to preach the gospel to them and operate under the assumption that at the very least they're in grave, grave danger unless they believe. But do I know for sure that they're in hell? I don't. I do know that if they're saved, it's because of an openness. It's not because they're so good in their religion because goodness is not the issue. The issue is, is your heart open to God's saving grace? And Romans 2 seems to tell us that when we don't have the truth, we're judged on the basis of the light that is within us. The Bible says in John 1, verse 6, is it? Or maybe it's verse 9, that Jesus Christ is the light that lightens everyone who comes into the world. There's light everywhere, and it's Jesus Christ. So even though they maybe don't have the gospel preached to them, there's an outside chance that they could be saved, but I can't wager anything on it. So I've got to preach the gospel with a sense of urgency. Good question. Important one in this age, too. okay we got a real simple one here greg um if god is by nature there's no question that's simple that i can't make if god okay good if god is by nature love and goodness and he cannot contradict himself where did satan come from a created evil being okay very good um we'll talk about this next week when we when we talk the major objection to the idea that ultimate reality that is god is personal in nature the the major objection to that in our age is the problem of evil in fact has always been the major objection. And that the core of the problem of evil would be something like, why did God create Satan? And if Satan is a creation of God, isn't he responsible, isn't God responsible, at least in large part, for what Satan does? And what I'll argue next week, what I'll try to lay out next week, is, by the way, this is an indulgent self-advertisement, but I consider this issue very deeply in this book called God at War. So you might want to run, I have hundreds of copies, understand up in the bookstore. At least four. But the bottom line is this. I would argue that God is no more responsible for what Satan does than I am responsible for what my daughter does when she turns 22 or whatever. We are free moral agents. And so is Satan. And so I would argue are the angels. And that means, I'll go into this more next week, but that means that they have the potential to bless or curse. I'd argue that that's the very meaning of what it is to be free. You have the potential to go one way or the other. When you go the other, the creator who created you free isn't responsible for that. You are because you're created free. So God didn't create Satan evil. God created Satan with a tremendous potentiality for good, but that also implied a tremendous potential for evil, and that's unfortunately what transpired. Yeah. What's the best way to witness to your family? Best way to witness to your family. A lot of it depends on who your family is. It really does. Because sometimes that question is, sometimes the best way to witness to your family in a certain situation is to keep your mouth shut. And you can, in some family systems, you just better pray that somebody from the outside is going to do some talking. You really have to, you know, the family is so various, variegated. It's like, you know, there's no easy way to answer that question. I would say as a general principle of this, though, that be careful to avoid the obnoxious hard sell. I'm talking from guilty experience here when, for the first year of my Christian life, I tried desperately to cram the Bible down my father's throat, and his throat wasn't big enough or the Bible was too large or something, but it didn't. It was counterproductive. The best way to witness is through your life. It's through your life. Work on your relationship with God to the point where you're walking as a reflection of his, you're a mirror of the triune love of God, and that will say, because your family knows you, you know, that's the trouble. You can fool the person on the street, but your family knows you, And so they see reality. That's why it's such a hard sell in the family. So you really got to deal with reality there. Don't be pretentious. Don't try to fool them. Be honest with your faults, but really try to work on living the life. And then pray for them a great deal. Pray that God will be working through you. And on the whole, I would say, just be careful that when you bring it up, it's not a forced thing. Don't try to force the issue. hope that they'll bring it up. Maybe you can kind of like plant seeds that help them bring them up. But you just got to be careful about being overly aggressive there. Especially, from my experience, when wives get saved and husbands don't. Wives, everything I just said applies doubly to you. And I hope that doesn't sound sexist, but I think women are more salvageable than guys. And so it seems that wives get saved more than husbands. There's a couple of reverse cases, but... Okay, I better quit while I'm ahead. A question on the role of tradition that's used lately in reference to various religions and beliefs and appealed to as a basis for truth. How do you respond to the use of tradition? Okay. Yeah, it is sort of... It is really big now in talking in secular environments about different cultural practices and religious practices to appeal to tradition. I think it's probably because our culture is so uprooted from any kind of tradition. We're almost trying to create our own traditions, that we kind of long for traditions. It feels like it has substance to us, and it is becoming the case, as this person has noted, especially in academic circles, to treat traditions as sort of inviolable. They're sort of authoritative in and of themselves. And so to say, well, this is their tradition is really to give it its ultimate authority. That is, however, simply another way of saying that morality and truth are culturally relative. They're traditionally relative, and the culture comes out of that tradition. So everything I said about moral and cognitive relativism would apply to this. I do think it's very important that you respect traditions. And I think Paul was giving us a good example of that. You don't walk in and just bulldoze over traditions. Paul said, I become all things to all people that I might win some. And it's important that when you're dealing with a person of a different tradition or whatever, you respect that. You buy into it. It doesn't mean that you're agreeing with everything, but unless you talk the same language as them, and our behaviors talk as much as our words do, you're never going to get a chance to be related to them or witness to them or anything. So we need to respect traditions. At the same time, there is no reason why, just because something has gone on for thousands of years, it makes it right. And I think everybody, at some level, believes that. I will refer back to my Yale feminist professor as a case in point. The barbaric practice of female infanticide and female circumcision has been going on for centuries and centuries. that doesn't make it right. And that implies that we're in touch with a standard that transcends these different traditions. I have a number of friends that are seeking something in the spiritual realm, but they do not know what. They're not open to the idea of God or the possibility of God, even though they believe there could be life elsewhere in the universe, but not God. How do I get a discussion going? How do I get the discussion going? Send her to the movie Contact. That would certainly get... Occam's razor. How do you get the discussion going? These are tough questions. How-to questions are really hard. I'm better at the theoretical. Because of how-to, there's so many different variables here that I can't possibly take into account. I guess the thing to do would be, this argument from desire might be the trick to begin to talk about why is it that you're longing for something spiritual? How would life on other planets help you? Isn't what you're longing for something different than that? Even in the movie Contact. It was really sort of anticlimactical. I was expecting a revelation from God or something, but instead you get this alien who's shaped like her father. How many people here saw the movie Contact? Okay, good. About half of you did. I see a lot of movies. But even in this movie, the alien ends up saying, well, we've learned that we need to love one another or relate to one another. It's the only thing that makes life bearable. And like that was the, whoo-hoo, life can be bearable if we just make contact. But are we longing for something more and ultimately fulfilling something? And what view of things makes the most sense? And for a lot of reasons that I can't go into, but some of which I went into already here, I would propose to them that if there is a super example of us, the only slice of reality we know for sure is our own slice. It's the only thing we know firsthand. All thinking is done by analogy with itself. So let's think about what the world might be like, what the world must be like for me to have the cravings that I have right now. Well, if everything comes from something that is a super example of what I am, then everything makes sense. In other words, a super person, i.e. God, a personal God. Then things make sense. Then your longings make sense. And then I would encourage them to begin to explore what a relationship with this personal God might look like. Think of it this way. It's agreed by everybody that the effect can never be greater than the cause. I'll probably have to end with this. But the effect can never be greater than the cause. If you roll a rock down a 40-foot hill, it's not going to roll up the other side of the hill 48 feet. if the angles are the same. Okay? The effect never outruns the cause. Well, the effect that we need to understand is ourselves. We're the effect. We didn't cause ourself. We are the result of something. Okay? We're the effect. Now, the question is, what is the cause? Well, the cause, if you just stick with standard common sense, the cause, and this is what Paul's actually getting at in Acts 17, We are someone's offspring. The cause might be evolution, just sheer time and chance, natural selection. But what does that explain? It doesn't explain anything. We are effects that have outrun the cause. We have desires that outrun reality. Bizarre world we live in, huh? Or maybe the cause is like us, but a super example of us, because the cause must be greater than the effect. Thinking along these lines, I think, can begin to, whatever is the ultimate cause of everything, it must be at least as great as me. And that means I should ask the question, if I created this world, why might I do it? And does this cause expect anything from me? Why do I exist? What does he want from me? Am I accountable for my actions? And you start thinking along those lines, and I think you can help people a lot in terms of working their way towards Christianity. Greg, thanks. but as we close I'm assuming everybody will be back next week at the risk of a shameless plug for your own books are there some books that people could start reading that you think are particularly relevant and would be appropriate to recommend I'll shamelessly endorse one Letters from a Skeptic has been used a lot by people giving it to friends to get a discussion going I talk a lot like this, but maybe in some ways more expanded, in some ways more abbreviated ways with my father, who was an agnostic atheist, depending on what day he asked him, kind of a guy. And it led to his salvation when he was 73 years old, at the end of a three-year correspondence. So that's sometimes helpful. On these sorts of questions, on these sorts of questions, I have found a book by Peter Kreft and, I forget, Ronald Tasselli, called A Handbook of Apologetics. It's good on a lot of apologetic issues, but it's really good on these kind of issues about what's ultimate truth and stuff. They're philosophers. K-R-E-E-F-T. And the book's put out by InterVarsity. It's called The Handbook of Christian Apologetics. It's a big, thick thing, but it's quite readable. Another very good book, a classic, is C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity. Everyone's going, yeah, yeah. But he talks a lot like this, about what's the nature of ultimate reality, about the need for a personal God, and things like that. And that's quite readable. I'd recommend that one. For other historical issues, there's a different set of things that we can talk about next week. Let's close with prayer, And then you're going to stick around for a few minutes? Sure. Where are you going to be? I'll be back in these bleachers. Should we get to it that way? Okay. I'll be in the mosh pit. Father, we give you thanks for this time together tonight. We're grateful that you speak the language of the head and the language of the heart. You speak the language of the whole being. And we pray that you continue to challenge and stretch us to be prepared to give an account, give a reason, give an apology for the hope that is within us. We ask that we could continue to be transformed into your image for your glory. In Jesus' name, amen.
