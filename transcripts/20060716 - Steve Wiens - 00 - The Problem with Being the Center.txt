The donkey? Oh, great to be back, everybody. Good morning. Let's pray as we go to the word. Jesus, your name is the very best name that we know. It's the highest name. It's the deepest name. And we're here centered around not just a name but a person. And you are here with us. so we pray that this morning right here in Maple Grove that your kingdom really would come in our hearts first and then on the streets and all the way across the world that your will would really be done here through us because we love you Jesus amen well I believe this I believe that three-year-olds have the unshakable belief that they are the center of the universe. Now, my favorite three-year-old these days is Joel's daughter, my niece, Maggie. And one time, Maggie was kind of playing rough with her mom, Kathy, and hit Kathy in the ear. And when Kathy said, Maggie, that hurts Mommy, Maggie said, no, Mommy, it hurts me. It's all about her. Another time when her older sister, Hallie, had a loose tooth, Maggie thought for a moment, And then insisted that it was she who had the loose tooth, not Hallie. Now if you live with one of these little tyrants, not Maggie or Hallie, but a three-year-old, you know that they're working on you to wear you down. So that you are in full concert with the fact that they indeed are the center of the universe. I want you to imagine for a moment that you have the mind of a three-year-old. Yet, you engage in every part of your life as you normally would. You still drive to work. You still are a mom or a dad or a friend or a husband or a wife or brother or sister. You still consume massive amounts of caffeine to get every day started. And I want you to imagine yourself in the following scenarios. Scenario number one, you're at work. And the person in the cube next to you gets the promotion that you were hoping for. You have four options. A, you could grab her new contract and scream, mine, mine, mine, until she forces her boss to give you the job. B, you could immediately spill coffee directly into her laptop and then smirk at her. C, you could slap her and scream until she leaves your presence. Or D, you could engage in all the above. Scenario number two Your spouse takes the last piece of pizza Even though he's clearly had more than his share And you are still hungry You could A Forcibly take it from his mouth Put it on your plate And initiate a stare down Until he breaks eye contact B You could shout No! No! No! until he removes the pizza from his mouth and gives it to you. C, you could throw everything that's currently on your plate onto the floor, his face, the walls, until you get said piece of pizza. Or D, you could repeat all of these in order until you get the pizza. Now here's what I think. I think the only real difference between us and three-year-olds is that three-year-olds act out what we wish we could. you agree with that the reality is that if we don't admit that we think the world revolves around us we think that it should that's why we get angry when the person ahead of us doesn't immediately go when the light turns green it's why we get unbelievably frustrated when we've called every number that we have for a certain person in the span of five minutes. And within five minutes, if they haven't called us back, we are livid. My wife said it best a couple of nights ago over dinner. And she said, you know, I think that we want to be the center of the universe because it is the only way that our needs will get met. That's what we believe. Now the problem with being the center is this. If we are the center and everyone else is orbiting around us and everything is orbiting around us. The problem is that you are what? You are stationary. You're not moving. And what's worse, you're not only not moving, but you're demanding that everyone else begun to move toward you and orbit around you. And this is a big problem because demanding to be the center of the universe is completely different. than the image of the God in whose nature we are created. God is utterly different than that. The truest thing about God, I believe, is that God exists in a collaborative, mutually submissive relationship with the Son and the Father and the Spirit. The Trinity know each other in terms of their self-giving love for each other. They're constantly, if you read the Scriptures, with a certain lens on, they're constantly putting the needs of each other in front of their own. Not my will, but yours be done seems to be the motto of the Trinity as we read about them in the scriptures. They move out towards each other and around each other instead of demanding that the others orbit around themselves. God is not static. In fact, I think the very nature of God is movement. if you were here when I spoke last February you might remember that I used the word perichoresis to define the relationship between the spirit and the son and the father and this word is a theological term that's been used for hundreds maybe a couple of thousands of years to describe the trinity it literally means to dance around each other it's where we get the word choreography from It describes a relationship between the Son and the Father and the Spirit of mutual indwelling, mutual submission, and movement towards and around each other. And we see this Trinitarian relationship play out all over Scripture, but especially in two passages. And the first one is found right at the beginning of the Hebrew Scriptures. In Genesis chapter 1, we start in verse 1. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, let there be light. And there was light. In this account, we see the Father initiating creation. We see the Spirit poised over the waters. And I picture the Spirit ready to move in the act of creation. And the Son is the Word of God, depicted in verse 3. Remember in John 1, it says that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Creation itself is the result of, I think, a combustible relationship of love that has existed for all time between the Spirit, the Son, and the Father. And their relationship is so full of dynamic movement around each other and deference toward each other, that it became generative and it burst out into you and me and stars and planets and mountains, all because of the love that God has for himself. Now the second passage is found in Mark chapter 1 verses 9 through 13 and the setting is this. Jesus is sitting at the banks of the Jordan River, and he's joined a bunch of people to be baptized by John the Baptist. Now, Tim Keller is a phenomenal pastor from Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, New York. And he has this remarkable insight that when Mark wrote the baptism story of Jesus, he was deliberately pointing back to the creation story. So as I read this to you, these five verses, see if you can put the pieces together about how it relates to what we just read in Genesis. At that time, Jesus, again, this is Mark chapter 1, 9 through 13. At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven. You are my son with whom I love. With you I am well pleased. And at once the Spirit sent him out into the desert. And he was in the desert 40 days being tempted by Satan. He was with wild animals and angels attended him. Now in this account we see the Father expressing limitless love toward the Son in a very public way. We see the Spirit poised over Jesus for anointing and for power. And we see the son submitting his agenda to the father and the spirit by putting on human skin and entering into the world. And by moving out into the desert to be tempted. Now here's where it gets really interesting regarding the relational nature of God. And how it parallels the creation story. Tim Keller, again this pastor from Manhattan, points out that just like the first Adam found in Genesis, Jesus is moved out and tempted. And you'll remember that he was tempted by Satan to become the center of the universe, as it were, by grasping it with power. Satan was giving Jesus that option. And unlike the first Adam, Jesus, who is sometimes referred to as the second Adam, chooses a different path. And we read about his remarkable choice in Philippians 2. verses 5 through 8. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus who being in very nature God did not consider equality with God something to be grasped but made himself nothing. Taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on a cross. Now, when we read the phrase, being in very nature God, Paul is not just saying that, hey, remember, Jesus was God. Remember that. He's saying something like this. We could paraphrase it this way. Because this is exactly what God would do based on his character of love and submission within himself. Because this is exactly what God would do, Jesus did it. He didn't grasp for his status as God. His first thought was not what he could get out of this, but what he could give. And how he could submit out of love for his father. I think he did this because Jesus knew that before anything, his ultimate reality was a relationship of love between the father and the spirit and himself. Now the way of Jesus culminates in a different garden from Genesis 1 and at a different tree from Genesis 3. When the first Adam entered the garden and was told to obey God so that he would live, he disobeyed God and he lived for a while. He made the choice to eat fruit from that certain tree and he became centered on himself and we became centered on ourselves But when the second Adam entered a different garden, the night that he was betrayed, he was told by God, he was asked by God to obey him and die on a different tree. And the second Adam obeyed. He resisted the temptation to have the world revolve around him. And the amazing result is found in Philippians 2, verses 9 through 11. in response to what Jesus did and the choice he made it says this therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father the Father in response to the radical love of the Son elevates him to the very highest place from the lowest place. And in doing so, the father submits to the son. Jesus emptied himself of any equality with God and became nothing. He refused to be the center. And now the universe really does revolve around the son. And when the son sends the spirit to be our counselor and the voice inside of us that speaks to us for God, we see the Spirit submitting to the Son. The Son submits to the Father by coming to the earth. The Father submits to the Son by exalting Him to the highest place. The Spirit submits to the Son by being sent out to us. It's the beautiful upside down way of God. And it's proof that there is mutual submission within God. Now, because the ultimate reality of God is found in this deep relational movement towards each other, then it means that because we are created in the image of God, then what reflects our nature most is to enter into those kind of relationships with others, modeled on the relationship between the Spirit, Son, and the Father. And I believe because this is true, we'll never be more joyful than when we are in relationship with each other, mutually submitting to one another and refusing to be the center of the universe. This is what Jesus means, I think, when he says in Matthew 16, 25, for whoever wants to save his life will lose it. But whoever loses his life for me will find it. Now, Jesus isn't saying that, hey, your needs aren't important. You don't need to worry about getting your needs met. He is saying, up the endless pursuit of being the center of the universe because you'll never get your needs met that way. We all have been in groups where maybe we or someone else have forced themselves into the center of the circle where they are saying my needs have to be met by you and we've all been there and we've all seen the failure in that. Jesus is saying refuse to be the center around which everything must revolve and you'll enter a dance so joyful and so fulfilling that you'll find real life. Now I believe the truest thing about God, the truest thing that we can say about God is the relational nature that exists within the Trinity. Now one commentator said this, that the reason why we can say that God is love, the reason why we can say it is because of the relationship within the Trinity. If God existed unipersonally, if there was just one character of God, then love could not exist within God because love must be given and received. Love must have an output. And this is an amazing thought. Think about it. If you're a dad and your daughter comes to you and says, there's this man that I want to marry and he says he loves me. If you're a dad or a mom, are you going to take that on face value? Or are you going to want to see that love in action? Someone can't be loving without a context within which to love. Because we say that God is love, we know that the truest thing about God is the relational nature of the Trinity. It simply has to be. And if that is true, there's two truths that I think we're challenged with that form the structure of the rest of the talk this morning. And the first one is this, I cannot hope to become more like God outside of the context of community. The second one is, I cannot hope to understand the complexity of the gospel outside of the context of community. Let's dive into the first one. cannot hope to become more like God outside of the context of community. Now, have you ever wondered why marriage was invented? And here's the idea. Find two people that have nothing in common, who think completely differently about every issue imaginable, who will micromanage each other to death, and who really can't communicate with each other without complete misunderstanding and pain. Great idea. I'm convinced this is why God introduces sexual attraction into the picture. Because in the courting process, we are so blinded by our raw attraction for this person that we're falling in love with. That we feel like we have everything in common. This person knows me better than anyone. better than I know myself. This person knows me way better than my parents who changed my diapers for a number of years and kept me in clothes and in food for 25 years. This person is my soulmate. And then we marry this person. And after a period of time, it could be days, months, Like, don't laugh like, oh, it's not days. Could be years. You realize this person doesn't know me at all. And what's more, I don't know this person at all. Why in the world did I marry this person? One of my friends says, it's lucky we don't know what we're getting into before we get into it. Or else no one would ever get married. When it comes to marriage, what was God thinking? I mean, that's the question. I'm coming to believe in my marriage that it's one of the ways that I'm invited into the Trinitarian relationship of God. It's just one of the ways that I am learning about who God is. There's no better arena than to test out this theory that we all seek to get our needs met by becoming the center than in marriage. Just the other night, my wife came into the kitchen and she set a dirty dish right by the sink where I was standing, doing nothing, I'm sure. And then she left the room. And in my mind, I think I knew that she was going to come and put it in the dishwasher later. But there was another part of my empty, shallow self that was thinking, now, does she think I'm going to do that for her? And a little bit like the moment where you sort of imagine the person poised over the missile launch button. Should I do this? Should I do this? Should I do this? I decided to say something, and the something that I decided to say was this, in my most sarcastic of tones. Would you like me to clean this out for you? Now, I think that moment killed a little spiritual formation that was happening in me and in my wife. But here's the deal. Mary and I have committed to each other that we will live together modeled after the Trinity, which is in a mutually submissive, collaborative partnership with each other. And though it feels like we're failing and fumbling half the time, I believe we are becoming more and more godly because of the relationship and all the aches and pains that come with it. Another way that my wife and I have been experiencing the relational nature of God is through a very small group of friends that we're more and more just trying to do life with. We're even trying to make certain decisions together. We're trying to sacrifice for each other. And this concept of being with people in this kind of way is nothing new. Though we tend to read the heroes of Scripture as if they were solo acts, Paul, the writer of most of the New Testament, experience deep levels of community if you read the New Testament with these lenses on. For example, most of us think that he wrote most of the books in the New Testament alone. But if you read Galatians 1, 1, and 2, we read this, when the author usually claims authorship. It says, Galatians was written by Paul and the brothers. Because he lived and did life with the brothers. The same is true with Philippians and Colossians. If we had time to look it up, you'd see that they both begin with Paul and Timothy. The same is true for 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Corinthians. Paul, Timothy, and Silas have you ever even considered that before? That these books that we read that are the word of God were written in community. Paul writes this in Colossians 2, 2 and 3. I should say Paul and Timothy maybe. My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Paul writes this profoundly weird thought that he wants people to be united in love so that they can what? Know Christ. To be united in love so that you can become more like Christ. This is a profound thought. When Jesus appointed the 12 apostles, the first order of business that we read is very interesting, but easily missed. Again, in Mark 3, 13 and 14, we read this. It was Mark 3, 13 and 14. Jesus went up on a mountainside, we've heard that before, and called him to those he wanted. We've heard that before. And they came to him, we've heard that before. He appointed 12, designated them apostles, we've heard that before, that he might send them out to preach. We've heard that before, but wait a second. I missed a little statement. Designated them apostles that they might be with him first before they get sent out to preach. He called the 12 disciples, first of all, to be with him. That was first on the job description. Jesus believed that transformation happens when we are with each other. Now my friends Scott and Ben, who are the youth pastors here at Open Door, they get this when it comes to student ministry. They've developed their entire strategy around the concept of a community of people being with each other and learning together. On most Wednesday nights, before youth programs start, if you would show up here in the building, you'd find Scott and Ben and the rest of the volunteer youth leaders gathered around meals together. Because they believe no ministry can happen to any teenager unless ministry is happening with each other. Unless there is a community that's being formed. And I think they're doing it exactly right. If we want to become more like the Jesus that is forever indwelling the Father and the Spirit, then I believe the greatest single spiritual discipline that we can do is to be ruthlessly aware of our propensity to be the center of our circle. To be ruthlessly aware that the reason why we do that is because we think that's the only way our needs are going to get met. Rather, we need to begin to move toward these people with sacrificial service and with loving deference. This is what I believe it means that we are formed in the image of God. And this is where I believe real life is found. I cannot hope to become more like God outside of the context of community. The second thing that I think I'm learning and a truth that we need to wrestle with is this. I cannot hope to understand the complexity of the gospel outside of the context of community. I can't hope to understand the complexity of the gospel outside of the context of community. Now, when I was growing up, I believed that the gospel consisted of four statements. You may be aware of these. The first one is about admitting my sin. The second one is about understanding God's love for me. The third one is about believing in Christ's work on the cross. And the fourth one is about asking for forgiveness for my sins so I can go to heaven. Now, I believe each of those statements are absolutely true. And I thank God for the grace of them. I believe they are absolutely biblical and true. But I don't believe that they're the sum total of what the gospel is. If you ask me what the gospel is, I don't think it's just these four things. Because these four statements seem to cater around a world in which I am the center. Just pray a simple prayer and get an eternal blessing in heaven when you die. That can't be all that there is. Scott McKnight, he's a professor at North Park University in Chicago. He's the author of two amazing books. One called The Jesus Creed. And the other one that I'm going to quote from called Embracing Grace has this to say about this topic. And I quote, God designed the gospel for us. God designs the gospel for more than my goodness and my sin and my redemption and my liberation and my experience. And my chance to go to heaven when I die. The gospel is about us before it's about me. My own I is in the us, and a gospel of I without an us is a gospel about me. And I'm glad the gospel is for me, but it is also about more than me. McKnight goes on to define the gospel this way, and I quote, The gospel is the work of God in the context of community to restore us to union with God and communion for the good of others and the world. The gospel is designed to create community out of individualists. I believe the greatest enemy of the gospel right now is the spirit of individualism that is overtaking us. We're all captive to this idea that we need to be the center of the universe. And it's crept into the church and it's crept into Christianity. And I would contend that the gospel is much more than adherence to a set of beliefs. In fact, I would even argue that a set of beliefs that is not played out in the context of community is not the gospel at all. Now, if that's true, if that's true, what kind of gospel can we believe in? And can you share that kind of gospel? What kind of gospel can you share with others? Now, I have a new friend named Tyler who's part of Upper Room. And Tyler's story is amazing. He's in his early 20s, and he's a recovering addict who's committed to working through the 12 steps. And one of the steps involves him going to people that he has hurt and making amends with them. And so he's asking these people as he makes amends with them, one of the questions he asks is, Is there anything I can do? Is there anything I can do for you? And for a lot of people, this is really, they have a gracious response to my friend Tyler, but one person said, the one thing you can do for me that would help me is to never talk to me again. Now, it's been a tough road for Tyler. But he was invited to Upper Room when he was living in a halfway house about two years ago. And he's been a part of the community ever since. And after a run together that we had about a month ago, I invited Tyler to be a part of this week-long camp for 9th and 10th graders at CPC, my church that I work. And there were about 140 students on this trip, and I didn't go. But during the week, I received a phone call from one of the high school directors. And he said, Weans, we're going to have to send seven students home because we found them with drugs and alcohol, and they're going to be on the next plane. Now, some of these students happened to be in Tyler's cabin. So Tyler got a chance to talk to these guys. And he got a chance to share his story with all 140 students that were on this camp about how the power of Jesus and the power of the community helped to transform his life. Tyler's story is what Scott McKnight would call a come and see story. It doesn't primarily rest on four beliefs that he has tacked up to his wall or dangling from the rearview mirror of his car. Tyler's experience with God cannot be divorced from his experience with community the power of his story rests in the fact that he was invited into a community before he believed in a creed and the result was the transformation of his life now the gospel that we share is this kind of transformation in this kind of community and in this kind of community do you believe do you really believe that a little group of people who are centered on Christ and committed to each other can change the world or do you think that small groups are just a program of the church now Al Shuck is going to bring Open Door through in the next three weeks just some sort of I wonder thoughts about how Open Door can move into this kind of community. And I think it's going to be a very formative time for this church. But my fear is that you would hear it in terms of, oh, Al, he's the adult life pastor, and he's just talking about his program, and I can check the box because I'm already in one or not interested. Rather than seeing little transformative, Trinitarian communities of people being Jesus' only strategy for changing the world. Now, my best friend, Stephan, who leads worship here every once in a while, pointed out something to me a few weeks ago that left me speechless. In John 17, 4, Jesus makes a startling statement in his most public prayer recorded in the scriptures. And he says this, I have brought you, speaking to his Father, I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work that you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory that I had with you before the world began. Now this is John 17. Jesus says that he has completed the work that God told him to do. This is before he went to the cross. What had he done? He'd healed some people, he'd driven out some demons, but really if you take this statement at face value and in the context of the rest of the prayer, what Jesus had simply done at this point was to form a community of friends that were centered on him and committed to each other. He formed a little band of people that were committed to a selfless, mutually submissive relationship with each other. We read in Acts 13 about Paul and Barnabas going out to do their ministry and speaking and crazy, crazy things. And you read this little tiny verse in Acts 13 that says, And John went to be their helper. Now this is John the apostle. Some would argue Jesus' closest friend. had the humility and the submission to go as these new guys' helper. Now, we also see the messiness of community a couple chapters later when Paul, Barnabas, and John have a falling out. Then they get back together. Jesus formed this little community on earth that modeled the community that he has always known with the Spirit and the Father. And I think it's as if the Spirit and the Father said to Jesus as he went out, just show them how to live like we live. And this little community changed the world. It's why we're gathered here today. We're a part of the link in their chain. This helps me to understand a gospel that doesn't orbit around me. It helps me to understand the community and be a part of a community that is committed to Trinitarian relationships. And it inspires me to want to join a story that is bigger than me. Amen? Colossians 1, 15 through 18 paints a beautiful picture, an alternative to living life centered on myself. We read this from the message. We look at this son and we see the God who can't be seen. We look at this son and see God's original purpose in everything created. for everything, absolutely everything, above and below, visible and invisible, rank after rank after rank of angels. Everything got started in him and finds its purpose in him. He was there before any of it came into existence. And he holds it all together right up to this moment. And when it comes to the church, Jesus organizes it and holds it together like a head does a body. Jesus, the son who went into that garden that night and for love of the Father refused to grasp becoming the center and instead gave it all up. He is the center of the universe around which all of us orbit. He is the God who can't be seen. The face of Jesus is the only face that we can put on God. It was through him and in him that everything finds its true purpose and that everything holds together. You and me, the whole world, and the crazy, irrational gospel of God says that this center of the universe is always moving out toward us with a love that is as limitless as the universe itself. Amen. Amen.
