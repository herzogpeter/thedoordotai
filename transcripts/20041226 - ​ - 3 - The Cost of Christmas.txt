Let's pray as we go to the ministry of the Word. Father, I thank you for the working of your Spirit among us. As we lifted our voices to you in worship, I pray for the power of your Spirit to continually be released now as we go to the ministry of the Word. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Day after Christmas. Number one question. what did Christmas cost you this year? Maybe you don't want to think about that, do you? I'll spoil the whole holiday deal. What did it cost you? A lot? Too much? Did it cost you more than you thought it would? Many of you would respond, it always does. I'd like you to consider this. It always has. I want to talk this morning as we conclude our Advent series of sermons on this the day after Christmas about the cost of Christmas. Using Mary once again, as we did a few weeks ago, as our point of reference for our thinking, I would like to invite you into using your imagination and as we consider Mary again and ask her that question about the cost. So Mary, what did Christmas cost you? It cost you a lot? When you said yes, Mary, to the promise that we talked about two weeks ago in Luke chapter 1, that the life of Christ could be conceived in you and grow in you and come from you, changing the whole world around you, when you said yes to that, be it done unto me, did that yes cost you more than you thought it would? Indeed, here's another question. If you knew then, when you were this little kid and that's what she was, you've got to have that in your mind. This is a little kid saying yes to God for the very first time. If you knew then when you were a little kid what you know now about the cost of that yes to God, would you still have said yes to God? Keep in mind when Mary did say her first yes, if you will, to God when she was this young girl and the angel came with the promise, she couldn't have possibly fully known what the cost would be any more than you or I knew what it would cost us when we first said yes to God. I want your life to come in me and grow in me and stretch me and change me. I want to say yes to God, but you couldn't have possibly known what that yes would cost. You wanted the life. You didn't fully know the costs. Can you remember your first yes to God? Some of you maybe don't even know what that is because you've never entered into that kind of relationship with God where you would say either yes or no to God. But I want you to think back. In order to really enter into what we're talking about this morning, to think back to your first yes to God. Maybe all of you can't do it, but I can remember mine. And not all of you were probably the same age I was. Some of you said your first yes to God in a meaningful way that really brought life to you in a later time in your life. Maybe you were an adult or a teenager. I was eight years old. First time I said yes to God, I can see it in my mind. I can replay it like a little movie, kneeling at the bedside of my mom and dad. We just watched a Billy Graham thing. He talked about the cross. I didn't want to go to hell. That wasn't the only thing, though. It really wasn't just about not wanting to go to hell, though that didn't sound like a treat to me. There was something in my eight-year-old heart that wanted to say yes to God. I wanted to love God. I wanted to know Jesus, and so I said yes to God. Let me tell you something, though. There's a warm part of me that remembers that and sees that as being who I was and who I am in some respect. But I had no idea what that yes would cost me. And that wasn't the only yes I've ever said to God. It's another thing I think as evangelicals we get to say, are you saved? Are you filled? Yeah, I'm filled, but I leak. And we're going to talk about that in weeks to come. How many of you know that in your journey of faith, there might have been an initial yes, and there might have been some very significant paradigm-shifting, life-changing yeses along the way, but actually, you say a yes to God, and it begins a journey, and then you come to another place in your life, and God's saying, you know, I'd like to do a deeper thing in you, I'd like to do another thing in you, and it's going to stretch you as much as that first yes, maybe even more, and you say yes again to God, and you say yes again, or no. So Mary, did you know that your first yes to God as a little girl, when that angel appeared to you, did you know that that first yes would begin a journey for you that one day would bring you to the foot of a cross? As you stood there at that foot of that cross and watched what looked like the promise of God die? Did you know that when you said yes, you'd end up there? And if you would have known then, when you were that little innocent girl saying yes to God, that it would bring you there, would you still say yes to that? I wonder what Mary thought that day. I don't mean the day she first said yes, I mean the day she stood as a mother watching her son, the promise of God as it were, die in front of her. I wonder what she thought that day. I wonder what she felt that day. I wonder if one of the things at least that was going through her mind as she saw her son dying there, I wonder if she remembered what the angel said in Luke 1.32, that he would be great. I wonder if her mind went back to when she was a little girl, and because she was a little girl, she just believed so easily that he would be great. And he would be the ruler of the nations, a king without end. He doesn't look great, not like a king. I see no kingdom at all, not today. So Mary, if you knew then what you know now, would you still say yes? Now, I want to intervene on this little scene I've created, because the resurrection is coming, right? We all know that. And when it does, every fear will be vanquished, Mary. Every promise will be fulfilled. But my question still stands. Mary, did you know when you said yes to God, there would be days like this, where resurrection is believed in and hoped for and may be coming and is absolutely real, but on this day, you can't see it. Did you know when you said yes to God, there would be days like this, when the lights go out, when the dreams are dashed, when the promises don't seem to be fulfilled and don't seem like they're going to be fulfilled. So what did Christmas cost you, Mary? And did it cost you more than you thought when you were that little innocent girl who said, be it done unto me. I want this life in me. Well, we have some indications from Scripture that Mary did know that her yes would cost something, but not necessarily how much, because she was told often that there would be cost, but she was told in a way that we're often told, that there is a cost to our life with Christ, and it kind of comes in a veiled way, Not because they're trying to hide anything from Mary or from you, but the reason is because we don't know specifically what the cost is going to be, what the price, if you will, will be. Let me give you an example of that. In Luke chapter 2, we're still kind of in this Christmas context, but this is after the baby has been born in Luke chapter 2. It's a somewhat obscure prophecy delivered by a man named Simeon to Mary and Joseph On the occasion of their bringing Jesus eight days after his birth to Jerusalem for dedication to God. Picture Mary and Joseph. Again, it's very important, I think, that you picture them. I think if you saw Mary and Joseph, we would kind of love them and be drawn to them. But we would kind of, just with a smile on our face, just a couple of kids. Picture them that way. Excited by the birth of a son. thrilled at the fulfillment of the promise that the angel had given, and now they have it in their hand. But the truth is, this is all still pretty weird. So they're still a little confused and a little concerned as to what these things might mean. Remember, that's one of the first things Mary said. Actually, it was the first thing Mary said to the angel. She was troubled as to what these things might mean. I think eight days after the birth, they're still troubled with what these things might mean and what these things might cost. in the middle of all of that excitement and confusion and maybe some concern the prophecy comes and it begins in verse 25 of Luke chapter 2 and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and this man was righteous and devout looking for the consolation of Israel and the consolation of Israel is Messiah and the Holy Spirit was upon him and it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came in the Spirit into the temple and when the parents, Mary and Joseph, brought the child Jesus to carry out for him the custom of the law, then he, that is Simeon, looked at Jesus, or took Jesus into his arms and blessed God and said, Now, Lord, thou dost let thy bondservant depart. I can die in peace according to thy word. For my eyes have seen thy salvation. It's in this child, which thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light of revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of all thy people. Three significant words as to who this Jesus is. Verse 25, he is the consolation of Israel. He is the salvation of all the peoples. He is the light of revelation to the Gentiles. He is the glory of all the people of Israel. Consolation, revelation, salvation, glory. So get your hopes up, Mary and Joseph. You're here a little concerned. You're a little confused. But you have some things to feel good about. This thing you hold here is the real deal. And if God through this child really is everything Simeon just said, if he really is the consolation, the salvation, the revelation, and the glory of God, I got a feeling, Mary, your life is about to get a little better. Things are probably going to get a little easier, wouldn't you think? I mean, you just gave birth to God. That would be like a good thing. Verse 33, and they were amazed at the things being spoken to them. Amazed not because this is the first time they had heard this. I think amazed the way you and I would be amazed if we were part of something that was this amazing, if you will. The birth of this child, the promise of the angel, and you're believing it. Do you ever do this? Do you ever believe things and not believe them? You're believing it and not believing it and living it and wondering at the same time. And they had heard it from the angel. It had been confirmed to them by Elizabeth that this child was really born of God. But now, out of the blue, they come into the temple. And Simeon says that Simeon, this guy they've never seen before, says these amazing things to them. And Mary and Joseph, I may be putting words in their mouths. I don't know, but I think the spirit of this was behind what it says when they were amazed. How would he know? God must have told them this, him this. And whatever else it means, it means that in the middle of our concern and confusion, we're not alone and we're not crazy. This really is a God deal. And they were amazed. Simeon then turns his attention from the baby to the parents. Simeon, I picture in my mind clearly from the text that's verified. an older man and he's seen there's just two kids is all they were. And his heart goes out to them, two kids standing there with sincere in belief, eager to obey, but alone and afraid. He does a very good thing. He blesses them. That's what they need. I'm going to bless these kids. They don't know the road they're going to have to walk, but they're obedient and they're eager to obey and he blesses them. It says in verse 34, And then he turned specifically to Mary. It's not like Joseph wasn't there, but these words from the text were directed to Mary. With these words in verses 34 and 35. And this is kind of my paraphrase of those two verses. Mary, behold this child that you're holding. In addition to being the consolation of Israel, the salvation of the world, and the revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of God, in addition to the child being all of that, you also need to know that he will also be the cause for the rise and the fall of many. And he will be a sign to be opposed. Literally, he will be a sign of contradiction. He's going to make a lot of people go, huh? Indeed, because of him, and this is in verse 35, because of him, Mary, a sword will pierce even your heart. Now, other things, if you read on through that chapter in Luke and on in through the rest of the Gospels, other things about the child were spoken after that. Wonderful things about Mary and Joseph and the child, confirming and encouraging things. But if I was Mary, I don't think I'm stretching this at all to think that she would have had left in her mind this concern, this question. What did he mean by the piercing of a sword? and when he said that one little thing about a piercing of my own soul with a sword why did it feel like when he said that in the middle of all the other wonderful promises why did it feel like the cost of Christmas just went up? Even though I don't know specifically what it means it just felt like Christmas got more expensive because it's going to cost me more than I knew. Keep in mind that this prophecy of Simeon is not the only prophecy that Mary had received about the child or the cost of his birth to her personally. The first came from the angel in Luke 1.28. We've already made reference to this one. And this is the one we talked about a couple of weeks ago, where the angel came to Mary and said, Hail Mary, full of grace. You're full of grace. The Lord is with you. And here's how this grace is going to look when it comes to you. The life of God is going to be conceived inside of you. and you will bear a son, meaning this, that once this life comes to you, once you say yes to it, it can't be stopped. And that's kind of the scary part. Because once it starts, it will grow in you. And once it starts to grow in you, it's going to keep on growing in you. And as it grows, it's going to stretch you, and change you, and mark you, and scare you, and scar you. But eventually, this life of God in you is going to issue from you, changing the world around you. And you know why he's going to change the world around you? Because his name will be great. She wasn't resistant, but you remember the story. She was confused about what these things mean. How can this be, she said to the angel, because I'm a virgin. In other words, what her question is, is this. I haven't done what you have to do to have life like this conceived in me. To put it another way, I'm not qualified. to be pregnant physically. Many of us would have to say the same thing about ourselves when it comes to spiritually, the life of God coming into us and changing us and transforming us and making us fit for the kingdom of God. I don't qualify. And the angel said, hey, Mary, you need to understand what every saint of every age is going to have to understand, and that is this. This isn't something you can do to yourself. the miracle of life in you, the physical life of the baby, but also the spiritual life of God in men and women in this room that I'm talking to right now, is a work of the Spirit. And it says later in the text, you know the story, that the Holy Spirit will come upon you, Mary, and you will conceive as a work of the Holy Spirit. But somewhere along the line, you have to say yes, and the same is true of spiritual life. I can't make myself new. The Holy Spirit comes upon me. The Holy Spirit comes upon you. But somewhere along the line, we have to come as Mary did and say, be it done unto me. That is the life I want. Mary's response was that verse 38 of Luke chapter 1. Yes, I want this life in me. She quite literally, if you were to put it in terms that are kind of evangelical in 20th century, she received Christ. Just like I believe you receive Christ and I receive Christ by saying, I want that life. So come Holy Spirit and do in me this new work of a new heart. For the same Christ born in her can be born in us when we say, come Holy Spirit. Plant your life in me. I want you to grow in me. I invite you to stretch me and change me and express your life through me. So whatever the cost of Christmas was, Mary determined early on she was willing to pay it. Be it done unto me. indeed like one whose faith is fresh and new have you ever run into somebody like that you really need to be around new believers from time to time because that's the spirit we see in Mary after she says be it done unto me because like one whose faith is fresh and new she erupts in Luke 1 47 with a doxology of praise it's called the Magnificat overwhelmed and delighted by this reality that God could come to a lowly person to a humble person that nobody knows. Mary, who is she? And plant the life of God in her. So excited is she by that. That God's way is to take the lowly people like herself and lift them up. It says that in the Magnificat in verse 53 actually. That God's way is to take insignificant nobodies and give them holy purpose. That she sings this. This is the Magnificat. My soul does magnify the Lord and I will rejoice in the God of my salvation. And again, to me, the spirit of Mary here is the same spirit we see in a new believer that you can't shut up. You just can't shut up, Mob. My soul does magnify the Lord, and I will exalt and rejoice in the God of my salvation. New believers to whom everything about God is clear. I'm going to say that again. New believers to whom everything about God is clear. Remember that day? Remember that one day you had when everything about God was clear? I liked that day. That was a really good day. When everything. And usually he is a new believer. So what's this talk about a sword? Simeon, you tell me about consolation. You tell me about his being a revelation. You tell me about him being salvation and the glory of God. And why did you even have to say that thing about the sword? And what did you mean it's going to pierce my own soul? See, I didn't realize I had preconceived ideas about what all this meant, but I kind of did think that all the hard stuff would be done when I received Christ and said yes to God. Seems to me that you get in trouble when you're not cooperating with God, and when bad things happen, it's because you did something wrong. I just said yes to God, and now you're talking about a sword. if he's the consolation, salvation, or revelation I just kind of thought he'd fix my life and make it smooth but see here's the deal Christmas always costs more than we thought it would always does always has I'm going to try to pull some of these thoughts together and as I do I'd like you to consider with me four events in Mary's life that I believe speak to the piercing of this sword. That speak to what I'm calling this morning the cost of Christmas. Not only for her, but for us as well. And just look for the parallels of Mary's life and ours as well. The first came not long after Simeon's prophecy, actually. When an angel appeared to Mary and Joseph in Matthew 2.13 again to warn them this time. Not that the child is coming. Now the child is already there. They've already been to Simeon. And the angel comes and warns them not to go back to Bethlehem, to go south toward Egypt instead because Herod had gone crazy. Herod. Power-hungry and paranoid was he when he heard the word about a king born to the Jews. He considered it a threat. his solution was to slaughter every baby boy anywhere near Bethlehem who was under two years of age. And according to Matthew chapter 2 verse 18, the weeping and anguish in Bethlehem because of that slaughter of the innocents was, and here's the quote, was beyond consolation. Now be merry for a minute. When the weeping of the women in Bethlehem is beyond consolation, she hears in her mind the prophecy of Simeon. He will be the consolation. He will be the revelation. He will be the comfort. But instead, because of him, there are mothers in Israel who are beyond consolation. This just isn't going the way I thought it would at all. I thought when I received this life, it would make everything better and easier. And a sword begins to pierce her soul. This is costing more than I thought, more than I knew. It's a sort of confusion, among other things, something most of us have felt. I mean, here's the confusion. Be merry here, but this, you can kind of draw the parallels to your own life. If I hold in my hands the answer, if I hold in my hands the solution, the consolation, the revelation, the glory of God, why am I still so confused at times? Why do I still feel at times so helpless? In fact, I received this life thinking that if I received this life and said yes to God, I wouldn't feel helpless anymore. That's kind of why I did it. I thought when I said yes to God, my questions would all be answered, my problems would all be solved. And what about the hate? I mean, I know here it's crazy, but Mary, did you know that when you said yes to God, when you said, be it done unto me, and you invited that life of God to come inside of you and grow in you and change you and then express itself through you, did you realize that some around you would resent it, would be threatened by it, would actually try to kill it, not kill you, but just kill the life that's in you. They just try to snuff it out in ways that were subtle and not so subtle. Did you know that? Well, she didn't know that any more than some of you in this room right now didn't know that when the life of God came to you and began to grow in you and began to express itself through you that some people around you, even family and very dear friends, would resent it, be threatened by it, and even try to kill it. Some of you have paid an enormous price for just saying yes. And when you said yes, you didn't know that that's what it would cost. You didn't know. You couldn't know. And suddenly, Christmas costs a whole lot more than you thought it would. And a sword begins to pierce your soul. Second event in Mary's life, 12 years later, Luke 2, verse 41. Joseph and Mary had taken Jesus to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover. You know the story, I think you might know the story. I'll remind you of it. They left Jerusalem without him. They had had their Passover celebration and family and friends and they all had traveled together. And kind of the way I picture it is if you're just with a whole bunch of families and the kids are over in that family and now you have them for a while. And so they just left and figured Jesus with one of their relatives traveling in this large group of people. But it was a half a day. They were gone a half a day before they realized that Jesus wasn't there. Terrified, they run back to Jerusalem and find Jesus in the temple listening to the rabbis and the priests and asking them questions when they confronted him as a parent would. I think kind of upset. Where were you? In verse 39, his response was this. A little odd, I think. Why are you looking for me? Now, that doesn't sound like an odd response if you kind of just remember everything and know it from our perspective of history, looking back, well, it's God. He's going to be okay. He's God. Why worry? But that's not how they experienced it, and you know that. I mean, I think their experience was much more human than what we think. And just like our experience of God is much more human than we even want it to be at times. Be a parent. Why are you looking for me? What do you mean, why am I looking for you? Because we're your parents, that's why. We give you a lot of freedom. Because you're God. And then that had to be tough raising God. It would drive me nuts. and then Jesus said this hear these words but be apparent did you not know that I am now about that I am now about to be about my father's business did you not know that I am now to be about my father's business and a sword pierces Mary's heart with those words why here's why I think because those words indicate that their relationship is changing now. Because the issue of who Jesus really is is beginning to evidence itself more dramatically than ever before. The fullness of who Jesus really is, really all about, is beginning to emerge more clearly now. He's beginning to exert his will on them. He's not asking their opinion anymore. He's not asking their permission as a parent. Forget about the parent. be in your own relationship with God. I can't control him anymore. As if he, God, was there to serve me. He's not doing my plan. He's changing the schedule. And quite frankly, I've got to tell you, it's not the only reason I said yes to him at the beginning, but part of the reason I said yes to God, I want your life inside of me, is so that he would give me what I want and do my plan. and maybe no one would ever say this but somewhere I think honestly it could be said you know I liked him a lot better when he was away in a manger a cuddly little baby in fact I'm pretty convinced that's why people like Christmas so much isn't that nice Jesus is a little cuddly little baby little babies demand nothing of me well there's a few things but it's a different analogy you know I'm sure that there are people who come to faith and understand these things you know right away but I really do believe that most of us go through seasons of transition where who God really is begins to impress itself on us at levels deeper than what we knew sometimes I think that there are adults for instance who in maturity in their own lives could come into faith in Christ and faith in God and have a mature understanding that he's going to want more than just me going to church on Sunday. This is a relationship and it's going to require some things of me. Maybe this transition thing I'm talking about is more consistent if you've said your yes to God at a very early age and then that God, that Jesus that you know begins to grow. I resonate with that. Maybe some of you do too. I grew up in church. Jesus loves you. And David, little David, Jesus is going to take care of you and he'll protect you. He'll be there for you. But then as my life changed and I grew up, this same Jesus, who was just kind of there for me, began to exert his will. And without words, say things like this to me, David, you need to understand something. It's not all about you. And everything here isn't for you. This is about my father's business. And I am calling you, David, and everyone who names my name to something bigger than just you. But here's the deal. When that first begins to come to you, it can feel like a sword. See, part of the cost of Christmas is coming to understand who Jesus really is and what he fully wants. For once you embrace the tiny little baby, you need to understand that this tiny little baby is going to grow up. And as he does, he begins to assert his agenda for your life and mine. And when we begin to respond in deeper ways to who he really is and to what he really wants. By the way, that whole thing, that whole dynamic is illustrated even more graphically in the third scene that I want you to have in your mind of Mary and what it felt like for the sword to pierce her soul. Now it's 19 years later, 19 or 20 years later. So Jesus is about 32 years of age. It's in Luke chapter 8. The ministry of Jesus has just begun. On this particular occasion, another one that many of you are familiar with, Jesus is teaching. A large crowd had gathered. Mary and the brother of Jesus had come to visit, but they couldn't get to him because the crowd was so thick. And so Mary grabs somebody from the outside of the crowd. Maybe one of the disciples could have been Peter and just says, you know, I wonder, would you go in there and tell Jesus we're out here? And we like to see him. And so whoever it was that Mary kind of picked for this little task goes in and says, Jesus, your mother and your brother is outside. they'd like a word with you. And Jesus' response to that was this in verse 21 of Luke 8. Who is my mother and who are my brothers? But those who hear and do the word of God. And there's a lady on the outskirts of that crowd who feels the thrust of a sword with those words. Why did he say that? I mean, I understand these calls to obedience, but I'm beginning to wonder, Does he care about me personally anymore? I mean, our whole relationship used to be about that, couldn't Mary say? And so could some of you. Our whole relationship was all about how much he loved me. That's how it started. That was the whole embodiment of how special I was to him. How everything he did, he did for me, just for me. Well, know this, Mary. he does love you and he loves you special know this every child of God in this room he loves you and he loves you special but know this also Mary there is a level of discipleship and obedience he calls all his disciples to including you there is no special deal there's no cost reduction no discipleship discount because you're related because you're the pastor because you're not the pastor, because you give money or you go to church. Who is my mother, Jesus said, and who are my brothers and who are my sisters? Well, I can answer that question, says Jesus. It's those who hear the word of God and do it. One of the guys I've quoted from time to time in the last several months is a guy named Richard Rohr. He's becoming one of my favorite writers. I had an occasion to go to St. Thomas College or University in St. Paul a few weeks ago and hear Richard Rohr speak at a men's conference. And he said many things. He reminds me of Dallas Willard in this way. He says, I can't take notes on the guy. I just keep writing incredible things that he says, and I go back and read them later. I thought that was kind of funny, but evidently not. but that was funny. Here's what he said. It caught my attention. He said, Jesus never said worship me. Not one time said worship me. I never kind of added that one up. All he ever said was follow me. I was just curious to me but then Richard went on to say this. He said this. One of the most clever ways to avoid following him and doing what he says and entering into his life. One of the cleverest ways to avoid following him is to worship him. that might sound like a weird thing for you to for anyone to say and I certainly don't think it means you shouldn't worship Jesus but you think about it let's go to church and sing come let us adore him we'll raise our hands we'll sing our songs we'll get a tear we'll sing about his love and you can do all of that worship and never follow and you can even convince yourself that by worshiping him you are following him there are some I'm afraid who presume that because the love of God is so personal and tender and real that they can kind of sort out and make their own personal arrangements with God. I'll live this half-baked life pretty much any way I want and rest in the confidence that he loves me special, so it's all okay. Here's the deal. He does love you and me specially, but he also calls you and me specifically to a life of discipleship that is marked by obedience. This whole thing I'm driving at here It reminds me, one of my favorite stories in the Gospels, it's Matthew 8, verse 18. When Jesus saw a crowd, there was a big crowd, and he'd been preaching and doing miracles and just being with them, and the crowd was just kind of getting bigger and bigger. And they came to the side of a lake, and Jesus gave orders to leave the shore, and it was time to get in the boat and go to the other side. Now, in the analogy, in terms of some of the spiritual significance and connections, till now, it had been very easy to follow Christ. All you had to kind of be was be in the crowd. The analogy to me would be like going to church. It's kind of easy to go to church. You can just be in the crowd. And whether anybody here is actually following Jesus, and I wouldn't know. So it's easy to be. Till now, till Jesus got to the shore, it was easy to be following him in some respect. You just had to be in the crowd. But if you're going to follow him now, it's going to cost you something because you're going to have to get in the boat. You're going to have to leave the security of the shore and get in the boat. But Jesus says that, okay, now if you follow me still, you're going to have to get in the boat. And it says in verse 19 of Matthew 8 that a certain scribe said, Jesus, I will follow you wherever you go. Sign that guy up. He's obviously a follower. I will follow you wherever you go. Big promise. Jesus says to him, great. But just know this. Foxes have holes and birds have nests, and the Son of Man does not have a place to lay his head. And if you follow me, it might be that way for you. you still want to come? Well, that guy disappeared in the white space between verse 20 and 21. We've talked about this before. A lot of people hang around. A few weeks ago, we talked about people who come to be warmed by the fire and the difference between people who are warmed by the fire and have stepped into the fire. Lots of people hang around. Followers of Christ? I don't know. Time will tell. We'll see. but according to verse 23 of Matthew 8 many people did get in the boat and I have a feeling that when they got in the boat they had a really good feeling about that felt pretty good about themselves we're the ones who are willing to pay the price of Christmas we're the committed ones and they probably didn't get cocky but they kind of bordered on yeah we're the ones who are the real true disciples probably saying I have decided to follow Jesus no turning back on and on all the way across they sang that song, I'm sure. But here's the deal. Here's the funny thing about this. They were obedient to Jesus. They left the security of the shore. They said yes to God, as it were, and when they got into the middle of the lake, the Bible says, the text says, Matthew 8, that a great storm arose, and it looked like Jesus didn't care, and they're all going to die. And I don't know exactly what went through their minds. I know what would have gone through my mind, and it's what goes through my mind today. When, because of obedience to God, I leave the shore, say yes to God, I'm feeling good about myself, and right in the middle of my obedience, a great storm arises. This was exactly what I was expecting to avoid. Didn't you think that when you obeyed God, there wouldn't be a storm? And that's how you avoid the storm. this isn't adding up the way I thought I thought the seas would be calm the storm comes across the Christmas goes up later in that same gospel Jesus comes to them again on the water now this time there was by the way in that Matthew account the Matthew 8 account there was a large group of flotilla of boats that had gone across now in this later in the same gospel Jesus is coming to the disciples, just a smaller group, on the water. This is the episode where Jesus actually is walking on water to them and says, and again, this is my paraphrase, you guys, remember how in Matthew 8 I told you to get out of the boat or get into the boat and follow me? Well, this time, I want you to get out of the boat, Peter. And when Peter saw Jesus walking on the water, he said, Lord, bid me come, and Jesus said, come, get out of the boat. and it makes me begin to wonder Lord what do you want? Because over here you tell us to get in the boat and over here you tell us to get out of the boat I don't know what you want me to do I don't know what you want from me the answer to that question is this I want everything from you I want absolutely everything. And a sword pierces the soul, and the cost of Christmas goes up. But the spirit of Mary says, be it done unto me. Beloved, in our journey of faith, there is not just one yes. There may be very, very significant yeses that transform you and change you, But God is calling us to a life of responding to God. Be it done unto me again. I say yes again. And again. And again. Last scene where I want you to see Mary in this dynamic of what it cost her to say yes to God. I want to bring you back to the scene I had you at at the beginning of this talk at the foot of the cross. Now, all of us are moved at this scene of Jesus on the cross when we place ourselves there. And we've done that, and I think we were enabled to do that in a very powerful way this last year through that movie, The Passion of the Christ, as we just saw things put in a context for us to see in ways that we were never able to see before. And we find ourselves filled with horror and gratitude as we see him as our Savior. But kind of put all that aside for a moment. Understand, Mary was his mother. His mother. She saw him not just as her savior. She saw him as her boy. That's my boy up there. See, she had watched as they mocked him and spat on him, beat him, abandoned him, publicly exposed and disgraced him and then executed him. I mean, a good question at this point would be, did she know that in three days all of this would turn to life? Well, she'd certainly heard that Jesus was going to rise from the dead. Jesus had said that himself. Do you think she believed that? Well, let's assume she did believe that. Even if she did believe that. The undeniable fact before her right now is this, that all of her hopes and all of her dreams and all of her expectations are being dashed. They are dying right now in front of our eyes. And though the resurrection is real, and I believe it, I can't see it today because today is Friday. And all of this is happening because I said yes. An angel told me he would be a king. An angel told me, as she's looking at him, that he would be a ruler of the nations. An angel said to me, these words mock me now. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you. Favored are you. Blessed are you. And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. And a sword pierces her heart. And the cost of Christmas just goes up. For now she is being called to love and believe God. She is now being called to love and believe God, even when the lights go out. Even when the dreams are dashed and the hopes are scattered, and even there, Mary loves him still. Even there, her response is this. Be it done unto me, just as you said. I still say yes to you, God. Okay, Dave, how do you know she's saying that at the cross? Well, one way we know is simply because she's there. What do you mean? Think about this. when Peter made his I will not deny you speech but did deny him Mary made no such I will not deny you speech but didn't deny him when all of the disciples agreed with Peter that they would never flee but every single one of them did flee Mary made no such promise I will never flee she just didn't flee. There she was where she wanted to be where she had to be at the foot of the cross with Jesus. G. Campbell Morgan says of this scene this she that is Mary was hopeless, disappointed, bereaved and heartbroken but the love that had been stirred in her heart could not be quenched even by the dashing of her dreams. Though disappointed, it could not be overcome. Though over the sea of sorrow, there was no sighing wind that says the dawn is coming. She loved him still. Jesus was the magnet of her soul and he held her to himself like the sun holds the planets in their orbit, even in his death. Even when her dreams were dashed, be it done unto me, even if it means a sword will pierce my soul. Now imagine with me what must have exploded in Mary's heart the day the stone rolled away. No words I have could come close to describing that, but this is for certain. It was joy inexpressible and full of glory. and it can be that way for you and me as well. How? Just begin with this. Holy Spirit, come upon me. Plant your life in me. Continually grow in me. I want you to change me and stretch me. I allow you to scare me and mark me and scar me so that your life might issue from me changing the world around me. But when you ask that, know this. Christmas almost always costs more than you thought it would. For a sword will pierce even your own soul. Really? Yeah, really. Sounds scary. Sometimes it is. The response of Mary, the response of his church, simply this, be it done unto me, just as you said. Christmas is more than celebrating his birth, beloved. You know that. Christmas is an invitation into his very life, into his very way of life, where we may experience the fellowship of the sufferings but also the power of the resurrection and those are the things that bring joy inexpressible and full of glory. Let me close with this question. Where are you on the journey? Wherever it is, maybe you've said yes to God several times, maybe you've never said yes to God. Wherever it is, I can tell you this for certain, God is calling you deeper than where you are now. God is calling us as a church deeper than where we are now. And the response that he is looking for is not, I will. The response he is looking for is, be it done unto me. I will receive this. I will bear this. I will allow this. Come, Holy Spirit, be it done unto us just as you said. Let's pray as we close. Would you stand with me? Father I hear this word even as I speak it I hear it myself and I hear it in the context of my personal life and can replay in my mind as many who are before me now can replay in their minds the places in our lives where they've saved yes and the spirit of God either gave them life for the first time or called them to a deeper place and all of us myself included I can kind of play it out in my mind how it brought forth incredible life, but there was also incredible cost. And so, Father, as we as individuals consider those places that in this next year, actually, as we anticipate the new year, are being called individually to these deeper places, may on our lips and in our hearts be the spirit of Mary be it done unto us. But I also know and believe, Father, that as a church you're calling us to deeper places and new places, Places that are gonna require not our stirring up of things, but our simple yes, we will go there. Yes, we will allow this and we will receive this, be it done unto us. Just take a very short moment here. And I just want to give you some time to do some personal work with God and in a way that maybe God is speaking to you about where you need to see be it done unto me. I want to give you time to quietly, before we dismiss, make that your response to God. And we ask these things in Jesus' name. All God's people said, amen.
