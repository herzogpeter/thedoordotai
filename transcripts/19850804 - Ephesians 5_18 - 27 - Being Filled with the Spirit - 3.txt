Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, the fifth chapter, the 18th verse. And I'll read the 18th and the 19th for our study this morning. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, or in which is excess, but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord. Let's pray as we begin. Father, it would be ludicrous indeed to speak of the filling of the Spirit without the Spirit's control as we do that. And Lord Jesus, we ask that that filling would come, that our hearts would be open and attentive to the things, again, that you need to teach us. There are many things. The depths of this particular truth we could never plunge. You need to be our teacher in this matter. We ask for that in your name. Amen. We are entering our third week in dealing with this particular verse. I believe it is absolutely crucial that we spend the time we need to do to understand it. I hope that we are going to finish up our dealing with this particular verse, the 18th verse, next week. But I'm not going to promise anything the way this thing has been expanding. I want to explain that every once in a while, and sometimes someone comes up to me afterwards and says, Dave, you don't need to apologize for taking the time we need to spend. And I want to just let you know that I'm not apologizing. I am explaining. I think we do need to explain that we cannot afford to treat truths like this in a superficial manner. It takes time. And if it takes a lot of time, so be it. There's a couple of reasons we can't skip it. One of the reasons I think we're all aware of right on the surface, right off the bat, is this, that there's an incredible amount of misunderstanding concerning what the filling of the Spirit is, what the function of the Holy Spirit is. That is why, again, that we're doing some things in this area in the evening service for a couple of weeks. I don't know if you've ever stopped to think of the areas in your life and in my life that we really believe things. You have things in your lives. I really believe something. And when you stop and think, you really don't know why you believe it. You feel real strong about it. You'd fight tooth and nail to defend it. But you've never really sat back and questioned it, evaluated it. You've never let it be challenged by some other kind of perspectives. And therefore, that thing you believe very strongly in is really on some very tenuous and shaky ground. We need to dig in. We need to do the work we need to do to understand this. The other reason we can't just skip over this is because quite simply, I believe that this verse right here is the key to understanding the book of Ephesians. I think we realize, because we've said it the last couple of weeks, that if this particular verse was deleted from the book of Ephesians, the rest of the entire book of Ephesians would be absolutely impossible to fulfill. For us to tell you to walk a worthy walk, to walk in humility and gentleness and kindness and love, be imitators of God, all those things would be absolutely ludicrous without the filling of the Spirit. So it behooves us as believers to understand what that is and how that is appropriated in our lives. It would just be nothing but legalistic trying effort on our part. We spoke last week of the fact that without the filling of the Spirit understood, There are one of two results. The first one is absolute frustration, a maddening frustration. We're going to spend our whole lives just trying to keep it up. And no matter what we do, no matter how hard you try to be spiritual, try to be humble, try to be patient, try to act like a Christian, you're never going to be able to do it. And your whole Christian life is just going to be a cycle of frustration and pretending. You're never going to experience grace. You're never going to feel forgiven. You might understand forgiveness. You might be able to recite it. and win all sorts of arguments as to what atonement is and all these kinds of things, but you'll never feel forgiven. I wouldn't even want to have you talk about this in a service, but I almost wonder if we had a raise of hands, how many of you really felt forgiven and felt free? What kind of response do we get? Very often we know the doctrine and it's never been experienced in our lives. This is absolutely crucial, that it not only be understood, but we begin to live in the filling of the Spirit. The other problem in not understanding this is not only maddening frustration, but very often pride, spiritual pride. And we've all been in churches where we just kind of feel a tension, and basically the tension is created by a group of people who are all performing, and we're all trying to measure up and be real good, and we've got these external characteristics that measure the Christian's life, and we're all trying to keep the little rules, puts a lot of pressure on, and instead of dealing with our pain and our fear and our weakness, we act like we don't have any of that. We're full of answers, and we end up intimidating each other. Listen, if you're trying to be a good Christian, and if you're trying to act like a good Christian, you know what? there is no need in your life for the Holy Spirit. None. If you could be a good Christian, there's absolutely no need in your life for the Holy Spirit. You know what? Because you're doing it. No need. God, thanks a lot. Thanks for the help. I thank you for the offer, but I can handle it. See, I am humble. I am patient. I can do it on my own. I want to tell you something. If you're trying to act like a good Christian, what you really are is a pretender, a performer. Because the Holy Spirit of God isn't doing that in your life. And the other problem is you're never going to move into joy. Your joy will be pretense. You look like you have joy, but the heart will not be full. And again, I can't put that into words as much as I can kind of try to reach into your hearts and say that's been your experience and it has been mine. I know when I'm pretending and so do you. Okay, let's get into our study. What does it mean to be filled with the Holy Spirit? I'm going to give you a whole bunch of thoughts today and we're going to have to again finish it up next week. You've got to hang with me and I hope again that the vistas of your understanding here will be broadened considerably this morning. What does it mean to be filled? Again, there's all sorts of... There's a great divergence as to what this means. Some people think it's some sort of a divine zap. Some people believe that it's an experience, a point in time when I was filled with the Holy Spirit. Some people believe that the filling of the Spirit is evidenced by the speaking of tongues. And if you don't speak in tongues, you've never been filled with the Spirit. That's a theology that's going around, and it's one that has a great following. A point-in-time experience. And many of us in our particular evangelical bent hear that kind of thing, and we go, oh, that isn't what we believe. You know, we believe something else. The problem with many of us is that when we get into the realm of dealing with the Holy Spirit, we're so afraid of what the Holy Spirit of God can do in people's lives, and we're sometimes so afraid of excess in a direction that we would say, well, I'm not really ready for that, is that we go the other way. And that we kind of approach the work of the Holy Spirit in someone's life with a stoic, theological, doctrinal understanding. And all that ever remains for us is something I know about. We talk about it every once in a while, but in terms of living my life, I never see the power, I never see the glory, I never experience the filling of the Holy Spirit, which is the only power I ever have to live the Christian life. And it just remains something stale and distant and misty and foggy. Never real. And with both of those things, maybe both of them, I'll call both of them extreme. And you kind of know where I stand with that. I would call both of them extreme. What my heart cries for is this. Where is the balance? I cannot handle a stoic theological approach to the work of the Holy Spirit. I am also not ready to let experience dictate my theology. Experiences are a dime a dozen. I can take a drug and have an experience. I can go on a roller coaster and have an experience. The human psyche, our emotions are so susceptible to all sorts of different kinds of phenomenal experiences that I just can't trust what I feel. Maybe the balance can come when we realize that if my experience is to be considered real and valid and absolutely from God, it first does need to be ground in understanding. We need to understand what the Word of God says about these things. There are some things I need to know, so let's study. The text breaks down, I think you know, into three basic segments as we deal with verses 18 and 19. The first segment we dealt with last week, and that is the contrast. Be not drunk with wine. That was contrasted to what? The second segment, and that is the command. The command is this, but be filled with the Spirit. The contrast, then the command, and then the third segment, which we'll get to in a few more weeks down the road, are the consequences of the Spirit-filled life. Singing, speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, and then going down through the rest of the thing, even through chapter 6, dealing with relationships. Last week we discussed the contrast. Be not drunk with wine, in which is asotia, or excess. And the two keys we dealt with there were basically this. What Paul was dealing with with these believers was this, an external control and excess of the same. External control, be not externally controlled, and don't have excess of that external control. We discussed the fact that wine was simply a beautiful illustration of an external control, a thing that I could use to let me blot out all my feelings, to deny the things I'm struggling with. We discussed the fact that wine was not the issue. Wine was not at all the focus of this particular text. The focus was using things outside myself to fulfill me. We said that if Paul came to us, he probably wouldn't even use wine as an illustration. Most of us have this wine problem handled pretty well. He would come to us and say, Dear believer, 1981, almost 1982, and Crystal, Church of the Open Door, be not drunk. Don't look for your fulfillment in a career, in which is excess. Something wrong with a career? No. But if you're looking for the fulfillment of your life there, you're going to be disappointed. Asotia, excess. Don't be looking for it in your career. Don't be looking for it in money. Don't be looking for it in something outside yourself, even in your family, even in church activity. spoke again of the fact that we could get so involved in church activity and feel kind of pacified that my relationship with God must be right because I'm teaching a class, I'm on the board, I'm preaching sermons, therefore everything is fine, and totally short-circuit my need to be broken before God and have the filling of His Spirit, enabling me to do the things on a real level that He's called me to do. One good illustration, I thought, as we were considering the fact that when he was using wine as an illustration to these people, of what an external control could be, an excess thereof being the damaging dimension, was that wine was on every person's table in this church, in this church in Ephesus. They couldn't drink the water, and so wine was just something they drank like we would, they didn't have pop and things like that, they couldn't preserve things, so wine was all over the place. They couldn't extract themselves. For Paul to come to them and say, don't ever drink wine would have sounded silly to them. What he said was, don't use it as an external control, and don't let it be an excess. a good illustration I think for us would be this that materialism is to us what wine is to them think about that material and he would have maybe used that illustration don't be drunk on materialism believer now there is no way in the world that we can we live in a materialistic society and it would be very difficult for us to absolutely extract ourselves from that environment almost impossible his exhortation to us would be this don't let that be the source of your joy in which is excess. I think you understand that. If you don't, come to me later and we'll talk about it, but we really need to go on. I could preach that sermon all over again if I wanted to make that perfectly clear. The contrast was clear. We don't want an external control. That's contrasted to the next part of this verse, which is an internal control, the filling of the Spirit, the living of the Holy Spirit of God, living His life through me with power. Okay, we've got the contrast. We're moving today to the command. Got my introduction done. Now I'm going to slow down. Ready? Okay. Okay. Be filled with the Spirit. The first thing I want you to see here as we're discussing the filling of the Spirit is that this is in what we would call in the Greek an imperative mode. An imperative is simply this. I think you understand this. A command. It is a command. To be filled with the Spirit is not a suggestion, believer. This is not an option for the believer. It really concerns me these days that we have been, I believe, permeated by a mentality that would say something basically like this, that you can be a Christian and not be concerned about this kind of thing, that you can be a Christian and not really care about commitment, that you can be a Christian and kind of raise your hand, come forward, pray the prayer, get your ticket out of hell, as it were. You know, that's very, very crude. But I hear people say that. They got my ticket out of hell and da-da-da. And commitment and giving my life to the Lord and opening myself up to Him is something I really don't want to have anything to do with. It's almost as if we've created kind of a new little group. You see, there's the natural man, and we know where that person is. They're the unregenerate. They're the unsaved. They don't know the Lord, and they don't care about the things of the Lord. And then there's the spirit-filled Christian or the committed Christian who loves the Word, loves the Lord, is growing all the time. He is not perfect. He has not arrived, but he's on the way and he's growing. And he's honest. And then there's this other little group we like to have, and everybody feels real comfortable here because this is the saved person who has got his ticket, but he's not committed, and he's indifferent. We would call it the carnal Christian. Now, there's no way in the world I can get around the fact that there are carnal Christians. The Word of God speaks of it in 1 Corinthians 3. That is not what concerns me, the fact that there are carnal Christians. Christians who do know Christ and in terms of their position before God stand holy and blameless, but aren't committed and don't really care about growing in the Lord. That doesn't concern me nearly as much as the attitude I sometimes pick up, and that's this, that it's okay. that it's okay that we've been infiltrated by that kind of thing, that it's okay that there's carnal Christians, and that I could say of myself even that I'm a carnal Christian, and that I don't really care about being committed and the deeper things of God, and that that's somehow okay. What I need to convey to you this morning, if nothing else, is this, that isn't okay. In fact, the very basic definition of Christianity would dictate to me that that isn't okay, that salvation without commitment, I can't even put them together anymore. I sometimes think we bring this problem on ourselves in our well-intended zeal to get people to come to Christ. We get them to raise their hand and walk the aisle and we go, oh, great, this is wonderful. And we sense maybe when we're sharing with them that they're not really responding. And if I really tell them the truth about who Christ is and what he asks of me and the kind of thing where Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, when Jesus calls a man, he bids him come to die. I don't want him to stumble over the cross, so I just kind of say, oh, it's nothing to know. You don't have no, it's not commitment, it's nothing. In fact, I'll tell you what, I've heard people say this. I've got to share this with you. I was with someone not long ago who actually said this to someone, and we were kind of getting resistance and trying to share the faith, and basically the person said this, but what if you're wrong? What if Jesus really is God, and what if he really did die, and what if he really did raise? What have you got to lose to pray the prayer? You know, go ahead and pray the prayer as if somehow that would do it. And just kind of take away all the stumbling blocks, all the commitment, and we'll just kind of get your ticket and, oh, that's wonderful. I don't see that. I see Jesus talking to the multitudes and saying, wait a minute. Before you come, I want you to count the cost. I want you to realize that to be a disciple of mine, it means that you're going to have to take up your cross and follow me. He talked about commitment, and you know what? When he was done, not that many people were left. I fear sometimes that if we water down the gospel and take away the stumbling block of the cross, that when people accept that Christ, they haven't accepted the Christ of the Bible at all. Think on that. That what they have accepted is a watered-down version that isn't Christ at all. Think on that. I fear mediocrity. I fear mediocrity infiltrating into the church and carnality. And the thing I fear about mediocrity is not that it's present, but that we think it's okay. And the real serious thing about mediocrity in our Christianity is that before we know it, it becomes the norm. Think on that. That mediocrity becomes the norm. And we don't even know what it means to go to be filled with the Spirit. and we look around and we see in our leadership mediocrity and we just kind of think, well, that's the standard. That's the standard. That's the way it is. Everybody's bored and that's what Christianity is. Nobody's really fired up. Nobody's really growing and that's the way it is. And then we wonder why our young people look at that and go, yuck. The spirit-filled life is not some sort of thing where we can make a designation. Well, here's the junior varsity and those are the people who don't really care and there's the freshman squad and there are Christians who really don't care and here's the varsity over here. Like the elders are the spirit-filled ones and nobody else has to be. Baloney. This is a command. First thing you need to understand. I hear that term flipped around a lot. Deeper life. As if, you know, you have two lives. There's shallow life. It's okay, no problem. You know, you're going to make it. No big deal. And then deeper life. And you can take your pick. You can live a shallow life if you want. No problem. No sweat. We're not going to make you uncomfortable. If you've been here for any length of time, you know that if that's your pick, you're going to be uncomfortable here. But it's almost as if I was to tell you that we were going to have a deeper life conference and there was 100 people, 10 would come and we would think that's normal. 10 out of 100 would want a deeper life with God. It almost maybe can be demonstrated, this whole problem can be demonstrated to us by the fact that when we meet somebody who's really fired up for the Lord and really excited and really growing, we're surprised. We go, wow, you see, I never saw that kind of thing before. What we need to understand is that this spirit-filled living, this absolute commitment of our life to Christ, is normal Christianity. What we need to see is this, that shallow isn't okay and it isn't normal. That superficiality and marginally committed people, that is not okay. That looking like we're dead and at the same time claiming that we have life in Christ is not normal. 1 Corinthians 3, we have that example of carnal Christians. Do you remember that? But remember what he described them? He said they were babes in Christ. He said, I wish like crazy I could talk to you as spiritually mature or growing people, but you're not. You were saved a while ago and you're still babes. That was an incredible indictment. You know the kind of tragedy it would be for a little baby to be born and never to grow? There's some sort of disease going on. There isn't. It's alive. It's got life, but it isn't growing. Something is terribly wrong there. It's called a babe. They haven't grown. To not grow is not normal. It says they walk like mere men. No external difference between them and the unsaved. For them, it's just become a system of belief. Something is very, very sick in that kind of situation. That is not normal Christianity. That is not okay. The filling of the Spirit in the life of the believer is not an option. The Lord has commanded, again, let me get back to this thing. The Lord has commanded us to be filled with His Spirit. Anything less than obeying a command is what? It's disobedience. There's no way I can get around that. And if my life is characterized by a flow of that kind of disobedience, 1 John says what about me? It says this, that I'm none of his, no matter what I think. I do not believe that real faith will be content to avoid the filling of the Spirit. I do not believe that real faith will be content to live with mediocrity in their Christian life. I do not believe that real saving faith is going to be content with carnality. As if we can say, well, I'm a Christian, but I'm not going to be committed. No. This is a command and it's binding on every believer. I want you to understand that just as we begin. But before we go shooting off for the filling or whatever that means, what we need to do is find out what it means. First thing I know, what do we know? We know it's a command. We know it's a command and it's binding on every believer, every single one of us. Be filled with the Spirit. That is normal Christianity. What does it mean? A lot of teaching here. Hang on. We're going to get right to the ground floor. Several thoughts as we proceed. First of all, I want you to know, after we understand that this filling of the Spirit is a command, the first thing we need to know is that every Christian is a possessor of the Holy Spirit in all His fullness. If you're taking notes, write that down. You need to know it. Every Christian is already a possessor of the Holy Spirit. So when we are talking about a filling of the Spirit, we are not talking about receiving the Holy Spirit. I want to make that distinction as we go on. There is no such animal as a Christian who does not possess the Holy Spirit. I hear people say every once in a while Well you know I was a Christian for 10 years And I really had a struggle And finally I got the Holy Spirit I received the Holy Spirit Well bless that person's heart I think I understand what they're saying But sorry that isn't right When you became a believer You received the Holy Spirit I believe that very possibly What that person discovered Is what you're going to get When you finally move into obedience When you finally surrender your will When you yield to the Holy Spirit That's already there you see the redeeming reality of our salvation and and we know this just from basic understandings of salvation is the life of god in me and that comes when when i believe let me give you some scripture references to go through and i want you to turn to these i don't always have you do that but this is a study and we need to get it romans chapter 8 starting in verse 6 romans chapter 8 starting in verse 6 says this for the mindset on the flesh is death but the mindset on the spirit is life and peace because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God for it does not subject itself to the law of God for is not even able to do so. By the way, just a note here, side like tying in with some other things I said a few minutes ago. The word flesh here is the same word in the Greek that's being used by Paul in 1 Corinthians 3 when he's talking about carnal Christians. Here it is speaking of carnal period, not having the life of God at all. And I need to just indicate this to you. We talked about this in our Sunday school class a few weeks ago, that almost every time the word carnos is used, flesh, carnal, is used to describe a person. It is not speaking of a believer at all. It's speaking of an unbeliever. For the mindset on the flesh is death, but the mindset on the spirit is life and peace. Because the mindset on the flesh, the carnal person is hostile toward God, for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for is not even able to do so. By the way, just saying this right here. If we're walking around saying, well, I'm a carnal Christian and that's okay, I would say this. If you're comfortable with your carnality, if you're living in known sin and you don't care about growing and the filling of the Spirit, then I'd say two things. One, it is very possible that you are a carnal believer, a la 1 Corinthians 3. But I think you also need to understand that it's just as possible that you're carnal, period, a la Romans 8, verses 6 through 8. And those who are in the flesh cannot please God. Verse 8. Verse 9 says this, and this is getting back to my point. Verse 9. However, you are not in the flesh, but you believers are in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him. The opposite of that is also true. If you have the Spirit of Christ, you do belong to him. There is no believer who does not have the Spirit of Christ. And if you didn't, you're not his at all. 1 Corinthians 12. Turn there very quickly. 1 Corinthians 12, verse 13. You need to understand that he is speaking to carnal Christians here. He is not speaking to carnal, period. He is speaking to Christians who have been involved in sin. And again, maybe our exhortation to them, if we didn't understand this teaching, would be that what they need to get over their sin is to get the Holy Spirit. These Christians were not normal, they were sick, but he doesn't, listen, verse 13, for by one spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, we were all made to drink of one spirit. I want you to note something right here. Often our problem here is just simply in identifying our terms. Semantics is where we foul up. The baptism of the Spirit that is being spoken of here is not some sort of thing you experience. It is not something you experience after your salvation. The baptism of the Spirit into the body of Christ right here is an act of God whereby upon salvation, He baptizes you or places you into the body of Christ. It is a theological reality. It is not an experience. And then when it goes on in the end of that verse, it says to drink of one's spirit or to take in the spirit. That is done. That is something that happened to you when you received Jesus Christ as your Savior. You were baptized by the spirit into the body. And you were made to drink of one's spirit. To take in the spirit. It's done. 1 Corinthians 6, verse 19 says this. Again, he is speaking to these Christians. And in fact, we should get this in context and move to verse 18, where he's rebuking them for their sin. Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside his body, but the immoral man sins against his own body. Verse 19. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you? Now again, if we didn't have our theology right, what we'd be saying to this person is if you want to get over this sin, what you need to do is get the Holy Spirit. You need to receive the Holy Spirit. Paul doesn't say that. He says this. You're in sin, immorality, all sorts of messy things. Verse 19, he says, Don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you? Okay, I think we understand that. We possess the Holy Spirit. When a Christian sins, it isn't because the Holy Spirit isn't there. He is there. The problem that we have then is that the Holy Spirit is defiled. Ephesians 4.30, Grieve not the Holy Spirit who is there. 1 Thessalonians 5.19, quench not the Holy Spirit. Okay, every believer is a possessor of the Holy Spirit. We understand that. Every believer has been baptized into the body and drinks of the same Spirit. Every believer is the temple of the Holy Spirit. This Holy Spirit is the residing place. Galatians 2.20 puts it another way. Yet not I who lives, but Christ lives in me. John 7. One more real quick one. John 7, verse 37. Keep your finger in Ephesians. John 7, 37 says this, Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If any man is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. He who believes in me, as the Scripture said, from his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this he spoke of the Spirit. What is the rivers of living water? It's the Spirit. Who gets the Spirit? Whom those who believed in him were to receive. That's who gets the Spirit. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. Who gets the rivers? The believers. What are the rivers? Verse 39, the Holy Spirit. Who gets the Spirit? Believers. Okay, that is why there is no place in the New Testament where we are commanded to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. None. All sorts of commands, all sorts of promises. Never is there a command to be baptized in the Spirit. There are seven references to the baptism of the Spirit, But none of them are in the imperative. Why? Because it's already been done. That's why. There is never another command that the believers to be indwelled with the Spirit. None. There is never a command where the believers to being sealed in the Spirit. None, why? Because it's been done. The command is this. Not that we be indwelled. God did that. Not to be sealed. God did that. Not that we be baptized in the Spirit. God did that. But that we be filled with the Spirit. That we be controlled by the Spirit. And that's where I come in. You're never going to get more of the Holy Spirit than you have right now. Don't be asking for more of the Holy Spirit. That's a ludicrous prayer. You're never going to get more than you have right now. The problem for you and for me is that we grieve the Spirit and we quench or pour water on the fire of the Holy Spirit in our life. Believer, you may be baptized in the Spirit. You may be sealed in the Spirit. You may be indwelt in the Spirit. But if you have not experienced the filling of the Spirit and if you are not in the process of being filled with the Spirit, mediocrity is going to be the hallmark of your life. And you are never going to be used of God. Whenever God wanted to do a job, He called on what? Men filled with the Spirit. Women what? Filled with the Spirit. He didn't look for college education. He didn't look for good... You know, that's good news too. You don't have to be educated. You don't have to look good. You don't have to be able to talk good. You know what you need? You need to be open to the Spirit of God. You need to be yielding to Him so that life resource that we have been discussing in Ephesians for a whole year can be unleashed in you to do His work. Be filled with the Holy Spirit. I need to draw our attention to something else. Again, I'm throwing a lot of things at you here, and we need to grasp them where I'm not going to draw the right conclusions. We need to spend the time doing this. Another thing that will help us make this more clear. When the Word of God says be filled, it's again in the Greek language, it's found in a present indicative passive. Be filled. That means something that happens to me. Literally, it would be reading this way. Be being kept continually filled. Again, if you're taking notes, that would be a good thing to write down. Be being in the process of being continually kept filled. What's the point? The point is this, that the filling of the Spirit is not secured by an experience. It is not secured by coming forward and getting filled with the Spirit so that I'm filled with the Spirit for the rest of my life. It doesn't work that way at all. The point here is being kept continually filled. It's a constant, present act that's always going on, again, dependent on my will and my yielding to the Spirit that's already there. there's no way in the world we can say you know have some experience and go hello I'm filled and that's it for the rest of my life no more problems no more pain I'll never struggle with that problem again baloney you will this is not like I used this illustration once before but it's not like deodorant you know where you put on in the morning one shot and you're good for the whole day it doesn't work that way it's moment by moment day by day week by week month by month again moment by moment quite frankly this thing is so alive that being filled with the Spirit yesterday is not good for today that yielding yourself to the Spirit this morning in your devotion time isn't good for right now you need to be yielding right now you need to be submissive right now to Him what happened in you yesterday is a nice memory my devotions again this morning nice good start wonderful but this filling and this controlling is a concept that needs to be grasped as being a moment by moment walking with God, step by step. Again, this ties in with some of the things we've been talking about the last couple of weeks. We are always looking for the magic wand, right? The magic wand, and I look for it and these people in Ephesus looked for this very thing. That's why they got blasted on wine to get in touch with God. You know, this just really got loaded and got out of touch and then they said they were in touch. And they had this magic wand. They just kind of floated over. It was called booze and it was wonderful. It went into the ozone layer. And we are looking for some sort of magic wand. Well, I'll tell you what. I'll go forward, and when I go forward, it'll all be over, and I'll never have a problem again. I'll get filled with the Spirit. My problem has begun. You ever go to camp? How many of you ever go to camp? You go to camp every year. You know what you do? You know what you do, don't you? Make the commitment. And then you go. You're at the fire. This time I mean it. Really? I didn't mean it last year, but this time I really mean it. You know, the problem with that is basically this, that the filling of the Spirit is not an experience. You were filled then. There was a yielding of your heart to God at that point. Wonderful. The problem is we misunderstand what the filling of the Spirit is. It is not an experience. It is a lifestyle of yielding, of submitting, of giving my will over to Him. There's a story of a church that was having revival meetings every year. This is great. You'll love it. Having revival meetings every year, and they'd have different speakers coming, and just wonderful things had happened, and there was this one gentleman who never showed up at church all year long, but for these revival meetings, he'd come, and he'd sit near the back, and he'd come to every meeting, and every year, for about ten years in a row, what he would do at the end of the meetings, on the last day, there would be an invitation, And he would come to the front every year, and he would stand at the front, he would raise his arms, he'd go, fill me, Jesus! Fill me, Jesus! And then finally, after about ten years of this, he did that again, and he got to the front and said, fill me, Jesus! There's a little old lady in the back stood up and says, don't do it, Lord! He leaks! Hmm. And the point is, we all do. The point is, we all do. And that's why the filling of the Spirit is not an event. It's not a thing that happens. It isn't secured when I come forward. Let me say this also. There are times in my life when I need to break, and there are points in my life that I can look to and see a point. In fact, I can tell you one right now. In a summer time, when God dealt with me at a point in my life, and I began to open myself, but all that did was start the process. It wasn't done. Be real honest with you. As I was dealing with this, I even look at my ministry right now. And the ministry God has given us here. And you know what? Our ministry here is hanging on the thread of the filling of the Spirit today, not last week. What God did through me and what God did through you last week doesn't count for today. That's one of the tensions of living the life. Be being kept continually filled. But there's another angle we still need to hit, another dimension, And this is the last one. I'll close with this. But there's three of them, so no. What does the filling mean? We still haven't gotten to that. What does the filling, what does that word fill mean? Most of us, when we think of filling, I don't know if I would ask you, but when I think of filling, I think of a glass, and I fill it, okay, to the brim, with brim. And I fill it up, and I fill it with water, and then it's full, okay? There's a container, and it gets filled with liquid. That isn't really the concept. It's not going to hurt you to think that, But that really isn't the concept. We can go far deeper with the Greek language, which is real explicit in this. There's three basic concepts that plerao, and that is the word to be filled, filled means. The first concept is this. It can be used to speak of a wind filling a sail. I like that. Think about that in terms of the filling of the Spirit. It can be used to speak of the wind filling a sail, and the picture would be that of moving a ship along with the wind, to be carried along by the wind, to be moved along by the wind, to be born along by the wind of the Spirit. All of the direction in your life, the thrust of your life, the energy of your life, the pressure of your life that's moving you in God's direction is this wind of the Holy Spirit. What a way to live! What a way to live to just let the wind of the Holy Spirit be bearing you along in your life, moving you from one experience to another, from one encounter to another, from one point of obedience to another. Just letting yourself be born along by the Spirit. what a way to run a church what a scary way to run a church too often the way we run our churches is just like businesses why? because we don't understand anything about being born along by the Spirit we make our plans I've had people come to me and they've heard real neat things are going on and they go what are you doing over there? what's your plan? I have a plan it's that we would learn what it means to be born along by the Spirit of God and you know what that means? I have no idea where we're going that's what it means because we're going to let the Spirit take us where He will play rao to be born along by the wind having the sails full full permeation is another thing it means play rao permeation that would be like salt that we would sprinkle on meat and the salt goes into the meat and it flavors it a better illustration would be when my kids have milk and they hate milk so they like chocolate milk and the chocolate goes into the the milk and you stir it up and what does it do it permeates it becomes chocolate okay takes on that very nature That's a real simplistic illustration. But there's a sense in which the Holy Spirit wants to flavor your life with Himself. So it is that when people get in touch with you, they have this strange feeling that maybe they've been with Jesus. Why? Because of the filling of the Spirit, permeation of your life. And that ties in so well with our whole understanding of what we've been discussing in Ephesians, that it's the Holy Spirit who lives in me, and by an act of my will I yield to him and permit him to do in me the things he's called me to do and then he permeates. Christlike. Be imitators of God. That whole thing. The third use for this word and this is the most dominant in all of the New Testament and I believe that this is where we can really get to the core of what this is dealing with most specifically in Ephesians. I've got to get back there. Is when it speaks of domination. To dominate. In the Gospel record, if a writer wants to speak of an emotion that would dominate a person, he would use the word plerao. It dominated him. Let me give you some examples. John 16, 6 says this. They were filled with sorrow. They were dominated. The dominant emotion in their life was sorrow. They were filled plerao with sorrow. In other words, sorrow to such a degree that it couldn't be balanced off by anything else. You got it? There was no room for joy, not even a little bit. No matter what good thing happened, there was so much sorrow, there was no room for anything else. Luke 5.26 says they were filled with fear. There was no room for anything but fear. Nothing was able to balance it off. Nothing was able to temper it. They were filled with fear. Luke 6.11, they were filled with madness. Acts 6.5, they were filled with faith. Acts 5.3, they were filled with Satan. Now, I think you understand that concept, But if you would back off that a little bit and look at your own life, one of the ways we try to live is to live in kind of a balance. We kind of have a little bit of sorrow comes into my life and I try like crazy to balance it off with a little bit of joy. If I have to go buy a new suit, I got a new suit. Okay, if I have to do that to get a little joy, I'll balance it off. I'll do something to balance off the sorrow, right? And I'm always trying to balance the scales. A little sorrow, a little joy, a little joy, a little sorrow. Just kind of keep it where it is. But every once in a while, something happens in my life, and I just can't keep the balance. My little boy dies. My little Caleb dies. And I want to tell you something. My scale will hit play ra'o right now. And I will appreciate your love, and I will appreciate your support, and I'll appreciate all your caring. But there won't be a whole lot of room for anything but sorrow right then. Play ra'o, full of sorrow. And there's not room for anything else. And it can't be balanced. It's just all there. I gave myself to sorrow. That's it. But on the other hand, I'm going along, and I'm living my life the way we normally live our life, a little bit of sorrow, a little bit of joy, you know, a little bit of sorrow, a little bit of joy, kind of keeping it balanced and doing what I have to do to keep it balanced. And then Martha dies, and I don't even know Martha, and she leaves me 50 million bucks. I'll tell you something. Whoa, I just hit the happy side. You know, there's the scale here. There's sorrow, there's happy. Over there, I was sorrow. Now I'm happy, happy. and there isn't any room at all for anything else. I mean, Poland could go to war. Hey, it doesn't matter. I could lose my job. Hey, it doesn't matter. You know, my wife could leave. Maybe that would do it. But I'm getting a little carried away, aren't I? Where is she? There you are. I suppose if I had 50 million bucks, I'd be kind of tough to live with. But I'd be way over on the happy side. You know, just be wonderful. Nothing could ruin it. Crack the car up. Doesn't matter. I'd buy three or four more. The problem for us is that we live our spiritual lives the same way we live our normal lives. And I know this is going to connect with you because it blasted me right out of the water. A little bit for the Spirit, a little bit for me, a little bit for the Spirit, a little bit for me. You know, I don't want to go overboard. I don't really want to get into this deeper kinds of commitment. You know, that's for the pastor, and that's the way he's supposed to be, and that's for the song leader, and for the deacons, and the elders, and the people who are involved. But not for me. This is a command. This is the norm for every believer. We live in mediocrity all our life. And the real tragedy is, is if that mediocrity just becomes pervasive in the church, we actually begin to call that mediocrity the abundant life. Because we've never seen real life. We all begin to believe that that mediocrity is normal. I just close with this. Somewhere along the line we need to decide that I'm not going to pretend anymore, that I'm not going to perform anymore, that I'm not going to try to be humble anymore. How many of you try to be humble? Don't we get into that? I'm just going to, you know, we're talking about humility, so I'm going to try to be humble or try to be patient. I'm just tired of trying to imitate God. I'm so tired of trying to be who this even says I'm supposed to be. You know what you need to do? You need to open yourself up to one thing. Let the other flow. and that is to be filled, to be born along by His power, to be permeated by His person, to be controlled, full, filled with His presence. You know how you do that? We're going to get that next week in detail. But I can't just leave you and say basically what it is real simply is saying that's what I want I'm going to quit pretending I'm going to quit performing I'm going to quit calling mediocrity normal because it isn't and Dave more than anything in the world what I want right now is to understand what it means to be controlled to be blown along to be permeated by to be filled with, controlled by the Holy Spirit. Again, I would just remind you that whenever God wants to do a job to build his kingdom, he does not look for talent. If you're going to school and thinking, this is what I need, that isn't what you need. That's good, go to school. That isn't what you need. I see too many people coming out of seminaries and coming out of schools, even like Speeby and Bethels, who feel prepared because they know, huh, he doesn't look for talent, he doesn't look for looks, he doesn't look for brains, he doesn't look for experience, he doesn't look for age, he looks for men and women who are fully his, who are filled with the Holy Spirit. And that is what builds the church. And that is what will build us. And that is what will move you, if you're struggling with this, out of that level of mediocrity, into a spirit-filled life.
