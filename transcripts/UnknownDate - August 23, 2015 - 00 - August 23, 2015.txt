Our scripture reading this morning has been drawn from Matthew 28 as well as Acts 1-8. And Jesus spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. I want you to go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, beginning in Jerusalem, but then in all Judea and Samaria too, and even to the remotest parts of the earth. And don't forget, I'll be with you as you do this day after day after day, right up to the end of the age. This is the word of the Lord. Amen. Thank you, Lindsay. Can we pray as we begin? breath of God breathe on us I pray for life to come and grow in us and from us the kind of life and energy that can only be generated by your spirit I pray in this word in this room and I pray it in Jesus name Amen I want you to go, therefore because from the very beginning of the story of our story, the church's story anyway the movement has always been outward it's always been out there beyond what we might call the friendly confines of what is familiar and maybe even safe so beyond Jerusalem and Judea you just heard those words I want you to go beyond Jerusalem and Judea and to places like Samaria, said Jesus in Acts chapter 1, where you will meet some frightening realities and strange people like this guy named Simon in the book of Acts, who over a year ago we were talking about because we got introduced to this weird guy named Simon who was a sorcerer. He was a sorcerer. The text said he was a person proficient in the magic arts. And if you stay in Jerusalem and Judea, You know, I've got to mess with that guy, but I'm calling you outward. I'm calling you out there where you might meet a guy like that. And then there was the Ethiopian eunuch that Philip connected with on the road to Gazans in the very same chapter, Acts chapter 8, who might be the first century equivalent. I remember saying this over a year ago, and I think he might be the first century equivalent of what we see today as transgender individuals having had this procedure that made them a eunuch. And so anyway, that's strange. If you just stay in Jerusalem and Judea, you might not encounter that kind of person. So we're not in Kansas anymore. This isn't Jerusalem or Judea. We've moved beyond what is familiar and what feels safe. But that's where I want you to go because the movement has always been outward. It's always been out there. so I want you to go. It's the last thing Jesus said before he ascended to his believers that day on the side of the mountain, and while many of the people who were there that day in Matthew 28, when he gave what we call the Great Commission, and heard him say those words, go, many of those people said, okay, yes, we will go. The actual going, you may remember from our study in the book of Acts, We were in this, I think, about a year ago. It didn't happen easily, and it didn't happen quickly. Indeed, you might remember, it wasn't until chapter 8 that a great persecution came upon the church that was in Jerusalem, and they had been in Jerusalem 13 years. It's 13 years in Acts 8 after Pentecost. This disturbance happens in Jerusalem, and they begin to move, because they had to now beyond the friendly confines of what was familiar and what was known, and that was Jerusalem and Judea, because Jerusalem and Judea, we all knew each other, and everybody there went to the same synagogue. They all went to synagogue, for one thing, and they all went to the same synagogue, and they did it on the same day in the same way with the same people, and sitting in the same pew, singing the same songs, praying the same prayers. It was familiar. It felt safe, but then a great disturbance arose. Acts 8, verse 1, they were disturbed, and it was only then that they finally moved beyond what we call the friendly confines of Jerusalem and Judea because now they're in Samaria where nobody goes to synagogue, and everybody has a different God. I mean, there was a multitude of gods in Samaria. It was a fascinating study. They listened in Samaria to very different music, and they had a very different way, and they sang totally different songs, and they have entirely different values. They eat meat offered to idols. They have sex before marriage. They practice the magic arts. These people are weird. We're not in Kansas anymore. But it's just the way it is if you're living in Samaria, So you're going to have to figure out how to navigate all that living in Samaria. As most of you know, if you've been with us the last couple of weeks, for the last couple of weeks, in my return from sabbatical, I've been trying to pay attention to, identify and pay attention to, and then to share with you the things in me that grew in the context of sabbatical, because that was the expectation. Rooted in our understanding of what a sabbatical is, that when you let the proverbial ground go fallow, when you just let it rest, things will begin to grow that otherwise wouldn't or maybe couldn't because they just get trampled and it's not a sinful thing, but they just get trampled. These things that might grow in you in the context of everyday life and the busyness that just comes with it. So what were those things in me that grew is the question that I returned with to Open Door and I started talking about it a couple weeks ago. And among the things I noticed first, most prominent was this, that had grown in me was my belief and conviction that our vision as a church is a compelling one and a challenging one as well. Because the vision at its most basic level of understanding is basically this. It's designed to do this. Prepare us as a people for whatever is next. And whatever is next, whatever is in that pot, what we've identified is the next generation of leadership here at Open Door. We know that that is next, so we need to be preparing for that to identify who they are, who are the young men and women who have the DNA of what we are all about, and then to invest in them. And what's next is whatever the next iteration of Open Door as a church might be in this community. So, primary question we're asking all the time, given our values, our core beliefs and values as a church that have been formed and developed for years here at Open Door about the kingdom of God, about the grace of God, about the gospel of God. What will we look like next? Who will we be? How might we change? How must we change? And how do we prepare for that? How do we prepare a people for whatever it is that's next? And how do we prepare for all that in light of what I described last week and a little bit the week before, a little bit more today? how do we prepare for what God is calling us to do and be in what I call this post-Christian culture that we live in indeed many of the researchers are calling what we live in now a pre-Christian culture which is a fascinating thing to even think about which means not only is it after Christianity there's a segment of the population that has no authentic experience of kingdom of God life at all It's before any of that. They're not even having to undo anything. They've never tasted anything. It feels like what authentic life in the kingdom might look like. And how do we as a church do what we do in the context of a culture like that that has less and less interest in what we do, particularly here in this room about coming to church? In fact, every research group that I have gotten a hold of and have been able to read relative to what's going on in the culture, particularly the Millenniums, is this, that they are leaving the church in droves and leading the parade in this exodus out of church and never even considering going to church is what I called last week this generation next, these Millennials, which prompted me last week to suggest that a very significant part of preparing us as a people for next involves preparing us as a people for a very different paradigm than what most of us are used to and what most of us grew up in relative to church and church ministry and how we do what we do because what most of us grew up in relative to church ministry and are used to and would even describe even today as successful is what I described last weekend, the week before as this attractional model of church ministry or the church as destination model which basically says to the culture, the church's destination model basically says to the culture, we've got it, whatever it is, God, the Bible, something cool and hip, we've got it, you need it, come and get it, it's here, so the destination model says you gotta go to church, we want you to come to us. I don't know if you remember the diagram that I used yesterday, last week, just feels like a day ago, But it was much cooler yesterday because I had this thing up here and I had to do it by hand, but this is much slicker. But this is a diagram of the culture I told you about. There's all these little areas of life, the political arena, business, education, arts, the sports arena, the family life arena, and then there's the church over there. And we have our own little arena, our own little silo. And for years, go to the next slide, what we've been operating with is this church's destination model where what we believed and hoped was that all of these arenas of life, politics, business, They would all come to us. They would come to us because we have it. You need it. Come and get it. It's here. And while the church or while the culture was Christianized enough, at least to some level, that model worked. Because many of you even grew up in a place where you hated church. It was boring. It was totally disconnected from life. But you just go to church. So the culture, Christianized enough, still buys that model. And then my generation came along and realized, well, a lot of people are just going to church. They don't have any life. And a lot of people are just leaving church. And so if we fix the church, this was my generation, like 35 years ago, I'm coming into ministry. I'm thinking if you fix the church, then people will come and they will come back to church. And so we fix the church. I talked a lot about this last week by making it more contemporary, more fun, more friendly, more whatever. More conservative, more liberal, more serious, more happy. And if we fix the church, become attractional, people will come. And again, if the culture is somewhat Christianized, the population that is still kind of Christianized might respond to that, but more and more. We are living in this post-Christian culture, pre-Christian culture, the vast majority of which has no interest whatsoever in coming to church, which moved us to this third model, church is incarnational, which is fascinating because now you have church and there's reason to be in church and there's reason to come here, but it really is to become and be remembered and be reminded about who we are and why we're here and then to go. I want you to go with the life of God, with the breath of God on you, with the authentic ministry of the Spirit pulsing through you. I want you to go and permeate this culture, permeate what this Samaria might actually be. And I believe, and it's a growing belief, that a significant part of preparing us as a people for whatever it is that's next, we keep talking about the year 2020, and that's kind of an earmark, or what do you call that, a thing, it's out there for me. What it involves is preparing us as a people for a very different paradigm. Because while we might even go, I love that incarnational thing. I think we are more steeped than we know in this church's destination model. We need to shift conceptually from a destination or attractional model. We're wanting more and more people here. I do want more people here. What we need to do is be very diligent to be providing reliable means for the people who are coming here to experience authentic transformation, to grow in the grace and the knowledge of Christ, who when they're wounded, they get healed, where we're confessing our sin, where we're coming alive to God, but then moving out from here into the culture that has no interest in what's going on here. I want you to go, because the movement has always been outward. It's been out there where people actually are. which as I said last week is a very different model than what most of us grew up in but it isn't a new one because from the very beginning the movement has always been outward it's always been out there I want you to go beyond the friendly confines of what's familiar or even safe and old paradigms are both old ways of doing it are familiar and they're safe just like Jerusalem and Judea was familiar. That's why they stayed. They weren't evil, they weren't bad but it was familiar and safe because everyone goes to synagogue here we all kind of think the same way we have the same thoughts and the same ideas we all go to synagogue the way we always have on the same day in the same way sitting in the same pew singing the same songs listening to the same teachings, Acts 2, 42. They were listening to the same teachings, continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching. They were really into that, and it was really good teaching, the apostles' teaching. It's a fascinating thing. In Acts 8, when they were dispersed and they started to go, which Jesus told them to do at the beginning 13 years previous, there's this little thing in the text that's kind of easy to miss because in Acts 8, when they started to go, actually just running from their lives, and they ended up in Samaria. How did we get here? The apostles stayed back in Jerusalem, and it's a powerful symbol, because what it means is the people I'm sending aren't the professionals. It's just people moving into their everyday, ordinary lives with the life of God in them and the breath of God coming from them. But there they were, these believers in Jerusalem. The breath of God had come to them. Acts chapter 1, the Spirit had landed on them 13 years ago. They were still living off the glory of that, the wonder of that. And in Acts 8, kind of out of nowhere, it all began to change because this disturbance arose. And now we have to go. So they did, and here they are living in Samaria. How do we get here? Because the movement has always been outward. It's always been out there. and I want you to go beyond. And all of that brings me now to another thing that's grown in me, actually come alive in me again in my return from sabbatical, and it's this story that we find in the book of Acts about a people to whom the Holy Spirit has come. It was the breath of God in chapter one, as I just said, and they had come alive just like you and just like me, And it was good there in Jerusalem and Judea in Acts chapter 2, but you need to go beyond what's familiar and safe. And this story in Acts is a story that we began to tell here at Open Door because we were just going through the book of Acts. And I don't know if you remember it. I looked it up this week. We began to go through the book of Acts in October of 2012, three years ago. Just working through the book, verse by verse, just thought it was a good place to go. And I thought it was great. And then it was a year ago next week, a year ago next week, August 30th, we kind of put a bookmark in our study in the book of Acts. Acts 13 was where we just said, we're going to stop here for a second and do some other things. We got into vision, and then we moved into Lent and to Advent and all sorts of other things. And so we gave the book of Acts a rest, if you will. And it's weird because in Acts 13, what's fascinating, they're in that same place where somebody's having to go, but this time it's not a disturbance that sent them. The elders in the leadership of the church had learned how to listen to God. They were ministering to the Spirit, and the Spirit said to them, I want you to send, because a movement is always outward, I want you to send Paul and Barnabas to go, and because they went, we're here. Anyway, we put a bookmark in it there and kind of forgot about the book of Acts, but now that story is beginning to grow in me again. It's coming alive in me because in ways that I couldn't see as clearly as I think I do now, the story that we see unfold in the book of Acts is our story. I think we're in this story. And I'm looping back to it now because we are in a story about a people to whom the Holy Spirit has come. It's you and me and us. It was the breath of God and we continually desired and we have come alive and it's all about becoming more and more alive but now it's time to go. I want you to go because the movement has always been outward. It's always been out there. I want you to move beyond the friendly confines of what's familiar and safe. So I'm not talking about a geographic movement here. I'm talking about paradigms. Old paradigms are both. They are familiar and they're safe which maybe means that part of what it's going to take to prepare us as a people for next is to be preparing us as a people, again, for a very different paradigm than what we're used to, what we grew up in relative to church, ministry, not the attractional model, or church as destination. We want them to come here because we have it, they need it, come and get it, it's here, but church as incarnation with people full of the breath of God and the life of God moving into their everyday life and world. Because I want you to go. The movement is always out there. But while it may be a different paradigm than what we've known, it isn't new. Indeed, it's right here in the story of the book of Acts. And we are in the story. We're in the story. So I'm not sure when it happened. And I can see some of the people in Acts chapter 8 when they'd been in Jerusalem for 13 years and this persecution comes and now they're out running for their lives, they would have said the same thing. I'm not sure when it happened. When this whole thing turned on us and it wasn't safe anymore to be in Jerusalem, I think we could say, I am saying, I'm not sure when it happened. When we became, here in North America, a post-Christian culture. I hear that all the time. When did that happen? And this pre-Christian culture, which I just heard a few months ago when I was studying this millennial thing, I'm not sure when it happened. And it's disturbing. It's disturbing to think about that. But maybe that is the disturbance. It's our disturbance that in some very good, though uncomfortable ways, might just move us beyond the familiar and known, beyond the friendly confines of what's safe. To be considering other paradigms, actually, not new ones, I want you to go. Think about the first century culture. This is fascinating to me, too. Go back in your mind, Acts chapter 1. Don't even be in Acts chapter 8 yet, be in Acts chapter 1. If there ever was a pre-Christian culture, it was the culture in Acts chapter 1. Why would you call that a pre-Christian culture, and how do you know? Here's why. before Pentecost. There was no church. There was no Christian thing. There was nothing like that. It wasn't on the radar. It was the quintessential pre-Christian culture. So we have that in common with these men and women of Acts chapter 1. No churches, no Christians, no nothing. But here's another thing that we have in common with them. There were no churches, no Christians, no nothing. Check the nothing, because there was religion in action. All over the place, there was religion. It was everywhere. And that's just like today. If we are in a pre-Christian culture, it's not that we're in a non-religious culture or world. There's lots of religion, much like today. And much like today, there's a confusion of voices. So many voices for a century. You would have had this Judaism voice. So there's Judaism, but it's connected to a corrupt temple system that we've talked about a whole lot. So be a first century Jewish person, and you know the temple system's corrupt. I would connect that with the institutional church today. And you're a Jew, but you love God, and you know the temple system's corrupt. And so I kind of fight, and should I even go to that thing to participate in that thing? But part of my relationship with God is this thing. so you continue to go to the temple, but it's harder and harder to be in that system when it's corrupt and it's about money and power and sex. Oh my, that sounds like, you know, home. That's what some would even just pull. If I'm going to know God, I've got to get away from that system, but that was one of the systems, and so some are loving God, but they've got to, hey, I can't get near that thing. I'll lose my faith if I go to church. Church. synagogue, but added to that, you've got the Judaism piece, first century. You've also got what was known in those days as the mystery religions. And the mystery religions were full of mysticism and a kind of spirituality, very supernatural actually. It was very attractive. There was also emperor worship in those days, so emperors would be seen as God and the worship was serious. They would have statues and all those kinds of things and it was a kind of power. But what's ironic about emperor worship? You go, wow, that was so weird. No, no, no. What do you think Rome was about? I got three things that Rome was all about. And so their God and their religion was all about money, big surprise, power, and big surprise, sex. So there's your religion. And then added to that, mystery religions, Judaism, emperor worship, the Epicurean, Stoic, and Gnostic. Take your pick. Philosophies. And then you get to the Areopagus in Athens. Athens, the city of enlightenment, the city of intellectual pursuit. These people were so brilliant and enlightened that in fact they were open to everything. They were just so open to everything. In fact, when Paul went to the Areopagus, I think it was in Acts 17 or 18, somewhere in there, he was walking through it and he saw idols everywhere. He saw these statues to these all sorts of gods. And the thing was, yeah, oh yeah, we're into that. Oh yeah, yeah, we're into that. And then there was even one to the unknown God because we're so open that we may not have it all down. So there's probably a God we don't know. So when Paul came to the Areopagus and began to speak, they were really interested. Tell us all about this God that you're talking because we would love to add him to ours. In fact, do you remember this? This is exactly what happened when the church was dispersed in Acts chapter 8 and Philip found himself in Samaria. Not because he wanted to go there. he just was running for his life, but there he is in Samaria, and he starts talking about the life that is in him, and it looked like a revival, because multitudes were coming to what looked like faith, but then he figured it out. In fact, Simon the sorcerer believed as well. Remember that? And Simon the sorcerer was going, well, we are into you. And Philip's going, this is awesome. Got to tell Peter back at home what's going on here. I got it going. And then they find out, this is Samaria, dude. And all they're doing is adding what you're saying about Jesus to what they believe about everything else. There is no revival here. In fact, this is a mess. Here they were adding Jesus to what they already believed about how life works, about how you get what you want. And what we want is, well, I don't know. Money? I got a theology for that. Sex? I got a theology and power? I got a... And now we'll just use Jesus to get that, which is the same. And I'll keep using Jesus to get what I want until I don't get what I want, and then I'll dump the Jesus thing and try something else, because it really is about getting what I want, whether it be money, sexual power, or some other thing. And again, today, in the context of where we live, it's not Judaism and a corrupt temple system. It's Christianity and institutional church that often is corrupted by money, sex, and power. It's in the paper. It's on the front page pretty much every day. Along with not just institutional Christianity, but the Muslim thing, Islam, Hindu thing, New Age stuff, emperor worship, God bless America, same thing. Areopagus in Athens that's open to everything let me ask you a question do you think we're in this story anywhere? because the story that I just told you about first century reality, Judaism, mystery religions it's our story it's where we live which means we're living in Samaria already indeed in the analogy of the first century church They had to physically leave Jerusalem and Judea to get to Samaria. The movement that I'm talking about is not a physical movement. It's not a geographical movement. We don't have to go to Samaria. Samaria has come to us. When did that happen? When did we become post-Christian? Pre-Christian, it's come to us. We're living in Samaria, which means, among other things, this, that are moving out beyond the friendly confines of what's familiar isn't just about geography. So we all have to go somewhere else. We don't have to go anywhere else because it's already here. We're already there living in Samaria right now, which raises some questions for us as a church. How do you navigate living in Samaria? Wow. well one I guess you'd have to kind of dial into the fact that we do this isn't a safe place that we live in it's not conducive to your kids health or yours sexually, morally economically there's a minefield out there so I know what we should do is be afraid be afraid, be very afraid and come to church and we'll make you feel safe so you build a bunker and church does that and churches do that and Christians do that and we'll just huddle up like the Essenes go out to the desert and wait for God to come and blow the whole thing up and go thank you Jesus for finally but I want you to go so how do we navigate this how do we walk into how do we not leave geographically anywhere we are but how do we engage in this Samaria landscape that we live in, how do we go and not fall into the minefields all around the way? Well, I don't have all the answers here today. Here's what I believe in. It's a growing belief. Part of what it means, part of what it's going to take to prepare us as a people for next involves learning how to live in Samaria. and not just live there, but how to navigate the chaos of it, the sexual minefields of it, the educate, whatever they might be. But not just living in Samaria, it's gonna be preparing the people to learn how to engage where we live in ways that actually and accurately reflect and reveal life in the kingdom of God. Which actually, you know, there's even some good news here. I don't know. Sometimes I get overwhelmed by even the things I'm thinking about this week. But other times I can get excited because I'm going, what if authentic kingdom living was happening someplace like here? And what if people got a whiff of it? Because now there's this opportunity because it's so, I promise you it's an alternative. It's different. It'll be different economically. We'll be doing different things with our money and our passions and our lives. preparing the people for next and allows preparing us how to engage in ways that reflect authentically the grace of God and the love of God but also the truth of God and how life actually does work whether you like it or not because when you do that you're going to get that because the whole thing that we need to walk out is grace, big hug, and truth. No, no, no, no. That's called wrong. How do you do both? And walk that out in Samaria. And actually engage in Samaria because I want you to go. From the beginning the movement is outward. I want you to go beyond the friendly confines of what's familiar and what feels safe. Peter Kapsner. In a talk he gave several weeks ago, it was the second to last talk entitled Witnesses to a Reconciling. He asked this question, and the question was asked, he was saying these things in a different way than I'm saying them today, but it was the same thing. The question he was asking was in light of what we see every day. It was in light of the headlines that scare us and overwhelm us, headlines that provide on a daily basis overwhelming evidence that evil men and imposters are growing from bad to worse, which is what Paul said to Timothy, who was trying to deal with his own kind of Samaria when he was pastoring a church in Ephesus. Here's the deal, evil men and imposters are growing from bad to worse, and we see it every day. He asked this question, did Peter, in light of the fact that there's a confusion of voices in the Samaria that we live in, and these confusing voices pull us and push us in very different directions. Sometimes the voices that pull and push are religious voices. Sometimes they're even Christian voices. It's fascinating to me. When you think about religious voices, and your mind goes, oh, these different religions, and it's just a chaotic noise. But now just forget all those other religions. Just talk Christian. And in that little arena, you've got all sorts of voices. Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. because there's an evangelical voice and a Catholic voice and a Protestant voice and there's a conservative voice and a liberal voice and there's a bad guy's voice and there's the let's just get along voice and there's the I don't think you're a Christian's voice. There's a confusion of voices. And then you think about your kids. Internet and social media, and I think about my grandkids and the easy access they have to things that wound their soul. And don't you want to just go, put them in a bubble? We do want to protect them. We figure out how to do that. But how do we protect them? We're offered not just our kids, all of us. We are offered unlimited options. Anything you want. You can have anything. You can be anything. No, you can't. You can do anything. Anything you want to do. You can do. And so we do. And then we find out that the thing they said I could do causes heartache and pain. So here's the question. Can we be a reconciling presence in a Samaria place? Can we get them to come to church? Can we be an incarnational presence? Can we go beyond the friendly confines of what's familiar and safe, old paradigms that won't have effect in order to go beyond what's familiar and safe? Well, those are the questions. I mean, those were the things. The question Peter actually asked was, that was the question he asked. Peter's answer was, yes, I think we can. Be a reconciling presence, an incarnational presence. But if we are, first of all, it's going to have to be a we. It's going to have to be together. I have a story in my mind I don't have time to tell, but of someone among us who we just get caught up in. We step in the minefields. And how do we bring healing to the people who've succumbed? How do we confess our sins to one another? We have to do this together. There can't be any secrets. We can't do this alone. I can't. You can't possibly navigate the minefield that our kids are facing by just reading a book. We have to be together. There needs to be together. You can't do it alone. Who are you with? And we have to be prepared, and we might need to learn the language of Samaria. I mean, if we're going to live in Samaria, can we learn how to talk to them? And I don't mean, you know, like kind of descend down to their level of whatever yucky stuff they talk about, whoever they are. Can we dialogue so that when they get into what Peter talked about when he was kind of opening the box, let's close it really quick. you start talking about gay marriage and transgender and all these things. Can we learn how to talk in order to engage or we just run away and I don't know, I don't know. There's several things we need to be prepared, but mostly, and now I just come back to what I closed with last week, and the more I get in touch with what I'm talking about, the more I'm desperate for this. We mostly need the breath. of God. We need the life. So he breathed on them. Remember that, John, 2021? He had just gotten done saying, as the Father sent me incarnationally into the world, I am now sending you incarnationally into the world. But wait a minute, wait a minute, you need the breath. So he breathed on them and said, receive the Holy Spirit, X. One was the same thing. He had just told them to go into all the world. and make disciples. I want you to go beyond what's familiar. But wait a minute, wait a minute. You need the breath. Wait for the breath. The Holy Spirit is the breath. The breath that we talked about last week. Because like Ezekiel, looking at the valley of dry bones, can you see them? Can you see the bones? Because they're dead and they've been dead for a long time. That's why they're dry. And there's not, the first thing you do isn't go, let's put them all together. I know a plan. You don't have a plan. We're going to have a plan, I guess. But the first thing is you just, Ezekiel's overwhelmed. He's looking. He's going, this is dead. This is dead. And the Lord said to Ezekiel, prophesy. And tell them that I, even the Lord, will breathe on them and they will come to life. I'll put my spirit in them and they will come to life. And that kind of life needs to start in rooms like this. That's why we go to church. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. And all of that is at least part of what it takes to prepare us as a people for whatever's next. More on this next week, I think. I don't know, we'll see. Would you get quiet with me? Just take a position where you're comfortable. Sometimes it helps to just hold out your hands just real easily on your lap as if a child receiving. Can you see the bones? and maybe they're real close to home. Maybe they're in your own marriage. Maybe they're in your own soul. Lord, we don't know how to fix this. What is the this you're looking at right now? You don't know how to fix it. Holy Spirit come breath of God breathe so we we could come to life more and more and more life and then gather together to encourage one another to love and good deeds and then to give it all away. And he breathed on them and said receive my very life. God, thank you that you do what you've always done. We're asking for it again. And we pray for it in Jesus' name. And for his sake. Amen. God bless you as you leave your dismissed. Thank you.
