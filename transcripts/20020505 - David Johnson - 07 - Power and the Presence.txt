Let's pray as we enter into our time around the Word. Father, my request tonight is that by the power of your Spirit through the Word this evening, you really would prepare us for the gifts you'd like to give us as we, your people, come to and gather around your table. I pray that in your name. Amen. I think most of you are aware of the fact, if you've been with us the last few weeks, months, that we're dealing these days with the issue of power. Rightly ordered, kingdom of God power lately is what we've been focusing on, and that there is in fact a path to that kind of power. But the path to kingdom power is an odd path, an unfamiliar path, full of paradox and what looks like contradiction, for what we've discovered over the last several weeks is that the path to power in the kingdom of God doesn't always look or feel very powerful at all, especially on the front end. Once again, while we've examined several scriptures that illustrate this reality over the last several weeks, the clearest and most succinct to me, it's the text I can use to get to this dynamic, the quickest, continues to be Philippians 2. where the path to power is embodied in Jesus himself who did not ascend to power by grasping for power, but he descended to power by emptying himself, taking on the form of a slave. Not much could look more powerless than a slave. And like a slave, he did what a slave does, he obeyed, becoming obedient even to the point of death, even death on the cross. Then the pivotal verse in that second chapter of Philippians, verse 9 says this, Therefore, or precisely because Jesus walked that path, God gave him power. For he gave to him the name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father. Every knee shall bow, and then it even goes on to articulate or make very clear, every knee in heaven will bow. Every knee on the earth will bow. Every knee under the earth will bow. Every principality, every power will bow, which means that ultimately everything and everyone is subject to him, and that's a lot of power. All of which tells us something that we need to know about power and haven't touched on it yet in our series, Will, in weeks to come, about where power comes from and how it can be accessed. Because while it's really important to talk about and understand the path to power, as we have been the last several weeks, we also need to understand that the ultimate source of the power we so desire and so desperately need, quite frankly, is God. Just God. Who by the word of his power put the stars in their place. What I want to say today, tonight about power is this. That the power of God is accessed in the presence of God. Say that again, let that in. The power of God is accessed in the presence of God because God is power. Wherever he is, there's going to be power. Leanne Payne says it this way in her book Healing Presence. The power to be healed, to change or be changed, is not stirred up or accessed by some song we sing or some sermon we preach, though God may move powerfully through both those things. It's because God himself is in our midst that healing happens. His presence and his power are mysteriously one. They cannot be separated. That is, wherever you have his presence, there is his power. And we who live and move and have our being in God are called to preach and to teach and to minister in the awareness of that presence and power. Oswald Chambers says it this way, You shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit, not power as a gift from the Holy Spirit. The power is the Holy Spirit, not just something he imparts. Leanne Payne goes on elaborating to say this, we become ministers of God's healing, love, and power, therefore, as we learn to invoke and invite the mighty presence of our Lord. We call it here practicing the presence. We by that learn to become vessels through which he ministers his power in our midst. Now, this practicing of the presence of God happens all the time. Some of you do it. Some of you are doing it right now. Some of you do it and are doing it right now and don't even know you're doing it right now because you never had terminology to call it practice the presence. Every week as I prepare my heart and prepare the word that I give to you on Saturday nights and Sundays, I practice the presence. Whether I call it that, I'm not practicing. I practice the presence with an almost constant awareness. I can hardly think of a moment when it leaves me. That without the active presence of God, my work and my words are futile and wind. So whether it's in the preparation or in the presentation, the unspoken cry of my heart is, Come Holy Spirit. Come Holy Spirit. touch and move and breathe on this be in the preparation be in the presentation and if I don't feel like you're in it I'm going to believe that you're in it be in it I love your responses to what we do on Sundays sometimes I hear nice talk and I know what you mean that's not an inappropriate thing to say but every time I hear that I think I hope it's more I just hope it's more every week we pray over our worship team people you just saw up on the stage and we'll in just a few minutes our altar team who you'll see standing here to receive you for prayer in just a few moments our communion stewards on days like this where we're coming around the table and these people you know you may not think about it very much but if you do think about it it'll dawn on you they come to church the way you come stuff of life all over them often feeling like they have nothing to give and nothing to offer so come Holy Spirit give us what we do not have accomplish what we cannot do you know how sometimes when the Spirit prompts you to come for prayer and you feel nervous? You don't know if you should, and I don't know if I should go? Do you ever dawn on you that the people who are receiving you feel the same way? Not that they're coming, but, oh no, somebody's coming. Because in their flesh right now, they don't feel like they have anything to give. And every week we are in that room and we pray and we anoint with oil and we bless them with water and we say, here's the deal. God's called us to do something we can't do. We're here to help blind people see and deaf people hear and lame people walk and dead people rise and hard hearts to soften. So come Holy Spirit. And practice the presence of God as they pray for you. every week people move through these seats here and in the Earl Brown Center where we meet on Sunday praying and anointing invoking the presence of God on your seat inviting the presence of God into this room before you ever get here why do we do that? because we're very weird there's another reason it's because we believe that in the presence of God is the power of God. People sometimes report and I don't hear this every week. Once a month maybe. You know, and I don't always hear it directly. I hear it from someone else quite often. You know, when I first came to Open Door, I came to church, blah, blah, blah. I walked in the room and I began to weep. Church hadn't even started. And I think, Yes, it did. Yeah, it started a long time ago. Did you know that what we call our worship time isn't a song time? You knew that. Maybe not all, but most of you knew. You know what a worship time is? It's a practice the presence of God time. It's a bring yourself presence to the God who is here time, whether you feel it or not. Believe me, I know what it feels like to not be able to feel it, and other times to be overwhelmed with it. And while some are busy critiquing the song, and I know that some are, usually it's the style. It's either too fast or it's too slow. Others are bringing themselves present to the God who is here. Guess what they enter into quite often? Power. Power. Power. A little over a week ago, anticipating this being the communion weekend, where we were talking about power, I didn't want to do the devotional this week. I was retired, actually. I didn't have a word, and then God gave me a word. No, I guess I've got to do it now. Here's what I felt to prompt him. Number one, shorten your talk. Promises, promises. We'll just see about that. It's going to be shorter. We're going to be done in a second here. Number two, explain enough about presence and power for the people to understand. Number three, do it. Practice the presence. Publicly, corporately, invoke the name of God, having explained what we mean by that. We do this all the time. I don't always explain this to you. Invoke the name of God. Invite the presence of God. I hope it doesn't sound presumptuous. I certainly hope it doesn't sound arrogant, but I have some expectations about what will happen when we do that. Because I have these expectations every week. That as we very pointedly, intentionally, and corporately invoke the name of God and invite the presence of God, we will experience at some level, for some of you, like beyond belief, others not, the power will experience the power of God. Because in the presence of God is the power of God. okay so what do you want us to do Dave this sounds a little weird just this it isn't weird at all and I'm putting words around something many of you do so I'm just giving some words here's what we want you to do I want you to do by an exercise of your will become aware of and present to the God who is here and do it just the way you are well I could never do that today some of you undoubtedly are thinking I'm so distracted right now I had a terrible week had a fight with my kids before we came to church I'm mad at them I'm ashamed of myself perfect it's not perfect come that way come that way don't get all different with God okay some of you are full happy grateful some of you got some really good news this week perfect come that way don't get all somber and serious because the person next to you is and needs to be you don't have to be there be in his presence as grateful and joyful as you are some of you are grieving some of you are sick some of you are afraid about what your sickness means some of you are feeling hopeless. Come that way. As we together in community invoke the name of God. Invite the presence of God. Expect the power of God. Not a lot of hype here at all. In fact, I think the less hype the better. I just want to know it's God moving and not anything else. Some of you tonight, I believe, there are, for some of you, gifts of healing. Physical healing. There will be gifts, I think, of healing in the presence of God. Gifts of healing for emotions and spiritual kinds of feelings. There may be gifts of repentance released among us tonight as God shines a light on something that you've been hiding or pretending and even didn't know you were doing it. There may not be for some of you much more than a sense of his presence. Would that be enough? Oh, that'd be enough for me. And some will have to exercise faith that he's here because the cloud of doubt or fear or whatever is keeping that sense of presence away. Let this be an exercise of that discipline. One of my favorite manifestations is illustrated, and I'm kind of biased, and this could be a preacher's thing. It's illustrated in Acts 16, 14. It says this, There was a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple fabric, who came to church one day. I like how that sounds. It's like she's kind of wandered in like maybe some of you. She just came with a friend, with the promise of dinner after. where are you going after anyway when the Lord opened her heart to the things spoken of by Paul now the text doesn't tell us what Paul said that day it is not that it didn't matter what he said but the Lord opened her heart not Paul that's power of presence I pray that every week do you think Lydia was the only one in that gathering whose heart was opened I don't Lydia is the one we read about you know what that tells me sometimes the manifestations of the spirit I get to see them sometimes I don't wherever there is presence there is power so come Holy Spirit move in ways that we can see I like that move in ways that we can't see move in ways we're going to hear about and move in ways we won't hear about till heaven as we go to the table indeed before we go to the table let's make ourselves present to the God who is here by invoking his name Bruce I'm going to ask the band to come and inviting his presence and we're going to get some help. I just want to take a quiet time with the music. We're not even going to stand you up. To let the worship band sing over you. I don't know if I'm stealing your introduction, but the words aren't going to be on the screen this time. Let them sing over you. If the songs you know and you want to enter in, you can enter in. But use the music and your own discipline of coming into the presence to make yourself present to the God who is here. And then we're just going to go to the table and let God do what he does and give the gifts he wants to give tonight. you
