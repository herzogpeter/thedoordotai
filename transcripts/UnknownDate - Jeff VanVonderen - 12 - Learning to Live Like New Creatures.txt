We're going to close off this conference by talking about what recovery really is, which I think it's learning to live consistently with who we are in Christ, and that is the result of a different fight than the fight most of us were taught. Most of us were taught a behavior fight, as I illustrated before, that in response to and in an effort to solve our shame, and not only our shame, but then the negative behaviors perhaps that we've done in our lives, we've learned to do positive behavior. So our biggest fight in life then is to just keep trying hard to do enough positive behaviors. And what I want to show you in terms of the diagram that I've put back on the board now is that on the left side of the diagram, someone else's behavior toward us or our own behavior is what generates the messages about ourselves. See, so that's where the power is. That's where our bottom line is. What this person has done to us or said about us or what we've done ourselves is what has the power to determine who we are and whether we're okay or not on this side of the struggle. On the other side, our own positive behaviors or perhaps maybe the people that these behaviors please, the ones who affirm us on the basis of these behaviors, they're the ones, this is what determines our value or whether we're valuable and acceptable. So the messages are, number one, based on our own performance, and number two, they're up for grabs, always waiting for and depending upon whether or not we are able to continue doing this good stuff. But I want to show you a different kind of struggle, and this struggle is what I would call a rest fight. And while that seems to be an oxymoron, remember I told you what oxymorons are a month ago, They're two words that contradict each other that are rolled up into the same phrase. So one of those would be, jumbo shrimp is an oxymoron. The Honorable Ted Kennedy, that would be another one. This would be... Rest fight would be two words that seem to conflict with each other, but if you can put them into the same concept, you're going to understand what we're talking about here because our struggle is to rest in God's it is finished rest. And so I'm going to show you what that looks like. And this is based on believing in and deciding to go toward and putting faith in and resting in someone else's performance besides our own, and that would be God's performance. But the only place that this struggle makes sense, or where this struggle begins, let's say it that way, Where this struggle really begins is right here in this middle place that is just after our last performance and just before our next one. So we're not doing anything right now. We're all sitting right here in the chair and nobody's doing anything. And now I'm talking about the fight that you can fight right now sitting in the chair right after your last performance and right before your next one. And this is about learning to look at what God has done and put your faith in what God has done and lean on what God has done. And Paul, the Apostle Paul, says this kind of fight in just about every way he can think of. In 1 Corinthians 1, Paul says, Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord. So I'm going to list some of the ways that Paul defines this fight. So he says, Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord. And what I want to suggest is that everybody boasts in something. Some people boast in their checking account. Some people boast in their physical strength. Some people boast in how many people they've slept around with. Some people boast in how much they can drink. Some people boast in their perfect attendance pins. Some people boast in the fact that they speak in tongues. But you let him who boasts or her who boasts boast in the Lord. So everybody boasts in something, just boast in the right thing. That's what Paul's telling us to do. In Ephesians 6, verse 10, Paul says, Now, everybody's strong in something. Do you understand? It's not a matter of whether we're going to be strong in something. It's a matter of what we're strong in. And what Paul says is be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. So as long as everybody's going to be strong in something, Christian, you be strong in someone that's strong. That's the fight. In John 15, John says, abide in Jesus. Jesus says, I am the true vine. Now the reason why Jesus says, I am the true vine, is because there's lots of vines. And Jesus is the true vine, and we're told to abide in the true vine. In Galatians 5.16, Paul says, walk by the Spirit. Meaning, it's an instrumental in a sense in the Greek, and what that conveys is, if any of you have ever seen this four-legged walker that people who have trouble walking lean on, this is what they lean on to get them from point A to point B, is this thing. Well, when Paul says walk by the Spirit, what he's saying is, let the Spirit be who you lean on to get you from one place to the next in your life. Some people lean on a variety of things, but we're told to lean on, to walk by the Spirit. In Ephesians 5, verse 18, it says, Be filled with the Spirit. That's another way he says it. Some people get filled from their kids' performance. Some people get filled from people's opinions. They try to fill themselves up with all kinds of stuff out here. But Paul says, Let the Spirit be where you get your filling from. 1 Timothy 6, 17 instructs those who are rich in this present world not to become conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly gives us all things to enjoy. So what that verse is about is this. He is not saying money is bad and God is good, so fix your hope on God. He's saying money is uncertain and God is certain, so if you're going to fix your hope on something, fix your hope on a certain thing, enjoy the uncertain thing. The certain thing gives us the uncertain things to enjoy. And you can tell, by the way, when someone stops fixing their hope on the certain thing and begins to fix their hope on the uncertain thing because they stop enjoying the uncertain thing. You know, if you happen to be in a place right now where you have all the money that you need, enjoy it. You know why? Because tomorrow you might not. If you happen to be in a place where you have a job that you like, enjoy it. But don't fix your hope on it. Enjoy it. Fix your hope on the certain thing, which is God who gives us the uncertain thing, God richly gives us the uncertain thing to enjoy. So that's the tension. And the reason that's a struggle, once again, is because you can't see God and you can see the job. If your kids are doing great right now, enjoy it. But don't fix your hope on the uncertainty of kids' behavior, but on God who richly gives us kids to enjoy. I can tell when parents start fixing their hope on the behavior of their kids because they stop enjoying their kids. And they fix their hope on their kids, and then they fix their kids instead of loving and, you know. And then in Matthew 7, Jesus says, build your house on a rock instead of the sand. Now the problem, once again, is not sand is evil and rocks are good, so build your house on the rock. The problem is that sand is uncertain. It shifts. Sand doesn't hold up houses very well. And if you build your house on the sand, get ready to have it fall down and you have to build it again. So if you're okay with building a bunch of houses, Just keep building it on sandy things. Do I need to tell you that your kids' behavior is sand? I mean, kids' behavior is one of the most shifting things there is in the world. As a matter of fact, that's their job. Build your house on the rock, not on stuff that shifts, because when you do it, your house falls down. So these are all ways that Paul has told us, and John and Jesus, people in the New Testament have told us to focus our gaze here, to put our hope here, to believe here, to trust here, to walk here, to be filled here instead of here. But the problem, once again, is that you can't see the Lord and you can see all this stuff and that's why it's a fight. So the resting part is turning to this. The fighting part is turning to this even though you can't see it. And let me show you some things that God has done, some of God's performance on our behalf, which generates some messages about us as well. First of all, as Father, God the Father. I don't believe that when Scripture talks about God as the Father that it's trying to communicate to us that God is a male. Because I don't think God is a male. I think God is a spirit. And that male and female are flesh and blood, human ways of talking about beings. God is a spirit. But the place from which the Scripture was written, to whom it was written, In that place, power and credibility and authority tended to be concentrated in male roles and male places. And so to talk about God in terms of female pronouns in those ways wouldn't have conveyed as much clout, let's say it that way, as it did to communicate God in male ways. But it's not because God is a male. It's because of the way that people understood male and female kinds of things. I think that if you want to see God's image, you have to see male and female. That's what Genesis says. If you want to see a clear picture of the image of God, males and females bear, that's the image of God, male and female. So God isn't about being a male. God the Father is about being our source. That's what it's trying to communicate when it says Father. You see, Father was the one who bears the children. In this culture, they were the one who bore the children. Now, see, the problem is that in this culture, the Father no more bore the children than the Father does in our culture. I mean, I have four daughters, but my wife bore my daughters. Do you understand? The male in our family did not bear these daughters. My wife bore the daughters. But yet, I would be viewed as someone who bore the daughters because I'm the father. And so in this culture from which this was written, the father was the bearer of the children. And that's why it says in 1 Peter 1 that we were born of imperishable seed. In other words, because we are children of this particular father, we come from a really good gene pool. We are indestructible. We are so alive that you could shoot us full of holes and we're still alive. Now, before we were born of this father, we were so dead that there wasn't anything we could do to change our deadness. But now that we're born of this father, we're so alive, we're imperishable. So God bore us. The father bore us. It also says that in Galatians that the Father adopted us. Now it's interesting that both of those words would be used to describe our relationship in God's family to the Father. Because they communicate two totally separate things. Has anybody here been adopted or adopted somebody? See, the reason why you adopt someone is because you didn't bear them. If you had born them, you wouldn't need to adopt them. If you adopted them, if you wanted them in your family and you didn't bear them, you'd have to adopt them. But either way, they're as officially really in your family as much if they were adopted as if they were born. Do you understand this? So there's two ways to get into the family. One is to be born, one is to be adopted, and you're officially a member of the family either way, but you don't have to do both. You only have to do one. Nobody would do both. Now, I was giving this illustration one time to a group of people over at another church, and I said that nobody would do both. And this woman about halfway back raised her hand, and I said, yes, and she said, I did both. And I said, what? And she said, I did both. I said, you mean you adopted the children that you bore? And she said, yeah. I said, I mean, you had children, and then you adopted them too? She said, yeah. I said, why'd you do that? She said, because I wanted to send them a message about how much I wanted them in my family. Well, that's the point. That's the point. See, God didn't have to bear us. He could have just adopted us. He didn't have to adopt us. He could have just bore us. But he did both. Because he wanted a relationship with us so much, he did both things. That's how much God wants us in his family. In Ephesians 1, 4, it says he chose us. So not only were we born and adopted, we were chosen. Now, how many of you came from a family where you felt like you were in the way and you weren't wanted and you didn't belong or you were extra or you were a pest or whatever. Some people get a message that they're not wanted. Some people get a message that from the very point of being conceived you were an oops. Like, oh man, oh no. That was the stance towards you from the very point that you were conceived. But see, now you have a father that picked you, that chose you, That adopted you. That bore you. Not only did he choose you, he chose you before the foundation of the world. How many of you ever were playing baseball or some other sport when you were a kid and you got picked last? Everybody got picked last? Like, you know, you and I are the captains of the team and Jeff is last. We picked everybody, but Jeff's the only one left. And so I say, you know what? I had him last time. so it's your turn and you go no I think I had him last time well arm wrestle whoever loses gets him how does that feel to him defective shame but now you have a father that picked you first that's the point even if you're into getting picked even getting picked second doesn't feel good but now you have a father that picked you first now I also want to say that some people here had great dads there is such a thing and some people did have great dads but you need to know that those of you who had a great dad if you're a Christian you even have a better dad than that dad because you have a dad who has a spirit that gives birth to spirit and now you are born of imperishable seed something your dad couldn't do for you or your mom In Luke 15, we see the story of the father of the prodigal son. Even though at the top of my Bible it says the prodigal son, this is not the story of the prodigal son, not really. It's the story of the father of the prodigal son. And the reason I know that is it says in verse 11, he said a certain man had two sons. So Jesus is going to tell us the story of the man with two sons. Certain man had two sons, and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the share of the wealth that falls to me. And he divided his wealth between them. Now you have to understand how hurtful this had to be for the father to hear this. Because the only way that an heir could get the share of the wealth that was coming to him is if the father died. So what the son is really saying to the father is, I wish things were the same as if you were dead. Make it be like if you were dead. And so he does a heartbreaking thing, I think, for the father, and then the father gives him the wealth, and the son takes off. And I told you the story earlier when I was talking about enabling. But, so I'm going to skip the actual crash and burn part of the story and skip to verse 16. No one was giving anything to him, but when he came to his senses, okay, so now we have a client here, do you understand? We've got somebody who's listening. When he came to his senses, he said, how many of my father's hired men have more than enough bread but I am dying here with hunger I'll get up and go to my father and I'll say to him so he makes up a little speech I'm no longer worthy father I've sinned against heaven and in your sight I'm no longer worthy to be called your son make me as one of your hired men that's the speech so he got up and he came to his father now what's interesting you need to notice that it doesn't say he took a shower and went to his father he cleaned himself all up fixed himself all up straightened all of his affairs, and then he went to his father. This is a guy who, a couple of verses ago, was fighting with the pigs for food, so the guy stinks. And he gets up, and he goes to his father. So he shows up in stinking condition with a speech. So he got up and came to his father, and while he was still a long way off, his father saw him. What that tells me is that the father was looking for the son. He's been watching for the son. He's worried about the son. He cares about the son. And so he goes out in the morning to do the chores, and on the way to the barn, he looks down the driveway. It's a long driveway, in my mind, and no son. So he goes and does the chores. Comes back at night, looks down the driveway, no son, goes back to the house every day. Same routine. And then one day, he gets up and he looks down the driveway, and coming around the corner is his son. While he's still a long way off, his father saw him, and he felt compassion for him. He's a sympathetic high priest. He felt compassion for him. It doesn't say, well, there's the idiot now. Boy, is he going to pay? Just wait until he gets back here. Am I going to give him a piece of my mind? It says, the father saw him. He felt compassion for him, and he ran. The Greek word there isn't ran. It doesn't mean ran. It means raced. There's a difference. Ran means run. Raced means run as fast as you can. Because when you're in a race, that's what you do. you run as fast as you can. So this father raced down the driveway to see his son and he embraced him. The Greek word is began embracing. Whenever you see a began doing something in the Greek what it conveys is started and kept doing. So he hugged him and hugged and hugged and hugged and hugged and hugged. And began kissing and kissed and kissed and kissed and kissed and kissed. He's really happy to see this guy. And then the son says to the father, here's the speech, Father, I've sinned against heaven and in your sight. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. And then it stops. And the rest of the speech is, make me as one of your hired servants. But he doesn't finish the speech. He doesn't get to finish the speech. But he's groveling. Do you understand? He's ashamed. He feels terrible. He feels worthless. He feels undeserving. I've sinned against heaven and in your sight. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. But the father said to his slaves. So the father interrupts the speech. He's not even actually listening to the speech. He's talking to the slaves. And I think the reason why he interrupts the speech, first of all, is because the son is about to make him a deal. Do you understand? The son is about to say, I'm going to pay for this. Here's how I'm going to pay for this. But before the son is able to offer the deal, the father throws the party. I think that's a significant point because he wants to convey to the son that there's no deals here. Do you understand? Second reason I think that he interrupts the speech is because the son says I'm no longer worthy to be your son. Well you see the son was never the son because he was worthy to be the son. The son was the son because the father was the father. Nothing had changed. You are not sons and daughters of God because you are worthy to be sons and daughters of God. And if you go off this afternoon and blow it you aren't less worthy than you were sitting right here. It had nothing to do with worthiness. If the father is your father, then you're the son or daughter, period, because of him being the father, because he bore you, adopted you, picked you. And there's another reason, too, and that's because of the nature of the deal, because what the son wants to do is he wants to tell the father, look, you don't have to receive me back as a son. I'll just be a hired servant over here. I won't even live in the main quarters with you and the family. okay, I'll just live over here in the servants' quarters like a slave. Because I feel so terrible about what I did. But see, the father isn't going to even let him say that part because sons and daughters live differently than servants. See, the way that servants live is that when they get up in the morning, they hope they do the job well enough so they don't get fired. And when they go to bed at night, they hope they did the job well enough so they don't get fired. That's not how sons and daughters live. They hope they can somehow pay back the master for giving them the job. That's not how sons and daughters live. That's how a lot of Christians live, though, you see. You know, they live over here in the slaves' quarters. You know, I've been so terrible, I did it so wrong, you don't have to receive me as a son or daughter. I'll just be over here and spend my whole life hoping I do it good enough for you. Or somehow pay you back for what you've given me. You know, I worry about people who have this idea that it's their job to pay God back for what he did. You can't pay God back for what he did. You know, it's very clear to us that salvation is a gift. It's not of works. It's by God's grace. You can't pay for it. But what's scary to me is that a lot of people understand that on the front end of their salvation, but they don't understand it the rest of the way. In other words, they just charge it. Instead of paying for it, they just charge it, okay? and then pay for it on the installment plan later on. You can't pay for it on the installment plan. If my refrigerator breaks, I go to Sears, and I say, I need a new refrigerator. They say, great, give me $600. You can have a new refrigerator. I give them $600. I get a new refrigerator. It's great, but it's not a gift. I bought it. So let's say I go to Sears, and I say, I need a new refrigerator, and they say, that's great, give me $600. And I say, I don't have $600. And they say, well, that's okay. Give me $30 every month for the next 30 months. great, I get a new refrigerator but you know what, it's still not a gift I just pay for it after I got it you know, if you're paying for it after you got it, it makes me wonder if you got it because you can't get it by paying for it even afterwards, it's only for free there's no other deal like it it's too good to be true but the father said to his slaves quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet and bring the fattened calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry. For the son of mine was dead and he has come to life. He was lost and has been found and they began to be merry. And his older brother had a problem with that. Now here's the deal. If you're this son or daughter and you say to the father, see ya, I can do this. I don't need you. I'm on my own. Get off my case. I can handle it. Bye. And so you're the prodigal, like the defiant person. And if you've done this into your life or you're doing this now and you're saying nuts to you, I'm out of here. If what you need to know is that when you get out here and you crash and burn and you finally hit the wall, pow, and you go, yuck, this isn't working, that you have a father that waits and waits and waits and waits and waits. And when you come back he's looking for you anyway because he cares about you and when he sees you come and he runs and hugs and hugs and kisses and kisses and throws a party because you're back, that's the kind of father you have. Is there anybody here that needs to know they have that kind of father? Do you know anybody who needs to know that they have that kind of father. Do you think that if some people knew that they had that kind of father, they'd go back? But they're afraid to go back because they don't know about that father. Well, verse 3. Luke 15, he told him a parable saying, What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, doesn't leave the 99 in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost? Until he finds it. And when he's found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found the sheep which is lost. I tell you, in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over the one sinner who repents than over the 99 righteous people who need no repentance. Now, this is a different kind of story here. This is about a sheep. But it's not about the prodigal sheep. Do you understand? This is not a sheep, a defiant sheep. It's just a regular sheep, like a normal sheep, like us. Some people, you know, are away from God, not because they said nuts to you and went on their own way, but because they acted like sheep. So here's this sheep, and they're going along with the whole herd, flock of sheep, and they're going along with the flock, and a butterfly goes by, and they go, oh, wow. And they go follow the butterfly over here, and then they turn around, and the rest of the sheep are gone, and they don't even know where they went, and they don't know how to get back with them. They're lost. See, this is not a sheep who goes, yeah, I'm going to rebel. I'm going to go do the nastiest sheep-like behavior I can think of. This is just a regular sheep. And now it's lost, and maybe it's stuck in some picker bush, you know, like addiction. And the harder it pulls, the more tangled up it is, and it can't get loose even though it wishes it can. It's lost. It wandered into something. See, the other picture is, if you need to know that when you are being prodigal, when you are being defiant, that when you hit the wall, you have a father that waits and waits and waits and runs and hugs and kisses and throws a party, then that's the kind of father you have. But what if what you need to know is that when you're lost and can't go back even though you want to, that you have a father that looks and looks and looks and looks and looks until he finds you, and then you don't even have to get back under your own power because the verse says he picks you up and carries you back, then that's the kind of father you have. So do you need to know about that? Do you know people who need to know about that? See, there are people who are lost. They wandered off. They're not being defiant. Guess what? Nobody plans to get addicted. Nobody. Nobody doesn't, when they're a little kid, say, you know, I'd like to grow up and be a sex addict. Nobody. They wander off into it. And maybe there is both elements. It doesn't matter because you have a father that looks if you need to be looked for and waits if you need to be waited for. Verse 8, what woman, now we've got a woman picture of the father. What woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, doesn't light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? When she's found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I found the coin which I had lost. In the same way, I tell you there's joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents. So here, now you've got a picture of a coin. The coin is on the dresser with all the other coins, and a person walks by the dresser and brushes against the coins, and the coin flips off the dresser and rolls around, and then it rolls underneath something. Okay? and what the verse says is that she searches carefully so this this is not a coin that's flipped over on its side out in the middle of everything that you can see real easily this is a coin that's gone underneath in a really dark place because the verse says she has to search carefully till she finds it so we don't even have a father that looks we even have a father that looks carefully if we have to be searched for carefully now when that coin is rolling down the floor, you see, it looks pretty good, like us. When we're rolling along, we look great. But then the coin flips over, and so there's no possible way that that coin can flip back up on its edge, roll over here, jump up on the dresser and get back with the other coins, unless someone picks it up and carries it, and that's like us. Some of us look good. We're rolling along, we tip over, we're laying there kicking one leg, can't get up. That we have a father that looks carefully for us. See, I just think that there are so many people who are wounded, and actually even wounded in the name of God, that they don't know about this father, and they're out here scared to death either that they can't come back or scared to death that God would never go looking for them, and they need to know that he waits or looks, whatever you need, whichever one you need. Now, that's father stuff. Here's some son things. In terms of this person who's self-punishing, in terms of the person who's paying the price. And the way that they're going to feel okay is if they can just punish themselves and pay big enough, then they're going to be able to feel okay. You know, standard Christian theology, everybody knows this. Jesus paid the price. Everybody knows this. Jesus paid the price. But if Jesus paid the price, then we don't have to pay the price. That doesn't mean we don't get consequences. You reap what you sow. If you sow immorality, you get sick. You get diseases. You get broken relationships. If you sow dishonesty, you reap people don't trust you. That's just the way it is. It's not because you're paying for your sin. Jesus paid for your sin. But there are consequences for what we do. We don't have to live in such a way to keep punishing ourselves for living in the way we already live. Jesus took the punishment for that. in Colossians 2 again it says this and when you were dead in your transgressions in the uncircumcision of your flesh he made you alive together with him having forgiven us all our transgressions well so which transgressions does that not include? none of them he forgave all of our transgressions having cancelled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us which was hostile toward us. So just picture like a big piece of tag board and on this piece of tag board are all the charges against you. And you know what they are. I don't know what they are. You know what's so sneaky about Satan? Satan will sneak up to us and tempt us to do a certain behavior as if that behavior has some kind of power to meet some need or something. And when we do the behavior, then he turns back around and indicts us for having done the behavior. and uses it as a charge against us, which is hostile toward us. And so picture this, that we have this great big list, a big scroll of charges against us, which was hostile toward us. Consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile toward us, he has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. So all these charges against us, which is hostile toward us, he took that away from us and nailed it to the cross. So those all went on him, they're not on us anymore. then it says when he had disarmed the rulers and authorities he made a public display of them now remember i told you that shame is a sense of being seen in a diminished way okay it's a sense that others are looking at you in a way that's less than okay and when when someone has the charges against us which were hostile toward toward us it's like here's a public writ, a public billboard of everything bad about us. We're on display. But Jesus has taken that out of the way off of us and nailed it to the cross. So now all those are about him now. They're not about us anymore. They're gone. But then he disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public display of them, which tells me that for Jesus to take away this scroll of the charges against us being equal to disarming the rules and authorities, that must mean that the only weapons that the rulers and authorities really have is this thing. And they've been stripped of it. They don't have it anymore. The scripture doesn't say that Satan is powerful. It doesn't refer to Satan the powerful one. Understand? It says Satan the liar, Satan the deceiver, Satan the thief, Satan the accuser. It says he prowls around like a lion. Doesn't say he is a lion, though. There's only one lion. Do you understand this? There is only one lion. There's somebody who prowls around like a lion, but there's only one lion, and that's Jesus. And Satan kind of puffs himself up. He's more like a chihuahua, but he kind of puffs himself up, postures himself with lion-like behavior. And when Jesus nailed the certificate of death consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile toward us, he really took away the only weapons that Satan had against us. as the accuser of the brethren. And then he made a public display of them. So it's almost like then he grabbed Satan by the scruff of the neck and just said, okay, here he is. See? And before, Satan was doing that to us. See, Satan was holding us up and saying, look at Jeff. He did this, he did this, he did this, he didn't do this, he didn't do this, he didn't do this. Well, that's on the cross now, and God's got Satan by the neck. So this living over here in a way that you have to punish yourself all the time is unnecessary because that's already been taken care of. But now we have the person over here who's doing self-rescuing behavior, trying to save themselves. Anybody here try to save themselves? They all try to save themselves. Some of us get pretty good at saving ourselves. Hebrews 7, verse 25. Hence, he is also able to save completely those who draw near to God through him. Jesus is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him. Now see, I was able to save myself. Remember I told you all that good stuff that I did? I was able to save myself, but I wasn't able to save myself completely. I always fell short. My streak always ended. Some of you were able to save yourselves pretty good, but never completely. But this says he's able to save completely those who draw near to God through him. When Jesus saves you, you've been saved. It's it, complete. And then it says he always lives to make intercession for them. He always lives to plead our case. He's in the presence of our Father. See, Satan is the accuser of the brethren, but Jesus lives to make intercession for us. That's what he lives for. So he's in the presence of the Father pleading our case. He lives for that. You now people who live for things? Some people live for their cars. Some people live for their kids. Some people live for their jobs, some people live for Michelob, you know, for the weekend. Dave Johnson lives for the Cubs. He loves the Cubs. He gets WGN just so he can listen to the Cubs. He gets Cubs memorabilia. He gets Cubs bumper stickers. He loves the Cubs. He lives for them." He cuts out the standings of the National League East the day before the season starts, when everybody's record is 0-0. But because Chicago is first alphabetically in the list, they're in first. And so he goes, Cubs are in first, it's great. You know, it's the only time they're going to be in first all season. But see, then what happens is in April, the Cubs go down the drain, like they always do, or May at the best. And then he hates the Cubs. You know, the Cubs trade somebody that he doesn't think they should have traded. He goes, Cubs stink. It's over. It's over. I hate the Cubs. You know, he'll be watching TV. Cubs will win a bunch of games. They'll lose the game. He thinks it's because he moved to a different chair. Okay, it's like, if he wouldn't have moved to a different chair, the Cubs would keep me winning. You know, like this. And so he says, that's it. I'm not watching the Cubs anymore. I hate the Cubs. And then he keeps watching because he loves the Cubs. Any Cubs fans here? See, shame. It's a shame to be a Cubs fan. It's hard to be a Cubs fan. Cubs fans are heartbreakers. Remember equity rescuing I taught you about? This is a perfect example. You've invested so much in the Cubs that you can't quit investing in the Cubs because if you ever did, they might win without you. So you've got to keep being a Cubs fan. So Dave Johnson lives for the Cubs. But he doesn't always live for the Cubs. You understand this? I live for Jesus. I do. I live for Jesus, but I don't always live for Jesus. I wish I always lived for Jesus. If I want to always live for Jesus, I try to always live for Jesus, but I don' always live with Jesus. But you know what this verse says? It says, even thoughI don't always live for Him, He always lives for me. That's what the verse says. Now, why do I needと remember that? Why do I need to be reminded that He always lives to make intercession for me? It's like He's in the presence of the Father always living to make intercession for me. So He says, you know, Father, Jeff's okay. And the Father says, okay. And he says, no, see, you don't get it. Jeff's really okay. And the father says, okay, you already told me that. I get that. And Jesus says, no, see, you don'T get it. Jeff is really okay. And the father says, you have been telling me this for 10,000 years. I get it. Now why do I need to know that? Because the father forgets? I needと be reminded that the father forgets and it's a good thing that Jesus is in his presence reminding him. No, the father doesn't forget. I forget. I need to be reminded of this because I forget. so see you don't have to pay the price Jesus did that you don't have to save yourself Jesus did that spirit scripture says that if you're a believer the spirit lives in you spirit is the paraclete the helper that comes alongside the help so the spirit is in you he's next to us where can we go to hide from the spirit? nowhere so he's with us, next to us, in us, around us clothed in his spirit my favorite spirit verse is the verse that talks about the spirit is God's seal and pledge on us. That word is Erebon in the Greek it means engagement ring. The spirit is God's engagement ring. In other words we belong to him. He's coming for us and nobody else can have us. That's what having the spirit means among other things. Now I'm out of time here to tell you any more stuff that God has done for us but you know there's lots more stuff where that came from. but the fact that God has done these things does say some things about us. And so what I want to suggest here is that all this behavior on God's part generates some messages about who we are as well. So in those other two scenarios, someone else's behavior generates the messages. In this scenario, our behavior generates the messages, but now I'm saying that God's behavior also says some things about us as well. Let me tell you a few of those. Just a few. Romans 14, 3, we're accepted. 1 Corinthians 1, 5, in everything you were enriched in all speech and knowledge. 1 Corinthians 6, 11, you were washed. Well, if you were washed, what are you now? Clean. You were justified. If you were justified, what are you now? Just, innocent. You were sanctified. If you were sanctified, what are you now? Made holy. 2 Corinthians 2, 15, a fragrant aroma to God. 2 Corinthians 5.17, if anyone is in Christ, he's a new creation. Creation. It does say that. It doesn't say creature. I mean, don't think that I'm picky here, but it is important because creation is better than creature. A creation is something that didn't used to be there before. Those of you who are artists know that when you have a creation, something is there that wasn't there before. If anyone is in Christ, they're a new creation. someone is here that wasn't here before flesh gives birth to flesh spirit gives birth to spirit when my little daughters were born in the flesh someone was there that wasn't there before when you're born again by the spirit someone is there that wasn't there before we are not mutants spiritual mutants we are not spiritual hybrids God does not add a whole bunch of good stuff to all the bad stuff that is there and say that's who you are now what he does is he takes old dead creatures, nails them to the cross, and raises us up and recreates us as new creations. If anyone is in Christ, they're a new creation. Behold, old things have passed away, new things have come. It doesn't say, if anyone is in Christ, they're a part old, part new creation. Behold, the bad stuff is gone, but not all of it, and some new stuff has come, but not a lot, so don't get too excited. It doesn't say that. If the name was in Christ, they're a new creation. Galatians 3.26, you used to be a slave, but now you're an heir. You used to be a child, but now you're sons, daughters. Ephesians 1.3, we've been blessed with every spiritual blessing. Ephesians 1.4, he chose us before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless. It doesn't say he chose us before the foundation of the world so we better be holy and blameless. It says his choosing then makes us now be holy and blameless. We're holy and blameless because he chose us. Not because we're so holy and blameless because, you know what? We're not that holy and blameless. Are we? Ephesians 1.5, adopted as sons and daughters. Ephesians 1.7, redeemed and forgiven. Ephesians 1.11, we've obtained an inheritance. We've obtained an inheritance. Hebrews 9.16 says, for where a will is, for a covenant is, for where a will is. How many of you have a will? everybody have a will? I got a will in my will my kids get everything for where a will is there must of necessity be the death of the one who made the will for a will is never enforced when the one who makes it lives is only enforced when the one who made it dies that's what Hebrews 9.16 and 17 says so it's teaching us about wills what it says is I have a will and in my will my kids get everything but my will is never enforced while the one who made the will dies so even though they have everything coming they don't get anything until the one who made the will dies. Then it goes into force. Well, this verse is not talking about human wills. It's talking about God's will. And what it says is that before the creation of the world, the owner of everything, the creator, the king of everything, made a will. And in his will, he left everything to his heirs, which are who? Ephesians 2 or 3, 6. fellow heirs, fellow partakers of the promise. That's us. How do you get to be an heir? By having the right father. So God created the world. He owns everything. He made a will and in the will he left everything to his heirs. Who's that? That's us. Well you know what he did then? He died. You know what happens when the one who makes the will dies? The heirs get the will. You know how many Christians are tiptoeing around trying to deserve the will or earn the will or get the will, you got the will. You can't get the will by earning the will. You can't get the will by deserving the will. The only way you can get the will is if you're an heir and if the one who made the will dies. And if you're a believer, you're an heir and the one who made the will dies. You got the will. I mean, Satan's got so many Christians running around like dogs chasing their tails, trying to get what they already have. You know, if dogs could think, they'd go, hey, wait a minute, I got my tail. What a waste of time. Well, we can think. We don't need to spend our lives trying to get what we already have. But a lot of people do. Ephesians 2.5. We used to be dead, but he's made us alive. Ephesians 2.6. Seated with him in heavenly places. Ephesians 2.10, his workmanship. Ephesians 2.13. We used to be far away. He's brought us near. Ephesians 2.19. fellow citizens, Ephesians 3.6, fellow heirs, fellow partakers of the promise Philippians 1.11, having been filled with the fruit of righteousness, Ephesians 2.15 God's light in a dark world, Colossians 2.10, in him you've been made complete wow, you know that's a perfect example of a verse that's very hard to believe, you know, in him you've been made complete, I mean all I have to do is look in the mirror and know that that verse isn't telling the truth. Right? I mean, I lost my hair, gained a bunch of weight, screamed at my kids, you know, didn't spend enough time with my wife. Don't tell me that I'm complete. Well, see, the verse doesn't say, in you you've been made complete. The verse says, in him you've been made complete. Quit looking at you. Start looking at him. Who are we taught to look at? 1 Peter 2.9, a chosen race, a royal priesthood, Hebrews 3.1, a holy brethren. Now, I'm out of time, but I just want to say, this is very important. All these things that I've said are true about you right now sitting in the chair and you haven't even gotten up and done one single Christian thing yet. Because they're based on what Christ did and what God has done, not based on what you do. And if you never get up and do another single Christian thing, these things are true about you. because they're not based on what you do. But see, we are called to obedience. We are called to works. We are called to living a certain way. And see, now, it's not about living in a certain way to try to generate these messages about ourselves because what God has done is generated these messages. What we're called to do is live consistently with who we are already because of what God has done. Philippians 3.16 says, let us keep living by the same standard to which we have attained. Well, see, that verse says we have attained the standard, and we're just supposed to live consistent with the standard to which we have attained. But let me ask you something. Have we attained the standard because we're such good standard attainers? no we've attained the standard because we are in the one who attained the standard so were we taught to rest in the one who attained the standard or were we taught to try to attain the standard I mean when you start understanding that holiness and righteous living and healthy living and good relationships is simply a matter of learning to live out of who we are in Christ instead of trying to live up to something Scripture even reads real different. Let me give you an example of this. This would be in Colossians chapter 1. Colossians chapter 1, verse 9, I think. Paul says, And then see, I hear that and I go, uh-oh. Well, I'm not doing that. And that always was a list, you know, that I was supposed to live up to. Walk in a manner worthy of the Lord. Please Him in all respects. Oh, man, not doing that. Bearing fruit in every good work. Well, I'm not doing that. Increasing in the knowledge of God. I probably should read my Bible more. Strengthened with all power according to his glorious might. Well, I'm not, whatever that means. For the attaining of all steadfastness and patience. Or I could use a dose of that. And then here's the punchline. But by the time I always got to the punchline, by the time I got here, I didn't hear it anymore because I was so beat up and shamed and indicted for not living up to that list. It says, joyously giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us. See, I used to do that stuff to qualify. What this verse says is that the Father has qualified us, and all that other stuff, we learn to do that. That's the process of sanctification. That's the process of learning to live consistently with who we already are because of what God has done. When I sin in this process, meaning when I miss the mark, And you have to understand that there are a couple of ways to miss the mark. Missing the mark is not about a negative list of behaviors. It's about turning to something to fill you up that doesn't have the power to do it. So one of the ways I could miss the mark is I could come over here and use a bunch of dope thinking that that's going to meet my needs and fill me up. And that would be a sin. But not because it's a negative behavior, but because it misses the mark. Understand? Or I could come over here and teach a Sunday school class thinking that that's going to validate me and make me an okay person. in which case that misses the mark too. Is it possible to teach a Sunday school class and be sinning by virtue of teaching the class? Sure it is, if you're trying to hit the mark by teaching the class because in doing that you miss the mark. So if I'm over here in my Christian life and I miss the mark, in my old behavior, I would try to now generate a new behavior to try to overcome the old behavior I did, you see. But in this struggle, If I miss the mark, what I need to do here is I need to go back over here to the cross and say, sorry, sorry, in which case I'm forgiven. And then my struggle then is to live once again consistent with who I am in Christ. And if I hit the mark, meaning that I happen to do something and live in a way that is consistent with who I already am, I remember who I am and I live that way. There's no self-righteousness like there would be here if I happened to crank out the good stuff. Over here, it's about still going back to the cross and saying thank you, and then continuing to fight this same fight. And the reason why the word fight is so significant, and I'll close with this, is because in 1 Timothy 6.12, Paul says, fight the good fight of faith, and that's what I'm talking about here, fighting the good fight of faith. The faith fight looks like walking by, boasting and being strong and abiding in the Lord instead of all this other stuff. But the word fight there in the Greek is the word A-G-O-N in the Greek from which we get our English word agony, and that's what it means. A faith fight, walking by faith is agony. It's agony. And the reason it's agony is because you can't see the cross. And you can see the list, and you can hear people's opinions, and you can remember what someone did to you. and can see a perfect attendance pin. Now we're supposed to get our sense of identity and value and acceptance from a cross we can't see while we live on this level, surrounded by stuff we can see and taste and touch and hear and feel that promises to fill us up but can't do it. Yes, but that's a fight. It's agony to do that. But Paul says it's the good fight. Fight the good fight. And I'll just close by saying it this way. You're going to fight either way. You're going to fight a fight either way. You're either going to fight to get okay from your in-laws or you're going to fight to get okay from Jesus. Either way, it's a fight. So fight the good fight. Anybody here ever try to get okay from your in-laws or from your parents? If it were possible to get okay from them, you probably would be okay by now. Because you're not short of trying hard. You probably tried really hard. the problem isn't that you didn't try hard the problem is that it promised to do something for you that it was not capable of doing so if you're going to fight either way fight the good fight of faith but the reason it's agony is because you can see your in-laws and you can't see Jesus and now we're supposed to get okay from Jesus yes now we're supposed to get okay from Jesus and not all this good stuff we do yes but it's agony because you can see the good stuff and you can hear what happens if you don't do it. And we've got a cross we can't see, but that's a good fight. So fight the good fight of faith.
