And actually, in most people's lives, this is only a handful of people. It could be a parent, a favorite coach, a favorite teacher, a favorite pastor. But those become idols, and I don't mean that in the term, the way you're thinking. They become symbols, you know, of something else. So we might only think of two or three people, but actually, they are symbols of a greater need to please people in general. So here's what happens really in church settings. Well, gee, it seems like most everybody in my circle of friends works in row C of the garden. I feel like my mission is in row E. And there aren't very many people who can stand that kind of differentiation. Thus, we must create communities of faith in which that kind of differentiation is celebrated. almost coddled, you know, we, like you care for a new baby. Or in my house, my wife is turning 50 next month, and so I bought her a puppy for her birthday because she wanted. And we brought this puppy home two days ago. It's amazing what a puppy can do to an otherwise sane house. I mean, it's literally like having a baby all over again. I called Debbie last night, and she says, I can't wait for you to come home. She said, I think we're gonna have to take turns at night with the puppy. I'm thinking, that's what we did with our kids. She said, I'm not getting any sleep, you know, because I haven't been home. She's been taking care of the puppy by herself. Well, in the same way one nurtures a puppy and gives it its safe place and makes it feel warm and accepted in a new home, if we can get that kind of social psychology going on in our communities of faith, then what it does is it helps us normal fallen human beings who have great difficulty with individuation because we're afraid of being rejected it gives us a safe place where we can do that now so it's then again hugely important that we help people grow through that because pursuing a mission by definition this is very important for you to get this it's just like by definition means that some of our friends and family are going to realize that their hearts aren't with us their hearts are in row c well what do we do when our heart is in row e the people who mean the most to us their hearts are in row c now we know our hearts aren't with each other what do we do here's what we do we don't merely see the discreteness the separateness the differentness of C and E. We see the garden, and we celebrate the garden. And we're all in this together as apprentices of Jesus, just doing and saying what the Father's telling us to do, and it's different for each of us. Now, I know as soon as I say it, you all go, oh yeah, that makes perfect sense. But it makes perfect sense theoretically. But the truth of it is when human beings usually realize their hearts aren't with each other in that way, it often leads to something negative, not something that's positive and can be celebrated, but you can find a way to do that. So we then need to learn to enjoy space and freedom for ourselves. And what I mean by that is we have to feel the space and freedom to fail and to risk and to try to move out in mission. And we need to give that to others. This is what people mean when they say things like to love is to let another one go. And it means to trust them in their row of the garden and to entrust them into their own apprenticeship to Jesus, knowing that Jesus can help them even if they get off a little bit. On the other hand, to cling to others in an effort to control them or to keep them in my row because I can't stand the thought of our hearts not being together defined in that way, you know, of only seeing separateness. To cling to somebody in row C because it makes me feel better because then I feel like my heart is with you, that is actually to never truly love them. Because to truly love somebody is to cast them into their own apprenticeship with Jesus, recognizing that in that and in his kingdom, not only are they always safe, but you're always safe. Now, again, I probably have to say, I know, I could just hear somebody out there thinking, yeah, well, I've seen people do really nutty stuff, and shouldn't we have said something? Well, yeah, of course. There are exceptions to every rule, but this is the clear rule, because most people aren't gonna do really extreme nutty stuff. You know what most people are struggling with? they're struggling with simple things like I feel like I'm called to a mission to reach out to my neighbors and I don't know how to do it and I'm afraid if I say that to most people they're gonna think I just lost my marbles that's what really it boils that's sort of the quiet life of spiritual desperation that most people lead they're not thinking about doing extreme nutty stuff and when that happens of course there's leadership in every church and enough wisdom from God to deal with it. What I'm describing here is the more main and plain thing. All right, one more, and then we'll stop. This is another point of beauty here. That sensing our mission under the umbrella of our apprenticeship brings us back to what I want to suggest is God's ultimate intention, and that is co-creation with him, which is our vocation. so again now we're working backwards seeing mission and hearing mission connects us to the family business of the trinity and involves us in kind of a co-creator subcontractor you know whatever metaphor works there for you it catches up us up into that which is our vocation which moves backwards to the sweet spot or the bullseye of what we've been trying to do here together this weekend and that is to the pursuit of the inner journey of spiritual transformation into Christlikeness and the outer journey of doing that for the sake of the world. So saying it again, Seeing mission, hearing mission, it naturally involves this cooperative stuff with God. And to do that, we have to go a step back farther of this inner journey of spiritual transformation into Christlikeness. We do it for the sake of ourselves, but for the sake of what it does to us as we express that mission. And then we go to the other end of the formula, so to speak. And we do that for the sake of others. And here's what this is gonna be like. It's gonna be like Exodus 3.11. When Moses is called to his mission on the earth and he doesn't wanna do it for all of his reasons. And what does the Lord say to him? What was the antidote to Moses' anxiety over mission? I will be with you so here's what calling and mission and gifts is like and you just have to reconcile yourself to it it is a mixture of awe and dread seriously you just have to reconcile yourself to that and the way you reconcile yourself to it is the knowledge that God is with us through the person and work of the Holy Spirit that he has not left us as orphans. He's not left us merely with a mission, but he's given us the gifts, character, power, fruit. But even that being the case, you're just going to have to get comfortable if you're, in fact, almost a way of knowing if you're on the front lines is do you have going on in you a mixture of awe, like holy cow, I can't believe this, and dread. Like holy cow, I can't believe I'm doing this. And it's really just the way it is. Paul knew it. Peter knew it. You know, the apostles knew it. The prophets knew it. It's just a part, I suppose, of the dread part, I suppose, is just a part of carrying this out. A little Q&A here. Do we have a... Can we get another mic? And then Janice will take care of that side. I'm going to ask a question. I'm going to start us out, Todd and Dallas, with a question that I've... They're going to do the cue. All right, let's just talk a little bit. Todd? What does all this bring up that you want to talk about? I'd like to ask a question as we get ready with the other questions that I talked to Dallas about. As we're in this awe, in this place of risk, for many people, the old gospel, the old paradigm of forgiveness of sins just doesn't make me feel like anything I do matters for eternity because I'm forgiven. My becoming now, what does that have to do with what I'm going to be? The statement that Dallas will often say when people ask, who is God going to let into his heaven? He says, I've heard you say Dallas, and I hope I quote it right. that you're pretty sure that God will let into his heaven anyone who can stand it. And I've just sat on that one. And as we think about all this split-off stuff that we've been talking about this morning and entering into this risk, the question I've got, and it comes from scriptures, like when he comes again, remain in him so that you won't be ashamed of his coming. And that's to believers. It's not to an unbeliever. It's not about living in the righteousness of Christ or being outside of it and not being a Christian. Or if this is the case, 2 Peter, it says if this is the case that if we live this way, there's effect, do this so we speed the coming of the new heavens and the new earth. Our becoming has something to do maybe with what everything is going towards the end. So my question is how does who I'm becoming and entering into this wonderful journey that we're talking about, outward and inward have to do with how everything's going to be in the end. I've been talking a lot. You take a turn. Well, let's take a passage to go from, it's kind of nice to do that. Romans 8. Romans 8, thank you. You turned me on. How about that, sports fans? You all know this passage now. You remember in Romans 8, Paul is talking about all creation groaning. Do you remember that? Maybe someone can find that and put that up here or something. All creation is groaning. Why? What? for. It's an inferior translation. Well, it'll do… But it was necessary in vineyard. It'll do in a tight. NIV. In verse 19 of Romans 8, "The creation waits for eager expectation for the sons and daughters of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. Now, I've said to you that your life here is training for reigning. And I started out, first shot, with Genesis 1.26. You remember that one? You see, any time you separate redemption from creation, you're already off track. you've already missed it and you're not going to hear the gospel that's present in the scripture so in brief response to Keith's huge question what we do here matters because it determines who we are becoming. What God gets out of our life is the person we become. And the person we become is going to determine where we fit into the picture of the redemption and progression of creation as the sons and daughters of God. And it isn't like now, after you get saved, if you haven't made much, after you get to heaven, not get saved, after you get to heaven, it isn't like now you're going to gradually stop lying less and less. You won't be lying when you get there. Because every temptation and reason for lying you have here will be abolished. You'll be in the presence of one who doesn't live in that kind of atmosphere. But there are going to be people carrying on with Jesus. What's Jesus doing now? Well, what did he say? I go to prepare a place for you. Do you think that's serious? Now, do you think the people who have already gone on are sitting there watching him? What would you think they're doing? They're helping him. That's in this universe. It's not in some celestial fog bank where people are lying on shelves. you know, storage, or maybe occasionally singing a hymn. We are meant to be active beings, and when we step through the veil, we will be ready to do some things and not ready to do others. there will be progression and it will be progression in terms of abilities and response abilities. And that's what your future is. And if you want to hear more about it come back tonight. No, but it really does make a difference. And the difference is in terms of who we have become and what we are becoming in the context of God's purposes in creation. I think you'll have to hang on a minute. I can't quite hear. I just wanted to ask if you had any recommendations about how we teach this to our children. And is there some age when they should start practicing disciplines or is there some resources that people have for teaching like young teenagers or maybe kids 9 to 12? Or is there something that, I mean, they're intended to walk in this too, I'm assuming. I assume they don't have to become adults first. No, they will pick it up easier than, more easily than adults. And people are working with this. I'm sorry, I can't give you anything off the top of my head. A question like that, if you want to send me a question on email, I might be able to come up with something. But the answer, the general answer is a lot of people are working on this. There's great success with it. people in young life and other organizations like that. Take kids on retreat, you know, and instead of wearing them out with volleyball, give them some time of silence and talk to them about hearing God and letting them practice it. They learn very quickly. The kingdom stuff is so natural to them. because I think children are more conscious of this, what's mine and what's others and how they're being invaded and all that sort of thing. We kind of get used to it as adults and we don't think much about it. There's a great deal of literature on it. And actually, if you have access to it, I just go out on Google and put my questions there. You'll get a bunch of junk, but you'll get some good things. Because this is being done. I have a question here. I wasn't here Thursday so I didn't hear Dallas talk about honoring personhood. But Todd in your second values around mission you talk about creating communities of faith that honor mission. My question is where does accountability in the community or personal accountability come does it have a place there? How does that play in? there. What I always say, and I learned this from long years of supervising pastors and churches, is that accountability is a matter of the heart. It's not a matter, first or most importantly, of structures and systems of accountability. Because a good-hearted person will seek out and find accountability on her own or his own. And will actually joyfully give themselves to that. And you can see that just in the relationship between a coach and an athlete. Once someone wants to do something, they actually appreciate help or accountability or being told that they're wrong. Because it's useful to them. It helps them achieve the dream that they have. So think of a young black girl growing up in Compton, Serena or Venus Williams, and say they're having a hard time returning a certain serve, and the coach comes to them and holds them accountable for that. You're failing to return that serve most of the time. Serena says, I know, I'm trying my hardest. I'm watching the ball. And so the coach then asks them a question that elicits more accountability from her when he says, Serena, next time that serve comes, I want you to tell me which way the ball is spinning as it crosses the net. Now, what do you suppose that evokes in a young girl? The capacity to actually watch the ball closer than she ever has. Because, you know, tennis balls have not seems like a baseball, but they've got how they're glued together or something, and if you watch closely, those of you who play tennis know I'm right, Or you could say, try to spot the logo. I used to do that in racquetball. You know, I used to try to spot the logo on the ball. And what it does is that kind of good coaching or what we would call spiritual direction actually evokes the accountability that is already in a good person's heart. On the contrast, I tried everything in the world I knew to get pastors to be good. Now, I didn't go quite as far as the IRS tax code. but the IRS tax code is the example on the other end of no matter how hard you try to close loopholes bad parted people are going to frustrate the best systems of accountability so what I caution against is trying to create systems of accountabilities in groups because people will go too far with that and end up squashing creativity and risk and the law of love. What I would rather see people do is create a community that exists in the law of love and in the law of love and in the law of mutually trying to help each other in this process of hearing call and mission has implicit within it accountability. Sort of naturally. Now sometimes I guess you do have to spell little things out but I wouldn't put your trust in spelling those things out any more than the IRS can put its trust in the tax code because it's only good-hearted people who actually follow even a book of rules that thick. Do you want to say anything about that? Well, I think that's exactly right. If you're thinking in terms of the VIM pattern, accountability is normally thought of under the M as a means. And if you don't have the vision and the intention, it won't do much good. Often you do have friends who commit themselves to one another, to hold one another accountable, but normally that just means what you're talking about. I mean, natural, open, loving relationships where there's honest talk and ways of being together, and then it sort of takes care of itself. So maybe what you're, I think what's often underneath this question when I'm asked it is really actually what do we do with people who refuse to be accountable? And I would just say that the issue there then actually isn't their failure to be accountable. It's something prior to that. It's something along the, what we've been talking about in Journey Inward or spiritual transformation into Christlikeness. If we get to those more probably fundamental character issues, then they could more easily enter into a relationship or a community of love in which accountability is very natural and easy. I think this is your question. Oh. Well, you're a bad man. it says what is the scriptural basis for eternal punishment why does it why does it say in Colossians 1 20 to reconcile all things that he will reconcile all things to himself. Well, I don't think I have anything particularly new to say today. I mean, I would, you all saw the diagram that I've drawn trying to illustrate this, that once one determines in their heart to, in my words, to follow on what Dallas was saying earlier, and sets a trajectory of their life that's apart from God's will, plan, story, and agenda, apart from reality. Remember the big arrow that's going to hit that bullseye of telos and the renewed heavens and earth and our place in it. Okay, once we determine that we are not going to align ourselves with that reality and we're going to live in an alternative story. Remember I said that that gets in the end to its own telos, its own end. And we talked about Gehenna and we talked about it as sort of the ultimate wasted human life. The way Lewis sees that, and I've never found anything personally that I could improve on with that, is Lewis sees it in the afterlife, that trajectory that we've set in this life. And that's what Dallas was saying earlier. The reason this life is important is that it sets a trajectory of our life. And so the way Lewis sees this is that, you know, there's only two kinds of people, those who say yes to God and align themselves with his reality and those to whom in the end God says yes to them. Like, okay, go ahead, as Dallas was saying yesterday. So Lewis sees this in the great divorce, you know, is that not only do people get farther and farther and farther away from God, but they get farther and farther and farther away from each other and end up living eternally apart from God. Now, if you put it the other way around, and think about it in terms of salvation, you basically have three sort of historical theological choices. One is inclusivist, one is exclusivist, and the other is universalism. So there are serious Christian thinkers who think that they can make a biblical case for universalism. I've never been able to quite see it on the grounds in which it's normally put forward. There are others who, you know, see an exclusivist point of view, a kind of double election point of view. I've never been able to go quite there, though I can see some of the points they make. I tend to, I guess, if I had to be pigeonholed, would be in the inclusivist position, which would say that there are a lot of people going to be in heaven who have no idea why, in the sense that we as American Christians have, you know, talked about this to death. So there'll be a lot of people there, but they will only be there because of Jesus and his work, whether they know it or not in the way that we know it in, you know, fine points of theology. Well, I think that's great. You should have asked a philosopher that question. That's a great answer. Not a humble minister. The question is about scriptural basis for eternal punishment. It's just the statements that are made in the Scripture about this by Jesus and by others. Now, the interpretation question, it's absolutely true that there are many people who are capable of producing interpretations that diminish that. Usually, I think it is because they just feel somehow God is so good, He could not let that happen. And I suppose if you're going to hold to eternal punishment, you have to say God is so good He could not let it happen. And that would mean something like He so respects the will of the individual that He will not manipulate it, and that a person whose will stands against Him, He allows that to stand. And there are many interesting metaphors that are used in the scriptures. Outer darkness, for example, is an interesting one. You know, they say if the universe keeps on doing what it's doing, pretty soon you won't be able to see any stars. Of course, you won't be around then, but… well, you will be around, you'll not be looking for stars. But the expansion of the universe pulls everything further and further apart. On a natural scale, that would mean eventually everything would be so far apart that it could not be related to other things. And if a person is really set on being God, they're going to need that much distance. You know? Nice. See why I hang around with him? All right, I think we have time for one, maybe two more, but I can't see, so. I have a question. It's me? Okay. Sorry. Okay. How do you bring the gospel effectively to people that have been really wounded by the church, so they don't want, you know, anything to do with Christianity? And also, how do you bring it to people that have grown up without any, you know, they've been told your truth is whatever you believe and they don't have the moral, you know, basis, like to know what's right and wrong. All right, I'll take the church part. You take the moral relativity part. Well, I've actually spent a lot of time the last five or six years working with people exactly like you talk about, who aren't even sure they can believe in God because they've had such horrible experiences in the church and kind of want nothing to do with it. And I didn't do it on purpose, but the last church I started a few years ago was actually started with dozens or scores of people like that. And I think, frankly, you have to place before them a positive alternative because simply talking about the past or trying to, as they would say, deconstruct their church experiences. The most they can ever get to, in my experience, is a point of, is the right word, inertia, where just like nothing's happening. You just sort of sit there and you kind of know what you don't want, but there's no positive alternative that's being constructed. You just, you sort of have to sit there and don't know what you're doing or where you're going or what to do about it. So what I've found is that you have to cast a vision for and embody a different reality than the one that they were rejecting. And that the human need for a social self, as Dallas teaches us, is so strong that once you can create any kind of a, even a small glimpse of a positive alternative, again, good-hearted people will begin to place their hope in that, and you can just begin to create a different kind of quality of community. I can remember a couple years ago sitting at a coffee shop with a young girl just like that. She had moved from Ohio to Southern California, and she sat there with the most sincere tears in the world telling me how she no longer believed in leadership, especially Christian or pastoral leadership, never wanted to be in a church again in which there was leadership, and wasn't even sure that she could believe in the church and wasn't sure that she, therefore, could believe in God. One of the most bright, sincere, lovely, you know, 23, 24-year-old people I've ever met. But she'd been coming to our community for a few weeks and asked to talk to me, and so I met her. And I just simply said to her, I said, well, you know, you're in a place here, not in which there's no leadership. I said, why do you want to have coffee with me? I said, because you instinctually know that I'm the leader in some functional sense of this group. And I said, what you've experienced here is not no leadership. You've experienced a different kind of leadership. And again, she just would dissolve in tears. So the only thing I've found is that you can't actually argue with people like that because their reality really is their reality in that sort of relativistic way you're talking about. But what you can do is invite them, help describe and invite them in to a positive alternative. Well, that's very good advice. And I think you were also asking about people who believe that good and bad are relative and so on. You won't be able to move them by clever intellectual devices because they did not come to that conclusion by intellectual means. That is a prejudice that people use in our culture. First of all, no one believes it. No one believes that good and bad are relative. They'll believe it for a moment. So you have to understand that if you're talking with them. They do not believe it. This is a game that people use. You know, it's like that corner down in the checkerboard where if you get in there and you just got one person, one thing left, and you can just move back and forth. Can't go anywhere except nobody can get you. I remember that when you're talking with someone who says that stuff about it all being relative, well, my good isn't your good, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. No one believes it. That is a protective device. And the only way you can help people like that is be with them and love them. You can pray for them. Sometimes you can ask questions that will help. Like Dr. Phil will say to people, how's that working for you? That's a good question. How's that working for you? In a loving way. You can be gentle and kind and be with people. And occasionally a question will come up that you can ask that would actually help them maybe get out of that. You have to sort of back off because, you know, if you get out of that in the game, you get jumped. And that's why you stay in the corner. So I think you just have to assume This is a needy person who is in a defensive mode, and that's why they're saying this, and I can tell you that there is no good argument for it. And so the things they will say to defend themselves are bogus, like, well, who's to say? Right? Or everybody disagrees, or those kinds of things. They're not true to begin with. Everyone doesn't disagree. There are a lot of things that people agree on as good. Most things, in fact. If it weren't for that, we wouldn't be able to live together and help one another and so on. So, I mean, it's a mode that people get into to protect themselves in the effete stage of American individualism. They want to say, I'm all right, Jack. don't bug me so yeah well down there in your little corner you're alright nobody gets you and you can say things like well don't impose your beliefs on me so all you can do is just be with people and watch for the time and they want to know something and of course depending on the case you may Maybe we'll get them to think about Jesus, for example. About why has Jesus been so influential? Get them to thinking about that and what He taught. And then they might have something that they could get a hold of and begin to move. All right. Thank you once again for hanging in and doing the hard mental work of listening. We've got a 15-minute break, and then Dallas will be back to help us more with what do we go and do now? Details. Details coming soon. Thank you.
