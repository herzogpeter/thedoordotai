Music My name is Evan I'm Jordan I'm Edine I'm Morgan. Dawn. And Steve. We're the Pukals, and we'll be reading the Advent scripture this week. Today's reading is from Luke 2, 1 through 14. Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth. This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria, and everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city. Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, in order to be registered along with Mary, who was engaged to him and was with child. While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth, and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in cloths and lied him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terribly frightened. But the angel said to them, Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which will be for all the people. For today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. This will be a sign for you. You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger. And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. That's the Pukal family. Thanks, you guys. You know, it's really hard to stand up here and look like you're enjoying it. Really grateful. Steve, by the way, Steve Pocall is one of our latest, well, he is our latest elder. And I was just confirmed, yeah, that's a really good thing. We're really grateful about that. Well, the text that Steve just read, Luke chapter 2, verses 1 to 14, is among all the Christmas narratives may be the best known because it's all there, you guys. the shepherds and the angels, with Mary and Joseph, and glory to God in the highest peace on earth, goodwill to men, all that stuff. But along with the text is a subtext in the text of kings and kingdoms and of what appears to be significant, consequential, and in control kinds of people, and what also appears to be as insignificant, inconsequential, and out-of-control kinds of people. It's all in the text. It's part of the subtext. And so one day, in Luke 2, verse 8, there were some shepherds in a field, watching their flock by night, which means it was dark, it was night, more insignificant and inconsequential you could not be than shepherds. They lived in a field. They stayed there all night. But the darkness that was part of their experience, their turn to light, says again in Luke 2, when the glory of the Lord shone round about, Luke 2, verse 9, a theme of Christmas. We hear it all the time, from darkness to light. That's what Christmas is about. It was night when the lights went on in that field with these shepherds. And they came on in the strangest of places. These lights, again, in a field with some shepherds. More insignificant and inconsequential. You could not be then shepherds in a field. They lived in a field. And then one day there was a baby born in a barn. To parents, young kids as all they were. Betrothed but not married. Alone and afraid. more insignificant and inconsequential, you could not be. So poor were they in a variety of ways, actually. They were poor, but they didn't have enough money or clout to make the kind of connections you might need to know how to make if you're going to provide for your family, I don't know, a room for your newborn child to be born who was born in a barn. If they were my kids, I'd be kind of disturbed, maybe a little. concerned. You want to get married. You really do. Really? You can't even do this. You're not ready for anything. You're not ready for life. But this will be a sign to you, said the angel. Again in Luke 2, verse 12, you'll find them. This is very significant stuff, but not on the surface, wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger. How coy? With smiling cows, no doubt, gathering around protectively and a couple of sheets and incandescent lighting, indirect lighting would actually be best. It's just perfect. Away in a manger, but it wasn't perfect. Not even close. It was a feeding trough into which he was born. That's how you'll know it's really him, ironically. He was born in a barn. More insignificant and inconsequential you could not be, but this little one made the angels sing. Luke 2.14. Glory to God in highest and on earth peace among men. So in the fields there were some shepherds and in a barn there was a baby and in Rome there was a king who was more significant, actually, and consequential than you could ever be, that you could ever imagine. For this king was great. His name was great. His kingdom was great. His glory was known to the world. Indeed, there once was a king. It's introduced again in this text, Luke 2, verse 1, who in his day was the most powerful man in all the world. His kingdom at the time extended north all the way to what we know now as England, and then south to Africa, east to Asia, having done what no other king before him in that time had ever done before because he was able to bring the entire world under the rule of one sovereign leader, the entire world under him. So in the day, in the moment that this story is being told, This king was quite literally the ruler of nations. He was the king of kings, the lord of lords, and of his kingdom there quite literally didn't appear to be any at all. His name was Augustus. He was one of the Caesars known as Caesar Augustus. At the height of his power he was worshipped as a god. Temples were built in his honor. Prayers and sacrifices were offered in his name. Songs were written about him, praise songs, like the songs we sing here to God and to Christ, but these were to Augustus, this august personality, this Caesar, the greatest of all Caesars. These choruses called him things like this, the Savior of Peace. He was called the Prince of Peace, divine King of Salvation, from whom all mankind has waited. May it last with unceasing, increasing splendor, rather, from age to age to age, both now and forevermore. Amen. It was under this Caesar, actually, and this is something we discovered both in our study of the rabbi and of the book of Colossians, that this phrase, Caesar is Lord, became popular, and this phrase as well, that salvation is found in no other name. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which you can be saved. And Caesar Augustus, so long before Peter, said those words of Jesus in Acts 4, verse 12. When speaking of Jesus, he said, neither is there salvation in any other name. For there is no other name under having given among men, whereby you must be saved. And Jesus, long before Peter, said that of Jesus. People were saying that of Caesar. But as we know, again, because of what we studied in the context of Jesus as a rabbi some years ago, And even the work we did in Colossians, what Caesar meant by being saved was allowed to live. Because his armies would go into villages and towns and cities and say, Caesar is Lord, and if you agreed you could live, you were saved. But if you didn't, you were either enslaved or annihilated. Sometimes nailed to a cross, which is precisely what happened to a large group of people, actually, who were coming to believe that Jesus, not Caesar, was Lord. So all of that is who Caesar is. But it's not just any Caesar. According to Luke chapter 2, this is Caesar Augustus, the greatest of all the Caesars, who one day got an idea. And it's this idea that brings him into our story. Luke 2, verse 1, the text that Steve just read, begins with these words. For it came about in those days that a decree went out from this very powerful, consequential, significant, in-control king named Caesar Augustus, that a census would be taken. And if he gives a decree that a census will be taken, a census will be taken. And a tax would be gathered as well from all the inhabited earth, because all the inhabited earth was actually his kingdom, which is why he wanted a census and a tax, because they would effectively accomplish for him two things. Number one, the census would reveal to him how vast his kingdom really was, how widely known his name really was. And if you're a kingmaker and a kingdom builder, that's something you want to know. How big is my kingdom? How well known is my name? Because it's all about my kingdom and my name. And the tax would kind of tie into that, because what the tax would do as a king builder, as a kingdom builder, would allow you to continue to provide the necessary resources to expand your kingdom even further. And so this king just speaks a word, just lifts a finger. Actually, he just has an idea. I don't know. Why don't we take a census? And because of that, the whole world, the entire inhabited earth begins to scramble. Each one in the whole world to his own village, It says in Luke 2, verse 3, including Joseph. Luke 2, verse 4. Look at the screen. Also Joseph. Along with everyone else who was going to their own village, Joseph went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, which is where Mary and Joseph lived, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem. And the reason he went there was because he was of the house and family of David, And he needed to register along with Mary, who was also engaged to him and was with child. N.T. Wright, the New Testament scholar reflecting on this scene, says it this way, that this man, this king, this ruler of the entirely then known world, simply lifts a finger and 1,500 miles away in an obscure little province, a poverty-stricken young couple, begins to undertake a hazardous journey, all on the whim of a king. So in the moment, as you're just looking at the text, we look at it 2,000 years later and look at it quite different. But in the moment, it's pretty clear who's significant and who isn't, who's consequential and who isn't, who's in control and who isn't. But as you know, because we look at this story from a significantly different lens than those who were originally there, it's precisely here that the story gets interesting because these kingdoms are beginning to collide. Verse 6 is where you see it begin to happen because it came about that while they, that is Mary and Joseph, were there in Bethlehem, that the days were completed for Mary to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. He was born in a barn in an obscure little town that Caesar has never heard of, more insignificant and inconsequential. It could not be, and I'm talking now of Bethlehem. It couldn't be more insignificant, inconsequential. But this town that Caesar probably had never even heard of just happens to be mentioned. And this is, again, where the stories begin to collide in an ancient Hebrew prophecy about the coming of a king, Micah 5, verse 2. It's ironic, even Micah. I mean, yeah, I'm reading that all the time. It's a pretty obscure book of the Bible, actually. Micah 5, verse 2 says this, For out of you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too little, in other words, too insignificant, inconsequential to be even named among the clans of Judah, from you, believe it or not, shall come forth the one who is to rule Israel, and he, verse 4, will stand and feed his flock in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of his God, and he shall be great to the ends of the earth. But this is where, again, these two stories, these two kingdoms begin to collide. Because Caesar, whose kingdom is vast, whose name is great, whose glory is obvious, just speaks a word. He just has an idea. He lifts a finger, as it were, and because he does, a young kid named Joseph and a young girl named Mary begin a journey and a little baby named Jesus is born in a town that no one's heard of called Bethlehem instead of being born in Nazareth, which is where Jesus would have been born if Augustus Caesar hadn't spoken a word, hadn't had an idea, hadn't lifted a finger. But all of that raises this question and it's a question that no one in the moment was asking. No one was asking the question I'm about to ask when these scenes were actually unfolding because it's so obvious in the moment that Caesar Augustus is in control, that Caesar Augustus is the significant one, the consequential one, but the question nonetheless is this, as this story unfolds, as these kingdoms begin to collide, what king is really making the moves here? And which kingdom is really being advanced here and whose will is really being done here, whose power is really on display here, and whose glory is really being revealed here in Luke chapter 2. Because as it turns out, the story of Christmas that we've actually read since we were little kids, many of us, from Luke chapter 2, is among other things the story of two kingdoms. It's not just shepherds and sheep and angels singing and Mary and Martha and cute little scenes. There's something else going on here. It's a story of two kingdoms, and we can see them historically played out in this text if we look closely enough, because this text gives us a picture of, among other things, two kingdoms and two kings and two cities. One of them, Rome, whose king is Caesar. And whether you're speaking in metaphor of Rome and all the Romes of the world or a king like Augustus Caesar, those kind of kingdoms could impossibly seem to be, in the moment where we actually live in our actual lives right now, more significant, more consequential, more in control. And the truth is, though this is an ancient story, These themes play out over and over and over again because we see these kind of kings and these kind of kingdoms all around us. As people, even today, it's just never been any different, like Caesar or Augustus, are engaged in what sometimes looks like a mad scramble to promote their name, to advance their kingdom, to force their will to reveal their glory. And sometimes these attempts to advance their own kingdom and reveal their own glory and make known their own name, sometimes those attempts are easy to spot because they're big and bold and obvious, involving nations and wars, so they're the kind of things you read about in the paper. Oh my goodness, it's just horrible that people act like this, we think. But sometimes these attempts to build our own kingdom, advance our own name, make known our own glory, gets played out in small, subtle, and petty ways involving power struggles at work or at church or at home or at family gatherings that we call Christmas. But whatever the case, whether you're dealing with the cosmic kinds of things, the global kinds of issues involving nations and wars, or just the kind of stuff that happens in your own house and mine, it's not all that complicated, actually, at the end of the day, because it's usually about my kingdom and my power and my glory and my name and my will and my way. And then there's Bethlehem, which speaks to and symbolizes an entirely different kind of kingdom, an entirely different kind of way with an entirely different kind of king. See, Caesar Augustus believed that his throne in Rome was as secure, significant, consequential, and in control as any throne could be. And I suppose that from a human physical standpoint, he was right. But he was wrong. A fact that can best be illustrated with, I think, a child story. It's actually one of my favorites about Yertle the turtle. Thank you, Dr. Seuss, for this illustration, who had a little pond. Many of you know the story. I know there's kids in here today, so I'm doing this for you. Yertle the turtle had a little pond where there were lots of little turtles ruled by one king turtle, Yertle, whose kingdom was massive to him. As far as his eyes could see, it was all that he could see. So one day he thought, I wonder what's beyond what I can see. I'm king, he said, of all I see, but I don't see enough. That's the trouble with me. Let's meet Yertle on the screen. Here he is, good-looking guy. If I could sit high, how much greater I'd be. What a king! I'd be ruler of all I could see. So Yertle the Turtle King lifted his hand, and Yertle the Turtle King gave a command. He ordered nine turtles to swim to his stone, and using these turtles, he built a new throne. Built on other turtles, by the way. Turtles, more turtles, he bellowed and braved, and turtles weighed down in the pond were afraid. They trembled, they shook, but they came, they obeyed. I'm Yertle the turtle, O marvelous me, for I am the ruler of all that I see. So his throne was as secure, significant, consequential, and in control as a throne could be. till the turtle on the bottom did a plain little thing. Any of the kids know what he did? He burped. Which I find fascinating. You know, getting past the junior high humor that I find fascinating. And still laugh at. The burp. He burped. It's a plain little thing. He burped. Because a burp, a burp symbolically to me, I'm probably reading too much into this child's story. What it means is life happened. You burp. life happens. But the burp that he burps shook the throne of the king. So today the great yurtle, that marvelous he is the king of the mud because that's all he can see now. A child's story. That's all it is. But the truth is this. Every single one of us have a little bit of yurtle in us and it doesn't take a very big pond for him to show up. I find it very embarrassing when he shows up in my house once every 10 years or so. It kind of works like this. We go to work and I just realize I'm your little turtle and it's my kingdom there. And so because work is my kingdom, It's my little kingdom. It just doesn't get any better than when it's my project being worked on, than when it's my idea being discussed. And people are doing what I want them to do the way I want them to do it. When people are doing what I want them to do the way I want them to do it, what does it mean? It means I'm in control. I'm Yertle the turtle that marvels me because I am the king of all I can see. It's my little kingdom. So some of you, go to your kid's room. And that's your little kingdom. And it doesn't get any better. It just doesn't get any better than when the beds are made and the clothes are picked up, their chores are done, and when you say jump, they say, how high? What does it mean when you say to your kids jump and they say, how high? It means you're in control. You're Yertle the Turtle. Oh, marvelous me. Because I'm the king of all that I see. It's your little kingdom. When I come home at the end of the day, again, it's my little kingdom. And it just doesn't get any better than when my wife greets me with a smile and a kiss. My slippers are by the recliner. The paper is folded and ready to read. The dinner is in the oven and ready to eat. But what does it mean? It means I'm in the wrong house. It means this is not my pond. Somebody else's kingdom. beloved the truth for all of us is this we all have a kingdom problem every single one of us sometimes it's big and bold and obvious and we get real indignant about nations and wars but sometimes it's small and subtle and petty involving power struggles at work, at church in our own homes, at family gatherings we call Christmas and while we like to make it real complicated and hard to get to. In many cases, it's not complicated at all because usually it's about my kingdom and my power and my name and my will and my way. And some of us actually have gotten really good at stacking up the stones of our throne just a little bit higher and a little bit higher till somebody or something burps. It's called life. life just happens and all of a sudden the throne is shaken and sometimes it's shaken in this life and sometimes it's shaken in a way that it brings you to the next life and on that day all of us discover something that we could have known before but didn't what we discover is what kingdom is really in control and who it is that lifts a finger and who it is that speaks a word and who it is that is the king. And he isn't in Rome. And his name isn't Augustus or Dave. Now, kind of getting back to Luke and reeling some of these things in, it's fascinating to me that according to Luke's gospel, not just here in Luke chapter 2, but later on in the gospel, Jesus' life actually was ended in some ways the same way it began. in this respect, by a decree from Caesar. Now, it wasn't from Caesar personally. Indeed, it was actually from one of his subservients or some of his subservients. But the crucifixion of Christ, his execution, as it were, was done in Caesar's name by Caesar's soldiers protecting Caesar's interests, which clearly were his kingdom, his power, his name, his glory. And so it is that from a human perspective, it looks like this, that Caesar determined by way of decree where Jesus was born, Bethlehem. And Caesar determined by way of decree where Jesus would die on a hill outside Jerusalem. But at the end of the day, if you understand the subtext of the story and what the story really speaks to, it wasn't really Caesar at all. It was never really Caesar because another king chose Bethlehem and another king chose a hill outside Jerusalem. Indeed, according to Philippians 2, the whole thing went down like this. That Jesus, being in very nature God, regarded equality with God as thing not to be grasped, but emptied himself to be born in the likeness of men. He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on the cross. death. But, this is what I love about this story, when you're telling the story of this kingdom, every other kingdom is going to have a different end. But when you're telling the story of this kingdom, the death of the king is not the end of the story. Philippians 2 verse 9 says this, that having been obedient even to the point of death, in other words, having not built his throne on the back of everyone else, on the back of other turtles, if you will, laying down their lives for him. He laid down his life for them. Because he did that, Philippians 2, 9, God exalted him to the highest place. And he gave to him the name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow of those who are in heaven and on the earth and under the earth, and that every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father. And while that isn't true of everyone today, in other words, not every knee is bowing today, one day God will speak the word. God will lift his finger, as it were, and time will be no more, and every knee will bow. Indeed, all of humanity will bow from the beginning to the end. People who we know about and read about today, who sit on thrones today, whatever their career or beliefs right now are today, followers of Jesus or not, will bow. Indeed, knees that didn't do much bending in this lifetime will bend that day. Indeed, on that day, bringing it back to Luke, Caesar Augustus will actually wonder how he could have ever thought that his kingdom was the kingdom of which there would be no end, And he will bow. And King Herod, who was another major player in the context of that first Christmas event, who killed thousands of babies in his attempt to kill the rival King Jesus, will discover in that day that death was actually never really much of a match for the one who really is the king. And Herod will bow and punch his pilot, who really didn't want to do anything wrong, But he was so busy trying to protect his own little kingdom that he really didn't have much interest in doing what was right either. And so he will discover that the day does finally come, eventually, that you can't wash your hands and look away. And he will bend the knee as well. Some people who went through their whole lives being bowed to will bow. Some knees, as you can expect, would bow under duress. They will bow grudgingly, resentfully. They will bow stiffly, while others will bow joyfully, quickly, gladly, easily, because they've been bending their knee to this King Jesus their whole lives. People like Billy Graham, Mother Teresa, will bow that way. And so will people like Moses and Abraham, Esther and Ruth, Peter and Paul, Mary and Martha, and so will you and so will I. And we will say and we will sing what we've been saying and singing all along, that He, Jesus, is the image of the invisible God. Remember Colossians chapter 1, the firstborn of all creation, for by Him all things were created both in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, and all things have been created by Him and for Him and in Him. All things hold together, for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we can be saved. For God has given to him the name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father. And all of that is why the angels sang that day. Back to Luke chapter 2, verse 14. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased. And the reason they sang was because they could see what in the moment was hard to see. That first Christmas morning that unto us is born a king, but he's not just a king. He is a king who is a savior, Luke 2, verse 11, and he is Christ the Lord. So now, with that as the context, maybe you can hear the greeting you have been hearing and will be hearing and extending to friends all the way through Christmas with that as the context hear now the greeting Merry Christmas Merry Christmas there's your joy there's your peace Thank you.
