Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, the first chapter, the 15th verse in our continuing study in the book of Ephesians. Ephesians chapter 1, starting in verse 15. Let's just begin with prayer. Lord Jesus, as we break open your word once again, we have to acknowledge the fact that the human mind is not always capable of grasping all the truth there is to grasp. And Father, this morning as we come to your word that is designed to change and move us, we pray that your spirit would give us understanding. In your name, amen. in the 15th verse Paul has come to a place where he has just completed delineating the magnificent promises the magnificent plan of God concerning us how before the foundation of the world God chose us in him that we would be holy and blameless before him nothing to do with us our position before God. He called us to adoption as sons through Christ himself. He redeemed us. He forgave us. He lavished upon us all of his grace. He gave us an inheritance. He sealed us in him. And now he's done with all of that. And he does something very strange in the 15th verse. He backs off. He's kind of done with his sermon there to verse 14. And he says, for this reason, for what reason for all of the for because of all the promises i just gave you having heard of the faith in the lord jesus christ which exists among you and your love for all the saints i am praying for you he says in that 16th verse i am praying for you for what that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him. It's almost as if when we move into this particular section, these next few verses, that he's not even talking to the Ephesians anymore because he's doing something else. He's praying. He's praying. He's also acknowledging the fact that it is not enough for him to just preach. He's backing off here as the preacher. He's told them the truth and now he's praying that they'll understand it. You got that? It's important that you do. He's told them the truth. He's told them the plan. Now he's backing off and praying that they'll understand it. What Paul is acknowledging here is just a couple of things. First of all, he's realizing that it doesn't do any good for people just to hear the truth. It doesn't do any good just to hear the truth. They need to understand it. And if they don't understand it, it's just fruitless. He's also acknowledging something else, that his teaching can only go so far. He can talk and talk and talk. He could have spent the rest of this letter talking about this wonderful plan. But somewhere along the line, he has got to back off and call upon the Holy Spirit of God to enlighten. That's what he's doing. These promises are too deep for you to understand just with the workings of your physical mind. But what is being prayed for is understanding. Paul does this and follows this model all the way through Ephesians. In chapter 1, right here, Paul describes the position of the believer in Christ. Then he prays that they'll understand it. In chapter 2, Paul is going to describe again the position of the believer in Christ. And then in chapter 3, he's going to pray that they understand it. And after he's done that a couple of times, finally, then we come to chapter 4 where he says, Okay, now that you've got it, now that you understand it, here's how to live it. So why is that a big deal? What's the point? The point is simply this, that you cannot live what you do not understand. You cannot live what you do not understand. We can't function on principles that we don't know, okay? We do not understand our position in Christ. We are not in any way ready to talk about or exhort you to live it, to talk about the practice. That's getting the cart before the horse and he's acknowledging that right now. The problem is this, however, in most churches, preachers will stand up and tell the congregation what to do. I dare say that most Christians live under that kind of thing. I kind of grew up under that to a degree. Just standing in the pulpit and exhorting people what to do, but never really taking the time to first teach them their position in Christ. And the result of that is you've got a lot of frustrated people. You've got a lot of people going up and down and on roller coasters all their lives because they're exhorted, do it, do it do it and i go okay okay okay but i don't really understand the the function they the process by which i get to that practice i cannot just stand in this pulpit and exhort you to live a christian life to do what is right to live for god to get dedicated and consecrated and irrigated and on and on and on and on it becomes kind of a process whereby we stand in our pulpits and sunday morning and Sunday evening becomes that place where we just go and get really pumped up, you know. And that's what we want. Just come and pump me up, get me all fired up. I'm going to get my spiritual fix on Sunday morning and emotionally be ready to go out and fight the battle. It's very much, it turns into very much like a half-time pep talk. Now, I can relate to this a little bit because I'm already an emotional person and I respond very well to emotional pulls. I'm really a sucker when somebody starts working with my emotions. I think some of us are too. It's incredible. When I was in high school, we had a coach who couldn't coach. He didn't know anything about football, but he was really getting me going. I'd be so jacked up it was unbelievable when I was leaving the locker room. And he would just kind of talk about my mother and my father and the whole heritage and responsibility and all of these wonderful apple pie, the whole thing. And I would just go, oh, I'm going to die. I don't care. Problem was. It was great. I loved it. And the problem was, I'd walk out of that locker room door all jacked up, ready to go, and then we'd start playing football then. That was a problem, you see, because I didn't know how. And I would get smacked in the face, and I'd go, what are you saying about apple pie? Anyway, you know. A lot of churches kind of try to jack you up and try to move you in that kind of way. And I feel, because I'm an emotional person, I could kind of fall into that a little bit. Come, I enjoy sermons that are like that. I enjoy delivering sermons that are just moved. I want to get your hearts. I want you to go. But Paul is acknowledging right here that before we talk about your response, you need to understand. And if you don't, your response is never going to be adequate. It's never going to be appropriate. You're going to be on a roller coaster all your life. A lot of churches not taking the time to explain our position as believers, wanting to have the godly life, will have to resort to pushing guilt. Okay? They will. They're going to have to resort to pushing guilt. They're going to take that angle. Do it, do it, do it, do it. And I go, okay, okay, I'll try. They'll intimidate, create a lot of peer pressure, develop within their little culture a lot of behavioral quirks which will indicate to all of us whether you're a Christian or whether you aren't. A lot of pressure, a lot of pressure. We're all trying to live up to it. just produces a lot of frustration, a lot of even anger underneath, a lot of tension, very little freedom. You need to understand this is his prayer. You see, the problem with that whole kind of approach, not explaining the position first of the believer in Christ, again, is that we cannot live or we don't understand. And when we try to bypass what we're talking about this morning, When we try to bypass this principle, we are asking for trouble because we are bypassing the real motive for spiritual living, for Christian living. You see, the real guts of it, the real foundation from which a godly life flows is not a lot of pushing guilt. It's not a lot of peer pressure. It's not a lot of manipulating and just trying to make everybody feel uncomfortable so we conform. the real foundation from which a godly life flows is understanding who I am in Christ. You are adopted as a son. You have been chosen before the foundation of the world so that you could stand before him holy and blameless. That's who you are. That's your position in Christ. You are forgiven of your sin. You are sealed in him. You are redeemed through his blood you have an inheritance that's secure and it's everlasting it will never fade away now when i understand that now i'm ready for an exhortation now i'm ready for an exhortation because after i know who i am i'm ready to respond to him with everything i have you couldn't tell me anything i wouldn't do you couldn't tell me anything that the holy spirit of god wouldn't be already working in my life to do so paul prays that they would understand that they that they are complete in him, that they would know that they are complete in Christ. Then the exhortation comes. There's a trend in the evangelical community today that concerns me. I'm sure at some level some of us have gotten involved in it and the problem with it is it sounds very good and it sounds very right. Let me just get right to the point. I call it this, the quest for something more. The quest for something more. And it implies very subtly, but it's very much there that being in Christ is not going to give you all you need to get. Okay? I want you to hang with me here. That being in Christ, the quest for something more, implies very definitely that being in Christ does not give you all there is to get. There's something more. There's something more. There's something you're lacking. There's something you've got to get. You don't have it all. I know of a young girl in my former church who was constantly in the process of striving and striving and striving for something more. And she would say things like this, oh, Pastor Dave, I just want to get more of Christ. And I want to get more of God. And I want to get more of the Holy Spirit. And I just want to get more power. And I would think, doesn't that sound admirable? But what could possibly be wrong with that? Problem is, there's something very wrong with that. While there are dimensions of our Christian life that we want more of, yes. We're going to talk tonight about we want to be more obedient. We want to be more submissive. We want to be more loving. We want to be more open and honest and all of those things. Those are things we want more of. But you're never going to get more of Christ than you already have. And while that sounds very admirable, while that sounds very... And I never doubted her zeal or her love. And that's why there was a tremendous relationship between us. But I had to tell her that while her heart was very open, and I appreciated that, and she was a very loving person, she was sadly lacking in understanding her position in Christ. There were some things she needed to know. Let me ask you something. Let me ask you something. Hang on. When you were saved, when you met Jesus Christ as your Savior, And after we have just delineated all of these promises of God toward us, was it complete or is there something more you need to have? Was it complete or wasn't it? Do I need more of God? Do I need more of Christ? Do I need more of the Holy Spirit? Do I need more power? For part of that answer, we could go to 2 Peter 1, 3, where he says this, According to his divine power, he has already given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness. Ladies and gentlemen, the biblical view of salvation is this, that salvation grants the believer everything he needs. You are complete in Christ. Colossians Church, let's use another example, the Colossians Church. Colossians chapter 2, in fact, I want you to turn there. it's right after Philippians, Galatians Ephesians, Philippians Colossians Colossians chapter 2 the Colossian church like many early churches were exposed to various heresies and various problems and these heresies were kind of creeping into the churches and they were having to deal with them and Paul was writing to this church about some heresies that had begun to influence them. And the prevalent heresy of that day said this, Jesus Christ alone is not enough. You gotta have something more. Does that sound familiar? You know what? The problem that we're talking about this morning is nothing new, is it? It's nothing new at all. This has been going on for years and years and years. The early church had to deal with it. And the heresy again restated that Christ is not enough. You gotta have something more. Now get this. Get this. This is where it rings in my heart. The something more is what makes you spiritual. Got that? I've been exposed to this deeply. Jesus Christ, oh sure. Faith in the Lord, oh yes. Salvation, oh yes. But see, something more makes you spiritual. Kind of sets you up above. This is going to be a two-part sermon, by the way, Because I believe that at the core of that whole philosophy is the problem with pride. And we're going to be dealing, next week is communion, and a week after that, we're going to be dealing with this again. But the something more makes you spiritual. Let's look. Colossians 2, verse 8. The first problem, the first heresy that comes along and they're dealing with is this, that it's Christ plus philosophy. It's Christ plus philosophy. It's not enough Christ alone isn't enough. It's Christ plus human reason. It's Christ plus human logic. Okay? I don't know exactly where to put this, but I would just, in order to give us a thing to look at and stick it on a hook, more or less, for us to connect with, would be the liberal church today. The church that is moving away from the deity of Christ and the view of Scripture that would indicate that it's, the word that we need is going to affect our lives. The liberal church that would have the stained glass window and the cross in the back and all of the things, But basically, the message is in the background. And we just kind of talk about waving to neighbors and feeding the birds and all those kinds of things. And man's wisdom is really the measure of everything we need to know. So it's Christ, but if you really, don't be naive, you know. If you really want to be spiritual, you've got to be philosophical and deep like us. And so we kind of elevate ourselves. It wasn't, and Paul said about that, verse 8, see to it that no one takes you captive. through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world. That is the elements of human religion. Human religion that is just the measure of your own mind, rather than according to Christ. It's Christ plus philosophy. It's Christ plus legalism. Verse 16 deals with this. It's Christ plus some ritual that we perform. It's Christ plus some duty that we constantly do. It's Christ plus we have set up in our church, a little structure whereby we judge everybody by their performance, you'll see. And if you measure up, then you're spiritual. It's Christ plus something more. Verse 16. As if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as do not handle, do not taste, do not touch, don't do this, don't do that, don't do this, don't do that, which all refer to things destined to perish with the using in accordance to the commandments of teachings of men, the teachings of men. It's Christ plus philosophy. It's Christ plus legalism. It's Christ plus a mystical experience. It's Christ plus asceticism. The point is this. There has been in the past and there always will be those who wish to say that having Jesus is not enough. Paul says, don't you dare let people mess with your mind that way. Because again, in Colossians 2, chapter 9, we see the whole key. He says this. in him all the fullness of deity dwells in a bodily form what he's establishing there is the fullness of christ that there is nothing more in him that we could ever have and verse 10 in him what's the result of being in him you have been made complete there's nothing more to get folks you've been made complete in him you don't need any more what we need what we need is by faith to use what he's already given us what we need is to by faith begin to use the things he's already promised us you need to understand who you are then you need to begin to under to use the resources that he's given and we will admit the fact that many many many christians are having all of these resources and the power that's available to them lying dormant but you're You're never going to get any more than you already have. Christ has given them to you. You are complete in him. You're never going to get any more. You need to learn to use them. You know, when you were saved, it wasn't like a polywog. You ever get polywogs when you're a little kid? The neatest thing was that they would grow an arm, a leg. They'd develop into something totally different. That's not what happens to us when we get to know Christ as our Savior. It's like a physical birth. You're complete when you're a baby. What a funny thing it would be if Bonnie would call me on Thursday and I'd be studying and she'd go, Dave, I got good news. Caleb, he just grew in here. It's wonderful. No, no, no, no. It doesn't work like that. He, that little baby of ours, is complete. He's got arms. He's got legs. He's got a brain and all of the things that he needs. He's got it. What that little boy needs is to mature. He needs to grow. He needs to begin to learn that what that right arm is used for is the forearm shiver. That's what it's used for. That's he needs to learn to use the resources, but he's already got it. They're all his, and he needs to learn to use what he's already got. He's not going to go trying to grow an arm out of here because he thinks he needs it. I'd have to tell him, Caleb, you're really stupid. You don't need that. You've already got everything you need. God made you that way. Begin to learn to use what you've got. Growth is where we exhort, but I need to understand what I have first. see it's not a question of finding more it's a question of using what we have and so paul and ephesians 1 prays that they would understand all the riches they have in christ because if they don't know what they have they're going to be on a roller coaster all their lives trying like crazy to get something more i want you to look real quickly we're going to go fast at three things that he wanted them to understand three things that he wanted them to grasp first the greatness of his plan, the greatness of his power, and third, the greatness of his person. The greatness of his plan, verse 18, I pray that the eyes have your heart may be enlightened so that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what are the riches of his glory, of the inheritance in the saints. The whole plan, folks, is right here in that 18th verse. The whole plan of God concerning us, I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that ye may know what? What is the hope of his calling what is the hope of his call his call was before the foundation of the world that we would be holy and blameless before him adopted as sons forgiven of sin blah blah blah blah blah okay that's the hope of his call the the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints i pray that you will understand that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened to that i want you to look at a little phrase it's very interesting and we need to understand it because there can be some confusion in this particular verse. I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened. The eyes of your heart. Now I want you to just focus in on this word heart. The Greek word there is kardios. For most of us, we get our word cardiac or heart. Okay? For most of us, the heart refers to what? The emotions. Right? Our culture has so designated the heart to be the center of our emotions, our feelings. Love songs are all geared at the heart. On Valentine's Day, we send little hearts because it's conveying some sort of feeling that I have for someone. So the heart is the core of my feeling. That's where I feel emotions. The problem is, is that is not the way it was for the ancients. The Jews looked at it far differently. For them, the core of their feeling was not in the heart but in the bowel okay disgusting isn't it yes but that's that's where they felt things that's where they felt things the great word is splenka or if i said that right jeff did i say that i think it's okay the bowels the guts that's where they felt things song of solomon as these two lovers would see each other they looked at each other and they would say my bowels are moved within me now that meant something to them to me that just seems to be kind of messy I don't know, I don't like that you know I don't say to my wife, Bonnie I just love you with all my bowels it doesn't somehow connect with what I really want to say but that's where they felt. That's the foundation of their feelings. Psalm 22. Christ was dying on the cross and they were looking forward to this time when it would happen. And the words there are that his bowels were suffering agony. His feelings were being ripped apart. In Lamentations 2.11, Jeremiah is crying over the destruction of his people and it says that he hurt in his inward organs. Specifically, it says that his liver was distressed. That's where they felt. That's where they felt things. In the bowel, in the gut. We have a gut feeling. The heart for them meant understanding. The heart for them meant a thinking organ. Okay? It's very important that we make this distinction. And the reason is that he is not appealing to their emotion here. He is appealing to their thinking first. It's very important that we grasp this. The heart is the thinking organ, the understanding. As a man thinketh in his what? In his heart, so is he. As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. The heart is the thinking, the will, the understanding. So what's the big deal about that? The big deal is simply this, that Paul is affirming the fact that at the foundation of Christianity, we do not appeal to the emotions, we appeal first to the understanding. Because if your understanding isn't right, if your understanding isn't complete, if you really don't know what is the hope of your calling, you're going to be governed by your emotions. And I'm going to give you a warning right here that if you're governed by your emotions, your emotions are going to run amok into any kind of different thing you want to feel. It's a terrible danger. So he prays first that they would understand because when you understand, then you can respond with everything you have and everything you feel. But you'll do it appropriately. You'll do it adequately. you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll, it'll be full. It'll be full. Why am I making such a big deal out of this? I think this is serious, and I'll tell you why. Because almost any cult I can think of right now on the face of the earth, you may be able to indicate another one that I don't know about, but almost any cult that I can think of. I did a study on the cult, and there are several characteristics of any cult, but one of them is this, that basically what they appeal to is the emotion first. They appeal to the emotions. They don't appeal to understanding. In fact, if you're going to get into this thing, this teaching that they're giving you, basically you kind of have to turn off your brain. That's one of the criteria. They offer you what? They offer you an experience. Turn off the understanding. That's not involved here. Go to O'Hare Airport where I used to live. Glad I'm gone from that place. It's a zoo. But you walk through that place and you can't help but be accosted by someone who is just absolutely convinced they're offering you an experience. And they're absolutely convinced that all you have to do is chant this little mantra, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, over and over and over again. And you'll experience the very presence of God. But I'm a Christian. Well, that's okay. You do this thing within the context of Christianity. you can just chant this thing and you'll really get this experience of God God consciousness and I would say well this is crazy I'd just go on and on just chanting a chant will give me an experience of God's presence in my life and he said well yeah but you do it all day long and I thought yeah I tell you I could say just about anything if I did it all day long I'd probably get something working in my brain that was weird but basically what they're doing is appealing to the emotion they're offering what? They're offering an experience first. The whole thing is set up on that whole thing. Paul says, I pray that first you would understand that you were chosen, that you were adopted as a son, that you were forgiven, that you were redeemed, that you have inheritance. It's all yours. It's secure. Because when you know that, when you really understand that, you're not going to have this impulse to spruce it up. Because when you understand what you have and who you are, there's no longer going to be the impulse to look for something more because you'll understand you have it all. You won't feel like sprucing it up with philosophy, Christ plus Christ is enough. You won't feel like sprucing it up with Christ plus legalism. Christ is enough. And he is also sufficient to lead me into a lifestyle that is going to be godly. I don't have to worry about that. If I really don't know my position, if people aren't really just drenched in the fact that they're forgiven and in Christ, well then maybe the wise thing to do would be, you know, get a little structure of legalism so we could somehow control people's behavior. The Holy Spirit controls our behavior. But you're not going to know that if you don't know your position in Christ. If you're not taught. If you don't have understanding. You see, he prays that they'll have understanding. And when they have the understanding, then they will see that Jesus is enough. What more could there possibly be? What more could there possibly be? He prays that they will understand his plan, verse 18. He prays that they will understand his power, verse 19. What is the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe? The first thing I want to indicate there is that it's his power toward us who believe and have a vision. No. It's toward us who believe and follow legalistic law. No. It's the power of God toward us who believe, who are in Christ. That's all you need. Interesting, in this 19th verse, there's four Greek words there, and all of them, if you wanted to, you could translate them power. The first one is obvious. It's power. Dunamis is the word. The power toward us who believe. These are in accordance to the working or the energy, the working of the strength. That's another word that could be translated power of his might. That's another word that could be translated power. And we could possibly read it this way. I want you to understand what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward you who believe, who are in Christ. These are in accordance with the power of the power of his power. You get the idea that he wants us to know that as believers we have power. I'm getting tired of saying that word. But he wants him to understand this. Paul says, I'm praying that you will. Because I'm all talked out. There's no more to say. You know, I could go on and on and on and on. All I can do now is back off and pray that the Holy Spirit will energize your mind to understand, to grasp, that you are complete in him. And the power that he has is yours. He gives the power to evangelize, first of all. Romans 1, 16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Why? because I'm a great orator. No, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ because that simple message is the, what? Power of God unto salvation. And that power is mine, and I'm going to share it. That's how come I have the power to evangelize, because the message has power. 1 Thessalonians 1.5 says, Our gospel did not come to you in word only. It wasn't coming to you because I was able to put words together. It came to you in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. Power. It's yours. The power to endure suffering. The power to endure suffering. 2 Corinthians 4, 7 and 8 says this, But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the surpassing greatness of the power of God may be of God and not of ourselves. It goes on to say in verse 8, We are afflicted in every way, but we're not crushed. We are perplexed, but we are not despairing. We are persecuted. It goes on and on and on. And finally, later on in verse 14, he says, We are always carrying about in our bodies the suffering of Christ. We go through suffering. I feel pain. But, we also know that the one who had the power, verse 17, the one who had the power to raise Christ, will also have the power to raise me with him. Power to endure suffering. You have it. You don't have to ask for more. You have it. What you need to do is believe that you do. Power to serve. Colossians 1.29 says this, And for this purpose I labor, Paul says, I serve, striving according to what? According to his power, which is working mightily in me. Why? Because I'm in Christ. Power to serve. And then you say, but I don't have that kind of power. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Acts 1.8 says, You shall receive power after the Holy Spirit has come upon you. When does the Holy Spirit come upon you? Friend, when you believe. If you don't remember that, Ephesians 1.13, I hope you got that in your mind from our study. Ephesians 1.13 says, Having also believed, you heard of the good news of salvation. Having also believed, you were what? Sealed in him with what? The Holy Spirit. You have power. The Holy Spirit is living within you if you're a believer. Romans 9 says, if you don't have the Holy Spirit, you're none of His. There's nothing more that you can get. You have it all. What we need to do is believe it. Quit looking for something more. Ephesians 3.20. Bye. Ephesians 3.20 says this, Now to him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we could ask or think, how is that possible? Because it's according to what? The power that is at work in me. I believe it. Christian, what more? What more could we want? What more could we want? Verse 20, chapter 1, he gives an illustration of the power that he's praying that they'll understand that they already have. He illustrates it. And he says, this power is the same power that brought about in Christ when God raised him from the dead and seated him at the right hand in the heavenly places. I think it's a very normal thing for sometimes for believers to have doubts about things that made the promises of God. It's something that, unless I'm just going to stand here and lie to you, that I have too. I have certain doubts about, you know, I'm preaching every Sunday. What if this is just a big hoax? Huh? What if it's just a bunch of baloney and we're just kind of all patting ourselves on the back and pumping it up every week? What if after I live for the Lord and I die, I find out that he doesn't have the power to raise me up with him? The promise right here is this, friend, that power is yours. Because the same power that broke the chains of death and blasted him out of that grave and sat him at the right hand of God and coronated him as king is the same power that is going to raise you too. The power is yours. That's power and it's all yours. What more could we want? I pray that you understand it. The greatness of his plan, the greatness of his power, and then the greatness of his person. Verse 21 through 23. Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named. He's talking about all the angelic powers, all authority and power and dominion. And then down to earth, every name that is named. You think of a name, he's greater. You think of a person, he's greater. I don't care who he is. I don't care how much influence, how much pain he may be able to inflict upon us today. His name is above his. Not only now, but also in the one to come. and he put all things in subjection under his feet. You need to know who he is and you need to know also that he who is this powerful God lives in you and I pray that you understand it. Christ secures us, the Holy Spirit of promise. He secures us, he empowers us and he makes the promises of God toward us. Yea and amen. So be it. They are sealed. It's Christ here living in me. What more could we want? You need to understand. Remember Timothy? Little Timothy? I don't know at all what he looked like, but I play games in my mind. I see Paul as big and burly, and I see Timothy as being kind of wimpy. Now that may not be true, but that's what I have in my mind. He was just kind of a weaker guy, and because of some of the things he dealt with, He may be burly and Paul may be wimpy looking. Who knows? But he was at a point in his ministry where he was really getting beaten down. And he was really discouraged in his ministry. And people were hassling him because he was young. They were hassling his teaching. He was standing and preaching and teaching. And they were hassling his teaching because some errorists had kind of moved into the church he was ministering at. And they were confusing him and intimidating him with all these long genealogies and these intricate kinds of doctrines. and they were really appealing to the flesh, you know. And Timothy was just preaching a simple gospel, and he looked naive and stupid, and he was getting real discouraged. And Paul writes to Timothy and says, Hey, buddy, you better fan the flame a little bit. You better stir up that gift that's within you. You better get your rear in gear, buddy, because you've got a job to do. And then he goes on and says, Get your act together, Timothy. Take a little wine and get your stomach organized. Stir up the gift that's in you, and get moving. And then, above all, 1 Timothy 2.8, he says, Remember the greatness of the one who lives in you. That's a fact, Timothy. Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, living in you. Go do it. I want to tell you we need to understand the greatness of his plan, that we are complete in him. We need to understand the greatness of his power, and that all of these things have been made possible because of the greatness of his person. And I believe that when we understand that, it's going TO CHANGE how we live. It has to. It has to. I also believe that when we understand that, when we know who we are, when WE know what his plan is, we understand it. When WE know what his power is, that it's working within us. When WE know who his person is and that he's living within us. You know what? I think when we understand that we're not going to be compelled to constantly be looking to find more of God more of Christ we've got it we've got it believe it you know what? I'm all talked out the only thing I can do now is pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you may know what is the hope of his calling what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of his might which he brought about in Christ when he raised him up from the dead and seated him at the right hand of God in the heavenly places far above all rule and authority and power and dominion every name that is named not only in this age but also in the one to come. You're complete. You can't have anything more. What more could you possibly want? Let's pray. Father I pray that the eyes of our heart may be enlightened that we may know what is the hope of our calling in Christ that we are complete in him Lord if there's anything we want more of it's more understanding more obedience more love more responsiveness but Lord I thank you that we have all of you Amen Amen.
