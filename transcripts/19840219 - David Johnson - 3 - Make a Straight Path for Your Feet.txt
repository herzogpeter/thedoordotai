Hebrews chapter 12, starting in verse 12, and if you can handle the distraction, we're going to read the text while they leave. Can you handle that, folks? All you grown-up people? There we go. They can handle that, but that's about all they can handle. Hebrews chapter 12, verse 12, Therefore, friends, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble, and make straight paths for your feet. Make straight paths for your feet. Here's why. so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. Here's something else I want you to do. Pursue peace with all men and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord and see to it that no one comes short of the grace of God, that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble and by it many be defiled. You know, as John was singing that song, My Spirit, and even it began for me when we were praying in groups and I just thought, this kind of thing tells me Jesus is real. There's nothing I despise more than coming and feeling like we're going through the motions. I just, with that kind of thing. And as we prayed and as Jesus, and as John, he just got promoted. as john's saying that's what i thought i thought you're you're alive and you're real and i thank god that as we come to his precious word that we can call on him for wisdom and insight and he will give it but i've shared this with you so many times before and there are times i really get frustrated with preaching there's times when I I really even want to quit because I sometimes really struggle with its value its worth I know scripturally that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God but I think there is little value to this unless the spirit of God himself grip people's hearts and we change ask that for yourself as we again open his word Let's pray. I have words to say, Lord, but they are just words. Unless your spirit dominate and control, overwhelm. You are here and I thank you for it. I pray that our hearts would be hearing what you're saying in Jesus' name. Amen. First thing I want you to focus on in this text is that little phrase, the limb which is lame would be put out of joint. The limb which is lame might be put out of joint. That's going to be the focus for our text. Something important that we need to understand as we continue in this 12th chapter. What I want you to see is that the writer of the book of Hebrews, for these people, in order for them to understand what he wants them to do, is verbally painting a picture. And the picture up to now has been that of a race, right? And the race is one that he is exhorting these people to run with endurance. The picture we have so far is that of a track, and we have people on the track. And because of the people to whom this exhortation was being written, we know something about the people who are on the track. It is this, that they are discouraged concerning their ability to win the race. They are discouraged and disillusioned concerning the value of even running the race. As I've said many times before, they were expecting certain things from God, and circumstances were not working out that way. They thought for sure that if they became Christians, everything would be smooth and rosy and Christ would pave the way for them. But it seemed that circumstances and trouble were knocking at the door constantly. And they were ready to fall back and quit and therefore the strong admonition comes in chapter 12. And we have seen this admonition as being really an encouragement, but we have also seen that this encouragement is not a gentle one. He says basically this, Quit feeling sorry for yourself, believer. Get rid of the fat. Get rid of the excess baggage. And as you get rid of all those encumbrances that weigh you down, here's what I want you to do. I want you to look away from everything that would distract. I want you to look away from those people, even in the church, who are uncommitted and who aren't running the race, who might get you to slow down, to look away from them, fix your eyes on Christ, and run the race. You know, doing that is sometimes nothing less than a war. You know that? I'm sure you've felt it. If you have committed yourself to running the race with endurance and flat out with everything you have, that ability to look away from people who would slow you down, to look away from negative influences, sometimes even in the church, is just plain a war. J.R. Packer said it this way as he was telling a story of a prophet who had some sort of passionate desire to scream his message to people. And he really believed that as he would scream this message to people, that people would change. And he screamed and he screamed and he preached. And lo and behold, people did for a while. But it went on a little bit more. And after time went on, people quit listening and they kept going their own way. And after a while, all you had left was this prophet standing on a corner screaming and preaching. And it seemed that the less the people listened and moved away from him, the more fanatical he became until finally one day someone came to him and said, listen friend, I've seen you screaming and preaching here, telling us what you think is the truth and how to live. For a while people listened and now they don't. Why do you continue? And he said this, when I first began to preach, I preached because I thought I could change people. and now I preach and I preach and I preach because I don't want them to change me. Fix your eyes on Christ. You're going to have to look away if you're going to run with endurance. Chapter 5, he continues with, verse 5, he continues with this. He didn't coddle them. The circumstances they were facing were not good and he spoke of the discipline of the Lord. He said, listen, you have forgotten some important things about your past. Right out of the Old Testament, you've known this from a child. The things come into your life and they are sometimes negative. Sometimes they are for correction. Sometimes they are for prevention so that you don't move into areas that will destroy your life or destroy your ministry. Sometimes they are for education to deepen you. But I want you to know this, that when the discipline of the Lord comes and negative circumstances come, it is for your good. It is because He loves you. It is not punishment. It is discipline. And the worst thing in the world you could do would be to misjudge it, to regard it lightly, to faint. The point of that whole text that we dealt with last week on the discipline of God is basically this, that the discipline of God is not designed to slow you down. It sure feels like that sometimes, doesn't it? It feels like these obstacles come, that these negative circumstances come, and they just grind me to a halt. The purpose, the point of God's discipline in the life of the believer, whether it be correction, prevention, or education, is not to slow you down. It is, in fact, to build you up to make you faster, to make you more capable. Those obstacles exercise you. Every athlete who ever trained knows that. When he's running the race, what does he do? When he gets right into the warfare, he strips everything off that he can. But you know what he does when he trains? He puts all sorts of weight. Have you ever seen anybody work out? They put weights on their ankles and they run. They look like crazy people. I've seen people put weights on their wrists so that when they run, it's even harder. They bulk themselves up with sweatshirts and sweatsuits and try to lose weight and build endurance. And then they go into another room and they lift weights. And you know what? When that gets easy, you know what I do? They add more weights. The discipline of the Lord comes not to slow you down. It comes to build you up, to give you strength, to exercise weak hands and feeble knees. So it is that we are in a race. That's the picture we have been given. And it is to be run and there will be obstacles. And those obstacles are there to make you strong. Therefore, it says in verse 12, what I want you to do is strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble. I want you to get in shape to run the race. Let those obstacles build you up. 13, it says, and make straight paths for your feet. When you run the race, here's how I want you to run it. I want you to run it straight. I don't want you to get distracted by the world. I don't want you to get distracted by sin. I don't want you to get distracted by uncommitted people who may be your relatives and friends and people in your church. Proverbs 4.25 says this. Here's how I want you to run the race. Here's how I want you to live your life. Let thine eye look right on, directly ahead. Let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you. Watch the path of your feet. Do not turn to the right or to the left. Turn your feet from evil. I want you to run when you run. I want you to run straight ahead. Now we're having a picture painted for us In this particular text The picture is basically this It starts in verse 1 Here's what I want you to do I want you to run the set before you race Okay? You doing it? Have you committed yourself to that? Okay, if you have Then the picture is beginning to develop And we move on to something else Here's what I want you to do I want you to run the race Here's how I want you to do it I want you to run it in a straight line Not moving to the right or to the left I could say it in the vernacular this way I want you to stay in your lane. When you're running the race, stay in your lane. Don't go bumping into somebody else. Don't go wobbling back and forth. Don't let yourself be distracted. Run straight ahead. Third thing is this. He told him what he wants him to do, run the race. He told him how he wants him to do it, run straight. And then in that 13th verse, he says something else. Here's why I want you to do it. Here's why I want you to run straight. So that the limb which is lame may not be put. out of joint. I want you to know something. As this picture develops, and we're going through this text of the last three, this is the third week that we've been in this. But as this picture is developing, a dimension has been added today. See, sometimes the reason people don't run the race is because they're not committed. Sometimes the reason they don't run is because they're half-baked. Sometimes the reason they don't run because they're mealy-mouthed and they just sit there and they're passive and they don't care. And it's real hard for us. I preached on this a few weeks ago, so I don't want to do it again. But it's real hard for us as a church because one of our tasks in dealing with people like that is that we have to work around them. We have to look away from them. We can't pay attention to them because they'll slow us down and grind us right to a halt. But you need to know something else. A new dimension is being added here, and that is this, that sometimes the people who aren't running the race aren't doing it just because they're being stubborn and don't want to and are really rebellious in their heart, sometimes the reason you don't run the race is because you're just plain hurt. And you're wounded and disillusioned and for the life of you, you can't run. You've got a limb that is lame. And sometimes people like that that find themselves in that position when the race is being run, the deepest desire of their heart is that they want to run. They might even try to run and pretend like they're not limping and they're not hurt. But you know what? One of the things that happens, and you can even look at your own heart because every one of us have fallen into this category. You may be fully committed to Christ and suddenly you just come up lame and something hurts. You know what happens when there are people in the church who are, in fact, suffering with a lame limb? What they do is they start to look around at other people because I get so discouraged and you get so discouraged and even disillusioned about your faith. That what I need to know when I'm hurting and I can't move anymore, what I need to know more than anything else is that even though I'm hurt and struggling and can't move, that this Christianity stuff really is real. I need to know that desperately then. And so he's saying to those who aren't lame at the time, you run straight. You run straight. You strengthen those hands and you strengthen those knees and you run a straight line so that those people who are suffering right now, whose limbs are lame, can see that this really does work. And if you don't, if you're running like this, back and forth, the possibility is very real that those people who are hurting in our midst could have that limb that is lame pushed out of joint and become disabled. I want you to consider this for a moment, what it means to be lame. The Greek word for lame is kalon. It means one who is limping or one who is halting. The physical picture is simply this. It's of a guy who's sitting on a track, and he's a track guy, and he's committed to the race, but he's just not 100%. He's just not there all the way. Now, there are several different possibilities as to who this person is. There are different dimensions. There are different reasons people might come up lame. It could be the fact that this lame brother, this person who is limping, is what we call from time to time the weaker brother. The weaker brother, the one who is immature in the faith and gets knocked off rather easily. Struggling, possibly. Now hear this. Struggling, possibly, with some very legitimate questions. Sometimes those questions that he's struggling with in terms of his faith are intellectual, And sometimes those questions that he is struggling with are moral. And maybe he's a young person. And I guess that's who I think of when I'm thinking of this particular thing. Maybe it's a young person. And the thing that has caused him to go lame is not bitterness in his heart. He's not going, ah, this is a bunch of baloney. I think this is a crock. Forget it. I'm leaving. It isn't that at all. He isn't rebellious. But he has heard the message all his life and he knows it well. He has been taught and somewhere in his heart it says this. this Christianity stuff and the Bible, it is right. But you know what? When those questions come and they are legitimate, you know what he needs to know desperately? You know what he needs to know desperately when he is lame? He needs to know that not only is this Christianity stuff right, he needs to know that it's real. And he needs to see that there is power. And he needs to see that there is something life-changing in this. So you know what he does? You know what he does when he's lame? and he looks around. He looks around. The exhortation is this. You run straight, so that when that one who is lame looks, he sees something real. It's real possible this one who is lame is a non-Christian altogether. One who is not a Christian at all. And maybe some right here, right now in our midst this very moment, who have come into our church, and you have said, boy, I'll tell you, there's something neat here. I like the message. I like the songs. We talk about Jesus. There seems to be a warmth. Man alive, people here break in groups and they act like they love each other. It's incredible. And we hear this message of forgiveness and grace. And you're right on the edge and you haven't made a commitment. But you know what people do after they listen? After people listen and their ears are pricked and they think maybe something's real here, right after that, the first thing you're going to do is you're going to look. You know why? Because the first thing you want to do after you think that it might be right, you want to know if it's real. and so the exhortation is beloved you run a straight line because if you don't the one who is limping the one who is maybe right at the edge of a commitment the one who is right at the edge of committing himself to christ maybe looking at you to find out desperately wanting to know that this christianity stuff really works and if you're running like this it might just take his joint that is lame and put it right at a joint disable him consider this possibility when we consider who this lame person is consider this possibility that it's just you consider the possibility that it's you this very moment and it isn't at all that you're uncommitted and it isn't at all that you don't love the Lord. And even as you look into your life, you can think, boy, I'll tell you, last week I was running and everything was well and I just felt on top of the world and I was trusting the Lord and oh man, and all of a sudden this week, I don't even know where it came from, but I got bumped. A negative word came. A hurt, a painful experience and I was running and I just got knocked right here and i just can't i just can't even move anymore and the deepest desire you might have in your heart is to run with endurance the race that is set before you and live by faith and really go but for the life of you you just can't move the limb has become lame and you're hurt and again you you try you know you're in church today hey, everybody here is running, right? Everybody here is running, right? Everybody, yeah. And so what you do with everybody running, or at least being exhorted to run, I'm lame and I'm hurting, I can't even move. At least I'm going to try to pretend I'm going to do everything I can to hide this thing. I'm dying. I get in my group with the prayer group thing and I don't tell a word. We've got a lot of people in our church who really like athletics, and I'm one of them. And one of the things I remember about being involved in athletic teams that when I got injured, and it happened from time to time, it seemed like once a year something happened to me that I had to be pulled out, and I couldn't be participating in what I wanted to do. But you know what I remember the most about being injured, being lame? It wasn't the pain of the injury at all. The thing I remember the most about being made lame was the feeling of not being part of the team anymore. That's what bothered me the most. I felt left out. And do you know what this text is saying to us about that kind of thing? if the situation that you're going through right now is that. That you're hurt and you just can't move for the life of you, but you'd love to if you could. One of the things that this text in verse 12 means, when it says strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble, isn't just an exhortation for you to do that for yourself. One of the functions of the body is that we do that for each other. Strengthen the hands, not just your hands. I have a responsibility to you that when you're lame that my response to you is not such that it would cause that lameness to get worse and even disabled but rather to come to you and exhort you and love you and you to me to strengthen those hands that are weak and those knees that are feeble and make straight paths you know I talked about the fact a moment ago that what it means to walk a straight path is to walk because it's kind of an example when I'm really hurting when I'm maybe someone who doesn't really know I believe this or not, I need to see someone who's running straight. One of the key words in that particular exhortation, though, is the word path. You know what it means? It means to clear the way. You like that? Please play with that a little bit in your mind. It means to clear the way. Make a straight path. It refers to tracks being left by wheels. It refers to the making of a path. Clear the way for those people in our congregation who are lame. And by your running and by your commitment, leave something behind you that makes it easy for those who are hurting to come along. You know what? Over and over again, these last few weeks, we have been exhorted to run the race. And we have been focusing on my individual responsibility before God to run the race with endurance. but I want to tell you something else it's incredible how the word of God continually comes back and gives us balance because the balance is this while I am individually responsible before God to be fully committed to him and running the race the fact is also this that I can't run the race alone you see I am part of a body and whether I like it or not I am part of that body and I need you I need you at times when I am discouraged to run a straight path for me Do you know that? I need you to run a straight path for me for certain times in my life and certain times in your life when the limb is lame and for the life of you, you can't run. The path needs to be made clear by those who are strong and moving. Can you imagine that, you know, you're used to it by now, but we might even have some visits. Can you imagine that sometimes the pastor gets lame spiritually? That he actually admits in front of people that he can't run the race all the time? That he actually gets disillusioned about Christianity, wondering, is this thing really all it's cracked up to be? That bothers you too. Well, I want to tell you something. I do. I do. People who are in the office know that there are times when I really struggle within myself. It's so important to me that this is real. And you know what I do when I come up lame? I do the same thing you do. I look around. I look around. And when what I see is people just going like this and mediocrity and people who aren't committed to the race, you know what Satan tells me when I come up lame and then I look around and I see mediocrity? Satan says, see? It really is just a bunch of garbage. It really is just a a thing we're duping people with and just a way to kind of keep people in line it has nothing to do at all with power it has nothing to do at all with god it doesn't work you know what happens to me though invariably the spirit of god sends someone into my life who's running the race who's running a straight line and who's making a path for me and i look at that person's life sometimes it's you and you and you and you and you don't even know and you're running the race with endurance and I just look at you. Sometimes I'm just passing you in the hall and I see a countenance that's full of the... I don't know. I see someone or I hear something and I see someone running the race and I look at him and I go, it's real. And I'm lame now but I'm committing myself again to that. I'm going to run. I'm going to run. It's worth it. It's more important to me to know that this is real than to know that it's right. That sounds like a contradiction, doesn't it? Tell me this. How in the world could this Christianity stuff be right if it isn't real? Strengthen those knees that are weak and strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble and run a straight path because if you don't, those people who are hurting and right on the edge of commitment could be put right out of joint. Do you know that people are watching you? People are watching you. and I'll tell you something the deeper your commitment becomes you know what happens when your commitment becomes deeper what you do is you make it more public you do you know that I mean you just know that in your own heart and the more you make your commitment to Christ public the more people are going to watch and I've heard that ever since I was a little kid you know so be on your wrist and I want to tell you something about people who watch you there are some people who watch you and watch me and they do it in a cynical way but maybe there are some people here who are with that very attitude. They'll come to church and basically what they want to do is they hear the message and they look around and they snicker and go, ah, this is just a bunch of baloney. This doesn't work. And they look at people's lives hoping like crazy that they fail so that they'll have, ah, see, proof it doesn't work. I want to tell you something. That's not what I'm dealing with. We'll deal with that some other day. What I'm dealing with is not that person at all. We are dealing this morning with that person who has legitimate questions, who has legitimate doubts, and they plague him, and he knows the answers, and he understands the way. And somewhere in his heart, he even believes it's right, but he desperately needs to know it's more than right, it's really real, and they're looking at you. And they're looking at me. I heard a story not long ago of a father who walked out of his house. And he was having problems with his marriage, And he walked out of the house in a fit of fury, and he was stomping down the street in the snow about up to the middle of his calf. And as he was stomping down the street in a great big fume, he noticed some sort of presence behind him, and he quickly turned around and he saw a six-year-old boy. And you know what the six-year-old boy was doing? Something that would break my heart if I saw him doing that. He was lifting his feet up as big as he could, trying to get his feet right in where his dad put his feet. I want to ask you a question if your children if your sons and if your daughters and if the young people in our church and if your best friend is putting his feet where you put your feet what are they stepping in? if they follow you in terms of what you call your Christianity what are you leading them to? is it real? is it real? Is it about a relationship with God or is it about religion? Is it about being a church every Sunday? Will in the living of my life, if people choose for good reasons or bad to put their feet where I put my feet, will I lead them into a relationship and into the power of the Holy Spirit or will I lead them into a lifestyle of just play acting? People are watching, and they aren't as concerned about whether what you believe is right as whether it is real. Does it work for you? Ravi Zacharias had an incredible privilege this last week to go to Pastor's Institute from Monday through Thursday this week. And Ravi Zacharias was the main speaker. And he was speaking, in one of the times, he was speaking of the fact that one of the biggest problems in the church today is that we have a message, but we aren't following up with credibility. He was talking of a time when he was dealing with a Muslim friend of his, and they were playing golf. And this friend of his looked at Ravi and says, you know, I have seen your life. I have seen the change. I really believe that you believe what you say you believe. I have seen the change. I have been a witness of what you say God has done in your life but I have been a witness of something else too and that is other Christians and I have been to churches and my conclusion is this that what has happened to you is not God at all but simply a quirk of a very powerful personality that has chosen to believe certain things that have affected his personality and it isn't God at all because I don't see him anywhere else what are people doing? they're looking they're looking J.I. Packer said this people don't have trouble believing in a supernatural God that's not that hard to do what people have trouble believing is they have trouble believing that most Christians have anything supernatural think on that what are we going to do about that I'll tell you what we're going to do about that we strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble and we run a straight path why? because if you don't the limb which is lame could be put out of joint look at your life right now does it cause those who are lame and hurt with legitimate questions does it cause them to be healed does it cause them to look at you and say oh man that is real this Christianity stuff is real or does it take that limb which is lame and disable it that's a heavy responsibility let's move on I want you to notice the outline. We really don't have one. It's kind of a narrative this morning as we flow through the text. But I want to give you this if you're trying to hang on with some sort of notes. The problem stated would be this. Those who are lame. Okay? The possibilities of those who are lame, point two, would be that there's two possibilities. One, that they'd be put out of joint. Or two, that they'd be healed. The solution to that is fivefold. I've given you two already. One, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble. And two, make straight paths. Here's another one. Verse 14. Pursue peace with all men. Here's four. And sanctification. Pursue peace. Pursue sanctification. Thank you. Thank you. without which no man shall see God. For some, this is a real tough text. I don't think it is at all, but some people get a little bit wrapped up and wondering what this is, and I was reading some commentaries this week, and they did all sorts of theological gymnastics to try to weasel out of it. It isn't that hard, but I need to state the problem just so we understand. They read it as if these are things that are contingent upon your salvation pursue peace with all men and if you don't do that you won't see God and pursue holiness and without that you won't see God and then they kind of do the gymnastics by saying the holiness that's being talked about here isn't a practical holiness it isn't that you are supposed to be a holy person as much as it is positional holiness meaning if you have received the free gift of salvation you are declared righteous you are declared holy and if you aren't declared holy, you'll never see God. Now, hang on, that is a true theology. If you haven't been declared righteous by your acts of faith in Jesus Christ, then you'll never see God. The problem is that's not what this text is saying. The text is saying simply this, pursue peace with all men, pursue holiness. Why? Because if you don't, those people who are looking at you will never see God. That's what it means. Those people whose limbs are lame, looking at you, if you are not, one, pursuing peace with all men, two, pursuing holiness, I don't care what you say, I don't care what you do, I don't care how right you are, I don't care how beautiful our building is, if we are not pursuing peace with all men, pursuing holiness as the passion of our lives, I don't care how good the program is, people won't see God and the limb will be put out of joint. let's look at that just for a moment this is a rich concept pursue peace, pursue, dioko means to continue after to run swiftly in order to catch how do you do that? how do you run swiftly after peace? what you do is you preach a sermon on peace you better be at peace with all men and pursue peace with all men go after it you know we've talked about this kind of thing so many times but behaviors, mark this and mark it well behaviors are symptoms of something else every time behaviors are symptoms of something else peace with you is a symptom that i love you now get that mark that it might sound a little simplistic but i'm going to explain it peace with you is just a symptom that i love you peace is not the key i don't even want you to focus on key where i need focus on peace where i need you to focus your attention is on this whether i love that person or not i love my wife in fact you know i i have real ambivalent feelings about doing what i did this last week going on retreats because what that means is from monday through thursday i had to be away from my wife and kids but there's really kind of a mixed blessing in that kind of thing because being away from my wife and kids uh for four days means i miss them like crazy in fact i came home a little early just because it was driving me a little bonkers. I love my wife. What crazy. And you know what that means? Since I love my wife, that means we never have an argument. We're incredible. We are. We are. It's awesome. We always smile. We're always curious. And I tell you, for one, I'm very thoughtful at home all the time. It's incredible because I love my wife. Well, you know, I'm glad you laughed because you know me well enough to know that's not even true. I mean, you see that even here. But you know what it means that I love my wife? You know what it means? It means this, that when I am unthoughtful and when I am argumentative and when I do become incredibly selfish as I do, I love her so much I can't stand that. You know what I do? I pursue peace. I go after her. And I say, this is wrong. This is not right. I can't stand to live at war with you. Why do I do that? Because I love her. You know what? We live at peace with each other. When? When you hear a message on peace. No. No. When you love, you will. Think of the one this very moment with whom you have no peace. Let me ask you this. Do you love him? Do you love her? Do you? Oh yeah. I love him in the Lord. Oh yeah. I want to tell you this. If you're not at peace with him, I don't believe you. I don't believe you. I want you to notice something though. I've got to be consistent with the word here. I don't want to just get people off the hook. But Paul does say something here. You know, that could really get some people's strife thing going. Oh man. Paul says this. So far as it depends upon you, live at peace with all men. So far as it depends upon you, live at peace with all men. There are people with whom you could exchange your love and you could give your love and you could extend your forgiveness and you could extend your... And it would never... It would just be like a wall. It would be bitter and it would be angry and nothing you could do could break through that. And they'd never let you off the hook, ever. Some won't love you. But the basic principle is still the same. If you love, there will be peace. And when there is lack of peace, don't even start preaching about, you better go to peace, you better... We got to have peace. that isn't the issue the issue is love and that's right at the core of problems in the church and let me tell you this right from the text without peace no man will see God in you ever I don't care how right you are and holiness pursue peace and holiness the word in my Bible is sanctification you know what the same principle applies I'm not going to ask you about holiness I'm not going to call you to a life of holiness. I'm not going to call you a life of sanctification. Not today. Maybe some other time. What I'm going to ask you is this. Do you love the Lord with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind? Does that register with you? Just ask yourself that. Don't even think about the symptom. Just ask yourself about the love. Lord, do I love you with all my heart and soul and mind? I got something. Revelation from God. If you do, characteristics, characteristic of your life will be pursuing holiness perfection not necessarily you will pursue holiness the deepest desire of your heart will be to do what god wants you to do the desire to do his will if you don't i'll tell you this if you don't love the lord with all your heart and soul and mind if that isn't your deepest love there is nothing on this earth that i could do or anyone could do to make you obey you know one of the reasons i think churches move into a strong legalistic stances is because somehow the Spirit of God has lost control of those people's hearts. The love has died. And I want to tell you something. If love has died in the church, then there is nothing to control behavior. Nothing. So what we need is rules and regulations and all sorts of hard stuff that you need to shape up. But if love is alive, that's the greatest control there is. That's the greatest control there is. dick dugan met dick dugan on a on a retreat this last week he used to be the pastor of monticello alliance church he's out somewhere in wyoming or montana or something like that some god forsaken state but he wrote a song and he was just strumming on his guitar one night you know and he was it was really neat and the tune caught me and craig's going to teach it to us in a few weeks, one of these evenings. But one of the things was, love God and do what you please. Love God and do what you please. And I go, what do you mean love God and do what you please? What do you mean we're going to have a bunch of loose people doing what they please? That's terrible. No, that's wonderful. That's wonderful. If we could set people's hearts free to love God with all their hearts and souls and minds, you do what you please. You know what you'll do? You'll obey. Catch this, pursue peace. That's this way. Loving you, there will be peace. and holiness. That's this way. Loving him. Without which no man can see God. There are no shortcuts. And you could build a new building. You know, I know of a church this very moment. I know of a church this very moment whose philosophy is this. Our building doesn't attract people. And we are going to build a new building because if we have a new facility, it will attract more people. My Bible says, without peace and without holiness, I don't care what your building looks like, nobody's going to see God there. And we could get a new music director, and we could get a new pastor, and we could get a new elder. We could get new elders, and we could have new programs, and we could have the best program. Oh, man, it would run like a machine. And we could have a doctrinal statement that is without flaw. and without peace, and without holiness, meaning without love, the limb which is lame will be put out of joint. No man will see God in any of that. Galatians 4.19, Paul says this, I am in much travail, I have labor pains over you, and the labor pains are this, I desire that Christ be formed in you. Notice, he doesn't say, I desire that Christ be dwelling in you. They are already dwelling in him. His deepest desire is that Christ be formed in them so that people who are lame and ready to fall out looking at them would see Christ. Matthew 5.13, You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its savor, it is good for nothing. You are the light of the world, but if the light be hid, it is good for nothing. We have a heart to evangelize. I think we do. What do we need to do that? What we need is a program. What we need is a method. Tell us how to do it. I think we need to do that. We need to tell people how, but I want to tell you something else. I'm just coming with the same thing. Pursue peace. Pursue holiness. And without that, I don't care what your program is, forget it. No man will see God. One final exhortation. Again, the problem, what's the problem stated? That those who are lame would be put out of joint. That those who are lame, that's the problem. The possibilities are that they would be, one, disabled, or two, healed. How would they do it? By looking at us. The solution? Strengthen those hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble. Two, make straight paths for your feet. Three, pursue peace with all men. Pursue holiness, which is love. And fifth, verse 15, see to it that no one comes short of the grace of God. See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God. That no root of bitterness springing up may cause trouble. See to it. It's a really neat little collection of words. The Greek word there is one word, and it is episcopal. Now, some of you who have a little familiarity with Greek, something goes up in your mind because that's a real familiar word, even if you don't know a lot, episcopal. It's the word for elder or bishop. It's synonymous with those things. And what it means is take the oversight. See to it, beloved. See to it. Make sure that no one, look around, go after that one who is falling short of the grace of God. Now it's obvious that at one level this one who is falling short of the grace of God is possibly one who is unsaved. They're falling short of the grace of God and in our congregation one of our responsibilities as believers not only as the pastor, not only as elders but as believers it is our responsibility to take the oversight for those who are sitting around me. They may be falling short of the grace of God going after them. But literally, that word means, in terms of falling short of the grace of God, literally, it means to come short of or fall back from. Apostasy? One who was in and felt possibly, sure. Take the oversight of them, too. Be looking around for those who might have been there and have fallen away. Take the oversight. Go after them. Don't let them slip away. You know, this is the most body-conscious text I think we've dealt with so far. we are responsible for one another take the oversight but just in opening my heart to you again you know what happens to me I never fall short of the grace of God in a positional way I know that I am sealed in him to the day of redemption and I never stop believing but you know what happens to me and I think happens to some of you there is a way in which I fall short of the grace of God in my experience there are times when I get discouraged and the limb is lame that the reality of the grace of God becomes real distant to me. And I feel real unforgiven and I feel real unforgivable and I feel real inadequate and I feel real worthless. And I want to go hide in a hole someplace and the last place in the world I want to be is at church. And I feel full of shame. You know what this word says here? When those people in our congregation have a lame limb. When they're trying like crazy to see the Lord, only they can't. When they're falling short of the grace, when they're falling short of even the experience of the joy of the Lord, you take the oversight. Go after them. Look out for. You know what? This has been a week for me like that in dealing with many of our people. I don't know what it is about this time of year, but this is a disjointing time of year. And I have talked to so many of you, and you have affirmed that over and over to me, that for some reason or another, this time of year, Christmas, coming into Christmas, right after Christmas, January and February, for some reason, things look worse than they are, and we lose perspective, and there are spiritual problems and problems in relationships that start cropping up. Our counseling ministry is just going crazy right now. It's a disjointing time of year, and I have been, even just last Friday, just two days ago, even as I was preparing this, there were some people who came to my mind and were placed on my heart by God, and I just said, listen, take the oversight. Take the oversight. You know, I got to tell you this. I really exhort a lot. I know I do that. And we know, we need to do this. We need to do this. But I need to encourage sometimes and say, boy, I'm just, my heart's so glad. I went to some people this Friday and I said, hey, I love you and I care about you. How's it going? And we talked and we talked and it was neat and it was just kind of making connection. And you know what, throw my heart? They said to me, you know, they said, Pastor, you know, you're about the fourth person who's come to me from our church. And they've come and they've said exactly the same thing you are. You know what that is? That's taking the oversight. That's taking the seed to it that no one among you falls short. I tell you, if you start, we're going to come and get you. And if it isn't me, I trust that we are beginning to develop a body that takes the oversight and goes. Let that root of bitterness take root. What that basically is dealing with is just flat out apostasy. We don't have time to read it, but I'd like you to look it up if you have time later. Deuteronomy 29, 28 through 31. That's exactly what I believe he's taking this phrase right out of that text. And it's dealing with apostasy. Do you mean to tell me, Dave, that people, even in our congregation, could get so discouraged, and that limb that got hurt somehow, that maybe looks real stupid to me, what a stupid thing, how could he get hurt over something like that? Do you mean to tell me that if we just leave them go, and don't go after them, and care about them, and take the oversight in their lives, that it could actually result in a root of bitterness, meaning falling away from the faith? That's exactly what I'm saying. And the limb could be put out of joint. Let me just end with this phrase. But so much as it depends upon you, do this. Strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble. Not only yours, but those people who are around you. Make straight paths, not only so that people who are looking for something real can see something that is straight and not going like that, but also so that those who are hurt have a place to run right in your tracks. And pursue peace with all men. And pursue holiness. And what I mean by that is fix your heart on love. Examine yourself to see if you do. And see to it that no one, take the oversight. I'm going to challenge you with something right now. Those of you who care about this and are committed to running the race, I'm going to ask you to ask the Spirit of God to give you a name of someone right now whose limb is lame. You know they are hurting. You know that they are just about ready to slip away. Take the oversight. Take the oversight. Jesus, teach us to be a people who run with endurance the race that's set before us. Teach us also that this race is not run alone. Teach us what it is that we need to be running after and to leave those things that don't matter alone. Pursue peace. Pursue holiness. Give us the courage to see to it that no one among us that we know so much as it depends upon us can fall short, can fall away from because of our neglect. I pray that you bless this to our hearts this morning. In Jesus' name, amen.
