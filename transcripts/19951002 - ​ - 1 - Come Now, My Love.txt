Our new American collegiate dictionary has 4,500 new words in it, and 30 of them are taken from the Yiddish vocabulary. Now you find in our dictionary words like glitch, gibbiz, gibboots, and of course the very well-known word that's been around for so long, chutzpah. What's chutzpah mean? Nerve. Brass. Gall. Sometimes an obnoxious aggressiveness. I heard a wonderful descriptive definition of chutzpah recently. Esther Schwartz was in front of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami with her two-year-old handsome Jacob. She adored Jacob. She worshipped the guy when Jacob walked down, and she bought precious little Jacob a canara yellow circular sun hat. Beautiful canara yellow sun hat sat on top of Jacob's head. She also bought him a pail and a shovel. Out on the beach, Esther Schwartz looks down at Jacob, and little Jacob picks up the shovel, puts the sand in the pail and Esther Schwartz marvels my god look at the grace of that child then little Jacob lifts up the pail Esther Schwartz is stunned look at the geometry in that kind of sand the boy's got the body of a bush the mind of an Einstein thank you for Jacob just then a tremendous tidal wave comes in picks up Jacob, pail and shovel washes him out to sea he's lost the view Esther Schwartz is very upset looks down looks up and shouts who do you think you are? Do you know who I am? I am Esther Schwartz my husband Solomon Schwartz is a physician and my son Billy Schwartz is a dentist how dare you do that? Just in a tremendous tidal wave watch little Jacob pail and shovel back onto the beach at his grandmother's feet Esther Schwartz looks down looks back up getting very irritated, looks back down and shouts, he had a hat! And that's chutzpah. So characteristic, you know, of Jewish prayer. In the Hebrew Bible, the Jews talk back to God, argue with God, and says, God changes mind. A few years ago, the professional golfer, Arnold Palmer, played a series of exhibition matches in Saudi Arabia. And when he finished playing, the king of Saudi Arabia was so impressed with Palmer's golfing expertise, he said, Mr. Palmer, I'd like to give you a gift. And Palmer, who's a multimillionaire in his own right, demurred and said, King, it really isn't necessary. I just love meeting your people and playing in your country. And the king responded, I would be very upset if you wouldn't allow me to give you a gift. Well, Palmer thought about that for a minute, and he said, well, how about a golf club? Yeah. A golf club would be a beautiful memento of my visit to your country. The king said fine, and the following morning, delivered to Palmer's hotel was the title to a golf club. 36 holes, thousands of acres, trees, lakes, buildings. And the moral of that story is, in the presence of a king, don't ask for small gifts. What is the deepest desire in your heart right now? What's the one gift you would like to receive from Jesus during these three days more than anything else? Remember as he walked down the road and the blind man Bartimaeus cried out, Jesus, son of David, have pity on me, and the apostles tried to hush him up. He cried out loud, Jesus, son of David, have pity on me. Jesus turned around and said, what do you want me to do for you? And Bartimaeus didn't hesitate. He said, I want my sight. And Jesus said, your faith has saved you. Let it be done. Jesus pauses right now in front of you and says, what do you want me to do for you? What's the deepest longing in your heart? What's the one gift you're seeking during this little time of renewal more than anything else? Would you gently close your eyes for a moment and get in touch with what that longing is, what that gift is you're seeking? And just present it to the Lord Jesus in simple faith and unwavering trust. Jesus, you taught us that things that are impossible with men and women are possible with you. You are indeed the master of the impossible. Jesus, we come tonight like little children, placing all our trust in you. And humbly ask that you grant each of us here tonight the deepest desire of our hearts, which no doubt is the deepest desire of your heart for us. Lord Jesus thank you for answering this prayer to the glory of the Father Amen Amen. You know, when I was back there with Dave Johnson and we were worshiping the Lord and through instrument and song, I began to think very much about my brother, my brother Rob. He was a year and three months older than I and my best friend. And when my brother was little, It was like he was born to lead and born to be heroic. He was the leader of the gang. He always fought my fights. I was a shy, introverted kid. I didn't have any friends. And the girls were crazy about my brother. And after I basically went in the Marine Corps, he won the Bronze Star, the Silver Star, and Three Purple Hearts for extraordinary gallantry in action. Became a New York City cop. Was decorated 16 times for bravery. For heroism beyond the call of duty. And when he died five years ago, 700 policemen came from all over New York City. Telling me stories of the absolutely heroic things my brother did to save their lives. One guy, Willow LeBrenner, who was my brother's partner for five years, said, Brennan, your brother was the most fearless man I've ever known. If a Sherman tank was coming down the road, he'd stand up in front of him and say, stop. When I preached for the first time in my home church in Brooklyn, New York, Our Lady of Angels, my mother, who adored my brother, looked at my father and said, Emmett, what is he doing up there? And you know, tonight, I was kind of psychologically distancing. I was about 10 feet away from myself, looking at myself and saying, what are you doing up there? This isn't humility. This isn't modesty. Why are all these people coming to hear God's word through you? You're not a hero. Most of your life you've been a scared little kid. And I'm really bewildered that God would use someone like me when... Someone like my brother, born to lead, heroic in character, fearless. So I ask you not to take me seriously. That would be a great disservice to me. But to take the word with the utmost seriousness. Over the past several years, my ministry has grown out of my own journey, out of my own brokenness. And probably it could be reduced to one theme, healing our image of God and ourselves. My books and tapes on the unconditional love of God, Abba, the wisdom of accepted tenderness, the compassion of Jesus, a stranger to self-hatred, and others, have aimed at dispelling illusions and myths about an unreal God and helping people to experience the God of Jesus Christ. This, by the way, I believe is the main business of Christianity. It is not a matter of simply learning how to think properly about God, but of actually experiencing him. Losing our illusions is difficult because illusions are the stuff that we live by. The Spirit of God is the great unmasker of illusions, the great destroyer of icons and idols. God's love for us is so great that he will not permit us to harbor false images, no matter how much they seem to comfort us. God strips away those falsehoods because it is better to live naked in truth than clothed in fantasy. Throughout the course of Christian history, down to the present moment, there persists this chronic temptation to reduce God to a human dimension to express him in clear ideas. Human reason seeks to understand everything, penetrate everything, reduce everything to its own clear conceptual thought. It's a noble enterprise, but in so doing, we rob God of his otherness and confine him to a world of our own mental limits. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas warned the Gisnes when he wrote, if you comprehend God, he is not God. In the same vein today, the Zen master says, if you meet the Buddha, kill the Buddha. That is, if you think you've comprehended the Buddha, destroy your comprehension of him. The secret of the mystery is, and I will return to this again and again tonight, The secret of the mystery is God is always greater. No matter how great you think him to be, God is always greater because God is God. In the most literal sense of the word, he is unique, uncreated, infinite, totally other than we are. He surpasses and transcends all human concepts, considerations, and expectations. He is beyond anything we can intellectualize or imagine. And that is why God will always be a scandal to men and women, because he cannot be comprehended by the rational, scientific, finite mind. With these brief remarks as an introduction, I invite you tonight to stretch. The key operative word in this presentation is stretch your mind, stretch your heart. If necessary, renounce the security of an unexamined faith. Let go of all merely human concepts of justice, mercy, love, rectitude, fair play. If necessary, let go of everything you've heard all your life about God and find your own understanding of the Holy One rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ. what was the message of Jesus concerning God what did he really preach what did he really teach and what did he really mean well modern biblical scholars tell us that if we want to be most confident that we're in touch with the original message of Jesus that we should turn to his parables quick decisive stories that make clear the fundamental points of his teaching for our purposes tonight we're going to look briefly at two first in Matthew 20 the parable of the crazy farmer. As you recall, it's harvest time. Work is plentiful, and every morning the farmer goes out to the marketplace, which is the hiring hall of his day, to recruit workers for his fields. Now, given the time of year and the amount of work available, one can assume, at least the great Lutheran biblical scholar, Joachim Jeremia says we can assume, that those who were still idling today with small talk at the 11th hour, about 5 in the afternoon, were a lazy and a shiftless bunch. Nevertheless, the farmer needs all the help he can get. He recruits them too. We can further assume the 11 thou workers took their time getting out to the field, shuffled around a lot, did very little work. But at pay time, they received a full day's pay. Now, those who heard Jesus tell this story found that his ending had a sharp twist. In this familiar rabbinic parable, meaning other rabbis of Jesus' time had told a similar story, In their version, those who worked at one hour got the whole day's pay because they worked so hard in the one hour. But in the version of Jesus, the emphasis is not on the diligence of the workers, but on the gratuitous generosity of the farmer. It was a mad, crazy, insanely generous act. No farmer or businessman in 1995 could have done reckless generosity in business very long. Imagine employing 100 workers, and you've got 50 of them who work a 12-hour day, and the other 50 work one hour a day. And on Friday, they all get the same check. I think a lot of us are still offended by the farmer's overpayment of the latecomers or the freeloaders. If you grew up as I did in the New York City area, you see what the welfare system has done to discourage initiative to actually encourage a happily married couple to legally divorce. Why? Under two separate roofs. You get two separate welfare checks. What has done to discourage youth from taking them in ways jobs? Why? More money from welfare. You're angry with the system is being ripped off. That's the response to the workers at Matthew 20. They go to the farm and say, see here, this is grossly unfair. We've been out there all day long in the scorching heat. Now you give the latecomers the same wage you're giving us. That is unjust. And the farmer replies, my friend, I do you know injustice. Didn't we agree to the wage of one denarius? Take your pay and go. Am I not free to do as I like with what's my own? Or are you envious because I'm generous? I'm telling you, the last will be first and the first last. As I travel around the country, speaking in all these different kinds of churches, it's astounding to discover how many Christians today are scandalized by the generosity of God. We're in, but they're out by God. They're out. In the last play that he wrote before his death, the great French play by Jean-Anneau describes the last judgment as he sees it. The good guys are just standing before the gate of heaven. They're keyed up, bursting with impatience, share their reserved seats. They can't wait to go marching in when suddenly a rumor starts. Look. Look. He's going to forgive them, too. What? Them? After all I've been through, they get forgiven? I can't believe it. Exasperated, they work themselves into a fury, and they start cursing God. Now it's the last judgment you see. They judged themselves. Excommunicated themselves. God appeared in Jesus in the form of an infinite, boundless, extravagant mercy, and they refused to acknowledge him. We simply don't approve of the heaven. It's not going to be Tom, Dick, and Harry. We spurn this God that lets everybody off. And because they could not transcend the limitations of their own finite expectations of who the Messiah should be, they could not recognize him in Jesus. And the same theme is replayed in what scholars call the pearl of the parables in Luke 15. You recall the prodigal law for the life of waste and wandering, boozing and womanizing, and returns not to the expected condemnation, but to a mercy of ill acquittal. You know, the father runs down the road, doesn't demand, where have you been, what have you been doing, but falls on his neck, kisses him. Put a ring on his finger, sandals on his feet, a new robe, kill the fatted calf, we're going to have a celebration. that is hardly an appropriate way to treat a delinquent kid the kid was spoiled right in the beginning he spoiled him again he's never going to change that's crazy behavior have you ever identified with the older brother in the story muttering to himself that rat fink thinking about if he's good and ready all the time I stay home that my father's not going to roast for that dingbat I mean I believe in being kind too but this is off the wall. My father's wacko. At any rate, the older brother, a serious, hardworking young man, didn't like it one bit. He saw love and grew indignant. He saw love and grew indignant. If you ever get the opportunity to spend Easter in France, whether you're in a large metropolitan area like Paris, Bordeaux, Dijon, or a little village like I lived in, the forest of Burgundy in San Remy, on Easter morning, you'll see this one phrase written on the sides of buildings, on the backs of buses. It's in block print. It's in script. It's graffiti. But you hear the same phrase sung, recited, chanted in all the Christian churches. In fact, on Easter morning, when Christians pass on the street, they exchange this one phrase as a greeting. L'amour de Dieu est folly. L'amour de Dieu est folly. L'amour de Dieu est folly. The love of God is folly, foolish, crazy, and Jesus says it's the folly that calls forth joy. In Matthew 20, the farmers appalled that the workers wouldn't celebrate his generosity. In Luke 15, the father of the product is brokenhearted that the older brother wouldn't come into the celebration. Jesus is saying that God is extravagantly loving and he calls for a joyous response from us. These two parables, among others, are both a revelation of real God and a call to conversion from us. Jesus' image of God assaults our invulnerable standards of justice, mercy, love, rectitude, fair play. The very foundations of our religion are being shaken. The depraved, good-for-nothing prodigal, preferred to his older, hard-working brother, celebration instead of punishment. What kind of lunatic justice is this that abolishes all our sacred standards, reverses all of rank, makes the last first the first last, and in the end, all get the same reward? I am not a universalist. I want to make it abundantly clear. Universalism is a heresy. It denies the saving power of Jesus' death and his resurrection. But the key operative word here tonight is stretch. Stretch your mind, stretch your heart to accommodate the God revealed by and in Jesus Christ. The parables of Jesus portray a God who is consistently over generous with his forgiveness and his grace. The secret of the mystery is God is always greater. In Matthew 18, Jesus says his God is like a magnanimous, merciful king, wiping out a debt the size of our national deficit. In Luke 7, Jesus said his God is a lender, generously canceling a debt, in this case, the lifetime sins of a hooker. In John 10, Jesus says his God leaves in 99 to go out in search of one lost and lonely. In Luke 18, Jesus says, his God hears the prayers of prostitutes and tax collectors. He hears the prayers of slumlords, drug dealers, hookers. Again and again, God is seen afresh by Jesus as a God of surpassing goodness and a boundless infinite mercy. My friends, I believe that Christianity happens when men and women experience the reckless, raging confidence that comes from knowing, that comes from experiencing the God of Jesus Christ. With this God, there is no need to be wary, no need to be scrupulous, and no need to be afraid. In his first letter, John writes, In love there can be no fear, for fear is driven out by perfect love. to fear is to expect punishment. And anybody here who's afraid doesn't know Jesus. You're imperfect in love. I came across an image of God in secular literature that is so much closer to the rantings and ravings of a lot of our televangelists. It's in a novel called Letters to Greco, written by Nikos Cousinsakis. The scene is an old man dying in a hovel, filled with guilt, shame, remorse, because of the sins of his past life, mostly sexual, and he's terrified at the prospect of judgment. When the old guy dies, he goes before the judgment seat of the Lord. At Jesus' right hand is a big bowl of aromatic oil. Jesus dips a sponge into the bowl of aromatic oil and wipes this frightened old man clean of his fear and his guilt and his shame. And then Jesus says to the old guy, don't bother me with that stuff. Now come over and play. And for many of us, the good news is simply too good to be true. Why? Because the love of God embodied in Jesus is radically different from our natural human way of loving. When I love as a man, I'm drawn, I'm attracted to certain persons and things. For example, I love the Jersey Shore and Clearwater Beach at Sunset. I love Handel's Messiah, Hot Fudge Sundees, my wife Rosalyn. There's a common denominator that are a common dynamic in all of them. I'm drawn, I'm attracted to certain qualities in persons and things that I find congenial and appealing. So, what I love as a man, I love someone for what I find in him or her. But unlike ourselves, the God and Father of Jesus loves men and women, not for what he finds in them, but for what he finds in himself. It is not because men and women are good that he loves them, nor only good men and women that he loves. It's because he's so unspeakably, unutterably, unimaginably good that the God and Father of Jesus loves all men and women, even sinners. He does not detect what is congenial, attractive, and appealing, then respond to it with his favor, he doesn't respond at all, for the God of Jesus is a source. He acts. He does not react. He initiates love. He's love without motive. And because his love is creative, it originates good rather than rewarding it. That's why St. Augustine could write those lyrical lines, qui amastime fecistime amabilem. In loving me, you made me lovable. Why is Brennan Manning lovable in the eyes of God? because 39 years ago I committed my life to Jesus, because since 1963 I've roamed the country of the world preaching the gospel? Am I lovable because back home in New Orleans I work on Skid Row at the Bridge House with alcoholics and addicts? Am I lovable because I spend two hours a day in prayer? Does God love me because I tithe to the poor, because I have been ruthlessly faithful to my wife in our marriage? if I believe that I'm a Pharisee then I feel I'm entitled to be comfortably close to Christ because of my good works and the gospel of grace says Brennan God loves you for one reason only because he wants to period hard as this is for us to grasp because we neither give nor receive love among ourselves in this fashion yet we believe because of the life, death and resurrection of the carpenter Messiah, that his God, his Father, is more loving, forgiving, and cherishing than Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob ever would have dreamt. All these words of mine, simply to restate what it says in every page of the New Testament, that the God and Father of Jesus is gracious. He loves us in a way that defies human comprehension, escapes human imitation. The secret of the mystery, God is always greater. And that is why I can stand here tonight and with theological certainty in the power of the word proclaim, God loves you unconditionally as you are and not as you should be because nobody in the auditorium is as they should be. Do you believe this with all the wrong turns you made in your past, the mistakes, the detours, the moments of sin, selfishness, dishonesty, and degraded love? God has used them all to bring you here tonight and the word says you are standing on holy ground. Do you truly believe that the God and Father of Jesus loves you beyond worthiness and unworthiness, beyond fidelity and infidelity, that he loves you in the morning sun and the evening rain, without caution, regret, boundary limit, or breaking point, no matter what's gone down, he can't stop loving you. If you don't believe that, you are into the psychological defense mechanism of projection. You are attributing a God, your own hostile feelings toward yourself. You are into illusion, superstition, cowardice. You are worshiping a God of human manufacturing. There is one God of the Christian life, the God enfleshed in Jesus Christ, who loves us as we are and not as we should be. Biblically, to believe in the love of God means to accept, Not as a head trip, a concept, a cognitive idea, but with my head and my heart that God loves me in a creative, intimate, unique, reliable, and tender way. Creative. I live as though I came forth. Through his love I'm sustained in existence. My next heartbeat is a loving gift from my father's hand. His love is intimate. Do you have a skeleton in your closet from your past life and you pray, please, God, don't let anybody ever find out about that? Something so shameful your palms start to perspire when you think about it? The intimate love of God reaches into that dark place. You know in the Bible, reconciliation is not primarily making peace with somebody else. It's first of all making peace in that part of yourself where you could never find peace before. Such is the intimate love of God. His love is unique, meaning God loves me not as you think I am or as I think I'm supposed to be, but as I really am. And the real Brennan Manning is a bundle of paradoxes and contradictions. I believe in God with all my heart, but on a given day when I see a little three-year-old girl slaughtered by a drunken driver, I wonder if he exists. I trust him. I get discouraged. I love. I hate. I feel bad about feeling good. I feel guilt if I don't feel guilty. I'm wide open. I'm locked in. I'm trusting and suspicious. I'm honest and I still play games. Aristotle said I'm a rational animal. I say I'm an angel with an incredible capacity for beer. That's the real Brennan. And God's unique love reached out to embrace me in my uniqueness. just as I am and not as I should be. His love is reliable, meaning it has never let me down. I'm sure if we had a chance to share your life story with mine, we'd discover remarkable similarity, at least in one respect. Our lives have been a celebration of God's faithfulness in good times and in bad. Just a little over 20 years ago, it was April Fool's Day, 1975. I woke up in a doorway on Commercial Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. about 7 o'clock in the morning, and I woke up in an alcoholic fog, sniffing and vomiting over my sweater, standing at my bare feet, didn't know why not stole my shoes during the night to buy a bottle of Thunderbird, and coming along the sidewalk is a woman, maybe, 25 years old, with blonde hair, an attractive woman, and she had a 4-year-old son in her hand. The boy broke loose from his mother's grip, ran over the doorway, stared down at me. His mother came out quickly behind him, cupped her hand over his eyes, and said, Don't look at that filth. All that is is pure filth. And 20 years ago, that filth was Brennan Manning. Now, Jesus, I've come to know. The God I've met in my own journey loved me as much that morning in the state of disgrace as he does tonight in the state of grace. For his love is never, never, never based on our performance. His love knows no shadow of alteration or change. his love is reliable the secret of the mystery God is always greater and quit projecting onto God your own negative feelings toward yourself his love is tender tenderness is what happens to you when you know you're deeply and sincerely liked by somebody if you communicate to me while I'm here at Open Door that you really like me not just love me as a brother in Christ but really like me, then you open up to me the possibility of liking myself, accepting myself, loving myself. The look in your eyes banishes my fears and my defense mechanism like sarcasm, ridicule, the put-down, name-dropping, giving you the appearance I got it all together. All that falls away. If I sense you like me, I'll become more open, sincere, vulnerable, and affectionate with you than I'd ever dream of being, and I thought you didn't like me. What happens is I grow tender. My friend Ed Farrell in Detroit goes on his two-week summer vacation to Ireland, and the reason, his uncle is celebrating his 80th birthday. On the morning of the great day, Ed Farrell and his uncle get up before dawn. They get dressed in silence in the darkness, and they go for a walk around the shores of Lake Killarney. Just as the sun is about to rise, his uncle turns, and he stares straight at the rising sun. Ed Farrell didn't know what to do. He stands beside his uncle, shoulder to shoulder, 24 minutes, not a word exchange, and then his uncle, his 80-year-old uncle, goes skipping down the road. He's beaming, radiant, smiling ear to ear, and Ed Farrell said, Uncle Seamus, you really look happy. He said, I am, lad. You want to tell me why? yes yes you see the father is very fond of me oh my father is so very fond of me if I asked you right now do you really believe God likes you not loves you because theologically God has to love you it's true God loves by necessity of nature without the eternal interior generation of love God has ceased to be God if I ask do you really believe he likes you and with gut level honesty you can reply oh yes the father is very fond of me there would come a relaxedness a serenity a compassionate attitude toward yourself and you'd be very close to what I described I have one of my books out in the lobby as living each day in the wisdom of accepted tenderness. Living one day at a time in the wisdom of accepted tenderness. But there's a nagging question here. Won't the awareness that God loves me no matter what lead to a life of moral laziness and spiritual laxity? I mean, if God is going to live in such a reckless, crazy, foolish fashion, why should I even try to live an upright life? Why should I be out there laboring in the vein while others stand around all day idle? God's going to live in my mind when it comes down, right? Theoretically, it appears to be a valid question. But in reality, the very opposite is true. I'm on the road the last 20 years, about 210, 220 days a year. And 99% of the time, like here, I'm staying in a hotel or a motel. Back home in New Orleans, I know my wife, Rosalyn, knowing all my warts and flaws, loves me as I am and not as I should be. When I'm on the road, honest to God, the last thing on my mind is going down to the cocktail lounge at 11 o'clock at night to find some lonely lady who needs comfort or consolation. The last thing on my mind is adultery, infidelity, betrayal, doing my own thing. For me, doing my own thing means responding to Rosalind's love in sovereign freedom because love calls forth love. Love calls forth love. the more rooted we are in the unconditional love of God, the more grounded we are in the relentless tenderness of Jesus Christ, the more generously we live our faith, we act it out one day at a time. It is the awareness of being loved. And that's so crucial, the word awareness. To center down, become aware of the presence, and to realize that I already have what I seek. I'm not reaching out for something I don't already possess. I'm not trying to get anywhere in prayer. I'm already there. I'm just becoming aware of the awesome, overwhelming, tender love of God for me. And that awareness empowers me to love myself without excuses, without questioning, with all the hang-ups and weaknesses. If God is going to accept me in my brokenness as I am, am I going to demand more of myself than he does? It is the awareness of being loved that enables us to transcend ourselves and to overcome all this legalistic, I've got to change my life. Randy Manning's over there at Bethel. I'm going to go over. I've got to have some kind of a shattering conversion experience. I've got to. I must. I should. I should. I really should. That's the key operative word of the ego self. I should, I should, I should. Got this dear friend in New Orleans, Mary Michael O'Shaughnessy, remarkable woman, doctorate in scripture, doctorate in psychology. Go to her home, huge banner on her wall. You know what the words on it say? Today, I will not should on myself. I will not should on myself. When her friends say, Mary Michael, you should go back in the classroom, you should take a vacation, she says, don't should on me. The awareness of being loved moves us beyond those oppressive demands of the ego self, and it also empowers us with the courage to risk becoming our authentic self rather than a carbon copy of somebody else. To become the unique singular manifestation of truth, goodness, and beauty that God had in mind when he made you. There are no two snowflakes alike. There are no personalities alike. are utterly unique and to fulfill your destiny. It's the courage that comes through the awareness of being loved to risk becoming you and not somebody else. If you knew my life story, you know for 21 years I tried desperately to become Brother Teresa. I've lived around the world in grinding poverty, depersonalizing squalor. As I mentioned yesterday, They live voluntarily in the prison in Freiburg, Switzerland. Live in the garbage dump in Juarez, Mexico for weeks at a time. Three and four children dying daily of malnutrition, polluted water. Old men, 80 years old, picking off mounds of garbage 40 feet high, trying to find something to eat. Live with 11 and 12-year-old prostitutes, boys and girls in New York City at the Covenant House. Some of them could never believe that God could love me as I am, but if I became a replica of Mother Teresa or Francis of Assisi, they didn't love me. But it's the awareness of being loved that gives you the power to risk becoming your authentic self rather than a carbon of somebody else. My spiritual director in New Orleans, Larry Hine, knows me better than I know myself. I go out to make a silent three-day retreat. The first night, as always, I go to his room. He asks, where have you been on the journey? I tell him. And this night he says, Brennan, I've got a word from the Lord for you. Now, I take that very seriously. He's only said that twice in the 20 years I've known him. I lean forward and I say, yes. He said, Brennan, actually, this word from the Lord came through an old black evangelical preacher on a red clay road in Georgia. I said, great. What's the word? He said, the word is, be who you is, because if you ain't who you is, then you is who you ain't. Boy, what wisdom in that. Be who you is, because if you ain't who you is, then you is who you ain't. Do you see why the scriptures attach so much importance to knowing God? To knowing and experience. You know, Joseph did not know Mary, had no sexual relation with her, did not experience. The Scripture, so much importance to knowing God. Why? Because healing our image of God heals our image of ourselves. Yahweh says to his prophet Hosea, my people are fools. They know me not. It's love I desire, not sacrifice, and knowledge. Knowledge. Knowledge, experiential knowledge of God, and not Holocaust. My friends, I hope it's not arrogant of me to say this, But in my own mind, the word I'm speaking tonight is the most important word I've ever spoken since I began preaching the gospel in May of 1963. This message of healing our image of God, healing our image of ourselves, stretching ourselves to accommodate the... Why is this so important? Because only through it will you ever come to terms with the central mystery of our faith, the incarnation. God draws aside the curtain of eternity, steps into human history in the man Jesus. And now the wild, passionate, furious, pursuing, relentless, furious love of God has a face, a pair of hands and feet. It's a voice so we can hear it. This is the whole purpose of the incarnation. As John writes in the prologue of his gospel, we have seen his glory. The glory of an only son filled with enduring love. Paul, who understood the mind of Christ better than any man who has ever lived, writes to the Ephesians, May Christ dwell in your heart through faith, and may love be the root and foundation of your life. Then you will be able, with all the saints, to grasp the breadth, the length, the height, the depth of Christ's love, which is beyond all knowledge. Do you hear what Paul is saying? The love of Christ is beyond all knowledge. Stretch, man, stretch. Let go of your impoverished, circumscribed, finite, limited human perceptions, your understanding of God conditioned by stories from your family of origin, your church. Let go of all that. Until Paul says you are filled with the utter fullness of God. my friends that's the message of jesus concerning god sorry about an equivalent point here there but i'm sure this among the biblical scholars of the churches there is no debate this is the essence of the good news in healing our image of god jesus frees us of fear of the father and dislike of ourselves it's a beautiful consoling attractive message, the all religious image of a vindictive, angry, punitive God gives way in Jesus to a God who cherishes all people, even sinners. Jesus presents a God who does not demand, but gives, who does not oppress, but raises up, who does not wound, but heals, who does not condemn, but forgives. Woe then to those, woe then to those who wound, oppress, condemn, and punish in his name. It can only be said, they do not know the God of Jesus Christ. Do you know him? And about him, do you know him? Have you experienced him? You know, this is true. Every one of us makes our image of God. But it's even truer, our images of God make us, and we start to behave like the God we image. Not too long ago, I went through a healing of memories. The very gifted woman out in Lafayette, Louisiana. At our first meeting, she asked me, Brenna, go back into your past life as far as you can. What is your first conscious memory? I thought for a few minutes, I said my fourth birthday. She said, why do you remember that? I said, well, my mother allowed me to have a birthday party. She said, why? I said she'd never have one before, but it's kind of awkward to tell you this, but our hometown newspaper, the Brooklyn Eagle, had a contest for the best-looking three-year-old boy in the city. When I was three, I was small, really chubby, curly gold hair, the big blue eyes. My mother submits my picture. I won the contest. I admit it was a lean year for three-year-olds in Brooklyn. but my mother gets 25 bucks and back you know in the 30s that's big buck oops forgot you don't say that anymore big bucks is out the new yuppie phrase is major coin yeah she generates major coin man she's a player she's a player well my mother's got the big bucks the Major Cohen. She said I could have a party, but she wouldn't let me invite any children. Instead, she invited four married couples who were friends of her and my father. I say this without a trace of bitterness or recrimination, but I had never known a moment of love for my mother. Whatever she had, she saved for my brother. And as the firstborn, I have no memory of being happy. held, hugged, touched, kissed, embraced as a little boy. I have no memory of ever being told I was good. I remember beatings. Most of all, I remember being ignored. My mother would come home from work, and she would walk into the house. I'd be sitting there in the dark by myself in a rocking chair, and she would never say hello. One day, I slipped into her bedroom. My mother's an RN, and an extremely gifted, dynamic woman, Very good at what she does. She came home from work around and she found me in her bedroom. I'd taken all her paste jewelry and spread it out on the floor. I was just fascinated by all the sparkly stuff. My mother walked in and she was livid. She screamed, God is going to get you for that and get you good. My mother was behaving like the God she imaged. We had a long reconciliation in 1984 after my mother threatened suicide when I married. But it was wonderful the last, my mother died in January this year. And the last 10 years, 10 and a half years were just wonderful. Well, the birthday party began. All these adults who hadn't seen me since we went from baptism, they come into the house and they're looking at me and they hadn't seen me since I was so tiny. They're picking me up and they're hugging me and they're telling me I'm beautiful and I'm wonderful. I am like a little sponge. I mean, suck it up. Every bit of attention, like an infection I get. And my mother said in a strong voice, that is disgusting. Stop it. Well, I stopped it. We go to the dining room table. I'm allowed to sit at one end with a little birthday hat on top of my head. My father's at the other end, and then my mother and these other couples. A latecomer, a guy, comes in by himself, greets nobody, walks over to my chair, picks me up, throws me in the air, pulls me down, kisses me on the forehead to the eye, the nose, the mouth, the cheek, And he says, you are the most wonderful little boy I have ever seen in my life. I wish you were my son. I would take you home with me right now. Well, I began, I mean, to act out. I'm slobbering all over him. I'm licking his nose and licking his hair and licking his hair. And in a quiet voice, my mother said, why do you always shame me in front of my friends? Your birthday party's over. Go to bed. This ghastly Paul falls over the table. Like a little drunken sailor, I'm wandering over to the bedroom door, hoping I'd get a reprieve, knowing I wouldn't. My mother said, shut the door behind you. I shut the door. It's pitch black in the bedroom, and I'm too short to reach the light switch on the wall, and I started to cry. And then for some reason, the idea of taking off my clothes and being naked in the dark was even more frightening. So I left my clothes on. I hunted around the door. I found my pajamas. I put my pajamas on over my clothes, crawled into bed, pulled up the covers, and a thought hit me, my mother's going to come in right now, and she's going to demand I give back the birthday hat because I acted bad out there. And, I mean, I treasured that little birthday hat. It was the first symbol that I was noticed, that I was recognized, that there was something worthy of attention and affection in me. I took the birthday hat off. I shoved it under the pillow, and I said to myself, I'll just lie to my mother. I'll tell her I lost it, or I don't know where it is. Well, in the healing of memories, there I am, four years old, lying on the bed, covers up, I feel a hand on my shoulder, I look up, it's my Heavenly Father. I said, hi. He said, hi. Where's your birthday hat? I said, under the pillow. he said sit up and put it on took the hat off the pillow sat up put it on he reached out and he held me he said now hear me well no one will ever take your birthday head from you again and no one will ever tear you from my hand well I felt this great wave of peace but then the guilt and I said Abba I gotta tell you the truth I was acting up out there I don't blame my mother, but the worst thing is, I was going to lie to my own mother until I lost my birthday hat. You know what my Heavenly Father said to me? The same word he spoke 40 years later when I was a broken down drunk in the gutter. Drinking a quart of vodka day, a bum on the streets of Latter-day. Finally went off to treatment, covered with shame, guilt, fear. And the first time I tried to pray, it was the same word I heard 40 years earlier on my fourth birthday. He said, Don't bother me with that stuff. Now come over and play. this is the only God I know the way he's revealed himself in my own life and sent me to go share that word with you I think everything I want to say tonight is capsulized and said much more briefly and powerfully by a Jew that I grew up with in Brooklyn who lived in Flatbush. And we played in opposing basketball teams, and neither of us very good, so we spent a lot of time on the bench, and we commiserated with one another. Then we had this real wide range of mutual interests, especially in reading these various authors. We eventually moved to California and became quite famous. In 1978, he won an Oscar in Hollywood for either the screenplay for the movie Network. He won an Oscar 30 years earlier at the age of 26 for writing Marty. Paddy Shiafsky, God rest me, three years now, dead three years, was a brilliant, creative, poetic, imaginative Jew who in his own words said, I've lived my life as if God did not exist. It's been a life of boozing and using every person, situation, institution for my own selfish advantage. If there's a God out there, I know I'm going straight to hell. One night, Paddy's in his Park Avenue apartment in New York City writing a play for Broadway. The living God broke through the window, broke into Patty Shafi's heart, and he experienced the relentless tenderness, the passionate, pursuing, furious love of God for him and his brokenness and his sinfulness just about blew Patty out the window. You know what he did? He tore up everything he'd been writing, sat at his desk for 25 days, never left the apartment, wrote a new play, which energy ran on Broadway for three full years, very successful, and the play is entitled Gideon. In the play, Shiaski projects into the lead character, Gideon, his own dramatic encounter with God. Happens to Gideon, he's out in the desert in his tent, hundreds of miles from civilization, and feeling utterly forlorn, cast off, abandoned, rejected by God with good reason. He's lived such a lecherous, rotten, egotistical, mean-spirited, ugly life, he says, if there's a God, I'll go right to the fiery pit. Well, that night, the God who made the play of this in the Orion comes tearing into the tent, And Gideon, in the bowels of despair and self-hatred and shame, experiences the unconditional love of God for him as he is and not as he should be. For Gideon, it is his born-again moment. It is his baptism in the Holy Spirit. He is swept up to an ecstasy, a paroxysm of joy. He can't sleep. All night long, he paces back and forth in the tent, up and down, again and again. finally dawn breaks the first chapter of the Sunday comes into the tent and Gideon in his Brooklyn Jewish accent cries out God oh God well not long I told him nothing but you nothing but you I caught up in the absence of the love if I take you to my tent I'll wrap you up, keep you all to myself hey hey God tell me that you love me God answers I love you Gideon tell me again God I love you Gideon Gideon scratches his head I do not understand I do not understand this why? why do you love me? and God scratches his head and answers I really don't know. And then God adds, sometimes passion is unreasonable. Yes, sometimes, my Gideon, passion is unreasonable. That's the God of Israel. That's the God of Christians. That's the God revealed by and in Jesus of Nazareth. That is the God of the Christian vision from which all change, all growth, all maturity, all transparency will flow. Would you gently close your eyes? Join me in prayer. Once again in unselfconscious freedom. Forget anybody on your right or your left in front of me behind you. sink down in the center of your soul and become aware of the presence of Jesus. Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, our brother, our Savior, our friend. Tonight you call us to stretch. To overcome our impoverished, circumscribed, finite, limited, human perception of God. And to enter deeply into the mystery that God is always greater. Jesus we want that and yet we find resistance Jesus this moment come and lay your healing hand upon each one of us set us free from the dark spirits of cynicism of skepticism from the bondage of unbelief Lord Jesus set your people free and deliver us from any negative spirit of shame, self-condemnation, self-hatred, remorse, and guilt over the broken syllables in the paragraph of our past lives. Jesus set us free from those legalistic images of God who we may have gotten from our family of origin, from our church. Lord Jesus this night plunge us into the mystery that no matter how great we believe the love of God is his love is always greater Amen. My God, when I in all some wonder consider all the worlds thy hands have made. I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, the power throughout the universe displays. When through the woods and forest glades I wonder, I hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees. When I look down from lofty mountain brand new And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze Then sings my soul, my Savior God to me How great the Lord, how great the Lord Then sings my Son, my Savior God to me How great the heart, how great the heart And when I think that God is so not sparing Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in. That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin. When Christ shall come With shouts of acclamation And take me home What joy shall fill my heart Then I shall bow In humble adoration And they proclaim My God, how great the Lord Praise is my soul My Savior, come to me How great thou art How great thou art When sings my soul I sing a song to thee How great thou art How great thou art I'd encourage you for your night prayer tonight before you go to bed. Just to spend a few minutes with Isaiah 43, 1 through 5. And tomorrow morning for morning prayer, Psalm 103. Tonight's prayer, Isaiah 43, 1 through 5. And tomorrow morning, Psalm 103. I was asked to repeat a blessing I gave yesterday to somebody here in the community. written by my spiritual director Larry Hine. May all your expectations be frustrated. May all your plans be thwarted. May all your desires be withered into nothingness that you may experience the powerlessness and poverty of a child and sing and dance in the love of God. who is Father, Son, and Spirit. Amen. Amen.
