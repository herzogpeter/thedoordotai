We are this morning entering into the sixth week of a seven-week series that has come to be known by us as the marks of false spiritual leadership. The issue that has been raised in this series is the issue of spiritual abuse. All of this began back in chapter 21 when just two days previously, although it feels like a long time ago, more than two days, two days previous to the events that we're discussing right now. Jesus entered into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey. They wanted to crown him as the king. They didn't understand the kingdom, however, that he was bringing. And then when it became clear that he did not come to destroy Rome, but he came rather to confront the people of God when he went to the temple and turned over the tables, a war began. The Pharisees, the scribes, the leaders of the temple began to come to Jesus all through chapter 22, if you recall, bringing him questions and insinuations and accusations designed to discredit Jesus and separate him somehow from his following. He answered every one of their questions, turned things back around on them, and in the end all of them were silenced. But in chapter 23, it is very clear that Jesus was not silenced. As he launched out onto this assault of this system of religion that was presenting itself as God's truth, but instead was defiling the truth of God. In verses 1 through 12, we are very aware by now that he is revealing for us and for them the characteristics of a false system and a false leader. First of all, you need to know they operate with a false basis of authority. They lack integrity. They say things, but they do not do what they say. False systems and false leaders tie heavy weights on people and don't do anything to lift it off. They wear their religion on the outside. They do what they do to be noticed by men, and they require the accolades of people. And then we discovered that past revealing these characteristics of false leaders and false systems, in verses 13 and following, he then began to reveal the impact of these characteristics upon people, especially people who are pursuing after God. These characteristics, Jesus is saying, that I have given to you in verses 1 through 12, do more than indicate a difference in leadership style. They do more than simply indicate a minor character flaw that might need some subtle adjustments. These characteristics, when you see them in a person, in a leader, or see them in a system, they have the power to shut off the kingdom from people who are trying to get into the kingdom. They have the power to devour people. They have the power to reproduce their disease into the people that they convert. They don't talk straight. They invert spiritual values. And if you're in a system like that, pretty soon your spiritual values will begin to get inverted. You'll start straining at gnats and swallowing camels. Things that aren't important will become of paramount importance. And things that really matter will go by the wayside. These systems spiritually rape people. They contaminate everyone who comes near. And today, Jesus is saying on top of everything else that these systems do, What they bring upon themselves, whether they understand it or not, is they bring upon themselves the wrath of God. And with an unsettling yet an undeniable vengeance, Jesus in verse 31 of our study begins to bring the hammer down. Consequently, verse 31, you bear witness against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up then the measure of the guilt of your fathers you serpents, you brood of vipers how shall you escape the sentence of hell? Therefore behold I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes some of them you will kill and crucify some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute that simply means to pursue or to chase from city to city from church to church from synagogue to synagogue that upon you may fall the guilt of all righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Truly I say to you, all of these things, all of these judgments shall come upon this generational generation. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her, how often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you were unwilling. The result of that, behold, is that your house is being left to you desolate. For I say to you that from now on you shall not see me until you say these words, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. I'm going to break this text through verse 39 into three parts. The first part is the wrath of God revealed. The second part is the grief of God expressed. That's going to be in verse 37 and 38. The grace of God is extended in verse 39. We are only going to get this morning as far as the wrath of God revealed in verses 32 through 36. The wrath of God revealed. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I pray in your name that your spirit would be at work in a powerful way among us to bring the word forth with clarity, with power, with truth, with the same weight that was brought to bear upon this when it was originally said, that God, we would be able to receive this and understand it and hear your voice. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. The wrath of God. The wrath of God. It's not something we talk a lot about. Quite frankly, it's an aspect of the character of God that we don't particularly enjoy looking at. It's not my favorite sermon topic. Some people, in considering the wrath of God, would indeed like to deny the fact of its existence. The fact, however, is that the wrath of God is real. The judgment of God is sure. The fact is this, that Jesus is not just the Lamb of God who comes to take away the sin of the world. He is also the Lion of Judah. The picture I have even in my mind of this particular drama is that of Jesus entering Jerusalem, and he enters Jerusalem among all of the accolades of men, but he personally was entering as a lamb. Remember the picture? He was riding not even on a donkey, which would be humble enough. He rode in on the baby, the colt of a donkey, and it spoke of his gentleness. It spoke of his humility. But now, just two days later, we've got a different picture of this Jesus who one day, just two days previously, rode in with all this humility. Now he is standing in the courtyard of the Gentiles, and it is very much the picture of a lion unleashed. You see, the truth is that as I've gone through this and I've allowed this to go over my heart a little bit, it's dawned on me that for us to really understand the fullness of God's grace and really get a glimpse of the fullness and the extent of his mercy, it doesn't hurt at all to get a little glimpse of his wrath. get an understanding of these things as we begin to dig into this text however there is something that i need to make abundantly clear and that is the object of the wrath that we are about to talk about we need to have it very clear in our mind that this wrath that i am going to make explicit as i can and this text makes very explicit the wrath that is about to be spoken of the object of it is not broken people broken people get what broken people who are saying my only hope is Jesus get the kingdom. It is not being directed to mourning people who are getting out here what is in here. They're quitting all the pretending. They're quitting all the sham and they're beginning to mourn over their sin and get outside what is inside. Mourning people get comfort. They don't get wrath. Keep that in mind as we go through this. This is not being directed to repentant people. It's not being directed to hungry people who've realized that they need a righteousness that they can't produce and they're hungering for a righteousness that only God can give, they get satisfied. This is not being spoken to bruised reeds and smoldering wicks. This judgment is, however, being directed to people who in the name of God have bruised the reeds and have snuffed out the fire of the life of God in the hearts and the minds of people who are trying to find out who God was. There's two things about this wrath that's directed to those kind of people that we need to know. The first thing about his wrath directed to these kinds of people is that his wrath is personal. His wrath is personal. The second thing we're going to discover this morning is that his wrath directed toward these kinds of systems and these kind of people is cumulative. It is cumulative. It builds and builds and builds and builds. It's personal. Let's look at that piece first. Simply read the verses, verse 32 and 33, gives you a feel for it. Fill up then the measure of the guilt of your fathers, you serpents, you brood of vipers. How shall you escape the sentence of hell? Without digging into the text at all, telling you what words mean at all, there is already a tone here that indicates to us that what he's saying is personal. There are feelings involved. We need to understand from the beginning that these words are not some dispassionate, objective, judicial edict. That is somehow without emotion where he is just kind of giving a decision, but it's really not about you. It is about you, he's saying here. He is angry. There is no careful objectivity. There is no simple giving of consequences. Again, all the time saying it isn't about you. It is about you. I'm really angry about what you've done to the people who are looking for me. Jesus says here, I'm really angry that you have used my name to promote your plan. you snakes, you vipers, you brood of vipers, you're going to burn in hell. It sounds personal to me. Let's examine the text a little bit. Pick apart some of the phrases. Fill up, then, the measure. Stop right there. Fill up, then, the measure. Fill up, fill up. This is a term that's used all through Scripture. The picture that is being created here is filling up a cup, filling up a goblet, filling up a bowl or some sort of large pot. And the term of filling up a cup or a goblet in Scripture is always used to speak of sin, filling up the cup. Judgment, filling up the cup. Wrath, filling up the cup. Revelation speaks of the cup of God's wrath. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, the Old Testament prophets also spoke of the cup of sin and the cup of wrath. And the way it worked was that the cup of sin that you filled up with your sin, that cup of sin turned into a cup of wrath. And that cup of wrath that you filled up with your sin then gets poured on you. Jesus in the garden said this, Let this cup pass from me in the picture of a cup. Again, it was a cup that was filled with agony. It was a cup that was filled with judgment. It was a cup that was filled with fury. This isn't a pretty picture. I get all these bizarre pictures. But as I was going through this, I had this picture of old movies that I used to watch and still like to watch of some group protecting their fort, their castle. And on top of the castle, there's this great big pot of oil. Remember that? And they would pour the hot oil, and I'd go, Oh, I don't like that picture, but it works for me. Fill up the cup. What's unsettling after I understand what he's talking about when he talks about filling up the cup of sin that can turn into a cup of wrath that will fall on you, what then becomes unsettling about what he's saying here is that when I look at the syntax of this, I understand that he is saying this in the imperative, Meaning this, he is commanding them to do it. Fill it up, you guys. What he's saying there is do it. Keep on doing it. All this abuse, all this pretend, all this putting heavy weights on it, just keep that up. Fill it up. I want you to keep doing that. I don't get that. Why would he command them to do that? Picture you need to get, whether we like it or not, or whether we're comfortable with it or not, is this. He's saying this, you know what? If you guys do this much spiritual abuse, And if you tie heavy weights on my people this much I'm going to give you this much judgment. I'm going to give you this much wrath. If you do this much abuse I'm going to give you this much wrath. If you do this much abuse I'm going to give you this much wrath. So do some more abuse because I want to give you some more wrath. It's personal. Fill it up. Do it. Keep it up. Keep lying. Keep making it external. Keep making it a big sham. Keep it up. Because I'm laying for you. I don't like that picture. Again, I get these bizarre pictures. It's the spiritual equivalent of Clint Eastwood looking down the barrel of his.357. Go ahead. Make my day. Keep it up. Keep it up. Keep on speaking, as it were, for me. But you're not speaking for me. Your divining lies saying the Lord has spoken what I haven't spoken. Keep it up. It's personal. He's not calling here for more sin, but he is revealing in some very earthy terms that I take it personal. I take it personally when you abuse my sheep. When people who are trying to enter into the kingdom of God and searching for me get lied to, I really get angry. Verse 34 and 35 affirms the same sense when he says, I'm sending to you prophets, wise men, scribes. You're going to kill them. You're going to scourge them. You're going to chase them from city to city, from church to church. You're going to kick them out of your church, out of your temple. But I'm doing that. I'm sending you these guys so that upon you will fall the guilt of righteous blood. I'm not sending you these prophets so that you'll respond and be redeemed because you won't listen. You're going to kill them. You're going to ignore them. The reason I'm sending them to you is so that upon you will fall the guilt of all the righteous blood. Not just yours, but all the righteous blood. So keep it up. So fill up the cup. I don't know if this helps you or not, but again, I get these goofy pictures on human levels that, like the Clint Eastwood thing, I mean, that works for me. There's another picture I've got of this if you're struggling with, you know, how could he be so angry? And I want Jesus to be a little baby for Christmas. And nice. the thing that worked for me in terms of being able to enter into this and understand it was was watching a movie here i'm watching this movie and in this movie it's the kind of movie i like there's also you know there's all sorts of action and crazy stuff and there's some fiend in this movie who's been getting away with it the whole movie and he's been getting away with it and getting away with it and he's been ripping people off and he's been robbing people he's been raping people he's been killing people and devouring people and and and he's just he just keeps on doing it and near the end of the movie something happens near the end of the movie the good guy starts to rise up and the guns start to blaze and it blows everybody away and the audience goes nuts get him get him yeah you maybe you don't do that I do that I'm telling you there's even this you know go get that guy rip him apart don't kill him fast come slow you know I just love it whoa I love it there's a little old lady next to me yeah she's doing it too the judgment's coming down on the abusers the judgment is coming down on the evil one again to get the picture full we've seen it before this is not a new thing way back in Matthew chapter 13 Jesus was was dealing with the disciples and preparing them for the ministry that they were going to have to do in the world and he was trying to prepare them for the fact that the kingdom in its fullness had not come because that was what they were expecting and he said the kingdom of heaven that you're going to minister in is like a field and in this field the field being the entire world God moved or the landowner moved and he sowed good things and then I hear God saying in the beginning in Genesis and he created everything and it was good it was good but the enemy came and he oversold that which was good and he brought evil and he brought pain and he brought death, and he brought sin. And then all the servants in the field looked at this field, again, which is the world. And so all the servants of God come to God and look at the world and go, what kind of world did you make? What kind of field? What kind of farmer are you? What kind of God are you? Did you sow bad field in the seed? And God, the landowner, says, I didn't sow that. An enemy has done this. And by the way, it is not time right now to go and pull all the tears up. It is not time to eradicate evil. You're going to have to minister in that context, and I'm going to give you power to do that. But there is going to be pain, and there is going to be suffering, and there is going to be death. But one day, I'm going to say to my angels to go and gather up all that is evil, and they will be burned. In verse 40 of that chapter, it says, Therefore, just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send forth His angels. They will gather out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks. That's interesting in light of what we've been talking about. He will gather all the stumbling blocks, all the people who got in the way of people who were trying to get to God. Those are the stumbling blocks and those who commit lawlessness. And He will gather all of them and cast them into the furnace of fire. In that place, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. I'm going to make it right is what He's saying about pain and sin and death. And in that day the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. And we will be going, get him, get it, get it, clean it up, do it right. It's personal. It's personal. That personal flavor of this judgment is affirmed again in the next verse. When it says, you serpents, you brood of vipers, you snakes. Snakes, the word serpent there is the general term for snake, any old snake. He gets a little more specific when he says viper. Echidno is the Greek word there. Not just a viper, but a brood of vipers, a whole pack of them. We've done teaching on vipers before. I don't want to go into that deeply, but the reason the choice of a viper and calling these people vipers was significant was because a viper looked harmless. Remember, they were in the desert. They generally gathered in the cool of a cave, the cool of the shade of a tree. And they looked, they were short little snakes in black, and they looked like little sticks. Remember that? And it was very normal for people to kind of put their hand in a pile of sticks, thinking that they could take these sticks out, build a fire, warm themselves by the fire, cook their food to nourish themselves. These little sticks would be helpful. They stick their hand into this pile of sticks they think are going to be helpful. It's not a stick at all. It's a viper. It attaches itself. It injects its venom and it doesn't let go. It is deadly dangerous. That's an incredible picture of a Pharisee who on the outside looks like a helpful stick. This guy is going to be able to warm me. This guy is going to be able to nourish me. But you put your hand on that thing to pick it up and it latches on, injects its venom, and doesn't let go. It's deadly dangerous. How shall you escape the sentence of hell? You won't. First thing you need to know about the wrath of God as it's directed to the people we've been talking about for the last five weeks is this. His wrath, His anger toward those systems is personal, and those people is personal. The second thing is that it's cumulative. It's cumulative. Verse 34, what is this? Therefore, stop right there, therefore. What does therefore mean? Well, we've done this long enough to know that any time you see a therefore, it kind of kicks you back. Literally, therefore means because of this. Because of what? Well, because of everything we've spoken of from verse 1 to verse 33. Because of the fact that you have shut off the kingdom for people who are trying to enter, because you have tied on heavy weights, because you operate with a false basis of authority, because you have devoured people, because you have inverted spirituality, because you have a lack of integrity in your lifestyle, because you are playing this incredible outside game with no internal reality, because of that I am sending to you truth tellers. Stop right there. I am sending to you prophets, wise men, scribes. I am sending to you Peters and Stevens and James and Pauls. I am sending to you prophets, pastors, wise men, teachers, scribes, writers. By the way, side note, God always does that. In every generation, God has sent to his people truth-tellers. Go all the way through the Old Testament to the beginning to Armageddon. You are going to see God injecting his people's experience with men and women of God who spoke the truth. God always provides for His people. And Isaiah, somewhere, God always provides for His people. A Jeremiah, a John the Baptist, a voice of truth. Sometimes those voices are crying in the wilderness someplace, but He always provides it. Sadly, however, according to verse 34, very often people don't listen to them, and very often those voices don't seem to last very long. They get chased from city to city. They get scourged in the synagogues, crucified and killed. But what he says here as it relates to this cumulative wrath is, I am sending to you these truth-tellers, verse 35, that, hapas is the Greek word, it's purpose, for the purpose that upon you the guilt of righteous blood should fall. I am not sending you them for a second chance. I am sending them to you so that upon you all the righteous blood will fall. This is a weird concept. It's hard for me to picture God sending someone to someone in order that they would hear it, reject it, and then get judged by it. I need to hear something, just some teaching here. 2 Corinthians 2 helped me to sort this out a little bit. Paul is speaking, and he says this. You know what? Whenever I preach, I triumph. Whenever I preach, I triumph. In Christ Jesus, I triumph. And he wasn't just doing positive thinking there. I triumph, and even if it's a lousy sermon, no, no, no, no. That's not what he meant. It wasn't what he meant. What he meant was if I tell the truth, and if I accurately and carefully delineate the real truth of God's Word, However it is that people respond, I triumph, and the Word of God triumphs. And then he went on to clarify. You see, sometimes people don't respond to the truth of God. Sometimes they reject it. I still triumph. Sometimes they receive it. I still triumph. For those who receive it, you see, it results in salvation. For those who don't, it results in judgment. And when we preach, we preach a gospel that is for the purpose of salvation. or judgment. And the same message produces salvation and judgment. And it is for both of those purposes. It is for the purpose of producing salvation. It is for the purpose of producing judgment. And when I come to some people, they receive it. And then the message that they heard is one that produces salvation. He calls it this, a fragrance of life to life. But other people are sitting in the same auditorium. They hear the same message. They go, nah, that's baloney. And that same message is not a message of life to life it is a message of judgment it is a message of death to death and that's the fragrance that god smells he smells life to life he smells death to death both of them i don't like that do you like the fact that judgment smells good to god i'm sending you rejecters truth tellers and you're going to hear the truth tellers and you're going You're going to reject the truth tellers, but I'm telling you that I am sending them to you in order that the blood of righteous men will fall on you. All of the blood from the beginning of time till now will fall on you. It's cumulative. Not only are you guilty of your sin and your abuse, but in doing it you have land on you the cumulative wrath of God that's been filling the cup since the blood of Abel. Abel and Zechariah, that's just kind of him coming together. Abel was the first Old Testament martyr in this Old Testament era. Zechariah was the last of the Old Testament era. So encompassing all of that. I have another goofy picture to share with you. I have a picture of a snowball at the top of a hill. A snowball at the top of the hill. The hill is the history of the world, if you will. And a snowball is the judgment of God. And as that ball of snow moves down the hill of history, that ball of snow picks up more snow. And it picks up more judgment and it picks up more wrath. And at Abel's time, it picked up a certain amount. At Zechariah's time, it was bigger than that. By the time we get down to the Pharisees, what is in the cup of God's wrath is bigger than it was at Zechariah's time. And it was bigger than the time of Abel. And by the way, as I consider this historically, I've got to keep that ball rolling past the Pharisees 2,000 years later right down to us. What that means is there's more in the cup now than there was then. And I let that ball keep on going down the hill of history, and it finally hits the bottom of the hill, and the bottom of the hill is Armageddon, where all of the wrath is poured out, and everything that is wrong is made right. And Satan is brought absolutely and ultimately under the feet of Christ forever and ever and ever. But as I get this picture of this ball kind of rolling down a hill and getting bigger and bigger as it does, I want to go back to the top of the hill at the very beginning and put another ball up there. See, I see two snowballs up there. This is deep theology, snowball theology. See, one is the snowball of God's judgment. The other is the snowball of God's revelation. And as I see the snowball of God's revelation, I begin to understand again, or a little deeper level why the snowball of God's wrath keeps getting bigger and bigger too. You see, the snowball of revelation is cumulative too. Cain, who killed Abel, he was the one who shed the righteous blood of Abel, had revelation from God. Cain had revelation. He did not have a lot of revelation. Cain didn't. He didn't have as much revelation as you do. He didn't, but he had enough. He had enough revelation to know how to come to God. He had enough revelation to know what was right and what was wrong. And in the light of the revelation that he had, he rejected God. He destroyed his brother's life. He was the first abuser. He was the first one who used his power and authority to take life from somebody. And because he had a certain amount of revelation, Cain had revelation, not a lot, but enough, he got a certain level of judgment. But time went on, you see? And the revelation of God became more and more complete. So the revelation, the ball of revelation got bigger and bigger too. And as it went down the hill of history, God began to disclose himself to men, to the world, and he gave the law. And then he gave the prophets, people who would be the voice of God in the world. And then he gave Moses, and then he gave Isaiah, and then he gave Jeremiah, and then he gave the entire Old Testament. And by the time Zechariah was killed between the temple and the altar. They had enough revelation of God to make a temple. They had enough revelation of God to make an altar. They had all of the Old Testament, all of the prophets. The snowball of God's revelation by the time Zechariah was murdered was absolutely huge. It took a lot of work to ignore all that revelation. The time in history that that was done, they just had to go, no, I'm not going to accept that. I'm not going to hear the truth. and in spite of the fact that all that revelation was there and it took an enormous amount of work to ignore it they did ignore it and the result of that was this since the revelation was greater than Cain's revelation the accountability was greater than Cain's accountability and because his accountability their accountability was greater than Cain's their judgment was greater because their sin was greater because they knew more here's the equation as these two snowballs go down the hill getting bigger and bigger all the time the equation is this revelation, knowledge of God, how to get to God. As that expands and expands and becomes clearer and clearer, accountability gets greater and greater as well. Failure to respond to what you know equals sin. Sin produces wrath. Wrath produces judgment. Greater revelation produces greater accountability, produces greater sin, produces greater wrath, produces greater judgment, and on and on and on. We see this principle every day. I mean, this is part of life, whether we understand it or not completely. If I walk out in the driveway and my nine-month-old son, I don't have one anymore, but if I have a nine-month-old son and he's out in my driveway with a very sharp, like a screwdriver in his hand and he's walking along my car going, and I walk out and he goes, hi dad and he's carving oh mercy i'm gonna react to that and there will be certain consequences brought to bear on him for that and i will bring him over here and try to explain to him but he's not going to get a lot he doesn't know what he's doing he thought he was being an artist he doesn't get it yet if that same kid 18 years later is out there doing that he's going to get it big he's going something's going to land on him why 18 years later he what knows better and when you know more there's more what accountability with more accountability what you do with what you know is the sin is greater when the sin is greater the judgment is greater the wrath is greater both of these balls go down the hill together and now we meet the fair in this 35th verse in this particular passage we're past able a little revelation a little judgment a lot of judgment but it was in accord to the revelation Zechariah had more now we get to the Pharisees they've got more revelation than Zechariah ever had they like Zechariah have the law they have the prophets they have Moses they have Isaiah they have Jeremiah too in fact the Pharisees have Zechariah they can look back on Zechariah and see what their fathers did and the sin of their fathers and go, we need to learn from the sin of our fathers. So they have that example to learn from and go a different direction. More than that, they had the completed Old Testament. It wasn't completed at the time of Zechariah. They have all of the sacred writings. More than that, they had John the Baptist come to them and speak the truth of repentance and preparing the way for the Lord. And then they had Jesus himself, the word incarnate, God among us. Well, I'll tell you what, that's a lot of revelation to ignore. The snowball of God's revelation at the time that the Pharisees are doing what they're doing is immense. And the fact is this, because they at this particular time were ignoring overwhelming revelation, they got overwhelming judgment. Listen to me. These Pharisees had the word in their hand. They had the word in their hand, and they had the word in their mouth. We've talked about this over and over again from Matthew chapter 1, that all they did was study the word. They had the revelation of God in their hand. They had it in their mouth. And they used that word not to dispense truth. They used that word and built their traditions all around the word until the word was obscured. And before you knew it, they began to use the word that was in their hand and in their mouth to establish a false authority, to tie heavy weights on people, to shut people off from the kingdom, and to devour them. And because of that, verse 36, you get it all. From the beginning till now, you get all of it. Not just yours, but from Abel till now. You get the snowball where it intersects history right now. And all of this is going to fall on this generation. From the beginning till now. When I do all that teaching, I obviously, and I think we obviously, have to go, where am I on this hill? See, how does this affect us? What does this mean for us? Some might say this means nothing to us. There are some of you this passage as being God's judgment on Israel alone, and that's all it applies to. This is a judgment that fell on them, and it stops there, and it is true. There is a judgment on Israel. In fact, it's 70 A.D., just a few years after this happened. Jerusalem was destroyed. The temple was destroyed. It hasn't been restored since, and if there ever was a desolate house, you can look at the house of Israel for a desolate house. But if you just leave it there, I think we've missed the entire point. To the word that was to the people of God then and the word that is to the people of God now. To the church. See, when it's speaking of this generation, I think it means this. All of that from Abel till now is going to fall on now. It's going to fall on this generation. And if I talk to another group of people in 100 years, all of that past the Pharisees until now is going to fall on this generation and on this generation and on this generation until 2,000 years later we come to this generation. And we are 2,000 years down the hill of God's history and God's revelation. And we, like the Pharisees, have the revelation of the Old Testament. We have the prophets, we have the law. We have John the Baptist. He's right in here. We have the record of Jesus in the gospel account right in here. But far more than the Pharisees had, we have far more revelation than they have. First of all, before I even talk about some of the things that we know about. They didn't have any of the new, they didn't have the apostles' teaching yet. By the way, I don't know what your perspective on the epistles is, Galatians, Ephesians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Romans, where all of this doctrine is taught. The epistles were simply a gift from God to the people of God that explained to people what Jesus meant by his teachings. It's like a commentary. Here's what we mean. And as that revelation came, people of God were going, wow, yeah, it's getting deeper and deeper and deeper. and I'm getting more and more excited. But as that revelation came, the judgment grew too to the people who reject. And we have the entire New Testament. Pharisees didn't have that. We have the Holy Spirit indwelling people. We have the new covenant. We have the gifts of the Spirit available to us. We have the mystery revealed, Paul says. The mystery revealed, a mystery that was hidden from even the people of God in the past. They had revelation enough to come to God, but they didn't have what we have. On top of that, we have pastors and teachers and evangelists and prophets. And according to our text, the scary part is that some of the pastors and teachers and evangelists and prophets aren't telling the truth, but we have pastors and teachers and prophets and evangelists who are. And you add to that, just in our generation, the books. I mean, it boggles the mind, the tapes, the radio stuff. You can't go home today without hearing another message. The videos, the schools, the churches. We know so much in 1989, it is frightening. You see, the snowball of God's revelation at this time in history is absolutely beyond description. But what we need to understand is so is the snowball of his wrath. the cup is almost full we are near the bottom of the hill listen like the Pharisees in Matthew 23 the word is in our hand too and the word is in our mouth and the word that is in our hand is different than the ones the Pharisees had in their hand and in their mouth because the word in our hand and the word in our mouth is far more complete than anything they could have ever known but we need to hear this If we use the word in our hands and the word that is in our mouth like the Pharisees did and build all sorts of tradition around the word so we don't even understand the word anymore. Jesus said that to the Pharisees. I'm not just picking that out of the air. He says, your traditions violate the revelation of God. You've got so many traditions, people don't even know what I said anymore. You've all become Baptists and Catholics and Lutherans. You don't even know what I say anymore. Just get to the word. again. If we begin to use the word that is in our mouth and in our hand to establish personal authority, if we begin to use the word that is in our hand and in our mouth to tie people up and put heavy weights on them and teach them to pretend, we will shut off the door of the kingdom from them and we will devour them and if we do that, you better know this, that the weight of judgment since Abel's blood will fall on this generation. it was worse for Zechariah than it was for Cain it was worse for the Pharisees than it was for Zechariah's murderers it will be worse for us than it was for Israel if you have a hard time having this kind of judgment fall in the context of churchianity I'll call it not Christianity but just the church if you have a hard time seeing these kind of confrontations fall in the context of steepled and stained glass windows, then you better read Revelation 2 and 3 where Jesus moves among the candlesticks who are the churches and they're all represented with a fire and he says, I see your activity. I hear your words. You have a name that you're alive, but you're dead and I have come, unless there is repentance, I have come to remove the light. I have come to remove the lamp stand and leave the house desolate. We're going to talk about that next week. let me wrap this up by tying this whole thing up with something we've learned before back in Matthew 11 Matthew 11 turn to it quickly Matthew 11 is the first time we were exposed to this concept kind of just back away from all the stuff I've taught this issue of revelation greater revelation equals a greater judgment we've been introduced to that concept in Matthew 11 it was revealed that there are degrees of judgment. Verse 20 says this, then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles were done because they did not repent. Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, where he did most of what he did. So these are people who saw the work of God. They heard the word of God. They had no excuse. They had revelation. And he says to them, woe to you, Chorazin, woe to you Bethsaida. And here's the issue of revelation and judgment. For if the miracles that you had seen had occurred in Tyre and Sidon, Tyre and Sidon were the epitome of vile sin, immorality, godless idolatry. Don't even know about God. But if those pagans that you go, aren't they scummy? We're going to make sure we're never around them. If they had seen what you had seen. They would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. Nevertheless, I say to you, it's going to be more tolerable in judgment for these slime bags that you think are really going to get it. It's going to be more tolerable for them than it will be for you. And you, Capernaum, Capernaum was where you remember he spent three years. His entire ministry came out of Capernaum. Will not be exalted to heaven, will you? No, you won't. You shall descend to Hades. For if the miracles had occurred in Sodom, Sodom and Gomorrah, burned up with fire, if the miracles had occurred in Sodom and Gomorrah had occurred there, which had occurred with you, Sodom and Gomorrah would be standing to this day. Nevertheless, I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than it will be for you. What does it have to do with our study? Pull it together with our study. As I do that and I pull it together, I come up with three levels of God's judgment. real quickly. There is a judgment of God, a wrath of God that is going to come upon what I will call the pagan. The pagan. They are embodied in Tyre, Sidon, Sodom, and Gomorrah. They are the world, who we would call the world. They are what we would call the evil workers, the murderers, the rapists, the liars, the thieves. Whatever in your mind is the vilest of all sinners, that's who the pagans are. And we have heard all our lives, truly, that judgment is going to fall on that. And we have seen in the Word of God that judgment did fall on Sodom, and it was an expression of what God thought about sin. But what we're hearing from the Word of God right now is there is a judgment that's going to fall heavier on another group. In fact, this picture we've had over the last couple of weeks, last couple of weeks ago, we talked about inverted spiritual values. Remember when little things were big? I think we've got an inverted view of judgment, too. The worst thing's going to happen to the vile, scummy, immoral person. That's not what the Bible says. They are going to get judgment, but the second group where this judgment's going to fall is on the pew sitter. The pew sitter who was in Capernaum and Chorazin and Bethsaida, who never reviled Jesus. They never would have nailed him to a cross. They went to church. They heard his message. They listened politely. They saw the miracles. They knew the truth. They hummed the whole thing. yeah yeah i've heard that i've seen that no big deal he's a carpenter's son this says they get worse judgment why because to whom much is given much is required because when the revelation of god is bigger the wrath of god is bigger do you realize if you're a ho-hummer if you're a rejecter the worst place you could possibly be this morning is here the worst thing you could possibly do is go to church if you're a receiver if you're broken hungry mourning person you come to hear the word and it's life unto life but you need to know that this same message is a message of death unto death because every time the word is revealed you become more accountable there's a sense in which this even applies to believers somehow as I you know i hear from time to time boy i'm learning things i never learned i'm seeing things i never saw i'm just growing and all these really okay good good good i've had to let in my spirit that i know more than my dad knew and i know more than my grandmother knew and that needs to somehow be brought before the throne of god and say god i've been given much empower me to do something with what you've revealed to me because it comes with that what are you doing with that where is that going. Is that producing life to life or death to death? Is that producing holiness or is it producing license to sin? Revelation 3.15, Jesus is speaking to the church in Laodicea, the church in Laodicea. And he says to them, you guys are neither hot nor cold. You say of yourself, hey, I'm rich, increased with goods in need of nothing. We got it down. We got the methods. We got the formulas. We're a big church. Jesus says to them, the best thing that could ever happen to you would be as if you could see that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked. You see, because you are neither hot nor cold, but you are lukewarm, you've done what Capernaum and Chorazin and Bethsaida did. When you saw and you heard, you went, yeah, yeah, I've heard that. No big deal. You ho-hummed it. Because you are lukewarm, I will spit you out of my mouth. The lamp is removed. Ichabod is written. The glory departs. That's the second category. the third category is the one we're dealing with right now the third level of wrath for the pagan there is a judgment for the one who heard and heard and heard there is a greater judgment could be living a far more moral life greater judgment the third level of judgment is the leader, the teacher whether an Old Testament prophet whether the time of Christ teacher, a Pharisee whether a present day pastor we have as teachers the word in our hand and the word in our mouth we study it all the time we are those who stand before people and assume to speak for God but you need to know something and I need to know something that if that word that is in our hand and in our mouth is used to establish personal authority if that word is used to hide a lack of integrity if it is used to tie heavy weights on people instead of taking it off with the grace of God if it is used to promote pretending among people and not being real if it is used to build tradition around the word so that the word becomes obscured, it will shut off the kingdom from people who are trying to enter. It will devour people. It will invert spiritual values. It will spiritually rape. It will spiritually contaminate people who come near. And it will make you a recipient of the wrath of God that has been filling the cup and rolling down the hill from the days of Abel until this generation. And that is why James 3 verse 1 says, Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we shall incur a stricter judgment. Hear it all put together. Jesus says this, you want to mess with my sheep? You want to abuse my little ones? Matthew 18 says, it'd be better for you to have a millstone hung around your neck and thrown into the middle of the sea than have to deal with me. Because as people begin to come to me, and if you throw obstacles in my way, I'm going to take it personal. if you use my name to get people to do what you want and build your kingdom and you shut off the kingdom from people who are trying to get to me i will take it personally keep it up just keep it up fill up the cup because the more you fill it up the more i'm going to give you i've got so much to give and this time it's not grace he's going to give not to this group what he's going to give is something that's been rolling down the hill and filling up the cup since the days of Abel. How do I close this? I have no idea. One thing that this has an impact on me with is that it really makes me look inside. I don't have a whole lot of energy to look out there. I don't think we should be. I mean, one of the things that makes me feel like, I go, who could possibly stand up and go, I have purified my heart. I know I never do any of that. You know, again, I don't know if this completely applies, because Isaiah was one who said he saw God. And I can't say that in this, I've seen God, but the response is somewhat the same. It says, in the year that King Uzziah died, I saw God, Isaiah said. And when I saw God, I became aware of something, and I became aware that I was a man of unclean lips. And I lived in a land of people with unclean lips. And Isaiah fell on his face and he said, he said, if there isn't forgiveness, who could stand? Who could stand? I look at stuff like this and I think, it would be really nice to get real big about all the people I think do this. But I've got to tell you, if you look into your heart, if every one of us do that, we've got to have something that sounds like Isaiah. And I feel like a man of unclean lips. And I live in a land of people with unclean lips. But God came to Isaiah and he said, blessed are the broken, blessed are those who mourn, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness they can't produce, blessed are those who aren't pretending about their sin anymore. And I'm going to purify your lips, and I'm going to purify your heart, and I'm going to purify your mind. I'll tell you words like this make me real aware how much we need grace. It makes me real grateful for grace, because if it wasn't for the grace of God, we could not stand. but I have been washed in the blood, and so have you. I'm glad this message isn't over. I'm glad we're going to be able to complete it tomorrow or next week. We ought to complete it tomorrow. But in the 37th verse, he says something that really does communicate a different tone. He says this, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often I wanted to gather you and your children together. the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. I wanted you to come. If you would have come, I would have protected you. I would have forgiven you. I would have empowered you. How often I wanted you to come. But it says here to them that they would not. They were unwilling. What about us? What about us? I think in the redemptive sense, God wants to bring his grace, not his wrath. To even people redeemed. Do you think God brings discipline upon the redeemed? Yes, they're still redeemed. But there are times when we move away from God, I believe, in disobedience and not moving in grace and not moving in the life of the Spirit, but manipulative stuff that the hand of God is removed, even from people of God. How often I would that you would come so I could bless you and gift you and empower you and give you joy unspeakable. but you would not what about us I think this is a sobering word I don't know how to make it any fancier the spirit of God is going to have to apply it where it lands let's pray take your word plant it like a seed in the soil of our heart everything that is foggy removed everything that would even be a distortion from the enemy bind it right now in Jesus name come behind this word with your grace come behind this word with your forgiveness and extension of life eternal and abundant joy in the Holy Spirit but pour water on the word pour water on the seed that it would bear fruit in our lives of life to life. God, I pray that this word would produce life to life, a sweet fragrance to you, and not death to death, but do what you do with the word. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
