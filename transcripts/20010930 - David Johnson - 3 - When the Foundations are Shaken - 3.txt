I'd like to pray as we begin. Father, my request this morning is the same as it has been for the last couple of weeks. And it's that by the power of your Spirit, through the wonder of your Word, you would shepherd your sheep, that you would father your children through these dark days that we are sharing together as a nation. I pray it in your name. Amen. Among the first instinctive desires that I felt rise in me immediately following the events of September 11th was this. I wish my dad was here. Now, as I poked at that desire a little bit to try to figure out what that was about, I realized that on a personal level that it was a pretty normal response, even predictable, if you think about it. I was very close to my father, and I trusted his read of things, his read of life. I especially trusted him when things were shaken and not going well. But at a more universal level, as I thought about it even further, I recognize that this desire I felt rise in me for my dad was really about something deeper. An instinct that I think all of us have in traumatic situations to look for and hear from someone who's been there before. It may not be a dad. To me, that was the figure. But the instinct, I think, is to look for someone who knows what to do, where to stand. someone who from their experience in life might help us navigate the evil day. Well, that is precisely why two weeks ago we went to the psalmist who told us what the righteous might do when the foundations are shaken. It's why last week we went to the book of Acts and in chapter 8 we heard from ordinary believers like you and like me who stood firm in faith even in the evil day, who went on good newsing even in the face of calamity. And it's why today I felt my heart drawn to the Apostle James. It's why today we're going to hear from James who, much like the father that we need at times like this, is speaking to his children in James 1, verse 12, words that are designed to remind them, and now us, of virtues critically important, especially in the face of what feels like insurmountable odds and undefeatable foes, His word to them and us is this. James 1, verse 12, Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial, for he or she will receive the crown of life. Among the interesting things about that word is this. There is no instruction in that word as to how. Simply the declaration of a truth, that the blessed ones are the persevering ones. Simply the recognition of a value. The value is perseverance. The conferring of a blessing upon those who do. I want to talk this morning about the virtue of perseverance and the centrality of its importance in every arena of our lives, but especially when the foundations are shaken, especially in the evil day. Indeed, I would render James' word this way to capture the fullness of its meaning. Blessed are you when particularly through adversity you don't give up. People like that receive the crown of life. It's very important to notice that it's not necessarily for winning that the crown of life is conferred, but for not quitting. When you had many reasons to do so, and you easily could have, you receive the crown of life d.h. Groberg wrote a poem it's probably my favorite as it relates to any dynamic or essence of perseverance it wonderfully captures the essence of perseverance it's called the race i want to read it quit give up you're beaten to shout at me and plead there's just too much against you now this time you can't succeed. And as I start to hang my head in front of failure's face, my downward fall is broken by the memory of a race. And hope refills my weakened will as I recall that scene, for just the thought of that short race rejuvenates my being. A children's race, young boys, young men, how I remember well. Excitement, sure, but also fear. It wasn't hard to tell. They all lined up so full of hope each thought to win that race or tie for first or if not that at least take second place and fathers watched from off the side each cheering for his son and each by hope to show his dad that he would be the one the whistle blew and off they went young hearts and hopes of fire to win and be the hero there which each was each young boy's desire and one boy in particular whose dad was in that crowd was running near the lead and thought, my dad will be so proud. But as he speeded down the field across a shallow dip, the little boy who thought to win lost his step and slipped. Trying hard to catch himself, his hands flew out to brace and amid the laughter of the crowd, he fell flat on his face. So down he fell and with him hope he couldn't win it now. Embarrassed, sad, he only wished to disappear somehow. But as he fell, his dad stood up and showed his anxious face, which to the boy so clearly said, get up and run your race. He quickly rose, no damage done, behind a bit, that's all, and ran with all his mind and might to make up for his fall. So anxious to restore himself, to catch up and to win, his mind went faster than his legs. He slipped and fell again. He wished then he had quit before with only one disgrace. I'm hopeless as a runner now. I shouldn't try to race. But in the laughing crowd, he searched and found his father's face. That steady look which said again, get up and run your race. So he jumped up to try again, 10 yards behind the last. If I'm to gain those yards, he thought, I've got to move real fast. Exerting everything he had, he gained eight or ten. But trying so hard to catch the lead, he slipped and fell again. Defeat. He lied there silently. A tear dropped from his eyes. No sense running anymore. Three strikes, you're out. Why try? The will to rise had disappeared. All hope had fled away. So far behind, so error prone. a loser all the way. I've lost, so what's the use, he thought. I'll live with my disgrace. But then he thought about his dad, who soon he'd have to face. Get up, an echo sounded low. Get up and take your place. You were not meant for failure here. Get up and run your race. With borrowed will, get up, it said. You haven't lost at all, for winning is no more than this, to rise each time you fall. So up he rose to run once more and with a new commit. He resolved that win or lose, at least he wouldn't quit. So far behind the others now, the most he'd ever been. Still he gave it all he had and ran as though to win. Three times he'd fallen stumbling, three times he rose again, too far behind to hope to win. He still ran to the end. He cheered the winning runner as he crossed the line first place, head high and proud and happy, no failing, no disgrace. But when the fallen youngster crossed the line last place, the crowd gave him the greater cheer for finishing the race. And even though he came in last, his head bowed low, unproud, you would have thought he won the race by listening to that crowd. And to his dad, he sadly said, I didn't do too well. To me, you won, his father said. You rose each time you fell. You see, beloved, even when all it is is a foot race involving a 10-year-old boy on a quarter-mile track, there is something profound and stirring to be said for people who persevere. And the something James says is this, Blessed are you. In James 5, verse 11, James says the same thing a different way. We count as blessed those who endure. I want you to understand something this morning. perseverance is a holy thing. It is a high-ranking virtue in the life of kingdom people worthy of the crown of life. Now, let me briefly remind you of the people to whom John is writing this word of exhortation because it matters for credibility. For the people to whom he was writing had reason to quit. James, you may recall, was the pastor of the Jerusalem church. the Jerusalem church that we met last week in our study in Acts chapter 8 who because of the ragings of Saul of Tarsus had to run for their lives they were driven from their homes remember that? they were scattered out of Jerusalem separated from their families cut off from their leadership in James chapter 1 the very first verse James identifies the people to whom he is writing as the dispersed the scattered ones it wasn't supposed to be that way that wasn't the plan they had for their life or expected. It certainly didn't start that way. Their whole life in the kingdom and walk with God started at Pentecost. In Acts chapter 2, an exciting day was that. The Spirit of God fell. The wind of God blew. The people of God moved. Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe. And the Lord was adding daily to their numbers, those who were being saved. And as I said last week, whatever else seasons of success like that do to you, they raise your expectations. And I'm quite sure their expectations were these. At Pentecost, we're going to win the world. The work of God so clearly is powerful and overpowering evil on this day that we will conquer kingdoms and we will cross the finish line of our lives with heads held high and banners waving. But it wasn't turning out that way. They were the dispersed, the scattered ones. They weren't going to win, at least not the way they had defined winning at one time in their lives. Now the goal was to survive, to hang on to faith and hope and love, to persevere, thus this word from James. Blessed are those who persevere under trial, they receive the crown of life. A little word about this crown of life. what is that? Lots of debate. Some say that it's speaking of salvation, not that you're saved by your perseverance, but the indication here by some is that perseverance is a sign that you're saved. So some say it's that. Others say it's a reward. Others still speak of it being a crown of proven character, not physically apparent, but real nonetheless. And while I'm sure all of them may in some sense be true, I submit that at the core of what this crown of life is is something far less obscure and far more universal than we might think. For at a very human level, I believe we have all had glimpses of this crown of life that James is speaking of. I believe we have all tasted the flavor of whatever this crown of life is. For there has been, in my opinion, infused to us by God, something that recognizes as noble, worthy of a crown, men and women who in the face of adversity and against all odds persevere, refuse to quit, finish the course. We live in a culture that says everybody loves a winner. It's interesting, however, that even in this culture that we live in that says everybody loves a winner and everybody wants to be a winner, even in that culture, there is something deeper reserved for those who persevere. Even in our culture that values the winner, we value even more highly the one who perseveres. A place of honor, of respect, of nobility, to that person comes a different kind of crown, a crown of life. See, the fact is not everybody can win. Not everybody's fast enough, big enough, smart enough to win, to be first. But the interesting thing about a persevere, and this is part of what I think stirs in us, is this, that everybody can persevere. You can't necessarily be the best or the fastest, but everybody can stay. One of my favorite stories illustrating the power of perseverance and the crown of life that comes to it is one I've told before. It happened several years ago in the L.A. Coliseum, the Olympic Games. The women's marathon was long over. The winner had been declared. TV coverage had gone to other venues when, like a special bulletin interrupting the regularly scheduled program, the TV coverage came back to the Coliseum where the marathon had been run previously. And what the TV showed was a young woman named Gabriella Anderson who had just entered the track to finish her race. Barely able to stand, let alone run. Every resource available to her physically had been spent. Absolutely no chance at all of winning. But she continued. At first, the crowd was silent, wondering how to react. But as it became apparent that she just might finish this race, they began to cheer, and as she crossed the line, the crowd began to roar. And as the camera moved in on people in the crowd, there were tears streaming down their cheeks, as if to say, Blessed are you. She didn't win. She didn't even come close. But there was something instinctive in the hearts of the people who watched this woman with wobbly legs barely crossed the finish line that rose up in their spirit and conferred upon her the blessing of James. Blessed are you, crown of life to you. I will never forget as long as I live and neither will you. The reports and the images that began coming to us from New York City after the events of September 11th and among the most noble and stirring are the reports we heard about the response of firefighters, policemen, and medical personnel who, when people were running down the stairs of these doomed buildings, these firemen and policemen and medical personnel were running up the stairs. When everyone else was running out of the buildings, these people were running into them. When everyone was running away from the rubble, these people were running toward them so that today there is not a group of people on the planet that we see as more honorable, noble, and worthy of a crown than those people who walked up the stairs not down, in the building not out, toward the rubble not away. Blessed are you. Why? Because even though they didn't win in the way we normally count winning, winning would have been they walked up the stairs, got everybody out, everybody was safe, five fives all around, they didn't win that way and even though they didn't win they didn't walk away they didn't bail out they didn't quit they persevered I love that picture that we had on the screen during the offertory it's there now you see I just want you to get in your head that sometimes that's what perseverance looks like sometimes it's high fives all around where because of perseverance we win but sometimes it looks like that and part of the reason beloved that these kinds of images move us so deeply is because they are hardwired into us by our creator for they find their roots in the kingdom of god you see there's something to be said for people who persevere and the something james says is this blessed are you, a crown of life for you. So who are these people who persevere? Not just in the context of September 11th, but persevere in life generally. Or are these people in the face of adversity who are able to persevere in their marriage, stand firm in their faith, stay with their children, hang on to their relationships and friendships, press through hard issues and not walk away, what do they look like? What do they know that maybe we don't know? Are they different from us? Do they have some superhuman strength beyond the reach of normal people? Well, I submit that people who persevere are often quite common in appearance and talent and capacity. Indeed, I absolutely believe that most of the people who persevere actually look a lot more like you and me than they look like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Miss America. But the ironic problem with people who are persevering is that quite often people who are persevering don't see themselves as being perseverers. Many of the people in this room right now, I believe, who are persevering might not feel worthy of the honor that comes with that designation, blessed are you, a crown of life for you. Because in the race you are running at the moment, whether it be something as simple as the grades you're getting at school or relationships or marriage or work or whatever, in the race you are running that is your life right now, it doesn't look like you're winning. You're not in first place. You don't feel particularly strong or capable. Your hands are weak. Your knees are feeble. You've stumbled more than once with wounds and scars to prove the fact that you are a stumbler, just like that 10-year-old boy in the race. Well, if that's where you are, you need to get a picture once again of that marathon runner who didn't win, who didn't even come close, but who didn't quit. Her hands were weak, her knees were feeble. She wobbled across the finish line, but she crossed the finish line. You need to get a picture in your mind again and never let it go. Let it be branded on your spirit. The firemen who went up the stairs, not down. Who went into the building, not out. Who went toward the rubble, not away. They didn't win. They didn't even come close. They were no match for the falling concrete. But they didn't walk away. Blessed are you who persevere when the concrete is falling. And you don't finish first. A crown of life for you. I'll tell you something. This is an important word for this day because of what we're going through. But I'm in another series. You know, the other series we put on hold about preparing ourselves for where we're going as a church. I want to tell you something. I mean, I didn't plan it this way, but this word about perseverance and this virtue of kingdom life and this kind of character is absolutely part of what we need to be preparing for as we go where we're going. To be a people who are marked by things like this. Now, I don't know if it's a guy thing, but when I was a kid, actually, maybe it wasn't a guy thing, it was a kid thing. But when I was a kid, I also happened to be a guy, so I've kind of got the double whammy there. Anyway, the big thing for me at eight years old, it was like it was huge. I had to win. It's just so important to look like I was the best and the fastest and the biggest and the smartest and da-da-da-da. I had no idea at eight, ten years old, however old I was, that that mentality of needing to win and be first was an incredible hindrance to perseverance. Because here's how that mentality played out in my life. If I kind of sniffed out the reality that there were some people at this game who were going to be better than me, or I maybe wasn't going to be that good, maybe not first, I wouldn't even try. I would bail out at the beginning. It was so important to win. If I couldn't win, I wouldn't even try. So important to be first. If I didn't think I could be first, I wouldn't even try. Here's a problem I discovered later, in time, I think. By that very lack of perseverance, I would fail to engage in the necessary discipline and tenacity that might enable me one day to do well. Because you bail out at the beginning. I got over that. I'm not sure how or why or even when. I think I just grew up. People tend to do that. But something clicked in me. And among the things that clicked in me was this realization. It was on the front end, it was a horrifying realization, but when I kind of pressed through it, it became a liberating, empowering realization. The realization was this. I was never going to be the best. Oh, that's horrible. No, that's liberating. I was never going to be the most talented. I was never going to be the biggest or the fastest or the smartest or the best. This horrible, wonderful, liberating realization was this. that there were some things I could not do that the biggest and the fastest and the smartest and the best could do. No matter how hard I tried, the faster person was always faster. The smarter person was always faster. But I discovered, I don't know where, but I did discover this, that there was one thing I could do. You know what was really cool? I could always do it. You know how sometimes in sports or a test or something, sometimes you do it and then sometimes you don't. I discovered there was one thing I could do and I could always do it. You know what it was? I figured out that I could always show up. I could always stay. I could always give it my best shot. Now there's some bad news that follows up on that stirring word. And it was this, that a lot of times my best shot was not enough. Whether it was in sports or in school or a sermon. See, your best shot doesn't always win. Sometimes my best shot doesn't even come close. But here's the deal about my best shot. I can always give it. I can, and so can you. And so can you. See, there's a thing you need to know about the biggest and the fastest and the smartest and the best. that we're all trying to be like? We outnumber them. See? You know what I'm saying? We're way out. Because if you're the fastest, there's only one. If you're the smartest, there's only one of you. And by the way, while I'm trashing the fastest and the smartest, I got a feeling that if somebody really is the smartest and the fastest and the best, they took the gift God gave them and they persevered with that and they fine-tuned that thing. And so there's perseverance among those people too. but the truth is this most of us have wobbly knees and weak hands and we wonder if we're going to be able to cross the finish line with the raising of our kids or hanging on to our marriage or our sanity or whatever it is we're trying to press through but you can always give it your best shot you can always show up I've told you before on various occasions that among the most heroic people I know are single parents single parents who are informed on a fairly regular basis by experts who I'm sure mean well that being a mom is not enough for your son or daughter they need a dad or being a dad if you're a single dad is not enough they need a mom and knowing that that's true here you are all by yourself you know you hear they need their dad they need their mom knowing that that's true that what you give is not enough that you're not gonna win you keep showing up and by that daily saying to your children son or daughter I may not be all that you need indeed I am quite convinced that I am not all that you need but I am here and I'm not going away blessed are you crown of life for you There is something to be said for people who show up. The something James says is blessed are you. Second thing you need to know about people who persevere is that they recognize the difference. This is critical. They recognize the difference between desperately wanting to quit and quitting. They recognize that discouragement, darkness, and moments of despair do not in and of themselves disqualify you from the race you are running. I mean, think about this, please. It's important to remember that Jesus in the garden desperately wanted the cup to pass. He wanted to bail. He wanted another way. He sweat drops of blood, but the fact that he wanted it to pass doesn't mean he bailed. The Apostle Paul, who we met last week as the ultimate persevere in Acts chapter 18. He wanted very much to quit. And I don't have time to go into all the things about the 18th chapter that reveal the discouragement that he was going through and the lack of energy and the wall he kind of hit emotionally and spiritually in Acts 18. But I want to tell you something. Wanting to quit and quitting are two radically different things. And people who persevere understand that. You see, I think that sometimes we get the impression that people who persevere have some kind of superhuman capacity that somehow gives them an exemption from the common-to-man experience of discouragement and fear. You know, you look at people who are perseverant, then you just go, well, they're not like me. I get discouraged. Well, so do they! They just keep showing up, even when they're discouraged. See, it's a lot like the impression I think we have of people who exhibit great courage. We assume of people who exhibit great courage, like the firemen who are walking up the stairs. We assume that they must not be afraid. That's not like me. I'd be afraid. No, no. And because we think that courageous people never feel fear, when we do feel fear, we kind of disqualify ourselves from ever being counted in the company of the courageous. But the fact is this. Courage is not manifested only by the absence of fear. There will be times when, for a variety of reasons, you will walk into a dangerous, difficult situation, and you will incredibly feel no fear. But courage is not simply manifested only by the absence of fear. True courage is manifested when, in the presence of fear, you go up the stairs, not down, into the building, not out, toward the rubble, not away. Courage is manifested when, in the middle of your fear, you do what is right and noble and good. It's when in the middle of your fear, you obey and you stay and you go and you act. See these t-shirts that kids wear? I see them at the club where I work out from time to time, and they say, no fear. You see those? There's kind of a scowly-looking face underneath. It's very intimidating. Whoa. Usually, you know, 110-pound. No fear. I'm not afraid. I don't know if it's a product. It's very cool. It's very cool. And that's obviously the goal, to not have any fear. I've got to just tell you the truth. I just want to speak to you like a father. I'll just tell you the truth about life. There are times when you will be in your school or in a sport or in some difficult thing at work. just some big task you have in front of you. There are times when you will, in fact, be so prepared and so experienced because you persevered in some bad experiences you went through, and now you're at this place that's difficult and you're ready for it, and you'll be so confident that going into this difficult situation, you'll feel no fear. I have felt that from time to time, and I would like to think that you have from time to time because you were ready and you prepared, and there have been times when I've been in this pulpit and I've felt like that, even though it felt like a difficult time. It felt like I wasn't skippy, but I felt a confidence. And by the way, those kinds of moments come when you persevere because you're prepared and you went through some times when you didn't do so well. And then when this tough thing came, you were ready. Well, here's the deal. When you feel really no fear and you're ready to face that hard thing, enjoy that. Enjoy that. And see it as fruit. But here's the other truth you need to hear. as a father to his children, every once in a while, son, daughter, you might just face something bigger than you. You might just run into something you couldn't prepare for that is beyond you. And if you are waiting for no fear to act, you will never act. And you will never move in courage. And you will never persevere. people who persevere are not fearless necessarily they act in spite of fear and you just watch them you watch the people in your life who have persevered and you will see them in days facing danger without fear but you will also see them and these will be the times that something rises in you that says blessed are you that on the days they're most afraid they stayed see I can't even hardly say that without getting emotional because something in me instinctively says blessed is that person these are kingdom kingdom characteristics and virtues third people who persevere have abandoned the pretense of independent strength see if you want to look cool and appear to be strong then keep up the I'll go it alone stuff. Just keep playing that little tune. But if you're serious about perseverance in your life in general and you're interested in really being strong then ask for help, confide in a friend, acknowledge your weakness, open your heart, tell the truth, let people in. In 2 Corinthians chapter 7 Paul does precisely that when he says this in verse 5. when we were in Macedonia our flesh had no rest we had conflicts without we had fears within but God who comforts the depressed comforted us by the coming of Titus now just a number of things about that verse that just knock me over he's admitting out loud he had fears within he was depressed and then he says what I needed most when I was afraid and when I was depressed what I needed was a friend and the coming of Titus is what brought me out of this goofy thing listen to what he said he acknowledged his weakness, he asked for help, he opened his heart he told the truth he let people in, I'll tell you what he did he abandoned the pretense of independent strength could I just tell you people who persevere do that just watch them, just watch them and if they don't, they don't persevere I got an email this week from a pastor friend of mine in Colorado about a pastor friend of his who had been invited to a prayer breakfast in Washington, D.C. this last week by President Bush himself. And as these pastors were all in the room waiting for President Bush to enter, they were all expecting him, understandably, to look tired and serious and very depressed. All of them were surprised, however, that when he entered the room, he was energetic, peaceful, and very focused. They asked him why. He said this, I'm feeling stronger now than I've ever felt in my entire life. And the reason is because it feels like every person in America is praying for me right now. And when I stay on my knees, that's when I have the greatest strength. Now, that's a pretty exciting thing to hear that our president says. And there are a number of things that strike me about that statement, but two of them just jump off the page. One is this, the power of prayer, obviously, which we touched on two weeks ago, that when we step into the power that belongs only to God, we step into real power. So President Bush is experiencing the real power that is unleashed when the people of God pray. But the second thing, more human, just kind of flesh and bloody to me, is this, that what's revealed in that statement is that the president is now experiencing something that he has not experienced since the day he got elected, and it's this. He is experiencing the overwhelming and empowering reality that he is not alone. For the vast majority of the American people, the polls are saying 98% right now, are with him, are for him, are lifting him, and he has by that been made strong so that he can in this persevere. Here's the deal. People who persevere abandon the pretense of independent strength. And if you think you can do it alone, that might look really strong for about ten minutes. But you will not be among the blessed who receive the crown of life. Fourth, people who persevere, instinctively understand, and operate on the basis of mustard seed faith. Now, they do this without maybe ever hearing of mustard seed faith. It's just how they operate, and it's what they understand. Matthew 17, verse 20, Jesus is speaking. He says this, For truly I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, it doesn't say the size of a mustard seed, it doesn't say if you have little tiny insignificant, you can't hardly see it faith. No. It's like a mustard seed. With the qualities of a mustard seed, you will be able to say to that mountain, mountain move, and it will be moved. Well, the question I have as I understand that statement is, well, how does a mustard seed work then? What are the qualities of a mustard seed that empower it to move mountains when applied to faith? Well, the key to understanding mustard seed faith and the mustard seed analogy is that the mustard seed starts small, but once planted, begins to grow. And once it grows, it starts to spread. And once it spreads, it can't be stopped. Principle, it doesn't start big and get little. It starts little and grows till it can't be stopped. When Jesus said the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, what he meant was this. The kingdom of heaven doesn't start with a bang. It doesn't start big and then get little, which is very often how kind of we are. In fact, I even think it's how sometimes we operate in the church. We send people to conferences. It's kind of my job on the weekend to get you all big and hyped up and full of stuff, really big, so you can go do the day, and as you go through the day, and the rest of the week, you run out of gas, and you come back, and we get real big again. And we go to camp that way. I remember when I went to camp as a kid, and then I began to speak at camps, and I always felt like it was my job to get everybody really big. And, you know, I would make all those promises as a kid going to camp. I'll never do it again. I'll always do it forever. And two weeks later, I was doing the things I said I never would, and I wasn't doing the things I said I always would. And I got really big and got then really little. He said, that's not how the kingdom works. The kingdom of God starts really little. In fact, it started with a teeny weeny little baby in a manger in a barn, but then that kingdom seed that nobody hardly noticed began to grow and then take root, and then it grew, and then it touched another person, and then it touched another person, and then another and another, and it grew, and it spread until it couldn't be stopped. It doesn't start big and get little. It starts little and gets big. Mustard seed faith, beloved, doesn't look at the mountain of a problem and say, I command you. Be quiet. It doesn't start big. Mustard seed faith looks at the mountain of a problem and says, I'm going to pick up a shovel. It starts small, but once planted, begins to grow and doesn't stop. And one shovel at a time, the mountain gets moved. Jesus said in Matthew 6, 34, Do not be preoccupied with tomorrow. Tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own, so do today, says Jesus. Don't stare at the mountain and get intimidated by it. If you stare at the mountain, it's going to intimidate you, and you will never start. Don't stare at the mountain. Pick up a shovel, one scoop at a time, one day at a time. People who persevere live that way. watch them finally people who persevere understand that the only way out of adversity is through it everybody's looking for a way around it people who persevere understand I'm walking through it most of the time beloved there is no magic wand there is no fairy dust there are times of great interventions of what feels like fairy dust. You get the deliverance. It's incredible. But generally, there are no magic wands to make our problems go poof. Generally, the only way out is through. Jesus in the garden again asked the Father for another way. Let this cup pass. He asked it three times. The answer from the Father came back and he submitted to it. The answer was this, Jesus, the only way out is through the cross. You can't go around it. You need to go through it. And as you go through it, as you persevere, it will mean the salvation. It will mean the life. For many. And so for the joy set before him, he, what was the word? endured, went through the cross, despising the shame. And beloved, it is by his perseverance that we have reason to persevere. In fact, as I talk about perseverance and how when we see pictures of it, even in just human beings, that little boy, 10-year-old boys running a race, something deep stirs in us. Part of what stirs in us is that it is even, it's primal to me. This is like core stuff to me because it was by the very perseverance of Jesus through the cross that we have our reason to persevere and our reason to persevere is eternal hope and eternal life. It is the very root of the gospel that we preach, this virtue of perseverance. So who are these people who persevere? What do they look like? Well, I submit to you that they look an awful lot more like you and me than they look like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Miss America. And my apologies to both because I'm sure in their way they are persevere. I just think most of them look more like ordinary people. Ordinary people who, like you and me, might have a hard time this morning seeing themselves as heroic, as being worthy of the designation of honor or the conferring of a blessing. Because in the race you may be running this morning, in the life you may be living this morning, right now you may not feel very strong. You may not be in first place. Your hands might feel weak. Your knees might feel feeble. Indeed, so feeble you wondered if you could come to church this morning at all. But you haven't left the race. You keep on showing up, believing God and asking Him for strength to keep on serving and keep on loving. You keep on hanging on to your kids and pressing through the issues in your marriage and in your workplace and in your school. I'm here to tell you this morning there's something to be said for people who persevere. And the something James says is, Blessed are you. A word I think we need to hear when the foundations have been shaken. I'd like you to stand as we're dismissed this morning in prayer Father I want to close this morning with how I began and how I prayed last week that by the power of your spirit through the wonder of your word you would shepherd your sheep you would father your children through this time of darkness in our nation. I ask this in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen. The altar team will be here for anyone who needs prayer for anything at all. God bless you as you leave. You're dismissed. Thank you.
