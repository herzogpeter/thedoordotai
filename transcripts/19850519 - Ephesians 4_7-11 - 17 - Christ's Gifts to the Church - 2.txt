Therefore, it says, verse 8, when he ascended on high, he led captive a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men. Now this expression, he ascended, what does it mean? Except that he also has descended into the lower parts of the earth. He who ascended is himself also he who ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things. And he gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ. Let's pray. Father, this morning I feel real weak. And Lord, I ask, as we always do, as we come to your precious word, that the power may be of you and that you may do more than teach us, that you may change us. I ask it in your name. Amen. We taught that text two weeks ago. We exegeted it and we called it the legend of Jesus Christ to his church. And that it was. And what a picture we were able to paint. As we looked at verses 7 and 8 and we saw that grace was given and what he was talking about, the gift that he gave was the spiritual gift that he gives to every believer. The gifts and all the categories of giftedness that that implies. And then Paul kind of breaks away as he's speaking of this wonderful gift that Christ gives to his church. And he takes this thing out of Psalm 68 and he paints a picture. And the people who were hearing this when he ascended on high, he led captive a host of captives and he gave gifts to men, knew that Paul was speaking of Psalm 68. And the picture they immediately got was the picture that they had grown up hearing as a little boy, a little Jewish boy, as they would hear that Psalm read. And it was simply the picture of a conquering king, a king of Israel who would go into the land and do war and come back victorious. And as he came back victorious, he would ascend that mountain of Zion. And at the top of the mountain, the whole nation would claim him as king and acclaim his victory and bow down before him. And as that conquering king would mount that mountain of victory, he would be carrying with him two things. On one hand, he would have the captives that he had set free from that nation that he had just conquered. And on the other hand, he would have the spoils of war. And that's a real interesting story, and it really kind of, I can get all sorts of imagery in my mind, but I have no idea what it means here in this text. And then all of a sudden in verse 9, Paul begins to try to describe what he's saying. He does an exposition of Psalm 68. Now this expression, verse 9, he ascended. what does that mean and who is he talking about what does it mean except that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth aha I've got a clue this one in Psalm 68 that is speaking of the one who ascended is the same one who descended now we turn remember to 1 Peter 3 18 and there we found out exactly what this is talking about that it was Jesus who is being spoken of here that Jesus is the one who descended the scene was at the cross in 1 Peter 3 18 and Jesus has just died in the flesh but his spirit, small s, descended. Talked about the fact that many of us wonder and even you have asked me what happened to Jesus in the three days that he was in the tomb. Well, he descended into Hades. Remember, we drew a circle in our mind and drew a line across it. The lower part of Hades is where the demons who've been bound at the time of Noah are bound forever and all the Old Testament sinners, those who were not. among the people of God and in the upper level were all the Old Testament saints. And Jesus descended into that place and that's what's being spoken of here at the time of the cross and he made proclamation. Remember, he preached to them. And we discovered that what he did there was not preach an evangelistic message with an invitation to those demons and to those unfaithful in the Old Testament but rather keruso was the word and it was this, to make a proclamation. He went down into that pit and told them what you thought was defeat was really victory. You have lost. I have won. Bye-bye. The one who ascended in Psalm 68 is also the one who descended. But something happened after he descended and made that proclamation. The one who descended also ascended. And we learned last week that as he made that proclamation, the next thing he did was he began to ascend. And as he ascended and began to move toward heaven, he gathered, he went through that upper part of Hades and gathered to his bosom all of those Old Testament believers and gathered them to himself and blew open the doors of that place. And they went to be with the Father. They had been redeemed. And we saw this picture. What a picture it was of Jesus, that great conquering hero that is spoken of in Psalm 68. At the cross, entering into a clash with Satan and death and sin and hell, And he won. And now as the conquering king, he is ascending the mountain to Zion. And we hail him as king and we fall at his feet. And as he comes, he is carrying with him, on one hand, the people, the captives. A host of captives. He led captivity captive. Meaning simply this, the redeemed. The ones he had set free, the you and the me. And on the other hand, he carries with him the spoils of war. And we learned that the spoils of war were the gifts to the church. The gifts to the church. And he takes those trophies that he wanted to cross and he gives them to individuals. And he takes those trophies that he wanted to cross and he gives them to the church to establish it and to build it and to nourish it and to sustain it so that we could be the body. As I kind of went over my sermon last week, one of the things that affected me as I was considering this magnificent picture that's painted for us here was simply this. Wow, these gifts are really important because Jesus died for them. And so that attaches importance to them. Because he died, that means they're important. And one of the things I'd like to twist that just a little bit that was in the mind of Christ when he died was this. Those gifts are important and that's why I'm going to die. You see, he saw the fact that we couldn't help ourselves and he saw the fact that the church could never be the body without those gifts. And so he went into war and he took them and he gave them to us. What I'm trying to say is that the whole idea and the whole dimension of spiritual gifts at work in the church is absolutely fundamental to understanding who we are as a church. This must be taught. I don't know what's happening to me. I feel like I'm growing, but I have in me a love for the church. And sometimes I hate it, because I feel too much. But Paul had the same thing, and he said to his dearly beloved people, I have pain for you, I have labor for you, until I see Christ formed in you, I have pain. And I think of the church and I think all that we can be and all that God has called us to be, I have pain until Christ be formed in us. This is important. This is important. Foundational. Let's start. I'm going to give you an outline. I don't always do that. But the first thing I want you to get as I'm continuing to stress, and this text is stressing to us the foundation, The foundational nature of the gifts. I want to go on. The first point is just that. The foundational nature of the gifts. And we're going to be doing some teaching, and I want you to hang with me. Because it's not going to be easy. You've got to dig. 1 Corinthians 12.1. Turn there with me. 1 Corinthians 12.1. If you go to 2 Corinthians, you're going to be confused. Which I just did. Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware. I do not want you to be ignorant concerning spiritual gifts. Why? Because they're foundational, because they're fundamental, because you'll never be the church unless you understand the gifts, unless the gifts are functioning. For our study, I'd like you to consider the gifts with this definition. Consider the gifts this way, as channels through which the Spirit of God ministers to the body. Channels through which the Spirit of God ministers to the body. Now, I really want you to get this in your mind. I want you to picture a tube, if you will, okay? A nice plastic tube, it's a long thing, it's wonderful, and it's empty, and you have, what I see going through it is just fluid. And it's coming in one end, and it's going out the other. It's coming in one end, and it's going out the other. Channels through which the Spirit of God ministers to the body. And I kind of have a picture in my mind of God here, and the Holy Spirit here, and they disperse the gifts, and going through these channels, these tubes, into the body. I also have a picture, and it immediately comes into my mind, of all the different ways those channels get blocked off. And so the ministry of the Holy Spirit to the church never takes place, and we look real human and real ordinary. The gifts are foundational to who we are. I want you to understand that. The first thing I want you to have in your mind is that the gifts are a channel of the Holy Spirit's power to the church. The second thing I want you to grasp just in laying the foundation for our study this morning is something we talked about last week. It's this, that all the gifts are clearly seen. If I wanted to kind of get one picture and look at one place so that I could see all the gifts functioning in one place at one time, all I'd have to do is look at Christ, the life of Christ. If ever there was a preacher, it was Christ, right? If ever there was a teacher, it was Christ, right? If ever there was a ruler, if ever there was an administrator, if ever there was one who had faith, it was Christ. And I can look at Christ and see all the gifts right there. My point is this. that as those gifts that Christ has given to the church begin to function in the church and they begin to blend together in the church and the people of God are being the people of God in the church what do you think happens? the church begins to look like Christ the church begins to look like Him the fullness of the stature of Christ begins to be seen. The body begins to be the body. You see that? I think it's real important that we understand, you know, we are talking these several weeks about the body. The whole thing in Ephesians is about the body. And we have discovered that the fundamental thrust of the book of Ephesians, or at least the fourth chapter, is that we need to be diligent to preserve the unity, right? Diligent to preserve the unity. And unity is established two ways. First of all, the one another fellowship that we talked about for several weeks. That one another fellowship that is absolutely necessary and brings us together. And the second dimension is just exactly what I'm talking about here. The gifts. The gifts that Christ will begin to be seen in us because we are being those channels. And all the gifts that I see in Christ will be seen here as the body is being built up. And so it is that it is not only our loving one another, our fellowship, that portrays Christ. It is also the functioning of the gifts in the body of Christ that causes Christ to be able to stand up in full functioning form in the church. It's foundational. I want you to have that established in your mind. It's at the very base. The second thing I want you to understand is this, the source of spiritual gifts. The source of spiritual gifts. Well, we already know that. They came from Christ. Ephesians 4 tells us about that. We understand the great battle. He descended and then he ascended. He came and he gave gifts to men and he led captivity captive. And those two things, that's the source. There's some other things I want us to understand about the source of the spiritual gifts. 1 Corinthians chapter 12, verse 11. But one and the same spirit works all these things, distributing these gifts. This is speaking of gifts and all the delineation of those gifts. But one and the same spirit works all these gifts, distributing these gifts, one individually, each one individually, just as he wills. Who is the source of spiritual gifts? The Holy Spirit of God is the source of spiritual gifts. And how does he distribute them? Just as he wills. This is very important, you understand. He divides and he apportions to each believer just as he wills. Verse 4 of chapter 12 says this, Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same spirit. Variety of gifts. The word gifts there is charismata. The root of that word is charis, which is grace. What we understand about the gifts, it simply means this. That the gifts are a gift of grace. They are a grace gift. Grace. What do we know about grace? We know this, that I don't earn it, and I don't deserve it, and I don't train it up, and I don't gain it, and it's nothing that I can establish for myself. Grace is something that he just gives just as he wills. Got that? Very important. If it were a matter of earning it, if it were a matter of working for it, it wouldn't be grace anymore. It wouldn't be a gift anymore. Grace, gift. This is at the very core of understanding the functioning of the gifts. Listen, when it comes to gifts, we need to understand that we don't pick and choose. You don't place an order when it comes to the functioning of your gift. You can't do it. I'm afraid that an awful lot of us are missing the point by asking for gifts and demanding gifts and deciding that certain gifts are so important that those are the ones I have to have. And I just kind of say, this is it and I have it. You don't pick and choose. God didn't look at me and he didn't look at you and say, well, Dave's a neat guy or George is a neat guy or John's a neat guy. And so since he's a neat guy, I'm going to give him that gift. It's a reward. No, it isn't. It's grace. It has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with you. It's grace. It's a stewardship It's something he's given And I need to use it We short circuit the power of God When I demand to have a gift that I don't have And I think some of you are even thinking I'm talking about tongues No I'm not I'm not talking about that at all I'm talking about the gift We have a preoccupation with visible gifts And I'm going to be talking about this a little bit later too But visible gifts And every one of us want to be a teacher And every one of us want to be out in front and be seen And not everyone has that gift and what happens is when I decide that I've got to have that gift, one, I'm missing the real powerful way God wants to really work through me. And secondly, I'm frustrated a lot because the power of God isn't coming. God is the one who gives the gifts, and it's all of grace. I want you to look at your physical body for a minute. I know it's hard because some of you are hard to look at, but look at your physical body. Now, God put it together, right? He put it together and we all understand that. And when you were born, you know, it wasn't like you had an opportunity to kind of check things out what you wanted. You know, six foot two eyes of blue. And it's obvious that we didn't have a choice because you wouldn't look the way you did if you had a choice. Hmm. No, God designed the body, right? And he also designed the church. And in accordance to his sovereign grace, he sets the gifts. How? Just as he wills. 1 Corinthians 7, 7, Paul says this It would be nice if all of you were as I am But each man has his own gift It would be nice if everyone was like me But they aren't That isn't the way God does things God sets the gifts just as he wills So, to begin with We realize that we have been given a gift That gift is what? It is a channel through which the Holy Spirit of God Can work through me to minister to the body of Christ It's a channel Second thing we realize is that God is the source Through the Holy Spirit Is the source of that gift And again I get that impression And it's like this You know God and it's just coming down And it's through all of us to the body By the way the gift you've been given And the gift I've been given isn't even for me It isn't for me it's for you It isn't so that I can feel good about the gift You know I can feel good about the gift God's given me Because it isn't even for me it's for you And if I don't use it and if you don't use it, we're accountable to God and we're accountable to the body for not doing it. It's a channel through which God wants to build a body. And that's why if I shut it off, ever, and if you shut it off, whether it be because of fear or because of pride or because of laziness or because of lack of faith, if that gift, that channel that God has given you gets shut off, the body loses. And if the gift that God has given me as a channel to the body ever gets shut off, the body loses. It's important. I think there are times when we need to back off. And I've talked to so many of my dear friends here who have gone through a period in their life where the word we're using these days is burnt out. They're just fried. And they've given, and they've given, and they've given, and they've given. And now they just don't have any more to give, And nothing's left. And I think there are times when we back off. But you know what? If you come here long, you know I'm going to put my arms around you and I'm going to say, Friend, stir up the gift. Stir up the gift that's in you. Because we've got to have it. And we have to have all of you. We were not given a spirit of timidity and fear, but of love and of peace and of a sound mind. Stir it up. third thing principles giving you the foundation giving you the source the principles of spiritual gifts how they operate and this is getting really practical how the gifts operate the first thing I want you to know about the principles of the spiritual gifts and this is something we went over one time in an evening service at least this point not the others but I need to do it again that spiritual gifts are not necessarily a natural ability or talent okay if you're taking notes I want you to get that spiritual gifts are not necessarily a natural ability or a talent now God may choose to give gifts in accordance with natural abilities you got that? God may choose to give gifts in accordance with natural abilities but he may not you see just because somebody has the gift of gab doesn't mean he belongs in a teaching position okay we think that we see somebody who's able to talk and just go on and on and on well that guy must be in the ministry he's got to go in the ministry he can talk the gifts are not given necessarily in accordance to a natural ability that may be at times but that is not the thing that ministers in fact I believe because I have seen it more than once that there are ways in which our natural abilities get in the way and stifle the real work of the Holy Spirit as he's trying to use you as a channel it works like this let's just pick on me because I have fun doing that and I'm into self-abuse and things like that. But I know that you think that I just have the gift of God. I could just talk and I think to a degree it's right. I feel like there's ways about me that I could stand up, have nothing to say and take 25 minutes to say it. I mean, I could just go on and on and on. And there are times, I suppose, with that ability that I could stand in the pulpit and look at the clock and say, I've got 25 minutes to say it. Okay, I'll go. And I could fill up 25 minutes. And that ability to talk would just stifle the work of the Spirit that He wants to use me for to minister to the body. Because when I have an ability, I don't need to pray. I don't need to wrestle with the text. I don't need to wrestle with the Spirit in terms of my yieldedness. I don't need to do any of those things. I've got an ability. I can fill 25 minutes easy. I'll just go on and on and on. And I'll tell you, I'll talk for 25 minutes and I won't say nothing. Nothing of power is demonstrated. Singers, the same thing. I think we kind of fall, because it's a vocal thing again, playing the piano. You know when Pam, when you were playing the piano, I just started to weep and it was weird. Because the fact that you were hitting the notes, it was like, so what was ministering was you. And that's... The ability was being used, but it was something else. It was something different. Something of power. But the ability sometimes can get in the way. Gifts are not necessarily in accordance to ability. Conversely, while you have an ability, it may not be a gift. Conversely, you may physically look like you don't have an ability. And in some amazing, illogical way, the Holy Spirit of God may work through you. work through you in amazing ways. Some of the poorest people I know have the gift of giving. Let that go in your mind a little bit. Some of the poorest people I know have the gift of giving. A particular friend of mine, loved dearly, just has an ability to sense a need, and not only sense a need, but just to give. and I've seen this person give to people who had more than them. Isn't that bizarre? The gift of giving, and it wasn't in accordance to an ability at all. I wouldn't look at them. You know, if I was running a program, I'd give the gift of giving to rich people. I mean, that makes sense to me, doesn't it? But maybe not, because what would happen is the rich people would give it to the poor people and the poor people wouldn't have the gift of giving it, so they'd just get rich and the rich people become poor. So you'd have the same thing anyway. Thank you, one person got it. but some of the richest people I know don't seem to have that gift and we're all very careful and we watch it and there's no freedom and oh we hold it back and there's the channel it's just gummed up and it can't flow and it can't move just so you know that isn't necessarily always true one of the people I know whose gift of giving stands out more than anybody I know is a person who has tremendous amounts of money but you know what? He sees that his whole life as being a channel. It's just like this. And God puts it in one end and he goes wham right out the other. And the whole thing is about faith. The whole thing is believing that if I let it go he's going to supply it. So I just let it go. Gifts are not necessarily in accordance with ability. Maybe the greatest illustration of that could be found in 1 Corinthians chapter 2. If I ask you a question who is the greatest preacher in the New Testament I think the person you'd come up with Is the person we're studying today Apostle Paul He's the dominant figure Some of you might think of Apollos Or someone like that But the dominant figure really In most of our minds Is the Apostle Paul And yet as I study the Apostle Paul And even not just going into a text But even reading historically Some of the accounts of the Apostle Paul It becomes apparent to me That he didn't have a lot of the stuff That we think we have to have If somebody's going to go into the ministry and have a pulpit ministry. He didn't have a lot of the physical things we think you have to have. One of the historical records of his appearance said this, that he was a short, little, fat, bald-headed Jew. And now I told him I'd get him back. I told him how he said him. I don't mean to make you feel bad. If you want to know what Apostle Paul is, stand up, would you please? There he was. There he was. I told him this morning as he was coming to church, I'd get him. But it was also apparent, it was also apparent that the Apostle Paul was not a natural speaker. He didn't have, he didn't have the natural just gift of gab. That wasn't where he was at. 1 Corinthians chapter 2, he said this, I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. And you know what? I believe him. I believe him. You know, I've read that passage before and I thought, Well, isn't that humble? I believe him. I think he felt weak. And I think he was trembling. And I think that he didn't have a lot of confidence in himself. First Corinthians also. You know, I think that Paul probably would have flunked preaching class at seminary. Because he talks about weakness and fear and much trembling. And the first thing you know, the first thing you learn in preaching class is if you need anything, you've got to have confidence. You've got to be strong. You've got to let people know that you know. Becoming weakness and fear and much trembling, forget it. To top all that off, his speech was not with enticing words of man's wisdom. When Paul opened his mouth, people didn't go, Wow, wow, that's... In fact, people in Corinth and 2 Corinthians said, Who is this guy? This man of rude speech. The point is this, that he felt weak. And he felt inadequate. And a lot of times he felt real small. And he didn't have a lot of ability that way. In terms that we would kind of picture someone who would be there. But you know what he had? He had a gift. And because he had a gift, he had to use it. Like it or not. And even the word of God indicates to us that there were times he didn't. He said to the church in Corinth, he said, I have nothing to boast about. Because I'm under compulsion. I have to do this. Woe unto me if I don't. And I don't like it sometimes, and there's a hundred other places I'd rather be sometimes, and people throw things at me, and people revile me, and people go home and pick me apart, and I'm going to do it anyway. And I'm afraid, and I'm weak, and I don't feel strong, but I'm going to do it. And it wasn't in accordance with his ability. You know what the result was? The result was that when he spoke, what came out was not a demonstration of his ability to fill up 25 minutes. It was a demonstration of power and of the Spirit. Gifts are not necessarily in accordance with our natural abilities. They may be, but the absence of them does not limit God at all. Second principle I want you to understand about the gifts that Jesus won at the cross and gave to his church is that there is not a hierarchy of gifts. 2 Corinthians chapter 12, this is what Jim read this morning. If the foot should say to the hand, because I'm not a hand, I'm not a part of the body. It is not for this reason any less a part of the body. I love verse 17. I think this is funny. If the whole body were an eye, you just think of a big eye just kind of floating through the world, you know, big eyeball. And again, alluding back to what I was talking about before, how we all kind of have this infatuation with gifts that are visible and gifts I can see. What we would have it be would be that the whole church would be a mouth, just a big mouth, you know, walking through and being the church. There is no hierarchy of gifts. I am really tired of the mentality that wrongly assumes that what's up front is what's most vital. It isn't. That's a lie. And I'm not trying to be humble. That's not my nature. You know that. That's a lie. There's two problems with that mentality. first thing is sinful kinds of pride that can move into the people who are visible. They can really begin to believe it. Oh, I tell you, it's just sick. And the other problem is this, that others are trying to function in an area where they're not equipped, they're not gifted, and all it is is frustration and the rest of the body is dying because the channel that God really gave them isn't being used because he's just convinced it's something else. Listen, what makes the body a body? And what makes the body strong? And you remember the whole theme we're talking about here is unity in the church, right? Unity is not established by everybody being the same. This concept that I'm going to dump on you here is real hard to grasp because our concept of unity is everybody just being the same. Remember the moose hat mentality? The moose lodge, you know, everybody think alike, talk alike, act alike, everything's alike. And that's our idea of unity. The unity that is distinct and makes the church set apart is our unity comes only in our diversity. The fact that we're different, the fact that we have different gifts and different effects and different ministries and all of them functioning, coming together to produce a unity. I've really stayed away from football illustrations. Oh, I don't believe it. I've stayed away from football illustrations and here is my coach from college. I don't believe this. I haven't done this for months. But this one fits. I used to get kidded all the time For all my football illustrations And so I quit But this one's too good The strength of a team is found And the unity that comes Is not found in everybody being the same It's found The strength of the team is found When everybody's doing their position The diversity There's a center and there's a guard And the guard doesn't do what the center does Because he's in trouble If he does And the tackle does something else And the end does something else and the quarterback does something else. And I could just see it, spring training or something, where the Vikings are, if everybody came and said, I want to be a quarterback, and they all line up there, you know, nobody else would be there. It's just all people who want to be quarterback. That would look real stupid. And I could just see the quarterback getting behind the center and kind of feeling a little cocky. My gift is the most important thing to this team. And guard, I have no need of you. Want to bet? Back now and then, we just show that little quarterback how much she needs us. What makes the body strong? All have been given. Christ won that gift for you at the cross and he gave it to you. And it's different. And the blendings of the categories of giftedness that you have is totally different than mine. And all I can do is do mine and you do yours and the body is built. See, I exhort and you give and you have mercy and you do helps and you teach and you help rule and you administrate and we all do it and it comes together. And I don't do it all and you don't do it all and it's the body. Verse 23, you know what? I like this. And those members, it's talking about those members who would deem themselves being less important, those members of the body which we deem less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor. And our unseemly members, ugly, okay, members come to have more abundant seemliness. whereas our samely members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, given more abundance, even to those members who lack. The ones that we think are insignificant are the ones that the Word of God says are the vital parts. Think again. The illustration is of the body, so I have to use the physical body. But think again of the physical body. The most vital parts of your physical body are the ones you don't see, and they're all the ugliest. We have the idea that, again, the most important part is the face. You know, but I can't have my face mangled, and I could still live, and I could still function. It wouldn't be as nice, and I'd have some psychological problems, but, you know, I could function. The liver, oh, that's ugly. The kidneys, the bladder, I'm not going to do much without those things. We wrongly assume, and Paul is saying this, we wrongly assume that what's out front is what's most important. We have this idea, and I think it's even crept into our evangelical circles, that what we need is strong pulpits. I think we need strong pulpits. But the power of the church is in strong pews. There is no hierarchy. Verse 25. Again, we give more abundant honor to the one who lacks. Verse 25. That there should be no division in the body. But that the members should have the same care for one another. There is no gift that's superior. The same care for you as the care for me. We care for each other the same. Why? Because there is no hierarchy. I have problems with titles. You know, when people call me reverend, you know, I almost feel bad I did that because it's like, I love you. But when I feel like when people call me reverend, they either don't know me or they don't like me because my name is Dave. And dress that would set us apart, there's no hierarchy and we need to know that you see I've received a gift just like you and you know what I've been charged of God as long as he gives me breath to use it and to keep the channel open and sometimes I don't feel like it and sometimes I get afraid and sometimes I get tired and I want to just stop it but as long as God gives me breath if I love the church I'm going to keep giving and I've been given a gift and so have you and I'm going to have to keep using it and so do you but there is no hierarchy they're all important so when you speak speak as it were the oracles of God and when you serve do it as unto God third thing you can have a gift and not use it real quick you can have a gift and not use it the channel can be blocked Classic illustration of this is the church in Corinth. Remember, it was said in that 1 Corinthians 1 verse 7, you come behind in no gift. You have all the channels that you need. Again, that's theology there. When Christ died at the cross, he brought with him the trophies and he gave them to the church in Corinth. You come behind in no gift. But you're carnal and you're divisive and you're immoral and you're selfish and your relationships stink. You're suing each other and you're wrapped up in divorce. and so you blocked off the channel the gifts are all there but they're not being used not to the glory of god listen every believer has the gift every believer has the gift and there's all sorts of things that block it off laziness there's a mentality that moves in the church that i've done my part and since i've done my part i can kind of lay back sometimes we're just afraid sometimes we don't know enough about the gifts to realize the foundation from which it comes. That this, along with my salvation, are the two most important things he's ever given me. And because of fear, or because of I don't know, or because of some sort of sin in my life, I take that gift that he's given, and I shelve it, and I say, nah, what's the big deal? What's the big deal? Let me tell you something. If what you do in terms of functioning, in terms of serving the church, is nothing but a physical activity that you've backed off of, then go ahead and back off. Because physical activity is not what we're talking about. Anybody can do physical activity. But if you have been a channel and you have seen that kind of channel minister through you, and you stop it, there's a problem there. You know what's something else? If we have visitors, this isn't a drive to join our church. This isn't a drive even for people to get involved in a Wanda. It's not a drive to get involved in a program. It's involved in letting the Spirit of God minister His gift through you. And I believe fully that as you begin to waken up to the ministry God's given you, some of you may have to leave because you can't function in here. You can't use it here. Some of you got called to the mission field. We can't shelve it. We can't be indifferent toward it. These gifts were run at the cross, And they were granted to the believer for the joy of the believer, for the ministry of the body, for the building of the church, so that Christ can be seen in the church, so that his kingdom can be advanced. And it is not something we can set aside. God's given a gift, and as long as he gives us breath, that channel needs to be opened. 1 Peter 4.10 says, As each one has received a spiritual gift, employ it in serving one another. It's about service, by the way. Gifts, spiritual gifts, are about serving one another. That's why it ties in with fellowship so much. Employ it. How? As a good steward. Again, this whole picture of the gift, this package that Christ went at the cross and gave to me, with all these multi-phasic gifts within it, he gives it to me, and it's like right here, and I have to be a good steward of that gift that he's given. Now, we talk about stewardship when it comes to money. And we understand it, I think, when it comes to money. Maybe some of us don't. But it doesn't mean, when we talk about stewardship with money, it doesn't mean we hoard it. It doesn't mean we take it and bury it. It doesn't mean we're real protective of it and just watch it and make sure it's all wonderful. To be a good steward of what God's given us is to use it. It's like the person who was given the talents. Remember that parable? And he was given a talent and he went and buried it, thinking he was being a good steward. I have to protect this. I have to take care of it. And so I'm going to be a steward. I'll put it in the ground and it'll be the same when he comes back. And he gave it back to me. He says, you lose it. I wanted you to use it. That's what stewardship is. And trust that when it goes out one end of the channel, God's going to supply through the other one. And here's where the fear comes. Here's where the fear comes when it comes to letting the channel be open. Because if I let it go, if I let it go, that means I'm going to have to trust the Lord to fill it up. And if it just flows and flows, I wonder if he can. And it's all about trust. It's all about trust. And so instead of trusting, I stop it. And then it fills up. But you know what? Now God's done. No? You get that? Now God's done. It just fills up and I live on what I see. I take a little bit out. Okay, a little too far. And that's all about the gifts. That's all about the gifts. It's all about giving myself. And I give and I give. And Paul said, I'm willing to spend and to be spent. I'm a channel. I'm a channel. It's a stewardship. And the only way we're ever going to be worthy of the trust that he has placed in us by giving us the gift is for us to use it, to spend it, to let it flow. But we're afraid and we're skeptical and we lack the faith and we hold back. How far should we go? Is this thing really real? I see God moving me and I go, Whoa, it's scary. But that's why this thing is about being a channel. It comes in one end and it goes out the other. and if there is no faith and if there is fear and if we're all skeptical God will be done and our church is going to look real human and real normal but it won't be a demonstration of power and all we'll be doing is living on what we see in the tube and we need to let it go and let it flow the last thing is this I've said first you can have a gift and not use it and this is where I tie it all in and this is it. You know, I'm really pumping you up to use the gift God gave you. And some of you are sitting and going, I'm really frustrated, I'm really scared, because I don't even know. We list all the gifts, and I don't even know my gift. And you want me to use it, and I don't even know my gift. My last point is this. You can be ministering a gift and not know it. You can be ministering a gift and not know it. And I'll add this. It's okay. It's okay. In fact, you're probably a lot more healthy than some of us who are always trying to figure out my gift and then exercising it like I walk a dog. Let me teach this by just kind of giving you an illustration from Galatians 5. I want to make a real clear distinction between gifts of the Spirit and fruits of the Spirit. Fruits of the Spirit are what? Remember Galatians 5? Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, on down the line. Those are the fruits of the Spirit. They are not the gifts of the Spirit. But I want you to watch the flow here. As we walk in the Spirit, as we walk in the Spirit, what are we talking about now? we're talking about all the Ephesians, right? the walk a worthy walk how humbly gently on and on and on as you walk a worthy walk as you walk and the spirit of God is in control of your life he begins to produce in you first of all these inner graces love, joy, peace long-suffering and I would like to submit to you that it's only out of those inner graces that the gifts begin to minister through you and let's just forget about focusing on my gift and focus on the inner graces. Focus on the fruits of the Spirit and as those things begin to flow through you, the ministry that God has given you is going to begin to flow. There aren't any shortcuts. It isn't a talent that you can just get up and sing and it sounds the same way every time. You know, I was in college. It was about 20 years ago. No. When I was in college, the big rage was discovering your gift. Oh, we were just going crazy trying to discover our gifts. We'd have Bible studies and I remember there was a computer. I heard about this place where there was a computer and you could fill this thing out. All your characteristics, your personality, how much you love the Lord, a little, a lot, not too much, and you know, right down the line. And they would send you back this readout telling you what your gift was. Oh, good. Oh, exercise. I'm going to walk in the dog again. And there were books coming out and they would be how to discover your spiritual gift. And at the end of the book, at the end of the chapter, there'd be a little test you take and how you did on the test kind of told you what your gift was. Oh, great. All discovering our gifts. My point is this. I don't think it makes a lot of difference if you've analyzed it or not, what your gift is. The issue is not, do I know my gift? The issue is this. Are those inner graces working in me? Are those inner graces, love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, are those things flowing through me? Because it's only then that the flow, the channel's going to be open. That's it. you see if they are Ephesians 4 again this is why my sermons are so long I feel like this has been an 8 week long sermon started in Ephesians 4 verse 1 if we're walking in obedience if we're filled with the spirit he's going to produce in us wonderful things like love, joy, peace, humility, gentleness and out of that the spirit of God will make your whole life a ministry and as the flow begins and you're serving him and he's using you I'm absolutely convinced that all that's going to have to happen is for you to have those things be flowing through you and you start serving the Lord it's just a matter of stopping and saying so that's what I do I didn't know that I was just loving the Lord I was just I was just focusing on him and his exhortation to me I entreat you to walk in a manner worthy of the gospel and as we do that and humility and gentleness and forbearing love become our characteristics out of that flow of life is going to be ministering your gift to us Thank you.
