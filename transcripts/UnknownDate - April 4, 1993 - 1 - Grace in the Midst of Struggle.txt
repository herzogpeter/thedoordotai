I think that most of you are aware of the fact that we are in the middle of a series that has come to be known among us as the pain of pornea. It is a series that was born out of our flowing through the book of Acts, came to Acts 15, verse 20, where we heard the apostle James to a group of new believers in Antioch, Syria, give this instruction. Among other things, abstain from fornication. The Greek word for fornication is porneia. We've pulled that word out and made it part of the title of the series, The Pain of Porneia. In most recent weeks, relative to the series, we have been dealing with what I've been calling four whatabouts. In the light of the pain of porneia, what about healthy sexuality? Does that exist at all, in any context? In light of the pain of porneia, what about singleness and sexuality? Was the second, the third, was in the light of the pain of porneia, What about when in the arena of our sexuality we have lost control and the fourth was this or is this? What about homosexuality? Today we are going to begin dealing with that. Our beginning in this involves the inviting of a guest. He's a new friend of mine and I believe of Church of the Open Door. His name is Joe Hallett. Joe has been the director of Outpost Ministries for a little over a year. He has been involved in Outpost Ministries for a little over seven years. Outpost is a ministry that is facilitating people who are coming out of the gay lifestyle. I could begin to move into his story a bit and speak of him, but he is going to come and share his story and his own coming out of the gay lifestyle. He is a member at the present time at Bethlehem Baptist Church. being discipled in, I think, some real precious ways to you by a guy who's a very good friend of mine, John Piper, who was the pastor there. In fact, it was from John that I first heard of Joe, and then some other things came together to make it feel like a fit for him to come on this particular day. I want to share a couple of the reasons specifically why we've asked him to come and be our guest today. First of all, for many Christians and many people in churches, homosexuality is nothing more than an issue. It is an emotional and volatile issue, but it's this issue, and it's an issue over which we debate. Is it right? Is it wrong? And lots of feelings around that. The reasons I've asked Joe to come is that Joe Hallett is not an issue. He's a person. And I think it's very important, as I begin in just a couple of weeks, to move into the issue of this through my teaching, So on the front end, have a person involved in this. The people in our body who struggle with homosexuality, both men and women, are not issues. They are people. We want to have that coloring everything we do over the next couple of weeks. The second reason we've asked Joe to come is because Joe stands for and speaks to the reality of God's amazing grace and power to heal in an arena of life that many who struggle with have lost hope entirely. It is with a great sense of joy that I am turning this pulpit over to you today, Joe. Joy was here, Joe was here. And I'd like you to welcome him. I thought I had an identity crisis there for a moment. And I've had a few, so it's not like unusual or anything. It's good to be here. it's a hard issue isn't it it's really hard but we have a big God I'm just going to share my story because I think it's important for you to know how people get into homosexuality they don't choose it per se but a lot of times all the little choices we make bring us to something or put us in a place where had we known where it was going to go, we would have chose something different. I mean, I didn't wake up at age 13 and say, gee, I want to be a social outcast and offend my parents. What can I do? Steal cars? No, I'm 13, don't have a license. Do drugs? No, I don't like needles in the air. There's always guns involved with drugs. No, I know, I'll be a homosexual. Dad will really get a kick out of that one. It's not the way it happens. People are involved in homosexuality because they want to be loved. They want to belong. They're just like everybody else out here. We all want to fit in. And that's the way I did. I don't think homosexuality is genetic because I'll just share in my life. In my own life, it was not a genetic thing. I think little boys, little girls are created to have connection with their parents. And if they don't have that, they look elsewhere for it. I always wanted my father to love me. But for whatever reason, he had a struggle doing so. I think mostly because of his own childhood and his own lack of nurture from his father. But my father had four things he used to say over me. You're stupid, you're ugly, you're untalented, and no one is ever going to love you. Those were the words that were spoken over me so many times. I just want to say one thing to you fathers out there. Love your children. Hug them, hold them. If you have a problem saying the word to them, get over it. Because the problem is not that child. In Outpost, we deal with a lot of people coming out of homosexuality, and one of the big things we see in common is a lack of connection with a same-sex parent. It doesn't matter what they struggle with, lesbianism, homosexuality. That's the thing we see again and again. And again, in my own life, I wanted my dad to love me. I'd do anything for my father to love me. And I worked really hard to try to please him. And I failed no matter what I did. So what did I do? I began to look elsewhere for it. I wanted him to love me, but he wouldn't. I remember when I was like eight years old, I used to cut the Marlboro Man out of magazines, you know. And I'd just, good-looking men, any good-looking men, I'd cut him out and I'd stick him under my bed, under the mattress, and I'd pull it out at night and I would look at it and I would create whole scenarios as I went to sleep about that man. There was nothing sexual. I would sort of dream my parents were dead a couple years now. We're done grieving. And this man adopts me and he does all the things that my father wouldn't do. He loves me. He tells me he loves me. He holds me. He teaches me how to play baseball. I was just vulnerable desperately vulnerable for connection with masculinity I went to church all the time I mean I grew up in a Christian church you know grew up being religious went to church every Sunday you know fought all the way there we're nice and in church and then you know we fought all the way home it really changed me. I knew all about God. I knew where I lived. I knew what kind of clothes he wore. But I didn't know him. You know? I didn't know him. I didn't have a relationship with him. Religion was about something you did, not about someone you knew. And I suppose if it had been different, my life would have been really different. But God uses everything, I'm convinced, good or bad in our lives, to glorify him. well when I was 11 years old I was sexually molested by a young man that was a really confusing thing for me those of you who have been abused you know what that does to you just changes you for me it was really confusing because I had this man giving me attention I was so desperate for attention from a man and here was somebody giving me lots of it. But it had a spin on it, you know, that made my own needs suspect and my own attractions wrong or bad ever after. Well, that abuse went on for a long time because I couldn't tell anyone. I didn't know how to tell anyone. If you struggle with the issue of homosexuality, you live just a real silent kind of desperate life. Terrified that if people find out, you know, you're going to really get it. And sometimes they do, and it's really awful. So it's like the biggest secret. You've got to keep it at all. All counts. You grow up feeling different. Feeling different. You just don't quite sync with everybody else. And I sure grew up feeling that way. Wanting to be a part of the rest of the world, sort of, but not feeling it. Well, I grew older, as we're apt to do if left to our own devices. Yep. I continue to do that. I've gotten really good at it of late. and I went off to college and college was really, really good for me, folks because I got involved in a ministry called Campus Crusade for Christ and they were really good they presented to me a different kind of God than the one I'd grown up with see, I'd grown up thinking that God was just like my dad kind of big and nasty God was always squishing people you know like you do ants when they come out that's what God was doing he's always squishing people the only reason he hadn't squished me thus far was you know the sneaker was coming down and I got out from under him just in time I didn't quite make it all the way but but that's the way I thought God was oh I need to move the tide down oh cool Oh, now we lost it. Testing. I always wanted to be a comedian when I grew up. Is that better? Cool. Now where was I? Nice day, huh? Oh yeah, God. Squishing people. I mean, the only reason he wasn't squishing me, it was squishing somebody else. Well, they presented me with a different kind of God. They presented me with a God who loved me, loved me so much that he sent Jesus to die for me. And man, hey, I wanted a father, even if one was a little bit invisible, you know? So I chose God. But I was terrified of leaving homosexuality because I was so used to going there to get my needs met. I knew it worked. I knew I could do it. I knew all about it. And that was like a place to be loved and to get those needs met. I didn't really like it. I sort of settled for it. I wanted something more in my life. But, you know, the whole world says you're gay, it's genetic, you can't help yourself. Poor thing. Settle for it. So, you know, I just thought, well, I'm gay, I can't help it, and I can't change. So I told God, I said, God, I really want you, but I can't leave homosexuality. You're going to have to love me where I'm at. And God is so cool. He does that, you know. He does that with each of us. He takes us right where we're at. Unlike the church at times who wants us to be all fixed before we come in. So I said, God, you've got to take me where I'm at. And that began in me a battle. For the next seven and a half years, I was either going hard after God, Trying to ignore the H word stuff, you know. Or hard after homosexuality and trying to ignore God. There's a lot of people that say that you can live peacefully together with both of those. But I don't really think you can. I did not experience it. I just don't think it's possible. You're going to love one and hate the other and back and forth. And that was like a seesaw, you know. Well, after two years in college, I couldn't stand it anymore. I was tired of some people knowing, some people not knowing. So I came out and I told everyone, I'm gay, it's genetic, I can't help myself. Not. And I went home, told my folks, I'm gay, it's genetic, can't change, get used to it. My mother said a really neat thing, I think that left the door open for me though. she said I don't think this is what God wants for you but I will love you and I will always love you that left God open to me left the door open so many times when a family hears that somebody in their life struggles with homosexuality they just want to kick them out and I don't think it works because the first step towards wholeness is that confession of I'm struggling with homosexuality I mean I don't think the gay community goes far enough with it but that's the first step. Nobody can really be healed until they make that one step. Well, I dropped out of college, moved here to Minneapolis. There's a lot of homosexuals here, folks, if you didn't know. And I jumped headlong into the gay lifestyle. And I want to tell you something. At first, it really was neat. I think the church could learn one thing from the gay community. They're very accepting of people, where they're at. they really are they'll take you where you're at we need to learn to do that more I think this church probably does a better job than most churches I mean but it's still a problem and we still need to learn how to be vulnerable as a body so that we can let other people be vulnerable well again at first it was really cool it met all my needs I thought it's great you know but after a while I found that love so often times it's much more for males than for women but often times love was predicated on sex if we have sex and it's really good maybe we'll have a relationship and hey I was willing to pay for that I would do that I was willing you know I'll settle for that I'll take that I want a relationship because lurking in the back of my mind was always the lie you're unlovable you are unlovable if people really knew you they wouldn't love you so I was willing to pay any price to be loved had a lot of sex folks I'm not proud of it but it's true sex is real cheap but something was much much harder and that was love it's easy to have sex you can have sex with someone and feel intimate and known by them and not really expose yourself. And that's where I was at. But you know the healing comes from? As we are known and loved despite our warts and, you know, our grossnesses and our dirt. Still loved. That's when healing happens. Well, I lived here for a time and just was really frustrated with my life. It was back in one of those depression times when nobody had jobs. Not the 20s, the other one. I'm not that old. I always tell people we keep better in Minnesota. I'm actually 70. They really buy that in the South. Well, I was frustrated with my life, and I just couldn't stand it. So I did what most people do when their life is a mess, and they don't know where to go or what to do. I joined the Army. Yeah, the Army was really great I mean, it was really cool Hated basic training at first though Those drill sergeants, yeah It was great for me Because through my growing up And through my involvement in homosexuality I had attached lots of lies to who I was And who I thought I was And the Army began to pull those lies off because you know what? One of the lies I believed was that I wasn't a man. You weren't a man unless you were like six feet and being five, seven, and three quarters. I just didn't quite measure up. Well, in the army, I began to see that maybe I was a man in just a smaller version. I mean, those six-footers I envied all the time. I mean, their legs start about right here, you know? All that leg, you think they could run. Some of those big guys just couldn't run at all. And, you know, I just always envied them, and I thought, man, they should be able to do lots of push-ups and sit-ups. Some of those big guys were really lousy. I was like, wow. Maybe I am a man. Smaller version, of course. Scaled down size. The compact version. Not a bus. So it was really healing for me. That lie about not being man began to fall. Well, I ended up in Europe, in Heidelberg, Germany, and I got a really, really hard job there, folks. Yep, real hard. I ended up singing in the army band and chorus. You should be so lucky. All you should do is sing and dance for hundreds of thousands of people. Yep. Cool thing happened, though. I originally signed on, just sort of be a member of the band and the chorus and not do much. But it seemed I had one of the bigger voices. Well, bigger anyways. I don't know if it's better. And they put me in front as a principal soloist. I began to see that maybe I did have talent, you know. And another lie went... So I think God was preparing me all along for another move of His Spirit. Well, I'd like to tell you I got out of the gay lifestyle. but I met this perfect man who was going to meet all my needs. He was 6'5". He was a real man. I had arrived. I had everything I wanted. I had this man who was going to meet my needs. I had this great job. I was touring all over Europe. My parents were thousands of miles away. It doesn't get any better than this. And if you've ever been in that place, or maybe you will be someday, you get everything you want and find it's not enough. It doesn't fill up the hole. It doesn't meet your need. I came to that place. It didn't work. All the stuff I'd gotten, everything I did, it didn't work. I was still unhappy. Didn't know what to do with that, but praise God that he moves when we're ready for it. There was this woman in my unit, and she was real weird. She was a fanatic. God squad. You've seen him. Glow it in the dark. Yeah. I mean, I think if you take Dave out on a good dark night, he'll blow. He'll blow. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, the problem is we're touring, right? And we've got nine hours on a bus with this woman. Oh, hi, Debbie. Yeah, you can sit here. Thanks. I agreed with her about God and all the points that she brought up. I was in agreement. Convicted. it. Agreement. I just saw such a difference in her life and mine. Well, Debbie did something else, too. She thought it would be really cool if I started to go to church again. I mean, I was going when I first came to the Lord, but come on, it's been a while. And one morning, she drives up on post, says, hey, Joe, do you want to go to church with me? I had an excuse. I said, no, I have a hangover. Maybe next week. I thought she'd catch on. She's not real quick in this department, though. Next week, there she is again. Well, I had an excuse. I thought, well, that'll take care of her. Next week, there she is again. This went on, folks, not for one month or two months or three months or four months. It went on for five months before I went to church with her. I know. Finally, I went just to get her off my back. I'm going to go and she's going to leave me alone. I went. The church was kind of fun, you know? I just, it was fun. I enjoyed it. But a weirder thing happened. God showed up. Oh, you've been there when he showed up, huh? I mean, it was really wild. It was like, whoa, it's kind of cool. I don't know what it is. And I realized what I was hungry for and searching for was God. By that time, I was starting to realize that I didn't want to have a man, but I wanted to be a man. So I began to pray. A little prayer. Prayer gets you in so much trouble, doesn't it? Doesn't it? All the time. I started praying this little prayer. I said, God, if this relationship with this man is wrong, I want you to give me the desire to leave it. A little prayer. Four months later, I left that relationship. I wanted something more. I thought, maybe he's just the wrong guy. I'll keep looking. But I knew I had to decide. So I began to pray if homosexuality was wrong, that God would give me the desire to leave it. Four months later, I was in a bar in Berlin, and all my friends had left, and I began to reflect on my life. And I realized that all my attempts at being loved had failed, and I wasn't any closer to being loved there than I was at the beginning. And I told him I made a mess of my life and my sexuality, And if he would take me back, I would follow him. Got up out of that bar and I went. And immediately, God began to bring people into my life that could love me where I was at. It was pretty cool. Pretty exciting. Well, my time in the Army is drawing to a close. I was pretty excited about that. I had been accepted at a Bible college. I was going to go to a Bible college and become a pastor or something when I grew up. Yeah, I'm still waiting on that one. This growing up process takes a whole lot longer than anybody ever tells you. Well, I got my physical for getting out of the Army. Everything was clear. And what a relief. That was 1986. And back then, AIDS was the big word, you know. Sweeping the homosexual community. If you talk to someone or someone with AIDS breathed on you, you died six months later. That was it, you know. That's the kind of hysteria there was out there. A month later, a friend came and told me that he had contracted HIV. You know, I felt sad for him, but I felt more relief for myself. I mean, I was practically Pentecostal, you know? Praise God. Because, again, it was a homosexual disease. I was out of it. I wasn't going to get it. Woo! Well, a month later, I got a call from the doctors, and they said your blood test was abnormal. What does that mean? They're HIV positive. Found out I wasn't just HIV positive folks, but that I was in full-blown AIDS and they gave me about two years to live. I was 25 years old. Death is not supposed to happen when you're 25. You're not supposed to have to deal with it. That's supposed to happen in the 30s or 40s, I think. But not at 25. It was the end of my life. I mean, first I went through the bargaining with God. Well, the denial. This is just a bad dream. This is just a bad dream. It can't be real. It can't be real. Then I went through the bargaining with God. God, I'll give you this if you let me live six more months. Problem is I'd already given him everything. Take my sister, please. Yeah. It was a hard time, folks. It was a hard time. really, really hard. March 25th, I celebrated my seventh year anniversary of being diagnosed with AIDS. Amen. It's been really hard. I'm not going to tell you that. I've just sort of had a great time with this. It's been really hard. I've almost died four times about. The virus, it does different things to different people, and for me, it attacked my brain. At one point, I lost most of my speaking ability, most of my walking ability. Doctors didn't know if I'd get better, if I'd stay bad, if I would die. Another time, it just doing more fun things in my brain. And I was in so much pain. Couldn't sleep. Couldn't eat. I mean, couldn't do anything. I had to have people to help me to the bathroom. But, you know, I just praise God that he can use that kind of suffering so powerfully in life. Because, you know, when you're flat on your back and you can't do anything, and you're just dependent on people, you get a different idea of where your value lies. I learned that my value doesn't come from how I look or what I do, but it comes from who He is. I think that's the greatest thing anyone can learn about themselves. I mean, there's probably better ways to learn it, but it's been hard, but I really had to learn to lean on God. And you know, God has freed me of the issue of homosexuality in so many ways. I think we are healed in our homosexuality if we struggle with it. Not as we deny it like so many people do. You know, 40 years, they lock it in a closet, and they think, if I can just keep it there, it'll be okay. Or if I just get married, that'll fix it. None of those things work. I think freedom and healing for the homosexual comes as they say, I'm struggling with this issue of homosexuality. But not that they go on and accept it and say, let's rationalize the lifestyle based on this. But that they say, I need help. I need support. I need people that will walk with me as I desire to walk in obedience before God. Because I really don't think God, that the orientation is sin, just the attraction. An attraction is only a finger pointing to your need. But I think there's godly ways of dealing with it and ungodly ways. Godly ways heal. Ungodly ways cement the problem. I found that all the good girlfriends in the world wouldn't help me, but what I needed was healthy intimacy with men. And God has brought great healing to me through the body of Christ. I've learned in so many ways that I'm just like all of you. The gay community will tell you that you're not. You're different. You're different. but as I've grown in Christ I've realized that we're all the same we're all the same we all need a savior and God has a conforming work he wants to do in each of us so my word for you this afternoon I hope is one of encouragement that we have a really really big God who is able to meet you right where you're at whatever you struggle with I mean sexual addiction is rampant in the church I'm sure a lot of you are struggling with all sorts of things but I want you to know that God is big enough to meet you there and don't be ashamed of what you struggle with because we all struggle with something no one gets out of here alive without struggling with something and your freedom will come as you're willing to be vulnerable take two vulnerable about what you struggle with I've had great healing in my life because God has helped me to learn to be vulnerable I mean, I have no secrets. I mean, who's going to come to Dave and say, Do you know this about Joe? I just said it, you know? But God can change me. I know He can change you. The reality is if God can't change orientation, homosexual orientation, that's a little thing, right? Compared to what He does with all of us at the point of conversion. At the point of conversion, He takes something that's dead spiritually and makes it live. He breathes His life into it. That's a far bigger thing, I believe, than just changing sexual orientation. But he can do that too. Because he's done enormous things in my life. And I want to share with you, September 18th, I'm getting married. So, don't limit God. You know, the pride of the worm says, oh, my struggle is too big for God to change. He can make all the stars in the heavens, and he can make me, but he can't change me. That's a kind of reverse form of pride, folks. We have a great God, and just serve him. He's worthy of our whole lives. That's all I have to say. You can come talk to me after, and if you want to hug me, shake my hand, I promise not to bleed on any of you. I just want to pray now. Papa, I just thank you so much that we can come into the very throne room of God and tug on your sleeve. I just thank you for that honor. God, I pray that you would just move powerfully over this body of Christ and that you would just minister grace and courage and strength and that they will have the freedom to share their shames and their secret because those are the things that keep us in bondage, our silence, not the things we struggle with. God, I pray that you just move in power and touch many people. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
