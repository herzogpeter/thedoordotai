Hi there, we are the Frasers, and we are going to be reading the scripture for today. And I am Chris. I'm Hunter. I'm Delaney. I'm Drake. And I'm Robin. And today's scripture reading is from Luke chapter 2, verses 25 through 32. Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah. Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the law required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying, Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. All right, would you pray with me as we dive into the talk for this weekend? God, we ask you to come, but really you're already here. So really what we're asking for is for us to have eyes to see and hearts that are open to what you're doing around us and in us so that we can respond and move into what you're doing in us and around us so that what you want to be born into this world through us might be born into this world through us. In your name, amen. So, question, as we start our time together this morning, What are the rhythms in your life that anchor you to something bigger than the mundaneness of your small story? What are the rhythms in your life that help you to remember that there's a bigger story to which you are a part of and in which you have a role to play? I think without being intentional about this, you and I can get so caught up in the daily grind that we get to the end of each day and realize we have not looked up once. We have not paid attention once. We have not ordered our lives in such a way to where we might remember that there's a bigger story happening all around us. That God is doing something in the world and that we have a part to play. And that God wants to do something in our lives. But instead, you know, the alarm rings and we press snooze a few times. We get to work and it's a blur. There's four angry emails that we respond to. There's a couple of phone calls that we have to make, but we're dreading it because we know they're going to be conflictual. We get to lunchtime and we gobble down our food and we finally make it to where we can clock out. We get home and we do the dishes and we make dinner. Hopefully in the opposite order, though, we make dinner and then we do the dishes. unless you're really going crazy that day. And then you flop down in bed and you realize, I haven't lived at all today. So Advent is a season for you to remember that there is a bigger story in which you are a part and to which you must play a part. Advent is the beginning of the church calendar. It's so great. Some of you don't even know that Christians all around the world for centuries have followed a calendar that helped them. These are rhythms that help them remember who they are and what God is doing in the world. So it starts with Advent, this time of longing and waiting for light to come into darkness. And that's four weeks long, four weeks of waiting, and our culture is horrible at waiting, right? And then we go to Christmas, 12 days of Christmas, celebrating that Jesus has come, the King of kings and Lord of lords. Hope on ye broken hearts. The King is coming. For 12 days, we celebrate the fact that the King has come. And then we move into the new year, into Epiphany, where we remember that Jesus showed up as an actual person who actually existed in the actual universe, went around healing and teaching and hanging out with prostitutes and Pharisees and bringing his kingdom from heaven to earth. From there we go to Lent, 40 days of fasting and confessing our sins. And then we go to 49 days of resurrection. Did you know that Easter in the church calendar is not one day where we eat ham? It's 49 days where we celebrate the fact that tomorrow does not have to be a repeat of today, where resurrection life is possible, where it's possible to go from death to life because of what Jesus has done. On the cross, yes, but going through death and being resurrected, that's the kingdom coming. And then we go to Pentecost on the 50th day after Easter where we celebrate the outpouring of God's Spirit onto the church. And after that, for the next few months, is what is called ordinary time. When the church plays its role in the world. Then we move again to Advent. And that's the rhythm of the church calendar. That's the rhythm that has anchored followers of Jesus to the bigger story for centuries. And it's something that during Advent we get to celebrate. So Advent is this time of waiting where we have the opportunity to get in touch with our longings. It's this opportunity where we get the chance to get in touch with our longings. It's a season of waiting. Now, some of this waiting, we get highlighted about how actually hard this is for us in very ordinary ways. So last week, I just started noticing that my internet just got super, super intermittent and spotty at home. Like, at times it was blazing fast. Other times I couldn't get on the internet. And, of course, God created the world to have blazing fast internet at all times so that we wouldn't be inconvenienced in any way. Amen? So when we are inconvenienced in any way, we, and by we I mean me, I get upset. So I was on the phone for three or four times with my internet service provider, and they were telling me, this was Tuesday of last week, that the soonest that they could get a technician out would be Sunday. To which, in a very Christ-like manner, I responded, well, that's a long time. During Advent, we get in touch with our inability to wait. And those are little opportunities when we have the antenna up to remember that the world is a dark place, and my heart is a dark place sometimes. And I need Jesus to come into my heart so that I treat people on the phone maybe a little better. Now that's on the ordinary side of the spectrum. On the other side of the spectrum, you might have to wait through really horrific things like suffering and accidents and pain. I have a friend, his name is Hain. He's actually Dave Johnson's son-in-law, married to Erica. Hain had a mountain biking accident last month where he broke his neck in three places. So, and Hain is a really athletic guy. He's a firefighter. And before that, he realized that he had type 1 diabetes. So he'd been off the truck already for three months. He had just gotten back on the truck. And then the next day, he got into this accident. And it was a big deal. He had to have surgery. And he's looking like he's going to have a full recovery. And that is great. but you know that time, from the time that you have the accident to the time that you have the full recovery is what? A horrible time of waiting. And some of you, I know, have gotten into accidents lately or are experiencing job loss lately. Last week I told you about this couple who has this little baby that's been fighting for his little life. Well, the good news is this little baby is doing much better. I spent the last week at Children's, and his name is Jonathan. We can keep praying for Jonathan. We're hoping that Jonathan might actually be able to go home sometime this week. But for that season, and still, we're still in this season where we're like, okay, Lord, when are we going to know that this baby is going to be okay? So when we start dealing with those things, broken necks, babies who might not live, and then we think about the internet service provider who makes us wait five days. Perspective. And yet you and I are going to deal with both of them during Advent, are we not? I'm not so holy that I'm going to be able to say, oh, I'm never going to be bugged by someone who makes me wait five days for something I think I'm entitled to. That's just another opportunity to realize I need Jesus to come into my dark heart during this season. Listen to this verse from Psalm 80, verse 3. This is from the voice translation. I love this. Bring us back to you, God. That's a prayer to pray when you realize you've totally lost it at a service provider on the phone. Bring me back to you, God. Turn the light of your face upon us so that we might be rescued from this sea of darkness. It's a little dramatic, isn't it? Rescue me from this sea of darkness. Until you realize that that really is a pretty adequate description many times of this world and many times of my heart. So that might be a good breath prayer for you this season. Bring me back to you, God. Turn the light of your face upon me so that I can reflect who you are to the world and not who I am to the world. Turn your face upon me. Bring me back to you. So the question that I have for you as we begin this four-week journey into Advent is, what is it that you're longing for? What is it that you're waiting for? what are the places in this world and in your life that feel really really dark and hopeless where the song hope on ye broken hearts is really really poignant for you and instead of rushing to impatiently get that need met with instant gratification with the quickest way that you can get it met, what would it be like for you to instead bring that need to God and wait for God to show up? Here's what Frederick Buechner says about Advent from this book Whistling in the Dark. Frederick Buechner, one of my favorite authors, I would say read anything he's ever written. He writes this about Advent, the extraordinary thing that is about to happen, the thing you're anticipating, is matched only by the extraordinary moment just before it happens. And Advent is the name of that moment. Extraordinary thing that's about to happen is matched only by the extraordinary moment just before it happens. You know, that moment where you're anticipating something is going to happen and then it's about to happen. That's Advent. But it's the, I hope it comes. It hasn't come yet. That's Advent. So this fall, you know, some of you know, I was in Israel. And during part of our time, we stayed in this hotel that was right on the Sea of Galilee. So that's a lot of the stories we read in the Gospels are Jesus on the Sea of Galilee, around the Sea of Galilee. And so when we got there, someone had the idea that we should get up early the next morning and watch the sunrise over the Sea of Galilee, right? To which we were all like, yes, that would be awesome. Let's do it. And, you know, of course, we stayed up late every night and talked. And so when the alarm rang the next morning, we were like, terrible idea. But then we realized this is the Sea of Galilee. This is the sunrise that Jesus probably watched, you know, many times. And so we got up and we walked down to the shoreline and we sat in these white plastic chairs that had been there since the time of Jesus. When you're in Israel, that's like, everyone's like, that stone right there. I mean, that is the stone that Peter, you know, I was like, no, it really wasn't. But, you know, because really that's about 50 feet down 2,000 years ago and now we're, anyway. And so, but everyone's like, is this the exact place where Jesus might have spit? You know, yes, this is the exact place. It's totally right here. Anyway, there we were. Back to the sunrise. This is what we were looking at for when we were sitting in these white plastic chairs looking out across. And then pretty soon the colors started to change and purples and oranges. And then it got bigger and brighter. And we're like, the sun is about to come up. And then, boom, it peaks its little head up over the hills. And then pretty soon it was up in its full glory. And I love that picture. Doesn't it almost look like arms outstretched? I mean, just this majestic and beautiful picture. And you guys, we would have missed it if we hadn't have showed up on that morning and waited for it to come. Advent, in its most basic form, is remembering that as a body of Christ, we're called to show up and wait for the light that God says will come to come. We were last night praying, and Peggy Lang always leads us through this beautiful time of prayer before each service. And she said, you know, I know during Advent, we celebrate the first coming of Jesus 2,000 years ago as a little baby. And then there will be a day where Jesus comes again and restores all things, and that day is out in the future. But she says, one of the things I'm looking forward to during Advent, and so if that was the first coming as a baby and that's the second coming as the king in glory, one of the things I'm looking forward to in Advent is Jesus' coming 1.5. When Jesus shows up in the ordinary moments of your life and is born again into this world through you, through people who simply show up and watch for ways that Jesus wants to be born again in this world. So what I want to invite you into with the time that remains is just how to enter into Advent as a person, as a family, as a friend group. And I really think it's about fundamentally two things. It's a posture and it's a practice. First, the posture is of waiting and trusting. That's a posture. And I put my palms up because there are so much of my life I spend with my fists clenched. And you cannot receive anything when your fists are clenched. The posture of waiting and trusting is a posture of openness. It's a posture that says, Lord, have your way. It's a posture that says, I'm listening to you, Lord. It's a posture that says, God, I'm going to let you initiate today instead of trying to control everything in my life. Amen? Do you see why we need Advent? Because we're so used to taking control and making it happen and getting on the phone and being upset because we have to wait five days for something to get fixed. Advent is a season when you're recovering from an illness or when you're recovering from a relationship that's gone bad, to be honest and real about how dark it is. And then to say, bring me back to you, God. Bring me back to you. So it's a posture of waiting and trusting. It's also a practice. The practice is showing up and looking up. Showing up and looking up. if you spend any time in cities like New York City or even Minneapolis from time to time you'll be walking along the sidewalk and then someone will have written on the sidewalk in shock look up you ever seen one of these? because what most of us are doing as we walk along is doing this, right? we're spending our whole lives looking at our phones as if they are the light of the world. What would it look like to show up to Starbucks tomorrow morning and instead of trying to do that final email, to actually look at the person who's greeting you, who's making your coffee and giving it to you and saying, hello, I'm a human being and you're a human being. Nice to see you. Hope you have a great day. The person at Target, the person at Walmart, the person at your work, who's maybe lower on the totem pole than you, do you realize that their fundamental existence in life is not to meet your need? Even if that's their job that they get paid for? The reason why God put them on planet Earth is not so that your needs might be met? So what would it look like to show up and look up in all the moments of your day? So really recently, I just have been realizing that I get up early in the morning, and one of the first things I do, and I'm not kidding you, is I get my phone out and I just check, do my checking. What is happening on Twitter at 5 in the morning? What is happening on email? I mean, what did I miss from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.? I mean, I'm sure I'm really important, so I'm sure I've missed a lot, a lot of, you know, huge things. And I realized I need just to shut that off. I mean, so I put a time limit that I'm just not checking that stuff. And it's ridiculously embarrassing that I had to do that. I'm not going to check email before 8 a.m. Like the whole, you know, first 25 years of my life that I didn't do that. So hard. How will I make it? without the addictive buzz that happens when I check Facebook and Twitter and email and do that. No, what would it be like to wake up and go, okay, God, I wonder what you're doing today. I wonder what needs to be born in the world today. I wonder what part I can play in the story today, God. I wonder what person might need a little light. That person is usually my wife and my three kids. It's a posture. It's a practice. It's waiting and trusting. And then it's showing up and looking up. Turn your Bibles if you happen to Luke chapter 2. The Frasers read this, but I want to read it again to you because this is a practical example of what it means to show up and look up and wait and trust. It's a story of a man named Simeon. Luke 2, starting in verse 25. Now, there was a man in Jerusalem, and his name is Simeon. He was righteous. and he was waiting for the consolation of Israel. So there's his posture. And the Holy Spirit was on him, and it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah, which must have been an interesting thing to carry the rest of your life. Like, did he tell anyone else that? Hi, my name's Simeon. I'm a carpenter. And also the Lord has revealed to me that the Messiah will show up and I will see that Messiah before I die. No big deal. Now let's move on. so moved by the spirit he went into the temple courts and when the parents that is Mary and Joseph brought in the child Jesus now the child Jesus the name is Yeshua and that means salvation so when Mary and Joseph bring salvation into the temple courts to do for him what the custom of the law required, Simeon saw that. Because Simeon showed up and looked up, Simeon saw salvation coming into the temple courts. And Simeon took salvation in his arms and praised God, saying, Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace, for my eyes have seen your salvation, your Yeshua, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel. I wonder what it was like for Simeon for all those years to wait and trust that this promise that God gave him would come true someday. And I wonder as an old man if he ever sat and said, man, did I hear that right? Because I'm getting old now. I wonder if, as he showed up in the temple day after day, if he ever got discouraged, if he ever sat in despair, if he ever wondered if God was real, if he ever wondered if God's promises were true, and then about the 10,000th time that he showed up in the temple courts, he showed up and he looked up and there was salvation. So what did he do? It's interesting, we don't read that he, you know, walked over to Mary and Joseph. Yeah, excuse me, I'm the guy, I don't know if you've heard, but I'm the guy that the Lord revealed that I was supposed to see the Messiah before I was dead. As you can see, I'm very close to death and so I'd like to hold your baby. No, he just walked over. Woo, salvation, took salvation in his arms. What does it mean to take salvation in your arms? The salvation you've been waiting for and longing for. What does it mean to reach out and take it and receive it? That's what Advent is all about. Waiting for that moment when salvation presents himself to you. So what does it mean for you? I mean practically, ordinarily, in your ordinary actual life, to wait and trust and then show up and look up. Right now, think about that. What is it like? What does it mean? What are the areas in your life where God might be prompting you to show up and look up at work, in your family, with an enemy? What does it mean to notice beauty when you see it? so a couple weeks ago my son ben and i were out in the back manhandling the willow leaves that fall late every year when all of a sudden ben goes to the corner of the yard he goes dad come here and i mean i'm like yeah anything to get me to no longer have to pick up leaves So I ran over to the corner and he goes, dad, look. And then this is what we saw. Ben was like, dad, it's a rose. I'm like, whoa, is it real? And Ben looked at me like I was crazy. Like, of course it's real, you idiot. Dad, that's so beautiful. Ben notices beautiful things. It's so great. So we're sitting there talking about the rose, and then later on, he goes and tells Mary about it, my wife. Mom, there's a rose outside. Mary goes, wow, was it real? Because, you know, it's November. And Ben's like, who are these people? well later on Mary went and you know checked it out and came in and Ben was off playing so it's just me and her and she goes honey that rose that Ben saw totally fake and I'm like I hate you right now that was my first thought but then my second thought was I didn't actually say that you realize that that's just a little poetic license that speakers take sometimes to prove a bigger point no my second thought was honestly what genius puts a fake rose in a little place where no one's gonna see it on the corner of this yard behind this little pine tree at the beginning of the long Minnesota winter and I began to, like, I want to meet this person. I'm sure it's one of my neighbors and maybe I have met them. But who thinks that way? I think a person that's longing to bring light into this dark world, plants a fake rose outside so that other people might go, whoa, whoa, whoa. What would it look like this Advent season for you to show up and look up and bring real light into an otherwise dark place? What would you need to do? What rhythms would you need to put in your day so that you remember the season in which you are? Because you know how it is for the next five weeks. You know what it's like, right? It's crazy, people. And you can get swept away unless you say daily, weekly, I'm going to put some rhythms in my life so that I remember. Maybe it's a breath prayer. Bring us back to you, God. Every time you find yourself wandering, bring me back to you, God. Maybe it's every day your family lights a candle. You do an advent. You know, you can buy candles at the store and you can make a little Advent thing. You know, that's a possibility you could do with your family. And you light the Advent, you know, candle maybe every day. You read a little thought from scriptures. Maybe you say, what are you guys waiting for today? Well, as a staff, we kind of brainstormed about a way that we can look at each other and help each other see what God is doing in the world. And so we came up with this idea called Faces of Advent. And it was pretty cool. We got the idea from this website called People of New York where these people, this guy goes around and takes pictures of people in New York. And then he writes little captions. And it's just this beautiful, it paints this beautiful story of what's happening in this crazy city. So we thought, what about if we had our people take pictures of themselves and send little captions in so that we as a community might, on this Facebook page, be able to see each other and see what's happening. So this is the way it works. Faces of Advent, you're going to respond to a question every week, which I'm going to give to you in a moment. And you're going to respond to it by emailing in a picture and a little caption to facesofadvent at the door.org. And then you can visit our Facebook page and then just click on the link for Faces of Advent. It's really easy. And, you know, when you're there, like us on Facebook. That's just a nice little thing that you can do to show you're a part of the community. Just like us on Facebook. Not to do that, right? Okay, and then, so this is the question for this week. How do you want Christmas to be different this year? Just a simple question. Again, you know the craziness of this season and how it can be. How do you want Christmas for your family, for your roommates, for you as an individual? How do you want it to be different this year? And then send in a picture that represents how you want it to be different and then include a little caption that explains it. So the Steiner family from Open Door love this family. This is what they wrote, and this is up on the Facebook page right now. They said they want closeness. What happens when we emphasize each other instead of stuff, the highs and lows and the in-betweens. So we want to fill up this page with pictures of you so that you can see each other, that you can keep going back to this page and look and see what new pictures and new captions. Of course, they're going to get emailed in, and then, you know, we just have to have some, I mean, because there could be a few lunatics out there. So, you know, we are going to control what goes on there and then we'll post them as soon as they're deemed, you know, worthy of going up there. I just wanted to make you sure that, you know, there was some control on that so that you can feel safe going out on that page. But do that. It's going to be a really cool way for us to see each other and move toward each other this Advent season. Another thing you can do is the same question that you maybe have noticed on the way in the four pillars out in the gathering place. We've painted them chalkboard black. And so each week, the question is going to be up on the pillar. And people have already started to answer them. So there's going to be chalk available. And you can just write your answer to the question each week out on that pillar. And we'll keep them up for all four weeks. It'll be a way for you to go and check and see how this community is moving into Advent. And then lastly, I really want to encourage you as a family, as a set of roommates, as friends, as individuals, to make it a point to come to church these next four weeks. I don't know that we ever say that. We certainly don't ever want it to be a pressure thing, but I think this season can get so crazy that if you don't have the rhythm as a family of stopping and singing worship songs together and hearing God's word explained so that you can interact with it, we will forget what this season is about. Amen? So let's, as a community, commit to being with each other for the next three weeks. The next three weeks of Advent and then the Christmas Eve service. And I think I failed to mention this at the top of the hour, so I'll mention it now. There's three Christmas Eve services. They're at 4 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 8 o'clock. And so we want to invite you to come to one of those services. And just like we did with Easter, we're asking you to please RSVP to those services. And the reason why we're asking you to RSVP is because last year at the 4 o'clock Christmas Eve service, 2,500 people showed up for that one service. Now, we can fit about 1,700 if we cram every seat full in here. But then another 800 people were out in the gathering place. And you know who those people are. These are the people that haven't been to church for a year. And they're late because their kids, you know, didn't get dressed on time. And they haven't been to Opendoor forever, maybe ever. They haven't been to church forever. And then the great hospitality we have to offer them is, oh, by the way, you can sit like at the back doors and experience this beautiful candlelight service. But we think that's not cool in any way. so we're asking you to please go online pick a service it's super easy RSVP with the amount of seats that you feel like you're going to take and once the service fills up then it'll become unavailable and you have to pick a different one but can we all agree to do this? it's a little inconvenient but we can do this together, right? and of course you don't have to pay for anything you don't have to print out tickets unless you want to and you can print them out and give them to Dave Johnson he'll be sitting right down here That'll be a nice little Christmas gift that we can give him as he gets ready to preach. But don't tell him I said that. He was here in the 9 o'clock service too. But anyway, so let's be together this Advent season. Amen? Let's do it together as a family. Would you stand for the benediction? The people in the back were getting super freaked out that I hadn't announced that Christmas Eve services yet. at the RSVP stuff. But see, you guys, I did. I did. Okay, receive this benediction as you head out into the Advent season. May the light of Christ shine on you so that your face reflects the very picture of who God is in this world. Amen? Amen. Peace and grace, everybody. Have a great week. Thank you.
