Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Before we pray and get into the talk, I just want to acknowledge, with this many people in the room, your experiences heading into tonight are as varied as the stars in the sky. Some of you are thrilled because you've just gotten great news of maybe a new baby in the family and things are going great. Others of you have just been hit with a train wreck of a report maybe like some of my friends who found out that their mom is dying of cancer and only has weeks to go. And so we hold all of this together as a church, as a community. Our joy and our pain. Some of you made a terrible mistake last night. And you barely made it through the doors. What I want to say to each of us as we gather together is God's mercies are new every morning. Amen? That there is strength. And like the little room that we gather in to pray before the service starts, There's a faucet that's dripping. It just drips. Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. Really annoying, right? But this wise woman that leads the prayer gathering said, you know, maybe one of the reasons why we have to gather is just to hear God's grace week in and week out. Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. And eventually it gets in, right? Oh, let's pray. Let's pray together as we walk through this life together, whether you are feeling extraordinarily grateful for life right now or unbelievably in pain. Let's pray. Jesus, as we gather varied people with varied places in our lives, we bring them to you right now. Our joys and our pains, our sorrows, our mistakes, our sin, we bring them to you and say, God, we need your mercy. We need your grace and mercy just for today. Just for today. amen well uh on sunday morning last week i was i was really kind of worn out uh from uh i was we i was at a next gen retreat all weekend and um some other things and so i kind of sat toward the back uh trying to be a little invisible and uh but when i came in i looked at the bulletin and i saw that my friend dave was speaking so i was pretty excited to hear that talk and uh and the talk i heard if you were here, you heard it too, was what I would call vintage Dave Johnson and vintage open door. I mean, I absolutely loved it. Like Stephan said earlier, it outlined a kind of people that we really want to become. If you did not hear it, I encourage you, go to the bookstore, give the CD, Go online, watch it on our website, go to iTunes, download it. Whatever you need to do, get it and listen to it over and over again because it beautifully expresses the kind of people that I think we want to become as a community. And the talk was based on Colossians chapter 1, starting in verse 28, as we just roll through this little letter. Dave remarked last week that we'd finally made it to chapter 2 after six or seven months, which is an amazing feat, really, for us. But Colossians 1, starting in verse 28, Paul writes this, We proclaim him, that is Jesus, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ. To this end, I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me. I want you to know how hard I am contending for you and for all those at Laodicea And for all who have not met me personally, my goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And the words that Dave camped on last week were these two words, to admonish and to teach. And nuthio is the Greek word for admonish and it literally means to put into the mind, to put something into someone else's mind. Didasko is the word for teaching, and it means to teach someone so that you would shape their will. So you put these two words together, and teaching and admonishing in this sense means to influence someone by putting something in their minds so that it would shape their will, so that it would shape how they act and interact with others, how they think. As you think about doing that to someone else, admonishing and teaching, putting something in their mind so that it would shape their will, the first thing that comes into my mind is, how arrogant do you have to be to do that to someone, right? How arrogant do you have to be to think, I have something that they need, and I will give it to them. Oh, yes. Well, we know how arrogant that we would have to be because we all do it, right? I do it and you do it. but we all know how it feels to find ourselves trapped under the thumb of someone who loves to put what is in their mind in your mind to shape your will especially when you haven't even asked for it and if you protest the focus quickly switches to you how you're not teachable you're not respectful of authority and you walk away from those interactions feeling kind of crazy right Like, what just happened? Well, you can intuitively tell, I think, when someone cares more about putting what's in them in you than they actually care about you and the shaping of your will. And when people do that, it's incredibly damaging. It's toxic, and especially when it relates to spiritual matters, things of the life of God. It can be a kind of toxic energy in your veins which kills the life of God in you. Because without knowing it, what they're trying to do is make you fully mature in them, not in Christ. And some of you have been through that, especially as it relates to the church, and we call that spiritual abuse. Dave Johnson wrote a book about it that you can find in our bookstore that I think is very helpful for those of you who have been through that. in terms of the church. But some of us have also been shaped by someone who really does care about us and care about us becoming fully mature, not in them, but in Christ. These people, as Dave said, have a kind of sweet spirit that we wanna be around. They do put things in our minds and that does shape our will, but because it isn't about them and getting what's in them, in us, we welcome it. And we feel like it's life flowing into us instead of life flowing out of us. So Dave's central question was this. What kind of person would you need to become so that when you put something into the mind of someone else that really does end up shaping their will intentionally or unintentionally on your part, what kind of person would you have to become so that you do that in such a way that you actually would help them become mature in Christ and not in you? and last week Dave painted as I said this beautiful picture of the kind of people that we would need to become and as I was sitting back in the back I just felt this enormous yes from all of you to those to becoming those kind of people I mean I heard I think it was the amen factor was way I mean but there's like the whisper amen it's like oh yeah oh amen oh yeah You know, that kind of thing. But it was all over. But here's the deal. Even though that desire is in us to become those kind of people, I know myself well enough to know that even the desire to become that kind of person wages a kind of war with the potential that's also in me to be the kind of person that just wants to fill someone else up with what's in me, to control and manipulate someone else. I know that's true about me, and so the question that we need to wrestle with tonight is how do we become the kind of people who, when we put someone in someone else's mind, shapes their will and shapes their will, the result is that they really do become fully mature in Christ and not us. The question is not just what, but how. How do we actually do that? Parents, teachers, friends, and spouses, if you have a yes in your heart to becoming those kind of people, and I believe so many of us do, you also need to have a kind of discipline that will say, I will submit myself to the kind of rigorous training that it's gonna take to instinctively and naturally react to people like that versus to control and manipulate them. Now, I know many of us have been watching the Olympics, and I have as well and women's downhill has been fun to watch and Julie Mancuso is one of the U.S. women's downhill skiers that's been fun to watch and when she was a little girl apparently maybe some of you saw this she drew a picture of herself at the Olympics winning a medal and she was just like 7 or 8 years old when she drew that picture now the question that should come up for us is this what happened in between her drawing that picture and her becoming an Olympic medalist. What happened? There was some training involved. There were some early mornings getting up to hit the slopes. There were some decisions to say no to certain things so she could say yes to training. And it seems like Paul, who wrote the book of Colossians, seemed to have a similar attitude. We find it in 1 Corinthians 9, verses 24 to 27. And he borrows the language of the games. He says, Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? And so run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore, I don't run like a man running aimlessly. I don't fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not become disqualified for the prize. Now the picture Dave drew for us, much I think like Julie Mancuso's picture of an Olympic medalist, the picture that Dave drew for us, the kind of people that we can become, was compelling as we've said. But it's gonna take courage on our part to say yes to the training. Now there are three characteristics that Dave painted, which I'm gonna review. And for each of them, I wanna give just a real practical way that you could press into this in your everyday mundane life, practices that will help you become these kind of people. Dave said, first of all, if you wanna become the kind of people that help others really mature in Christ, you'd need a deep reverence for the presence of Christ in them. You need to have a kind of reverence, a kind of fanning this little wick that might be barely blowing within them, protecting it, recognizing that it's there, and waiting for it to be fanned into flame. It all comes down, I think, to what you fundamentally believe about people. Do you believe that when you scratch just beneath the surface of all our coping mechanisms and all of our sort of sin, that what you would find is not necessarily just more sin and depravity, but the working of a God that loves you and that is inviting you into more of life? Do you believe fundamentally that if you uncover the layers of someone's soul that you'll find the ruach, the breath of God, the creative activity of who God is that God breathes into each one of us as we breathe our first breath? Do you believe that that really is true, That God is constantly at work in us, inviting us to life? Or do you believe that God is just somewhere out there sitting in God's room like a petulant teenager who won't come out of her room? According to Paul, the mystery of the gospel is this. Christ in us. Not out there. Christ in us, the ruach of God, the seed of God planted in us, the working of God in us. In John 5, 17, Jesus said this, my father is always at work to this very day, and I too am working. And God does his best work inside of you and me. God is tirelessly working in you right now. God is not absent from you. God is working and inviting you into life. And we know from Scripture that the work that God is tirelessly doing is the work of reconciliation, the work of repairing that which is broken in each of us. And if that's really true, then when it comes to putting something in someone else's mind to shape their will, here's the deal. The work that you and I need to believe is not that we would bring Jesus to you, but that we would find where God is working in each other. Think about that perspective of someone else is coming at you and saying, you need to change. I want to bring Jesus to you now. Versus, oh, where might God be working in you? Like an archaeologist, let's find that together. What a different spirit that is. So the first training exercise I think you need to engage in in order to have a kind of reverence for the presence of Christ in others is simply this, to ask lots of questions. Lots of open-ended questions when you're around someone. And save your answers, right? This is the hard part, right? Now, great answers really are helpful. Answers are not bad. The problem is when answers get given before the right question has been asked. How in the world will I know what kind of answers you need if I haven't spent time with you asking the right questions? And how in the world am I to assume that I have them? I have the answer for you. well what about as Dave said last week what about if my confidence in you was Christ in you not me in you I mean that would change everything but my problem really is that I give answers too quickly I want to fix someone I really do and the reason I want to fix someone primarily is not for their benefit, is so that I will feel good about myself. And so let's normalize this. How many of you, really, raise your hand, think that you probably give answers too quickly? Okay, some of us. Now, how many people think that the people around you give answers too quickly? Uh-huh. Okay. Busted. Right? Conversely, have you ever been around someone who asks really great questions? If you have, you know the kind of life that breathes into you. I'll never forget Mr. Eret, my 11th grade creative writing teacher. It was time for us to receive our midterm grades. And so how he did it was he didn't send out a letter. He just invited each of us up to his desk. and then he would show us our grade. And so he invited me up when it was my turn. He pointed to this letter and it was a B. And he looked at me and he said, are you satisfied with that grade? And I mean, you guys, I was not a great student. A B was awesome. I was like, yes, I am. I love a B. And then he looked at me and he said, well, I don't think you should be satisfied with a B. I'm convinced you could get an A. What would it take for you to get an A? He looked at me right in the eyes. And I mean, I'm telling you, my little 17-year-old 11th grade self went back to my desk and said, no one has ever asked me a question like that. and you know writing turned out to be something i love to do and at the end of that semester mr eric called me up and he goes steve i want to show you your grade he pointed at this little sheet of paper and it was an a mr eric called something out of me that was already there he just believed it he didn't berate me he didn't tell me i have to get an a he said would you like an a and the answer was an emphatic yes in my spirit all of that came from a really great question. But you would only ask a question like that if you believe something was happening inside someone else. Now, if you read the Gospels, notice how many questions that Jesus asks. There's way, way, way more questions than answers. And I think this is not just because he was an inquisitive person, though I think he was. I think he knew that the most effective way to find out where God was working in someone else, and the most effective way for someone else to find out where God was working in them, was to ask a really good question. In Mark chapter 10, verse 35, we see this wonderful human story about two disciples named James and John and this bizarre request that they give to Jesus. Verse 35, Mark 10, then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him, that is Jesus' teacher, they said, and this is amazing, we want you to do for us whatever we ask. Like if that was me and you sitting there with James and John, and they're going to say, now, we have an appointment with Jesus. We're meeting him for coffee. And here's what we're going to roll out to him. We want you to give us whatever we ask. You'd say, bad idea. Right? Right? But Jesus' response, found in verse 36, is amazing. He doesn't shut him down. he says, all right, well, what would you like me to do for you? Sip. And then they replied, and this is classic. Let one of us sit at your right hand and the other at your left hand in glory. Now, they don't mean in heaven. They firmly believe that Jesus was going to be the king of Israel and he was going to sit on the throne in just a few weeks from then. and they wanted to sit on his right and left, showing they wanted to have a part of the action, a part of the glory. And which, you know, you got to admire that kind of chutzpah, right? I mean, that's sort of, wow. I mean, that is a bold request. But Jesus said, you know, you guys, you don't really know what you're asking. Another question. Can you drink the cup or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? And their beautiful 18-year-old answer was, yep we totally can well Jesus knew that his throne was going to be a cross in a few weeks and the people that were going to be on his right and on his left were going to be two thieves that were also going to be hanging from a cross you don't know what you're asking for Jesus tells James and John and you don't know the cup that I have to drink and after Jesus was crucified and the disciples had fled deserting Jesus I wonder if James and John went back to their silly answer I wonder if you know they sort of said can you believe it I mean we totally missed it and then I wonder if it led to a better conversation could we have drank the cup that Jesus drank that we saw him drink No way. And then Jesus came back and gave them this mission to carry on the work that he started to disciple all nations so that they would love God and love others the way that Jesus does. I wonder if the conversation got even better. Will we drink the cup? I bet they never forgot that question. And I wonder if it helped them endure what they had to endure as they came up against resistance. because the answer for them turned out to be no matter what it brings, we will drink the cup even if that cup brings death. See, when you have the courage to ask the right questions of someone that might lead them to discover where God is at work in them and when you discipline yourself and it takes tremendous discipline to withhold your answers until you know the right questions or even better, to let them discover the right answers, You'll see a remarkable thing. You will see that God actually is at work coming up with answers to questions that you never could have had. One of our friends says this, when you think about it long enough and ask God for help, God will always come up with a way that you haven't thought of. I love that. But you won't get there if you rush to an answer. and this will increase your faith as you see God at work in others. It'll enable you to genuinely say to someone, my confidence in you is Christ in you, not me in you. Well, the second characteristic that Dave pointed out, for those of us who want to help others become fully mature in Christ, as Paul encourages us to do, we'd have to be entirely aware of our own process, Dave said, that we have not yet arrived. We don't have all the answers. Paul put it this way in Philippians 3, verse 12. Not that I have already obtained this, Paul writes, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers and sisters, he writes, I don't consider myself yet to have taken hold of this, but one thing I do, forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. In order to train yourself, to become aware of your process so that you really don't think you've arrived or have all the answers, you could submit yourself to a prayer that I'm submitting myself to during Lent, every morning during these 40 days. And this is the prayer. Jesus, I don't have all the answers to the problems I will face today. And I don't know all that you're doing in the people that I'll interact with today. And I don't know all that you're doing in me today. So I'm inviting you to partner with me today to help me see what you see and know what you know. And we're gonna print that in the message tool this week if you wanna kind of join me in this Lent experience of praying this prayer. of I do not know. Jesus, I am not, but you are. And it's gonna be interesting to find out what we find out because praying this prayer, I think is simply just inviting Jesus into the mundane moments of your life, your chores, your assignments, your lunch break, your conflicts. And as you learn to picture Jesus with you, helping you to see what he sees and know what he knows in all the mundane moments of your day, the truth is and the grace is that Christ really will be with you and really will help you. This last week I was in a meeting where I left feeling kind of angry and frustrated and after the meeting I felt as though Jesus was inviting me to go back to a certain person and apologize to him for being kind of a jerk, for kind of pushing the agenda too hard. You know, to which I kind of said, you know, relax, right? I don't want to do that. That takes way too much energy. But I did go to this person and apologize. And we had a good talk. And in my experience, this is what Jesus does most often with me. When I invite him in to see what he sees and know what he knows and show me that. And when I get into a conflict with someone else, Typically, Jesus does not corroborate my own internal monologue. What a jerk that guy was. Yep, he was. You should go tell him that. Yeah, I will. You should. I will. All right. It's not like that. Typically, it's a kind of question that comes into my mind that says something like, do you think maybe the other guy kind of thought you were a jerk? Maybe let's start there. And if he was a jerk, maybe he'll apologize for it. But if he doesn't, then maybe you're okay. And I do this so imperfectly, but when I do partner with Jesus in these little invitations, it changes my perspective on a situation that I thought was someone else's fault. And it helps me see that I haven't yet arrived, that I have some work to do. And that softens my heart toward myself and toward others. See, I think in message team this week, Scott Madison, one of the guys that's in message team, said this, it's too easy for us to submit to a kind of American Idol approach to dealing with others, right? Where we see their performance, we cast our vote, and we write them off with no consequences whatsoever to us. And when we do that, when we cast our vote, make our judgment, and write them off, what we're saying is I hold the cards you don't you have the problem I don't and when we live that way Jesus the voice of Jesus is super hard to hear because he's saying maybe you shouldn't phone in your vote just yet maybe there's more to understand about that person see partnering with Jesus keeps the focus on your process I think this is part of what Jesus means when he says this hilarious thing when he says, listen, if you're walking around with a log in your eye, you might want to think twice before pointing out a speck in someone else's eye. I mean, just think about it, he says. Because the hard work is to focus on your process, not someone else's process. It's way too easy to critique someone else than actually do the hard work of looking at ourselves. So starting my days with this prayer, Lord, I do not have all the answers to the problems that I will face today. And Lord, I do not know all that's happening in the life of the people that I'll interact with today. And I don't know all that you're doing in me today, Lord. So I'm inviting you to partner with me to see what you see and know what you know. When you pray this prayer, it's like hitting the reset button every morning because you look back on the previous day and you realize, oh man, log, log in my eye, log in my eye, pointed it out, yep, pointed it out, did it, oh gosh, did it, yep, did it. And you'll realize with this prayer, it's new every morning. You'll hit the reset button. Last week, I was sitting in my basement before my boys woke up, which you got to get up pretty early in the morning before my boys get up. And so the sun hadn't yet risen, but pretty soon the sun was just starting to rise. And it was filling the sky with light and this thought came at me immediately that just like the sun rises new every morning, so are God's mercies. And they cover my mistakes and allow me to live free even though I have not yet arrived. A third characteristic that Dave pointed out, if we want to be people who help others fully mature in Christ, is that we would develop a sweetness of spirit that smelled good, that others would want to follow and be like us. And so Dave ended with this question, what is your fragrance? What do you smell like around others? So that others, do others want to be around you and follow you? Well, my grandpa Weems died 16 years ago at the ripe old age of 88. And I remember him as being this kind and gentle, fun guy, full of life. He always had time for me as a little boy. I remember every time I went to his house, he kissed me right on the mouth, which as a 14, 15-year-old got super awkward. But I remember the feeling of his whiskers, you know, kissing me and kind of feeling like, this is weird. But he never stopped doing it. When he was 76 years old, I remember him pitching me, you know, this wiffle ball and I'd hit it. And late in life, another story I remember, he bought a puppet and learned to be a ventriloquist. I mean, this guy was, he was so fun. I remember his laugh most of all. It came easy and often. He had such a sweet spirit. Now, his wife, my grandma, is still alive. She's 99 years old. And just this past week, she recounted this story with my cousins who emailed it to us about my grandpa's growing up. She said, and this surprised all of us, but that his dad, my great-grandfather, was super harsh. And he always favored my grandpa's younger brother. And my grandpa, as a young man, I guess, according to my grandma, was a nervous, anxious kind of guy. So my great-grandfather, his father, treated him with contempt. His whole life. My grandma said that it took a lot of years, many, many years, for my grandfather to forgive his father. And one of his determinations in their marriage was that he was gonna never be harsh with his kids. Now, my grandpa was a Mennonite pastor in the last half of his life. He made $300 a month and never got a raise in 20 years. He had to sell spices door to door in order to make ends meet for his family. He told this story. This is characteristic, Grandpa Weems, but one time he was standing near the kitchen table on one of his sales calls and he felt this warm and wet feeling on his foot. So he looked down and there is the family dog peeing into his loafer. And at that point, and as he told the story, I always told it with a laugh, he said, even the dog pees on me in this job. Isn't that hilarious? There were lots of reasons for this man to grow up cynical and kind of crusty, but the opposite was true. He was lovable and he loved people. He treated others as though he really believed Christ was in them. He never thought he had all the answers. I never remember him once telling me, this is the way it is. He had a sweet spirit that lasted right until the muggy day in the summer of 1994 when he died. So the question for me is, what kind of training do I need to undergo so that I become like my grandfather? Well, I think on one level, if you become the kind of person who really does see Christ in others and asks lots of questions, if you become the kind of person that really knows that you're on journey and that you're in process and you don't have all the answers, I think that right there will give you a sweet spirit that others will want to be around and want to be influenced by you because you're the real deal if you do that. But I think there's one last training exercise that makes you sweet-smelling and that makes others want to be around you. And I think my grandpa did it. And I think it's this. When God calls you to do something, you simply resolve to do it. You just say, I will do it. so he did it he did the hard work of forgiving his dad providing for his family even though he got peed on by dogs in my experience this inviting god inviting me to do things god calling me to do things is not calling me to africa though he might call you to do that it's calling me to very small things like have the conversation with your co-worker empty the dishwasher say you're sorry don't linger on that channel. Don't do conflict over email. And when I choose to do those things, my experience is that God partners with me with all the energy of Christ, which is so powerfully at work in me, just like it was in Paul and just like it is in you. And as you become more and more aware of Christ in others by asking lots of questions, as you become more and more aware of your own process that you haven't yet arrived and you don't have all the answers, you'll become someone who really does help others, become mature in Christ. And as you submit yourself to these training exercises, I promise you that God will partner with you in it, giving you access to all the energy that Christ has in you, which is so powerfully at work in you, just like it was in Paul. And we desperately need people, Christians, who courageously say yes, not only to the idealistic vision of becoming these kind of people, but to the hard work of training so that you can do it. And you know what the good news is? You can, because God will meet you in it. This isn't a try-hard exercise. This is a I will become that which Christ calls me to become, that which Christ has taken a hold of me for, I will take a hold of. And God will provide you the energy that you need to do what God calls you to do. When you need it, God will bring it. This comes right out of Colossians 1, 28 and 29. I close with this. We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ. And to this end, I strenuously contend but here's the deal not on his own efforts but on the energy of Christ which so powerfully works in me let's pray together Jesus help us become the kind of people that say yes to becoming the kind of people you want us to be to asking lots of questions versus having all the answers to being aware of our own process to submitting to one another in love and to believing the best of one another, to having a sweet spirit about us, the spirit of you. Jesus, help us to become people who when you call us to do something, we simply do it through your power, which is at work in us. In your name, amen. Amen.
