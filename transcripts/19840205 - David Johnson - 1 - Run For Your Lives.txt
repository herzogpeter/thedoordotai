I trust that through our singing that your heart has been prepared to hear from the Lord Jesus. We come into chapter 12, verse 1, and I want you to know that as we do, there almost needs to be something stirred up in us as we approach this, because we need to hit chapter 12, verse 1 with a running start. We are still talking about faith. We are still talking to the same people. In fact, I believe that possibly one of the most unfortunate chapter divisions in the Bible is right here, because the same theme is being continued. The focus, however, is changing. We are still talking about faith. The personal pronouns, though, are different. We have been talking all through chapter 11 of someone else's faith, haven't they? They've been saying, look at the faith of Abel, and look at the faith of Abraham, and look at the faith of Enoch and Noah and all of these great men of faith. And then in chapter 12, verse 1, we see a very significant word. It says, therefore, because of their faith, because these people, this great cloud of witnesses, have lived their lives by faith and the times that they were victorious were the times that they believed God, he then directs his attention away from all those people that we've been discovering and discussing for the last several weeks and looks them square in the eyes and says, Now is the time to act. The he's turn into we's. Them becomes us. Theirs becomes ours. The time has come to change some things in our living, to do something. It isn't enough to know what faith is. It isn't even enough to understand fully by looking at demonstrations of faith, how it can be worked out in my life. We need to change some things in our living. Chapter 12, verse 1 through verse 4 is what we're going to deal with this morning. Let's read it. Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, since, again, it is that these men of God were successful by believing God, let us also, just like them, lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. How? Fixing our eyes on Jesus. the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself, so that you may not grow weary and lose heart. You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin. I have much on my heart this morning. This text is a powerful text. I've been sharing with the people who've been close enough to me to hear that this 12th chapter of Hebrews and probably the 11th chapter also is to the book of Hebrews what Ephesians chapter 5 and Ephesians chapter 6 were to those studies there are some powerful things here that we need to learn and I just again as I do every Sunday morning ask that you would join me in prayer in terms of preparing our hearts and hearing from him let's pray dear father i pray in your name that satan and his ability to distract and take away and divert my attention from the things that you have laid on my heart i i ask in your name that he will be fully bound father that you will have your way with powerful freedom in my speaking. And Lord Jesus, more than in my speaking, but even in my own heart, my receiving the very things and applying to myself the very things that your spirit is saying through me. Open our hearts to yourself this morning in Jesus' name. Amen. Need to remind ourselves of some things as we get into this text. These people to whom this book was being written were a discouraged people. They were scared. They were a people who were fairly new in the faith, and they were fully expecting the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. They looked for that with anticipation. Jesus was going to come and set up his kingdom, and everything was going to be wonderful. Instead of Jesus coming with power and glory, the Romans came, destroyed Jerusalem, scattered Jews throughout all of the world, and these people were discouraged. Everything they thought was going to happen wasn't happening. And they were in very grave danger of falling away and going back to the ritual and the form and the legalism and the religious trappings of Judaism. And we've gone and spent several months discussing that problem and that tension and the pull of this writer to bring them back into the new covenant and say, don't you fall away, hang on. So it is, with that backdrop, that these are discouraged people who are in danger of falling away, that one of the things that I want you to pick up from this text, the one I just read, is that laced throughout this is a very strong encouragement. It's as if he's putting his arm around him and saying, listen folks, I know you're hurting, but I want you to hang on. Don't go back. I want you to run the race. I know you're weary and I know your heart is hurting, But hang on, you haven't bled yet? Run the race. But I want you to notice something else about encouragement. Even though he is encouraging them here, there's something about encouragement that this text teaches us. And it's this. That encouragement that really does help me when I'm just about ready to give it all up and hang it all up and cash it all in, encouragement that really does help me isn't the kind of thing that comes up to me and puts its arm around me and says, oh, you poor baby. Oh, you are just having such a hard time and these people are just picking on you. Encouragement that builds me up. The kind of thing I need when I'm ready to give up is not someone coming around feeling sorry for me. In fact, that kind of thing just stimulates me to feel sorry for myself when somebody kind of pities me and I just wallow in it and go, yeah, I really got a raw deal. Paul to Timothy. You remember Timothy when his chin was just hanging and he was ready to hang up the ministry? It just isn't worth it. Paul came up to him and said, Timothy, you poor baby. Things are just so tough, didn't he? He didn't say that at all. He said, Timothy, I want you to know something. I want you to know I love you. And I want you to know that I understand that you feel like quitting. But I want you to understand something else. You have been called of God to serve, so serve. and Timothy I'm going to tell you something you're ready to quit and your heart is hurting but I want you to get your act together I want you to fan the flame of the gift God's given you I want you to take a little wine for your stomach's sake get moving, quit trying to please people and tell the truth instead guess what guy, I got news for you this is a war and if it feels like you're getting bombed that's why you feel like you're getting bombed because this is a war 2 Timothy chapter 2, he says, Timothy, when you entered into the ministry, when you entered into becoming a caring Christian, one who is indeed running the race, you entered into a war, and the way you're going to win it is this, endure hardness as a soldier. And we come to chapter 12, verses 1 through 4, and you're going to hear the same theme. You people are discouraged, and you're hurt, and you're ready to cash it in, and it isn't a big pity party getting started here. He says this, stir it up, get in the race, quit standing around looking, you better just start believing God. You haven't bled yet. You know what? I believe that every Christian needs to have a friend who knows how to encourage like that. Now, I think we've got a lot of people I can find, and I know who they are, too, and you do, too, in your life. You know the people you can go to and they'll feel sorry for you. Don't you? You know when you're feeling really down and you want to quit and you want to find an excuse to quit? You know the people you could go talk to and they'd encourage you to quit. They'd go, yeah, oh, it's really rough. I really believe we need people in our lives who I know I can go to and they're going to kick me one. They're going to say, Johnson, get moving. I've told you this so many times you're tired of it. That person for me is my father. I thank God for a father that I have that kind of relationship with. I want to tell you something. when I'm the most discouraged, that's who I call. And if he, if when I was just ready to cash it all in, I called him and said, Dad, I'm really hurting, and I just want to quit, and I sound a little bit like a martyr, and you know how you are when you whine, you know. Well, I know how I am when I do it. If he just came back with all that whining and said, Oh, you poor guy, how can they do that to you? I would just panic. Because he doesn't say that to me. And the people who encourage me to get in the race don't say that to me. His favorite line is my favorite text. He goes, hey Dave, you haven't bled yet, have you? No, I haven't. Get in the race. Get up off the floor. But you know what? The reason this encouragement works, the reason this encouragement works is that underneath this admonishment to get moving is a loving, strong encouragement saying this, hey, I know you're weary. I know you're losing heart. You need to hear something. It's too soon to quit. It's too soon to quit. Get in the race. This text is rich and full. There are several things we need to catch. We are going to jump right in, tear it apart. Three things, basically, I want you to learn. The first thing I want you to hear this morning is I want you to hear as loudly as the Holy Spirit of God can bring it to your ears. I want you to hear the call to run the race. Point one, I want you to hear the call to run the race. Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. Literally in the Greek, the way it translates is this, run the set before you race. I want you to get that picture in your mind. It is the set before you race. Whether you're a Christian or not a Christian, God in his economy has set before you a purpose in life, a direction in life. Whether you choose to run that race is up to you. We've talked about that many times. I have the ability to choose, but I want to tell you something, human being. You have a set-before-you race. What brings you into that race is a commitment on your part to the Lord Jesus Christ and to follow after him. What I'm saying is this, that the race that we are speaking of in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 and 2 is not an optional thing. This is the set before you race. It is, and God is not saying in this text, if you want to run it, that's okay. If you don't want to run it, that's okay too. You know, this text introduces us again. And as I was dealing with this this week, I became aware of the fact that this was pulling us right into something we've dealt with many times before, and that is this, that whether we verbalize it or not, as Christians, we have in our minds little compartments, little pigeonholes, where we, in our minds, allow people, Christians, people who we call Christians, who are carnal, who are uncommitted to Jesus Christ fully, who are fleshly in their living, who have no direction in their lives in terms of saying, Jesus is my Lord, God is my God, that's where I'm going. But because they've raised their hand or said some sort of, given some sort of intellectual assent to Jesus Christ as being the Son of God, we kind of pigeonhole them and say, well, they must be a Christian. They've said the words. We find little compartments where we can put people like that so that they can live in safety and never be confronted with the possibility that they are just plain lost. And it's real cozy and it's real safe. And we pacify ourselves by saying, yes, I realize that person really has no commitment to Christ in his living. He may be living spiritually like a spiritual zombie, giving absolutely no influence to the power of God in his life, but I know he's saved. How do you know? Well, he's such a nice boy. How do you know? Well, he's just such a quiet kid. He stays out of trouble. He comes to the youth group. He comes to church. He serves on the board. I think we need to consider the possibility that if we have not committed ourselves to Christ, that if we are not running the race, the possibility is there that that person is indeed a Christian who needs to start running. The other possibility is just as real that that person has never gotten onto the track. You know, we even pick this up, or I have little flags going up that indicate to me that I believe this or function this way more than I'd even like to admit. It shows up in how we share Christ. All you have to do is accept Christ. We don't even stop to think sometimes what it means to accept Christ. Because we are living in an evangelical culture, those words probably for many of you have meaning. But when we're sharing Christ, we who haven't thought the meaning of those words through enough think that those little buzzwords work on everyone. All you need to do is accept Christ. All you need to do is walk forward. All you need to do is pray the prayer. All you need to do is just believe the right stuff, give mental assent to the right things, and you've got your ticket to heaven. And you know the problem with that is this. I've said this many times. Satan believes all the right stuff. Big deal. The characteristic of Christianity that sets it apart from every other thing, that sets it apart from anything you can do in terms of earning salvation, is that Christianity is not a system of belief. It's based on a commitment. Every once in a while I hear someone say this, you know, pastor, I'm sharing my faith with this guy or this girl or this man or this woman. And I'll tell you something, they are just so close to accepting Christ. But you know the thing that always hangs them up, the thing that always holds them back, is that they're afraid of what they're going to have to give up. And I just keep telling them, you're not going to have to give up anything. But you know the problem with that? Is that what we're always thinking about when we're thinking about the things you have to give up to become a Christian are all the things that don't matter. What you'll have to give up when you become a Christian is you're going to have to quit smoking and chewing and go with the girls who do it. You know, those are the things you give up. Don't you dare in your sharing of your faith with someone who doesn't know Jesus as their Savior. Don't you dare tell them they don't have to give anything up. Jesus said, I want your heart. I want your mind. I want your soul I want your life you give it all up Paul said I am not my own I don't own me anymore I've been bought with a price Jesus said with that multitude of people standing there and he was preaching a sermon and he was giving the invitation and he said this before you come and get all emotional and really start to cry I want you before you make one decision I want you to count the cost of what it means to be a disciple because it does cost If you come to me, I want it all. And we're not talking about the stupid... I believe it's time we recognize the fallacy of people who call themselves Christians but at the same time demonstrate fully in their living that they have not committed themselves fully to Christ. Why? Because he has no bearing on their living, their attitudes. They just meander from here to there. The life of God has no bearing on them. I want you to tell you something. An uncommitted Christian is a contradiction in terms. How do you put those two words together? Uncommitted Christian. I can't do it. It's like magnets on the wrong ends. They go like that. They keep missing. A carnal Christian makes about as much sense to me as saying someone's a godly pagan. Those words don't work. Yes, people fall into sin. Yes, people stumble. We know all about that. But people who are consistently living in disregard to what the Holy Spirit of God is saying to them, and at the same time giving lip service, while I raise my hand, I pray the prayer. 1 John 2, verse 4 tells us something very clear about that kind of person. The one who says, I have come to know him. I prayed the prayer. I came forward, but does not obey him, meaning the life of God has no bearing on his living, is a liar. And the truth of God is not in him. I don't care what you say, you believe. A Christian who isn't running the race, who hasn't committed himself to following after Christ, is a misnomer. I believe it happens. I believe, in fact, just the very thrust of the text indicates to us that there are possibly people who are Christians who weren't running the race. And the exhortation to them was, if you're in the race, run it. But I want to tell you something else. When it says, let us, one of the keys to understanding where this text is going is trying to figure out who is he talking to when he says, let us. Who is the us? Is it non-Christians? Is he saying to non-Christians, let us? meaning get in the race, let us run the race. If you're not in the race, get in the race. Or is he speaking to Christians, saying, well, you may be in the race by virtue of the new birth, but you're not living the life, so start living the life. The answer to that is yes. The answer to that is he's saying get in the race to both of those people. And whether that person who knows the words but isn't living the life or the person who by virtue of his confession says, don't know Christ, whether that person is a Christian or not, I can't always figure that out. But if you're not running, if you haven't committed yourself, you're in a very dangerous place because it's real hard to tell whether you are in fact a Christian or not. A Christian who isn't running the race is a puzzle. Amos 6.1. Woe to them that are at ease. Don't take any comfort in the fact that if you are not committed to Christ, if you're not running the race, don't take any comfort in the fact that you know some certain things and so that makes you a Christian. What demonstrates that you are indeed a Christian is that you have made a commitment to Christ and he is bearing on your living. Woe to them that are it is. This race is not an option. This race is not an option. I'll give you a special note here and I want you to hang with me here. A special note. You see the problem of people who are in the race or at least consider themselves to be in the race. Let's say we're talking about the person who's in the church. Okay? He's grown up in the church. He came forward. Blah, blah, blah. They accepted Christ. They received Christ. And they are someone that we would consider is in the race. They are on the track, but they aren't running the race. The problem of that kind of person, I suppose some of you would call this person the carnal Christian. Okay? He's in the race, but he isn't running. The problem of that kind of person in the church is an extremely serious problem. The reason it is a serious problem is this. Because the impact of people in the church who call themselves Christians but aren't committed to Christ, who aren't really running the race of faith, by the way, This is not the race of good works. This is not the race of trying hard. This is the race of last week, believing God, trusting Him, resting in Him. The reason this is such a serious thing is that people who aren't running the race do not have a harmless impact on the body. They are not benign. You might think that one who isn't racing and isn't running the race and is just sitting there is kind of harmless, right? They're just kind of sitting there doing nothing strongly good or nothing strongly evil. That isn't the case. You see, the problem is this. People who, by virtue of their lack of faith and shallow commitment, aren't running the race do something very strong in the body of Christ, and that is this. They get in the way of the people who are running the race. They stand on the track, and not only do people who are committed to following after Christ have to keep their eyes fixed on Christ and the goal and keep moving. But one of the tasks they have all their lives functioning in a body of people who call themselves believers but aren't running the race is to constantly run around and dodge and look out for people who are just standing there in the middle of the track. I want you to picture it this way. There's a big track, okay? You got it in your mind? There's like an arena there. And this little track is going around and it's a great big huge thing. and you've got all these people and they're sitting on the track in their track suits okay they're in their track suits and it looks really neat you ever see a track thing really sharp they've got these satin things stripes down the side all these little insignias and things like that and these people that we're talking about would have very nice track suits they'd be very evangelical track suits got it right in fact when you look at the track things they have little emblems and they say adidas puma nike well ours would say cnma right there, you know? I'd have one on my shoe, too. Run real fast. Christian and missionary athlete, right there. Right? Or I would say, but there'd be another group over here, and that would say BGC. That'd be the other team, you know? Baptist General Conference. And they're all on the track, and they're in their track suits, and they're blue and gold and red, and oh, really sharp satin. Everybody's going like this. Ready to go, right? Everybody's excited. Ready to run the race. Real evangelical-looking suit. And they're standing there real hot, ready to go. And what they do is they get out their manuals. And it says on the front, how to run the race. It's my Bible, right? How to run the race. Hey, yeah, boy. And after a while, what they do is they form little huddles, you know, and they start talking about how to run the race. Get out your manual, guy. Here we go. How do you run the race? You run it this way, and you run it that way. And if the manual really inspires them in one place, they go, oh, that's great. Amen. Oh, let's run this race. It's great. Tell you, if they get big enough, what they do after they're talking about the manual, if they get big enough, they hire a guy, a pro, who can come and tell them all about the manual. I'll tell you, you should hear the guy we got. He can pull things out of this manual you've never seen. It's incredible. And when we hear him tell us about what the manual says and how to run, we go, wow, that's great. But before you know it, you know what happens? These people get so enamored with learning how to do it that they never do it. and they form in their little huddles and they want to hear how the manual tells them how to run and they go oh that's good, oh that's great teach me more about how to run and all they do is sit in their little huddle and do that and they never run and they actually begin to believe they become so deluded that they actually begin to believe that because they know how to run that they're running. And they're not. And I'm going to change that little pronoun there to we. We actually begin to believe that because we come and sit on a Sunday morning and learn how to run and go, oh yeah, that because we hear it and agree with it that we are, we aren't necessarily doing it. And until we begin to run the race, until we begin to apply the things we say we know, there is no victory, there is no movement. We are absolutely impotent in terms of spiritual power. We have no direction. We are nothing more in a spiritual dimension. We are nothing more than just a sanctified club, and we look just plain silly. I read a... Any of you ever read The Wittenberg Door? okay, take their names down and report to our elders after the church service. There's an article there about a guy it was called, the guy who went to firefighting school, and it was a wonderful illustration of this very thing. The guy who went to firefighting school you know, this guy grew up in a house and he grew up right across the street from a fire fighting house. Every once in a while the bell would go up ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, and these guys would come flying out of the place with their fire trucks, hanging out of the truck and they'd go fly into a fire just lost my place. Okay. flying to a fire and just get all the flames are going and they fight that fire and this kid just from a little tot just oh that's what i want to do i want to fight fires you know what he did he started going to school and he went to school learn how to be a firefighter you know oh man i want to be a firefighter this is great and even people around him who saw how good he was doing at firefighting school said hey you're cut out for this i can tell you get a's all the time you go to school, you learn how to do it, you got the manual right there. Oh, you are the one. You do it. So he goes to firefighting school. He learns how to fight fires. Gets A's all the way through it. Then he goes into an advanced class. Then he goes on and graduates from that. So he goes to get a PhD in firefighting. It's wonderful. Then if he graduates from that, he goes, what am I going to do now? You know what he does? He was so good in school that they make him a teacher in the school, teaching all the people how to fight fires. You know what he never did? He never fought a fire. Paul says this, 1 Corinthians 9, 24, when I run, I run not as uncertain. You know what that means? It means I don't run uncommitted. You know, uncertain running is like this. Let's see, should I go this way? Maybe. I don't run that way. And you better not run that way either. When I run, I run as one who is certain. I am going that way. I am committed fully to Christ. That is my life. That is my direction. And nothing is going to knock me off it. I do not run as one who is uncertain. That ties in with the message we had a couple of weeks ago. Remember about commitment? People who aren't committed, who are uncertain, are the ones who fit into the behavioristic model. Well, when you were two, something bad happened to you, and that's why the way you are. That's right. If you have no commitments, you're going to be blown to and fro, and every little circumstance that comes into your life is going to bump you along. You're going to be tossed to and fro by the wind, Ephesians 4. But the people who run certainly, that is my future, is the way Paul ran. I run not as uncertain, this is even better, nor as one who beats at the air. I love that. Nor as one who beats at the air. You know what it is to beat at the air? It's a shadow box, right? You know, all ready to go. The one who beats at the air is the person who went to firefighting school and never fought a fire. You got it in your mind? It's exactly who he is. It's a person who grew up in the church and knows all the right answers, went to seminary, knows how to exegete the Greek. It's wonderful, but he never got in the race, necessarily. Shadow boxing. Shadow boxers are pew sitters. Shadow boxers are pew sitters. They come and listen. They go through the motions. You ever see that on TV? I don't watch boxing very much. It disgusts me pretty well, but every once in a while there's no football game on, so you have to. You got to watch some sort of athletic event, so you got to watch boxing. But before the fight, they're always boxing, kind of shadow boxing into the camera. And these guys look so tough, intimidating, don't they? These shadow boxers, they know the moves, they know how to bob their head, they know how to back off. It's incredible when they're in the ring, the first round, boom, she's laying on the ground. Shadow boxers are people who know how to do that. They look really evangelical. They know all the answers. They come to church with their little track suit on, and they go through the motions. They know the moves. They know all about how to run the race. In fact, they know so much about running the race, they could tell you how to run the race. But they never run the race. They never get in the fight. They never exercise faith. And it shows up all the time. It shows up here. In our quarterly meetings, in your annual meetings, when we discuss directions for the church, the people who exercise faith, it just becomes evident. It just becomes evident. It's as if, it's as if the spiritual things are here and then when we make decisions, now be practical, you know, you know, you gotta, but it looks so good and it looks real evangelical in our little outfit and I'm gonna tell you something, I spend significant amounts of time in my office weeping over people who may even be in our church who will one day with their track suit in hand come into the presence of Christ saying, Lord, I knew all about how to do this and never did it and he will say, depart from me. I never knew you. The call is to run the race. Run the set before you race and I don't think it's an option. The second thing, I want you to hear the call. I hope you did. The second thing is I want you to see the nature of the race. First, the call of the race, the set before your race. It's about commitment. It's about saying that is where I'm going and that is who I serve. And halfway commitments don't cut it. The nature of the race is this, and this even makes the whole concept of commitment come more clear. What's the race like? What's the race like? Several things we need to know. It's first of all called a patient or an enduring race. Run with endurance. You got that word? You can circle it if you want, unless it's like mine where it's cut in half. Okay? You can underline it. Okay? Run with endurance, the race that is set before us. It is an enduring race. Some of your translations say a patient race. Run with patience. Now, this is the place where we take the illustration and tell the people this is a patient race, this is an enduring race. So what that means is the Christian life is not a hundred yard dash. Okay? That's true. See, lots of Christians shoot out of the blocks and they're all excited about their faith and they're all excited about Jesus and they're thrilled and they're giving and they're serving and it's wonderful. And then they get around that first bend and their chest begins to heave or they run into a little bit of resistance or they run into some sort of obstacle and they just collapse on the floor. and what we do usually or often in relation to that kind of person when we're using this illustration saying it's a patient race it's one that needs to endure and then we talk about the person who shoots out of the blocks like crazy the usual application is this well see uh-huh it just goes to show you you shouldn't shoot out of the blocks like that you shouldn't run so fast you shouldn't give so much now listen come on slow down take it easy you don't need to give quite that much. You shouldn't get so excited because if you do you're going to get around that first bend and you're just going to fall flat on your face. You're going to burn out. You know what I think of that? I think that's baloney. What burns people out in running the race of faith is not that they ran too fast. It is not that they gave too much. It is not that they were too excited. How can you be too excited? Can you imagine a pastor or an elder or someone kind of putting his arm around someone who's a new believer or an excited Christian saying, it's really good to be excited, but slow down. You know, you're just a little too excited. You know the reason we want them to slow down is because everybody else is walking and they embarrass us. What burns people out is that having started out with wide-eyed, bold, innocent, idealistic belief in God that, oh, I just got my eyes on Him and I'm going to believe Him and he can build and he can give me strength. What happens is I run into that first obstacle and maybe it's another Christian who isn't running. He's standing right in the track and I wasn't ready for it. And I run right into him. Slow down. Take it easy. I run right into him. and I'm absolutely positive that the reason my chest begins to heave and my legs begin to get wobbly is because I was stupid to ever run that fast I want to tell you what makes you burn out isn't that you ran too fast or cared too much is that somewhere along the line you looked at that person who wasn't running or you got into a church of people who weren't running and you just quit believing God instead of running right through the pain and believing god what you do is you get your eyes on the problem and you get your eyes on people and you get your eyes on what some people who don't believe god call reality you got to see reality and you just quit running and then what we say is we say oh i just went too fast i tried too much i did too much i cared too much i say you quit believing god running the race that is set before us is a flat-out run the word for race is agon. We get the word agony. It means full throttle. Full commitment. And what I do is I give it everything I've got. I love the Lord and I live for Him and I'm going to give Him everything I've got today. And you know what? Because I burn it out today, I'm going to trust Him for tomorrow. And I'm going to trust Him for the next day. And I'm going to trust Him for the next day. You know, the best picture I can give you for this is Peter. remember when Peter jumped out of the boat and he sank remember how stupid that is the perfect illustration of somebody who shot out of the block all excited all idealistic he'll sustain me and then he sank like a rock and our assessment would be well that'll cheer him it'll teach him to go climbing out of boats like that that wasn't Peter's problem was it was it that he was burnt out that he cared too much and gave too much and believed too much his problem was that somewhere along the line, he quit believing. God called him to the miraculous. And when Peter believed God idealistically and simply and in a childlike way, he was walking on water. Something came along. It was a wave. Maybe it was a problem. I don't know. The text doesn't reveal this, but maybe it was one of the disciples back in the boat who weren't walking on water saying, Peter, what are you doing? You can't do that. And he looked back and, you're right. It's over. his problem wasn't that he shouldn't have gotten out of the boat it's just somewhere along the line he could believe in god some obstacle he didn't believe go back to the picture of the track you got it in your mind you got it picture the track and some people are just standing there other people are running i want you to picture some guy who's just real idealistic just loves the lord maybe they just became a Christian or maybe they're a Christian who just caught on fire with what it means to really run the race. And they just said, Lord, oh, I love you and I'm going to serve you and boy, I'm going to have impact on my church. And you just, they're running around, you know, and all of a sudden they come into a group of people who are just standing there like this. And it's almost like a buzzsaw. They come, nothing. Just sucks the life right out of them. how do you handle that how do you handle that what do you do when you're all excited and idealistic and and just believe god and then you come into a church and you find out that that is just really just a lot of talk just talk about believing god really trusting him with our financial things, really trusting Him with the programs, stepping out on a limb and saying, we're going to do it, and the only reason we're going to do it is because God said to do it. And you're really, that's right. And you're all ready. And then you get around a bunch of people who are just staring and going, oh. And when you come with those ideas, they go, what is the matter with you? How do you do that? How do you handle that? How do you keep running when everybody else isn't? Verse 2, fix your eyes on Christ. We're going to get to this in a minute in terms of really breaking this down. But you know what that means in the Greek, fixing our eyes on Christ? I love it. It literally means looking away to Jesus. It means looking away to Jesus. And when you begin to run into people like that who don't believe God, the only way you're going to make it is if you look away. It's if you look away and you see Jesus and you say, I'm going to keep being idealistic and I'm going to keep believing you and I'm going to keep believing that the only thing of value that works here is faith and I'm going to run right by him. Don't you dare look at other people. When Jesus has called you to run and every obstacle that comes and every problem that comes you've got to look away. Look away to Jesus. Look away to Jesus. Look away to Jesus. It's a patient race. First thing, it's a patient race. It doesn't mean you sit around patiently. It means you run flat out enduring, believing God every step of the way. And when those obstacles come, you look away. It's a disciplined race. It's a disciplined race. I love this. It says, lay aside. Let us also lay aside every encumbrance. Every encumbrance. Encumbrance is a wonderful word. The Greek word is agakon. It literally means bulk, mass, superfluous flesh. Literally, fat. Get rid of the fat. You like that? If you really desire to do what God called you to do and be what God called you to be, you're going to have to get the lead out, get rid of the fat. You know that in any athletic endeavor, I don't care if it's softball or what, bowling, weight hinders you, right? You should see our guys in the spring, after the whole winter of sitting around, and we have our first softball practice, these guys who've been sitting around, they can't get the fly balls. There's just no way. They just look like a bunch of ducks. It's unbelievable. When you're heavy and you're fat, you can't move. That's why this illustration is so beautiful. You can't run the race. lots of things make christians fat lots of things make christians fat spiritually fat keeps us from being efficient let me give you a few real quick first peter 121 says this if you want to run the race that's set before you efficiently and well strip away all malice guile hypocrisy envy slander i don't have time i'd love to break every one of those words down and apply them to us. You do that. Do some work in your own heart. Malice, guile, hypocrisy, envy. Why do you need to get rid of that? Because it makes you fat. Because it keeps you from running the race faithfully. That's why. Ephesians 4.31 says the same thing. Let all bitterness and anger and clamor and evil speech be put away. Why? Because it's fattening. That's why. You ever find yourself in a conversation with people? And maybe it's people in our church. and all of a sudden, slowly, almost imperceptibly, this conversation begins to move to slanderous malice. You begin to talk about somebody, and it's all ripping them apart. And I'll tell you something else. One of the ways you get sucked into it is that people who are really good at malicious gossip, people who are really good at it, and are wearing their evangelical tracksuits, they do. They do it wearing their evangelical tracksuits, and they couch malicious gossip, in words that sound like concern. And I'll tell you something. You get into a conversation like that and every one of us have been in them. You just feel yourself getting what? Weighed down. It makes you fat. Put all that junk away. I'd like us to start a new phrase. You know, we talked about this in prayer meeting a couple of times and I asked people there, how many times have you been in a conversation where it just turned sour and it turned negative and you stopped them right in the middle and say, I don't want to have anything to do with that. I remember a couple of people just, they had done that kind of thing. They stopped them right in the middle and said, I don't want to be part of this. I'd like to start a new phrase in our church. When we feel ourselves getting sucked into a conversation like that, just stop right in the middle and say, excuse me, this conversation is fattening. I'm really kind of on a diet here and I'd like to move myself out of here. You know why that's hard to do? You know, think about this. The reason that's hard for some of us to do is that some of our relationships are so sick when I think about this that some of our relationships are so sick that the thing that holds us together is that we all don't like the same people wait we're unified you know what else makes people fat this one's real practical this illustration is beautiful I feel like I could go on and on and on and you're going no what makes people fat you know what makes people fat they eat too much and then what they eat they don't use that's what makes people fat i know a lot of people physically who work like a dog and they eat like crazy but you know what they never get fat why because it's balanced what makes people spiritually fat is that they come to church and they eat and they eat and they eat and they eat and they never do a thing and they go spiritually and we say things like this I just like to hear the preacher preach I just like to hear the word of the Lord I'll tell you something there's an awful lot of Christians even in our church who the last thing they need to hear is another sermon what they need to begin to do is do the things they've already learned run the race when all we do is come and sit and watch and eat and never function is we get spiritually fat and and then we become that person who's just standing in the middle of the track and not only are we uncommitted and not only are we just standing in the middle because we haven't really set our course but on top of that is a great big fat guy i mean he's right in the middle of the track blocking the whole work stuff like this can just grind a church to a halt unless there are significant numbers of people who are looking away and saying we're not going to go that direction we are going to ignore that kind of influence and believe God and believe God and believe God by the way the way to get rid of the fat in terms of running the race you don't get thin and then run the way you get rid of fat is start to run start to run just start running everybody's waiting around so they get in shape before they run you don't stop eating either i hope you're here in balance i hope you're here in balance you need to eat there's two people there's two reasons why people get hungry and want to eat one reason is because they've been running and they've been giving and they've been believing god and they need it and they come on sunday morning or they come on a Wednesday or they go to a Bible study and I want to tell you the words feed them and they leave refreshed and challenged and oh Lord thank you I needed that meal and I just trust that as we come together in this place that by the grace of God you leave feeling like you've been fed and it's wonderful and it's satisfying if you've been running a race there's another reason people are always wanting to eat and that that's the only thing they know how to do sit and listen and watch and then compare it to other meals they had I like last week's meal better don't stop eating just balance it, run the race the sin that entangles, it's a disciplined race you got to get rid of the fat, you got to get rid of the sin that entangles I got to wrap this up I believe the sin for them was legalism and I'm not even going to be able to go into that because I want to call this let's take a minute here and edit my sermon the word entangle means to surround it means to stand around it means to hang on it's like a ball and chain so you picture a guy who's obese because he's taking it in and not giving it out and not only is he obese but he's got this great big overcoat surrounding him and it's a thing that entangles him or it's a ball and chain. These Hebrews, the weight they carried was legalism. They were being dragged back into the ritual. Remember? They were being dragged back into the form. They had all sorts of rules they were supposed to keep and instead of being free and just running the race without all that junk, that excess stuff, they hadn't cut that off. Somewhere along the line, somebody came and clamped it on them and they're trying to pull this legalism and all this ritual and religious stuff along with them. And it became slow and afraid and tentative. I want to tell you something the word of God says dead works works that are designed to try to earn me something is dead weight you can't carry it along Galatians had the same problem that's why I had Jeff read that it was for freedom that Christ set you free got to read a text chapter 5 verse 6 and 7 you foolish Galatians for in Christ neither circumcision or uncircumcision means anything. But faith is what matters. Keep running. You were running so well. What hindered you from being free? What happened was they got all sorts of rules and they got all sorts of little codes and little languages that they were supposed to remember specifically for them was circumcision. The joy was gone. The freedom was gone. When the joy and the freedom were gone, it was like a ball and chain. They were following codes. It wasn't because they loved the Lord anymore. They stopped running. That's what happened. how do you filter through all that how do you filter through all that how do you get rid of the ball and chain of legalism and unbelief how do you manage to run around people who are standing in the way you keep your eyes on the goal verse 2 fixing our eyes on Jesus fixing our eyes literally I said this already means to look away to look away to Christ to look away if we had it we don't hear there are some here in our church that are unspoken and we all kind of live by little codes our job is to strip every one of those away as much as we can and look away from all that to christ the fact is friend if you commit yourself to running the race guaranteed guaranteed listen you will be distracted obstacles will be in the way there's no doubt about it and some of those obstacles this is the real subtle thing some of those obstacles can look like real good things. That could be this church. Don't you dare look at this church. Don't you dare come to our church and think, oh, my spiritual salvation is searching the open door. Look away. I thank God that people sense that something's going on here and the Spirit of God is here in such a way that we are being obedient to Him and you feel fed and excited. Great. But don't you start counting on it. You'll be unfaithful. You'll start pacing yourself right next to our church. look away people commit themselves to churches they commit themselves to denominations something wrong with churches? something wrong with denominations? no but I want to tell you if you start committing yourself to that stuff you're going to get unfaithful look away keep all that other stuff in perspective placement of our eyes in any athletic event is absolutely crucial when I was a kid baseball remember playing baseball? keep riding the ball Dave the worst thing for me was ground balls I played third base when I was a little kid and the big thing was you're supposed to keep your head down because that's where the ball is usually on a ground ball that's why they call it a ground ball it's on the ground so you got to keep your head down right and what do we all do we all go like this right well that's what i do now because i caught it right in the face my nose is all kind of spreading out see that that's why ground balls would come up and so now i don't keep my eye on the ball at all but if you're going to catch a ground ball keep your eye on the ball same thing in football what they teach you when you're making tackles on people is don't look at the eyes don't look at the head don't look at the feet or the shoulders look right at the belt because where his belt's going is where he's going. Keep your eyes there. When you run a race, what do you do? You keep your eye on the goal. You ever run a race and watch your feet? Think about that. 100 yard desk. That'd be great. I hate to admit this. I jog. I don't hate to admit that. I hate to admit this. When I jog, there's this one place on Brooklyn Boulevard where there's this car place and there's all these windows there. So I run by and I'm in a jogging suit. I like to look over there and see how I look. You ever do that? Some of you do. I look over there and see how I look. But on Brickland Boulevard, I did that once, there's a telephone pole. It's right in the middle of the sidewalk. You don't run the race looking around. And you don't run the race looking at your feet. There's a dangerous problem in the church, and we have it. Many of us are afflicted by this, we constantly get introspective. It's real good. We're told to examine ourselves, aren't we? So there is a place for introspection. But I want to tell you without balance, it just paralyzes us. We say things like this. Okay, how am I running? Is it this foot? Or is it that foot? Oh, I wonder, Lord, are you telling me to move this foot? Oh, look away. Quit looking in. Quit looking at your feet. Just look away and run. And you may fall flat on your face and get back up and run. And you may run right into an obstacle and it might be a Christian who you thought was really committed and cared and you shared your heart and you didn't get a response and you just felt like you ran right into a buzzsaw. You know what you're going to have to do? Right now, look away. Look away. And sometimes you're going to have real victory and you know what you're going to do? You're going to get proud and you're going to start thinking, I really am the man. And you're going to fall right on your face unless you look away. There's even something more serious than being proud because you succeeded. Some people here this morning aren't running because they failed miserably. And maybe that sin you got involved in was a public thing and everybody knows. and you just went into a buzzsaw, you know what I want to share with you? The gospel. Confess your sin, ask forgiveness, and look away. You know, some of you are paralyzed spiritually in terms of running the race. You know why? Because you keep looking at something you did in the past that you asked forgiveness for. If you've done something in the past and you knew it was sin and you never confessed it and your heart was broken over it and you brought it to the Lord and asked forgiveness, then you can't be running the race. I mean, you've got to deal with that. But if you have indeed asked forgiveness and you've moved away from that thing, you need to look away. And if you don't, if you don't accept your forgiveness and accept your freedom, you're never going to run. You know, Jeff mentioned Christmas. This applies to Christmas. How do you do it? You know, how do you handle Christmas with the rush and the chaos and the tinsel and the glitter. Pastor, how do you enjoy Christmas with all that? Look away. Temptation comes and pulls. Look away. You may be attacked or criticized. You're so idealistic. Look away. Look away. We look at the crowd. We look at other people and the pace they're running. You know, one of the real cop-outs is if you're running and you're really excited and you're really committed and you run into a buzzsaw and then you start walking too and quit running. You know what the wonderful cop-out is? I've used it. It's their fault that I'm not running. They made me stop. Baloney. Look away. Look away. So it is that we run the race, not looking at a church, not looking at a denomination, at a pastor, at a person, you or me. I run saying, Lord, I want to be like you. Lord, I want to be by you. Lord, I want to do what you do. Dear friend, I want to encourage you this morning with this sermon. Hang on. Run the race. Be faithful. Trim the fat. Don't stop. How? Look away. Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith. Let's pray. Lord even as I close I'm impressed again with the fact that sermons don't get us to run I pray that we would search our hearts concerning whether we are people who sit and listen and know it all but aren't doing the things you've called us to do may we be people who run in Jesus name Amen Thank you.
