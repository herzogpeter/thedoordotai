I'd like you to open your Bibles with me to 1 John chapter 5, 1 John chapter 5, where last week in our examination of the first 12 verses, we heard John essentially saying this, that those who are truly born of God are just not that hard to spot. Beginning in verse 1, first of all, they believe that Jesus is the Christ. Let's read it right from the text. Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Characteristic number one, they are believing. but it doesn't stop there for because they believe him they also obey him characteristic number two of those truly born of god they are obeying and the reason they obey him is because they love him so characteristic number three they are loving three characteristics that clearly mark the people truly born of god obedience faith and love and as i indicated last week those three things work together they're circular it's kind of how john talks it's how he thinks they're cyclical they are connected they go together you can't have one without the other you can't have faith without love you can't have love without obedience they all just work together for if we do indeed believe that jesus is the christ we will obey him and if we obey him it simply reveals the obvious fact that we believe him and if you love him you will obey him and if you obey him it simply reveals that you do indeed love him. This cyclical, circular way of thinking is John's kind of trademark. But the cycle doesn't stop with obedience, faith, and love. Just those three things the way I described them. Indeed, it doesn't even just start there. It continues to affect and be affected, cycling out into our lives in a variety of ways, transforming ways. Consider briefly the transforming cycle of the life of God involved in those who are truly born of him. You see, the reason that we love him, and even consider the idea of obeying him at all, is because we have been seized by the power of a great affection. And the great affection that has seized us is the furious love of God for us, who loved us first. And when we believed and received that love, it changed who we are. For we are now the children of God. And that furious love of God, believed and received, changed also how we live and who and what and how we love. But the biggest, most obvious and visible change, according to John, in all of that is this. That now we are believing, obeying, and loving. And as those three simple things are active in our lives and growing in our lives, more and more we have the power to live a different way, to literally, according to chapter 5, verse 5, overcome the world. And who is the one who overcomes the world, verse 5, but he who believes. That word believe is present tense verb and it can be rendered this way. Who is the one who overcomes the world? but he who is believing, obeying, and loving this Jesus who is the Son of God. Now last week I said all of that this way. There was a kind of obedience to God, born of our love for God, and belief in his Son as God that gives us the power to overcome the world, to live a different way, no longer dominated and driven by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life, which is what the world is, that world system driven by those three things. But we can live a different way for we can live by love from God, for God, and for people. So the exhortation around all of that from John is this. So keep on believing and keep on obeying and keep on loving. Even when you wonder if it matters. Even when you wonder if it's worth it. Even when you don't feel much like an overcomer. The word from John through this epistle is this, keep on believing and keep on obeying and keep on loving, for it is by our believing, obeying, and loving that we overcome the world. Now, we come to verse 13 through verse 20 this morning. This cycling out effect of obedience, faith, and love, having impact on our lives in a variety of ways, continues. Let's look at verse 13. These things I have written. Stop right there. What things? these things about believing, obeying, and loving, I have written to you who believe in order that you may know that you have eternal life. Let me say that verse as you just continue to kind of look at it on the screen. Let me say that whole verse a different way, kind of dressed out. Here's what I think he's saying. I am writing to those of you who are in the process right now of believing, obeying, and loving about how vital believing, obeying, and loving is in order that those of you who are believing, obeying, and loving would know for certain that believing, obeying, and loving is how you know you have eternal life. And I am here to tell you, he says in this verse, that you have it. You know how I know? Because I can see it and I can hear it. For what I see and what I hear is this, that you believe him. And because you believe him, you obey him. And the reason you obey him is because you love him. So keep on believing and keep on obeying and keep on loving because that is how you know that you have eternal life. It is also this cycle of believing, obeying, and loving that serves as the basis, as we go now to verse 14, of our confidence that we have in him. Verse 14, and this is the confidence, what? Believing, obeying, and loving. That we have before him that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, We know that we have the request which we have asked from him. I want to sit on this verse just for a moment and clarify something about this promise. It's an amazing promise. Number one, he hears us. Number two, he will answer us and give to us what we request. I'm afraid, and this is why I want to sit on this just for a second, that some of us have really trivialized this verse. and the trivialization of it for us, it kind of comes in this package. We tend to look at this verse and picture God in this verse as a dispenser of the promise, and our picture of him is he's kind of this big gumball dispenser in the sky. And the promise is, we think anyway, that the promise is if I put in the coin of my prayer, he will give me the gumball that I want. So I sit there and think, well, I'd like a blue one. And he says here, if I pray, I'll put in the prayer thing, And then we don't get the blue gumball. We get a bread one. Or we didn't get any gumball that we wanted at all. And I think actually there's, actually, among even believers, there's a lot of pouting around this. He didn't tell. He didn't give me what I wanted. It says right there I will, but he doesn't. I want to go out on a limb here and say something rather blunt. And if it kind of shocks you or even offends you, just kind of hang with me here as I kind of play this out. I think God has no interest whatsoever in the prayers of people who think that he's a gumball dispenser. I don't think he's interested. And to be quite frank, I think prayers like that bore him. What do you mean bore him? What do you mean, hey, I thought he was a loving good man. I think they bore him. You know why? Because he is not interested. God has no interest whatsoever in being in a relationship with anybody who thinks he's a gumball dispenser. He's not interested. One of the things that we have talked about over and over here at Open Door, and it's been strong in 1 John, is that God is a furious lover, and he wants a relationship with us. And through Christ, he is the groom, and we are the bride. And he is looking for suitors. And what I'm driving at here would be the equivalent of in the human arena, someone who, let's say, has great beauty, physical beauty. And over time, they've just kind of gotten used to the fact that people want to be with her and knock on the door and make requests of her because they're beautiful. But you know what? After a while, if this person has any wisdom at all, not only do they get offended when people are coming in, the only reason they want to be in a relationship with her is because she's beautiful. After a while, you just get flat out bored. You don't even hear it. They have no, oh, please, oh, please. You don't even hear it anymore because I am not interested in a relationship with someone who's just here because I'm beautiful. Let's say you have a lot of money. Same dynamic. Someone's got a lot of money. After a while, the people, you can spot them, the people who want me for my money. I've had that problem all my life. but they want you for your money after a while maybe for one place over here it kind of offends you but past that after you've heard it and heard it after a while you just don't even it just doesn't even affect you anymore you know why because i'm not looking for that kind of relationship and guess what neither is god he is he has no interest in people who want to treat him like a gumball dispenser and he doesn't i don't think this is me okay and this is i'm just kind of floating this one out to see if it floats at all. I don't think he even hears it. You know what interests him? You know what gets God's attention? People who love him. People who believe him and are desiring to obey him. People who are coming to him with requests like this. Lord, teach me how to live this human life in the middle of an evil and perverse generation where God is the, where the enemy where the whole world lies in the power of the evil one and teach me how to live in that world my human life in the context of your kingdom reality empower me father to believe you and obey you and love you and empower me to trust you and follow you even when I can't see you and even when I can't hear you and even when I can't feel you I'm going to tell you something the spirit that kind of spirit in the heart of men and women catches is the attention of God. That is the frequency he is tuned to. You know why? Because he is absolutely committed to partner with people who love him. It's not that complicated. That's the kind of relationship he's looking for. People who will love him, who will be, he is totally into and eager to collaborate with people who believe him, who are desiring to obey him. In fact, he's looking for that. Like a suitor, like somebody who's looking for somebody to marry, he's looking around for people he could collaborate with and be with. Where do you get that? I get that. In a number of places. The most obvious is 2 Chronicles 16.9 where it says this, that the eyes of the Lord move to and fro throughout the whole earth in order that he might strong do what he wants to do. And you know what he wants to do? Strongly support those whose hearts are fully his. He's looking for people that he can strongly support who believe him, obey him, and love him. So keep on believing and keep on obeying and keep on loving. Even when sometimes it feels like he's not hearing and he's not answering and it doesn't matter that you pray. Why? Because he does hear and he will answer and it does matter. So keep on believing, obeying, loving, and praying. one of the things I wanted you to catch here is this cyclical dynamic circular reasoning of John believing, obeying, and loving is how we overcome the world it's how we know we belong to him, it's how we know he hears our prayers what I want to do now is stop the cycle and get you to consider that this cycle that goes one direction goes another direction as well and it's extremely important if you're going to get the whole picture to understand how the cycle goes the way I just described it but it goes another way too. Let me explain. Over and over again, in this epistle, John tells the people to whom he is writing things that they need to know. In fact, he reminds them over and over again of things they already do know and they need to be reminded of. Indeed, 39 times in this epistle, seven times here in these final verses that we're covering today, John uses the word know, that you may know. By this you know, for we have come to know. Sometimes he just says, we know. The purpose of this entire epistle is identified for us by John in verse 13 when he says, these things I've written to you who believe in order that you may what? Know. Apparently there's some things we need to know. We need to know. God hears us when we pray. We need to know. God answers when we pray. We need to know it matters that we pray. Moving on to verse 19 as the we knows continue and with a flurry of activity even grow. We need to know that even though the whole world lies in the power of the evil one, that we belong to God. Look at verse 19. I kind of flipped that over so we could understand it. It says we know that we are of God and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. I didn't even get that until I flipped it around. Even though we live in a world that is in the power of the evil one, you better know that in that world you belong to God. So you don't have to be afraid. and he will protect you and keep you. We need to know, verse 20, or be reminded of what we already know, that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding in order that we might know him who is true and that we are in him who is true, that is his Son, Jesus Christ, and you need to know or be reminded of what you already know, that this Jesus is the true God and the eternal life. You need to know all that. Now, let me just kind of describe how the cycle of these things goes two different ways. On the one hand, John makes it clear, and this is what I've been talking about for two weeks, that it is by our believing, obeying, and loving that we can know for certain that we belong to God, that he hears our voice, that he answers our prayers, that he partners with us in the living of our lives. And the reason we can know that is because he is totally committed to people who love him, believe him, and obey him. So keep on obeying, believing, and loving. But the cycle goes a different direction. For John fully knows this about us, that if we are going to be able to keep on believing, obeying, and loving, then we are going to need to know that we belong to him first. You need to know that first. And we need to know that he hears our voice. If we're going to be able to keep on believing and obeying and loving, we need to know he answers our prayers, that he's actively involved in our lives, we need to know that the Son of God has come and that he is real and that in him we have our life and that we are in him who is true. Because if you don't know those things are true about God and about his Son, Jesus, and if you don't know those things are true about you and if you don't know them deep within your spirit, then you will never have the courage, the strength and the endurance to keep on believing, obeying, and loving. Especially when the lights go out and the night is long and the shade is pulled and you can't hear his voice and you can't see his face. And so it is, John says in this epistle, 39 times. and seven times here at the end with a flurry of activity, these things I write so you will know. Because it is by knowing that you'll be able to believe. The believing turns to knowing. The knowing goes both ways. Let me say it this way. When John wrote his gospel, different than his epistle, he wrote it to unbelievers so they would believe. In fact, in John 20, 31, he does exactly what he did in his epistle. He tells us why he wrote the gospel in John 20, 31. He says, these things I have written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you might come into life. He is speaking, he wrote the whole gospel that people who didn't believe wouldn't now believe. But when John wrote this epistle that we have been studying for almost a year now, he wrote it to believers that they might have confidence. Confidence. 1 John 5.13, these things I've written to you who already believe, in order that you may know that you have eternal life, in order that you may know that you belong to God, in order that you may have confidence. Do you know why he wrote all that? Do you know why in this epistle, 39 times he says, this is what we know. You need to know. Seven times at the end. You know why he says all that? Because the people to whom he was writing had lost their confidence. And if you lose your confidence, it's really hard to keep on believing and obeying and loving. Because if you lose your confidence, you begin to wonder if it's worth it. And you begin to wonder if it matters. And you begin to wonder if you matter. you ever lose your confidence maybe in spiritual things maybe maybe because of maybe some stumbling that you went through and you're just discouraged and you just don't think god can you're gonna his face and you're feeling lousy about yourself an enemy just lands on that maybe it's nothing that you did it really is just the enemy coming with accusations and you're a loser and god doesn't love you and you know you don't belong to him and even if you do it doesn't matter and all these messages and you just lose your confidence. But let's say it's not spiritual, anything. Have you ever felt that? Maybe in an arena of something where you felt like generally you're pretty capable, but not anymore. You've lost it. It's a frightening thing. It just takes the wind out of your sails, steals your endurance, it undermines your courage, it saps your strength. I've been reading the book of Joshua lately, and one of the very colorful phrases is that from time to time it says that people's courage turned to water and their courage turned to, has your courage ever turned to water? It resonates in me. I know what that feels like. If you're an athlete, you lose your confidence. You don't run as fast. You may still be running and everybody looking at you, it looks the same. You don't jump as high. You just lose a spring in your step. If you're a baseball player and you lose your confidence to hit, it's just this weird thing. You're still swinging, but you're not as aggressive. You're not confident. You lost your confidence, so you're not even swinging this hard. It makes you tentative, this loss of confidence. More afraid to fail than eager to win. And in the middle of it all, you begin to wonder, am I wasting my time? Have I missed a boat? Am I really the chump that I feel like I am? Does any of this really matter at all? Do I matter at all? It's a horrible feeling to lose your confidence. And if you ever have felt the things I'm describing, or if you are feeling them this morning, then you need to know that you are not alone. For the people to whom John is writing this epistle had lost their confidence as well. Let me tell you how. The story is familiar to many of you because we've touched on it before. It's kind of the story of 1 John, and I've told it before. As most of you know, the people to whom John is writing are his beloved spiritual children in the faith. Most of them had come to faith in Christ under the ministry of the Apostle John. And they were by and large a simple people of simple but authentic faith. Not many mighty, not many wise or noble as the world would measure those things. But as is the case for all people who are truly born of God, This faith thing for them was not just an intellectual exercise of all the things about God and Jesus they needed to get right on the test. For them, it was a love affair. For they had been introduced to Jesus, the lover of their souls, by John, the beloved apostle. And so it is out of this love they had for Jesus, who they believed to be God, this business of believing him, obeying him, and loving him was just not a stretch for them. It was literally part of who they were and how they lived. The problem began with a group of people calling themselves Christians from within the church. And actually, when you think about it, many of the problems and the things that really undermine us don't often or always come from the outside. When the outside attacks, even with persecution, even though it's painful and scary, ironically, those things effectively make us stronger. We come together. We believe more. It's when it's from within that it's the most debilitating. These people from within had begun for a variety of reasons to despise the simplicity and purity of love and devotion to Christ. And among the reasons they despised it was because it was, well, just too simple. Kind of sappy obedience, purity, devotion. Come on. They began to look down their intellectually superior noses at people of simple faith, people who just loved Jesus and held precious his precepts and loved their brother from the heart. See, they had begun to see themselves as having ascended to a higher level of intellectual and spiritual insight, and they began to hold themselves aloof, for they were the elite, the enlightened, the intelligentsia. They were the knowers, in a word. They were the knowers. and in fact I introduced them, talked about them last week. Specifically they were the Gnostics, the Docetists, the Cyrenthians. Remember them? Interesting, the word Gnostic has as its root to know. They were the knowers. And isn't it interesting, by the way, just to kind of tie this into the text, that these superior, at least the thinking of themselves as being superior knowers, on one hand, who were indeed false. John's Holy Epistle is saying to the people who are truly redeemed, You're intimidated by these people who call themselves the knowers. I'm here to tell you, you are the ones who know. 39 times you know. They don't know. Who's the liar? They're the liar. He's a little feisty about that. And what they knew, these Gnostics, Dostoe de Cerinthians, that these unenlightened, sappy, simple believers didn't know, among other things was this, that Jesus was not the Christ. He wasn't God, according to them. How could he be? No thinking person believes that anymore. She will have some reverence for Jesus. He was a good man and had good things to say here and there. But God, give me a break. As we said last week, the dominoes begin to fall from there because if he isn't God, then why on earth would obedience to him be imperative? It isn't. I will pick and choose. I will make the law unto myself. I'll do precisely what I want, when I want, where I want. I will no longer struggle with sin or against sin and move to freedom in Christ. I will now embrace my sin and call the embrace of sin freedom, which, by the way, is the spirit of the age that you and I live in as well. And then in their arrogant perception of themselves as the elite, these people eliminated love, separating themselves from people they thought beneath them, like simple believers who just love Jesus, who believe that he was indeed the Christ and were careful to do all that he commanded them, who kept on believing and kept on obeying and kept on loving. What losers are they? Now, you may think that all of that stuff would be easy to blow off. You know, I mean, if they don't believe that Jesus is God, fine. I mean, to each his own. If they don't think that obedience matters, big deal. I mean, let them do what they do. And if they think that I'm a loser, too bad. I just don't have time to give a lot of energy to what they think about me. You'd think. You'd be able to do that. But, beloved, the effect that that spirit had on these simple believers was a cumulative thing. It's the kind of effect that a spirit of unbelief, if you have to live around that long enough, begins to have on you and maybe some of you here living this close to this kind of spirit in your family, in your workplace. It had the same effect on you that it had on these simple believers this time. And the effect over time was this, that it began to make these people who loved Jesus, obeyed him, and loved him, it began to make them feel small. And they started to feel stupid, like maybe they were missing the boat. And it took the wind out of their sails. And it stole their endurance. And it sapped their strength. And their courage turned to water. And they lost their confidence. And when you lose your confidence, you begin to wonder, should I keep on believing? Does it matter? Should I keep on obeying? Should I keep on loving? Does it really matter? Is it really worth it? Have I missed a boat? Am I wasting my time? Maybe they're right. Maybe I really am the chump they say I am because I believe and I obey and I love. Beloved, it is into that dynamic that John begins to speak. And he is speaking here, and you need to catch this. He is speaking to them like a father to a son, like a father to a daughter, like a father to his children. Indeed, I believe this entire epistle is what I would call a father talk to beloved children who are right on the edge. I have a father. My father is gone to be with the Lord, but I had a father. So this analogy works well for me. And I remember getting father talks from time to time. Well, I also am a father. And my kids will tell you once in a while there's a father talk or a mother, father, parent talk. And we even have a place that happens. It happens in the living room. Caleb, Chris, whatever, whoever. Come into the living room and they go, oh, brother, oh, brother. Every once in a while we have a talk. Don't do this every day. Every once in a while it's important, especially when something's on the edge. There's some things you need to see. There's some things you need to know. Maybe as I use this father analogy, some of you don't have a father, and if you do, the image of a father is not a good one. Then I want to invite you to do something this morning as I begin to move through this text in a way that speaks from a father's heart to his children. I want you to let John be your father this morning. And here is what John the apostle, John the father of these people in the faith, begins to say, and he says it throughout the epistle. I'm going to go back into this epistle and hear his word. He says this, my beloved children, there's some things you need to know, especially in this dark time when you've lost your confidence, when the lights have gone out and it feels like the shade has been pulled. There are some things you need to remember right now about what I know you know. In fact, he says in chapter 2, verse 21, I am not writing to you right now, sons and daughters, because you do not know the truth. I am writing because you do know the truth. And you have forgotten. And I am writing to you because you do have an anointing from the Holy One of God. And you have forgotten the anointing that you have. Let me talk to you. Let me ask you a question, son, daughter. Who is the liar? You are being lied to. And you're beginning to wonder who's telling you the truth. Let me ask you a question. Who is the liar? I'm going to tell you who the liar is. He says, chapter 2, verse 22. The one who denies that Jesus is the Christ is the liar. And you can get involved in all your debate if you want, and we can debate later. But I'm here to tell you, you need to know, the liar is the one who denies that Jesus is the Son of God. Little children, it is the last hour, and the stakes are very high. And up until this time, we've had a lot of time to sing and dance and play. But you are growing up now, and the stakes are getting higher for you. And just as you have heard from me in our family of faith, that false teachers will come. I'm here to tell you right now, as your father, that they are here. Do not be deceived. I'm writing to you, he says. In chapter 2, verse 12, I am writing to you children. And I'm writing to you because your sins are already forgiven for his namesake. And I am writing to you fathers because you have known him who was from the beginning. And I am writing to you young men and you young women because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the world and you have begun to use your youthful strength to come against the workings of the evil one and do the works of God. Here is my word to you, children, fathers, mothers, young men, young women, love not the world. That's my word to you as we sit in the living room today. Neither the things that are in the world. And I am telling you not that. I am telling you that not because I want to spoil your fun. In fact, I am telling you these things so you can come into the fullness of life in God. The reason I am telling you to love not the world or the things that are in the world is because all the things that are in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life, absolutely devour and destroy people. And they will destroy you. And they will destroy families. And they will destroy our family. And they will destroy churches. And that will destroy our church. And they will destroy cities and countries. Don't forget who you are, says the Father to his children. Beloved, let me tell you who you are. You are now the child of God. That's who you are. Born of him. Amazing, isn't it? See, in effect, John himself, who is kind of acting as the father, is speaking of the father. He backs off and he just gets excited. He says, see how great a love the father has given unto us that we should be called the children of God and such we are. That's why in chapter 3 verse 9 he says, no one who is born of God practices sin because the seed of God abides in you and you are born of him. People born of God don't practice sin. Let me explain that in a minute. Little children, let no one deceive you. The one who practices righteousness is righteous. It's not that complicated. The one who practices sin, practice word means works hard to get good at sin is of the devil. By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious. The one who practices righteousness is born of God. Do you remember when we dealt with that? That's just a little confusing enough for me to stop here in this run of words from John to us to just kind of reteach that very briefly. What it means to practice righteousness. What it means to practice sin and the spirit of this whole thing that John is speaking of. The essence of it is this. you are born of God. And the analogy he's using is just like a child wants to be like their father who gave them life. It's just natural for you to put your steps where your father put his. Picture here is that we are born of God. The picture of the father here is that we're talking not about maybe your father who hurt you and abused you and made you want to run away the other direction. This is a father who is noble and good and righteous and loves you beyond what you can imagine. And I'm telling you, if you've got to use your imagination to picture a father like that, then go ahead and ask God to ignite your imagination about a father or a mother like that. But I promise you, a little kid with a father or a mother like that, you don't have to tell them desire to be like everything in them says, I want to be like my dad. And you don't want to even use the word like honor, and you just want to be like him. And the picture, remember when I taught this months ago when we went through this text in chapter three, the pictures of a little kid and I, it must have been winter because the picture I had was of a father walking through the snow and he's leaving footprints. And there's this little toddler behind trying to put their feet where their daddy put his feet. And they're just trying as hard as they can to do that. But because he's a little guy, he's not always doing real well. And sometimes he falls down. And sometimes he gets off. And sometimes he quits and he starts to cry and he's just mad. It's all upset. Remember, we were struggling when I went with this text at the beginning with whether practicing righteousness meant sinless perfection. And the picture I had of this toddler trying to keep up with their dad was that they don't always keep up real well. And it might even look like they're sinning because they're not doing exactly what their father did. But if you look at the course of their life, what are they practicing? What are they trying hard to get good at? They're trying hard to get good at, I want to be like my dad. That's just what I want. And I'm not doing very well right now, but I am practicing. Why? Who does that? Who does that? People born of that father. That's what he's saying. And that's who you are. That's who you are, says John. And these people who have come along embracing their sin and telling you obedience doesn't matter, they are liars. And it's just bizarre to me, says John, because they're intimidating you and making you feel like you're missing the boat. They're missing the boat. And I'm here as a father to tell you that. And I know you know this, but we just need to have a father talk today. Don't forget who you are. Chapter 4, verse 4, you are the children of God. Chapter 4, verse 6, you are from God, little children. Let me soften this just a bit. Know how he loves you. And you know what? One of the things that happens when we lose our confidence is sometimes we forget how much the father just plain loves us. loves us. So let me remind you of how he loves you and tell you how we know he loves you. Here's how we know he laid down his life. Chapter 3, 16. By this the love of God was manifested to us that God has sent his only begotten son into the world so that we might be able to live through him. In this is love, beloved children. Not that we loved God, but that he loved us. Before we knew his name. He loved us and sent his son to make a way for us to know him and be with him. So here's my word to you children. Keep on believing and keep on obeying and keep on loving. Even if today you feel stupid. Even if today you feel small and weak. Even if today you don't feel much like an overcomer or a knower. My word to you is this. Keep on believing. obeying and loving. For the reason I have written these things, chapter 5, 13, about believing, obeying, and loving. It's so that those of you who are believing, obeying, and loving would know for certain that you are born of God and have eternal life. And you just need to know that. You know what else you need to know? You need to know he hears your voice. Now we're back at verse 14. And in particular, this is he. Verse 14, when he talks about prayer, I don't believe this is just, you know, I suppose you could go to these verses if you want to do some study on prayer. But you've got to get these two verses in the context. He's speaking to people about prayer who've lost their confidence in prayer. And I'm here to tell you, says the father to the child, in the middle of the night, when you feel stupid, and you feel weak and small, And you maybe even feel afraid. You need to know in that night, he hears your voice. And he answers your prayer. And he is committed to collaborating with you in the living of your life. No, he's not a gumball dispenser. But our God is absolutely committed to people who believe him. And he is totally into people who love him and desire to obey him. And he is really interested in people who are desiring to do those kinds of things when the lights have gone out and the shade has been drawn. And it's hard to hear his voice. It's hard to see his face. But keep on believing and keep on obeying and keep on living, loving, even. Says John. Come to verse 16. It's an odd verse. When I first looked at it, it looked like it was just out of sync. Like, why is it here? I'll read it to you. I don't think we have it on the screen. But it says this. If anyone sees his brother committing his sin not leading to death, he shall ask God. See, I think this verse just continues. It's an illustration of prayer. Well, ask God. And if you ask God, God will give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is, however, sin leading to death. I do not say that you should make requests for this. He doesn't say not to pray. He just says, I'm not giving you a big instruction to get all excited about praying for people who are doing the sin unto death. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death. What's that about? Well, I'll tell you this. You could spend a long time in the commentaries, pages and pages and pages of all the different theories of what this means. And I remember I was on a plane coming home from our vacation, and I figured this is, like, weird to me, so I thought I'd read the commentaries. Anyway. Oh. Lord, what is this about? Keep it in the story, Dave. Keep it in the context. Keep it in the flow of the story. What is the story? What is John talking about? Who is he confronting and who is he encouraging? And all of a sudden it dawned on me, I think while there's some naughty things here, it's really pretty simple. I think the sin that's leading unto death is the sin of the Gnostics, the people he's confronting. It's the sin of the docetists. And what their sin was, it wasn't like there's this one sin you can do and if you do it, you're done. No, no, no, no. It's more of a spirit. And the spirit of the Gnostics that is the sin leading to death is this. They had decided that Jesus isn't God. They weren't struggling with that. Pray for that guy. They had embraced sin. Obedience doesn't matter. I'll write my own law. I'll do it my own way. And they had embraced sin. Remember when we, in James chapter 4, talked about spiritual adultery. And I made a distinction at that time that I thought was very important. It really helped me to kind of get this. There are people who struggle with sin. They don't want to sin. They're Roman 7 people. That which I would not, that do I do. The thing I want to do, I don't do. The thing I don't want to do, I do do. But they're a believer. Here's the word. You pray for that guy. You invest your life in that guy. You be involved in that guy. But there are other people. and they're not struggling with sin. They're not struggling with their love for God and wanting more. They have decided. It's a bunch of baloney. They've decided. And as far as sin, they've embraced their sin. They've married their sin. And what he's saying to these people is this. The people to whom John's writing is this. You guys are being all intimidated by these people who've decided Jesus isn't God and don't give a rip about obedience. And you're letting them have power in your life. And you're spending all sorts of energy trying to take their grip and release it so they will live for God. They're not going to live for God. They've already decided. But there are all sorts of people, brothers of yours and sisters of yours, who are struggling with sin, and they're right on the edge. And I want you to spend your energy there. And I'm here to tell you, you begin to pray for them, says God, says John. You spend your energy. Quit worrying about what the docetists and the Gnostics think about you. By the way, this does not mean don't pray for unbelievers. He's addressing a particular problem. These people were being intimidated by them. Do not spend all your energy trying to convince people who have embraced a lie that there are all sorts of people who are more in it than you, who are struggling, who need you to come alongside. You know what it is? That's a community verse. That's a community verse. And here's the real encouragement, practical reality of this verse that on the surface looks obscure. It's a wonderful encouragement to those of you who've lost your confidence. Here's how it works. Verse 16, here's how it works. That even if you have lost your confidence, to be much help, to do much good to that brother or sister who's struggling right now. Maybe if you're a physical father or a mother, you're struggling with your own son or your own daughter, and you're right on the edge, and you're feeling kind of weak, and you're feeling kind of feeble, and it doesn't feel like you have much wisdom, and it doesn't feel like you have any influence. I'm here to tell you, says John, that middle of the night, weak-feeling, stupid-sounding prayer, I'm here to tell you that that prayer has the power to give your struggling brother, sister, son, daughter, friend, life. The upshot of verse 16 from John the Father to us today is this. It matters that you pray. He hears you when you pray. He answers when you pray. It matters that you pray. So keep on praying even if you're praying in the dark. Keep on believing and keep on loving and keep on obeying. Why? Because this is what we know. Now verse 19. We just pull it together here and close it. Verse 19. The flurry of we knows continues because this is what we know. We know that we are of God. And even though the whole world lies in the power of the evil one, we belong to him. And I'll tell you what, you need to know that when the lights are out and the shade is drawn. We know, verse 20, that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding in order that we might know him who is true and that we are in him who is true. Even Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and this is what you know. This is what I'm not telling you anything you don't know. We know this, that this Jesus is the true God and the eternal life. So here's the word, son, daughter. Keep on believing and keep on obeying and keep on loving and keep on praying and keep on serving because we know him who is from the beginning. And among the things we know about him is this, that he has set his love on us. And because he loves us, we love him. And because we love him, we obey him. And the reason we obey him is because we believe that the Son of God has come. And that he is the true God and the eternal life. These things I have written to you who believe that you may know. So keep on believing. And keep on obeying. And keep on loving. Thus saith the Lord. Let's pray. Father, our Father, my Father, thank you for reminding us of things we already know. Thank you for bringing us into the living room today and sitting us down and reminding us of who you are and reminding us of who we are in you. And thank you, Father, that you are doing a great work among us here. For you are calling us to be a people who even in the dark when the shade is drawn and we can't see your voice and we can't see your face and we can't hear your voice, that we are a people who are believing and we are obeying and we are loving and out of that we are learning to live a different way and we are knowing that we belong to you and we are growing in confidence that you hear our voice and answer our prayer and that it matters that you pray and that you partner with us in the living of our lives we thank you for these truths bring fruit from this word by your spirit in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen. Amen.
