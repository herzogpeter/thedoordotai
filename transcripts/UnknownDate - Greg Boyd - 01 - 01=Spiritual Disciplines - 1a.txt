Lord, there are so many things that in this life pull at us, that vie for our attention and vie for our affection, desire to hook us and to lord over us, and we, every day, let those things in. Not usually consciously, Lord, but we let them in, and so we are pulled in many directions. You've told us that the double-minded person is going to be unstable in all their ways. And a lot of times, Lord, our lives are unstable. They're fragmented because we're double-minded. Our affections are dual. Our allegiances are dual. And we're given to many things in this world. I pray, Lord, that you'd help us even now as we're beginning this course and then throughout this course to learn above all else what it is to be centered on you and to will more than anything else one thing and to love one thing and that is you and our relationship with you. Teach us, Lord, tonight and throughout this course what it is to be wholly devoted to you, to be sold out to you, to make you the Lord of our life, every area of our life, and to put flesh and reality to those words that you are our Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore we live in service to you. Teach us what that means, Lord. Help us to experience that and to be transformed by that. Help us to be centered, Lord. Lord, I thank you for the people that are here tonight that have a hunger and thirst after you, Lord. They wouldn't be here otherwise. I thank you, Lord, because you're the one who put that hunger and thirst in their hearts as you put this hunger and thirst in my life, Lord. And I pray that you'd fan that and cause it to flame up, Lord. Cause it to be on fire. Cause us to hunger after you, to be desperate for you, Lord, because we are desperate for you. We can't make it without you. You are our life. Help us to experience the reality that we're nothing without you. Help us to be desperately panting after you, Lord. And help us, Lord God, with that desperation to be willing to do whatever it takes to draw closer to you and to be filled with you and to have our lives transformed by you, Lord. And let this course be a means by which that happens. I pray, Lord, that you'd give us your Holy Spirit in every class, starting now, Lord. Impart your Holy Spirit upon us, Lord. That what I would say, Lord, wouldn't be through my carnal mind and through the flesh, Lord, but that it would be endowed with your Spirit and that it would be anointed. I pray, Lord God, that with your spirit of truth here, that we could be honest with one another and we could share with one another and grow by giving insights to one another. We are just fellow journeyers, Lord God. We're feeling our way forward here. Help us to help each other, Lord, in that journeying process. God, I pray that you protect us, protect the words that go out of my mouth and protect our ears as the words go into our ears from anything that would be wounding, from anything that would be shaming, that would be destructive, because the enemy can take truth and turn it into a building club, as he's done in many of our lives. Protect us from that. Protect us from the enemy who has a very deep vested interest in seeing that growth does not happen, a deep invested interest in making sure that we stay in an incapacitated state and therefore hates this class and hates everything that goes on here and hates the truth that is spoken and hates the growth that will occur here. And Lord, we need you to protect us from that force, from that influence that would be trying to disrupt our lives and intimidate us and steer us away from the truth into error or just into apathy. Be with us, God, during this time. We pray in your name. Amen. Amen. Well, my name is Greg Boyd. I'm going to be leading this course, the spiritual disciplines. I'm a professor of theology. I teach theology, so I have to have a syllabus. I can't do anything without a syllabus, so I have a syllabus. But before I hand out the syllabus, what I'd like to do tonight is simply give a little introduction to the course, hand out the syllabus, go through the syllabus a little bit, and then give an introduction to the spiritual disciplines. That's really all I have outlined for tonight. The idea for this course actually began about a year ago. It was in the back of my mind for quite some time, actually, talking with people from the open door and feeling the need for a course like this. But in my own life, there was a growing sense all throughout last year that I was kind of in a rut. You felt like that, haven't you? We just sort of get in a rut. And, you know, things are okay. Things are nice. nothing terrible is going on. You're praying as usual. You're getting blessed at the services. But it's like nothing's changing. You're not really growing. You're just sort of stagnating. You're just going on. I was feeling like that. And I really wanted to shift gears. I just wanted to get turbocharged. I wanted more reality. I don't know if you've ever sensed it, but you just want more of the reality, more of the stuff that the New Testament talks about that can be given to the believer, the empowering of the Holy Spirit. And I wanted more of that. I wanted more freedom in my life, freedom from a lot of stuff that was holding me bondage. I'm getting tired of some of the old hang-ups that I had, tired of the old thought patterns that I had. And I was just feeling like I was stagnating. So I hit upon the idea that I wanted to take a look at all the different people throughout church history that have worried about this sort of thing. And I wanted to see what they had done to encounter God and what they had done to grow in the spiritual life. Because I had kind of done everything that I knew how to do, and I had kind of depleted all my resources, and I still sensed that I was the same. And so I wanted to have a time where I just took a block of my life and looked at church history and examined the ways in which they grew and the ways in which they prayed and the ways in which they just met the Lord and experienced the reality of God. I wanted to look at their techniques. In science, you wouldn't think about doing science without looking at the history or the tradition of science because you don't reinvent the wheel. You look at what other people have done to get to where you are right now and you imitate that, and then you progress beyond that. Well, it's the same thing, I think, in theology or in growing with the Lord. We really are missing the boat if we try to do our own spirituality in a vacuum, as though Christianity began a year ago. There's 2,000 years of this thing, and there's been some wonderful godly people who have spent their lives related to the Lord and struggling to relate to the Lord more intensely, more genuinely, more transformingly. And it would really be remiss of us not to look at how they did it and to think that maybe they have something to teach us. Sometimes in Protestant circles, there's sort of a prejudice against Catholicism because the history of the church has been mainly Catholic. And that has sort of blocked off us to that rich, very rich spiritual tradition there. And that's really unfortunate because there's an incredible wealth, not only in the Catholic Church but in the Eastern Orthodox Church and in the early Protestant Church that we can learn from. So I decided, as a way of examining this, to teach a course on it. Because I didn't know much about it, so I decided to teach a course on it. In fact, I decided to teach a senior seminar course. And what we did is we had 14 students, and we just plowed into the great spiritual leaders of the Christian church. And we looked at their writings, and we examined the way that they went about knowing God, the way they went about being transformed in their life, what they thought about things, and we tried to apply them. We'd take their spiritual exercises and we'd just say, well, let's try it. And sometimes it would work and sometimes it wouldn't work. But that's what it was really all about. This course is a spinoff of that course. It's going to be sort of an abbreviation of that course. My main goal here is to simply take some of the things I've learned through scripture, through church tradition and church history, and then through my own experience and kind of share that with you. And then to try it, to try some of these things. Let's see how it works. And then to have, it's very much like you do in science. You learn how to experiment with certain things. You experiment with certain things. You come back and you give a report. Did it work? Didn't it work? Well, if it didn't work, why didn't it work? Maybe we should try this. And you kind of feel your way forward. Well, I think growth in the spiritual life isn't too unlike that at all. We're feeling our way forward. So not everything that we're going to deal with here is going to work. Hopefully some of it will work though. And some will work for some people and other things are going to work for other people. But we're just going to kind of share this and see if we can't grow through it. So having said that, I'd like to hand out this syllabus, syllabi. Here, let's just go like this. I'm going to pass them out. I'm going to start going through it even before it gets all the way back there, not to be inconsiderate, but just to save time. But I just want to read through some of this, just so we can have an understanding of what we're trying to get at here. There are three objectives of the course. Am I addicted to college teaching or what? Three objectives. It really helps to have a focus on what you want to do. The first objective of the course is simply to provide information. To provide information on the nature and the techniques of spiritual disciplines. and to do so as they've been taught and practiced in scripture and throughout church history. So what are my jobs? Here's what my job is. It's to impart information. Just to say, here's what was taught, here's what they meant by what it's taught, here's why they thought this way, and just to do that. That, I think, in itself will be helpful. But that's our first objective, just to kind of expand us to see what other people have thought about spiritual discipline. The second objective is to begin practicing some of these spiritual exercises and hopefully to experience some of the benefits of these exercises. A lot of times we can be sort of addicted to cognitive learning, where we just like to learn the facts and to digest the facts and to get it in our little cerebrum and to stop there. In fact, I think evangelicals are far too cerebral. We like Bible studies a lot because they don't require anything of us existentially. By that I mean from the heart. They don't require any sort of alteration or commitment or discipline in our life. If all you get out of the Course is a cerebral knowledge about what certain people have thought about certain techniques, then the Course has really been wasted. Well, that's valuable information. Maybe it's not totally wasted. But the purpose of the information, and this is true of everything that's revealed in Scripture, the purpose of the information is to evoke a transformation. Information without transformation is really quite useless. So we're going to try to practice some of these things. Now, just from the logistics of things here, we're not going to be able to do a whole lot of that in class time. But I'm really going to encourage you to be practicing some of these things on your own. And then when we come together, I would like to have a time where we just sort of get feedback. Did it work? Did it help you? And things of that sort. The goal is to practice it, and then in practicing it, to experience some of the benefits from it. to begin to change. And hopefully, to begin to establish the habit of spiritual disciplines. This is a six week course, and I really hope that whatever you get out of this course doesn't end in six weeks. But to begin to establish a habit of spiritual disciplines, some of the things we're going to be talking about. The third thing is to gain insights by sharing with each other our experiences with the spiritual exercises. I hope to learn something from the Course by hearing from you what works, what doesn't work, what are some of the obstacles and problems you confront and things of that sort. Or I hope to learn from you maybe something that you do, something that you found in your own devotional life that really clicks and maybe I've never thought of that. Maybe other people haven't thought of it. None of us has a corner on this market. And so we have a lot to learn from one another. I've benefited a lot just by finding out how other people pray. In fact, a lot of times I ask people, I thought about doing that tonight, but I forgot because I was so scattered because I didn't realize I was late. But I was going to ask some people, what were you thinking about when we prayed? What were you thinking about when I was praying up here? What were you thinking of? Were you picturing anything in your mind? We don't ask those kind of questions very much. What goes on in the mind of a person when they pray? But if you start asking that kind of question and begin to examine it, you'll find, here's kind of what I found, is that some people really get into prayer more than other people, and there's a pattern that develops. The people that get into prayer have different things going on in their head than people who don't get into prayer, and they think differently about things. We really do well if we open up the discussion to find out how do other people do spiritual stuff. What do you think about when you pray? What do you think about when you sing? When you read the Bible, how does it work for you? What were you doing when you really got blessed that one time? And maybe there's something there that we can kind of generalize and that we can apply to our own Bible studies so that we can be blessed more by it. You see, again, we're feeling our way forward in this whole thing. So I'm hoping to really get some things from you guys as to what works in your life and what doesn't. Here are the requirements. See, they're not requirements because I can't test you. So the requests. I just have no leverage when I teach at the open door. It's true. I've got to rely on your good intentions. Throughout history and in some quarters today, spiritual discipline has been understood to require the role of a spiritual director or a mentor or a discipler to whom one is accountable. That's not a bad idea, but I don't think we're ready for it yet. The idea here is this. Maybe some of you have gone on retreats like this, where you have a spiritual mentor, and they really are an authority over your life for a given period of time, where they ask you questions like, and this will sound shaming to you, but there's some value here. What went on in your prayer life today? How long was it? Did you have a good conversation with the Lord? Or when you were fasting, what benefits did you receive? And they're really interested for your own good. They're interested in your life, and you're accountable to them. Accountability is not a bad thing. It's really a good thing. If you're the one who decides that you want to be accountable to someone else. If you find yourself enslaved to somebody that you don't want to be enslaved to, if you find yourself having to answer to people that don't have your best interests in mind, and you didn't choose it, that can be a very damaging thing, and you should never get involved in that sort of thing. But if you say, look, here's a person, here's a person who has done this before. In the monasteries, they call this the abbot. The abbot of the monastery was a person who was understood to really have been advanced in the Christian life. And you put yourself under their authority for your own spiritual growth, and you were accountable to them. Now, we're not ready for it, and frankly, I'm not ready for it because I'm not an abbot. But to a certain extent, some of that is kind of good. And therefore, I would request, request that you attend class attend each of the classes and as much as possible carry out the assignments that are going to be given there'll just be some brief assignments here on spiritual exercises and stuff it's an active discipline to do that and you have every right not to do that and feel free not to do that but if you want to grow and being disciplined i encourage you to do it to just make a commitment here it's discipline i'm going to be at the class I'm going to invest in the class and I'm going to try to carry out the requirements of the class. It's a good thing to do. It won't hurt you a bit. Number two, you will only get as much out of this class as you put into it, guaranteed. So I encourage you to practice the exercises that are discussed in class. Assignments, or maybe we should call them projects or opportunities for growth, are going to be given in each class period. Okay, and I really encourage you to carry those out. I also encourage you, this isn't on the syllabus, but I encourage you to take notes because a lot of this you'll forget. And it will really be good if, you know, three months down the road, you look at the notes and you think, oh yeah, I haven't been doing this exercise lately. I think I'll try it. Sometimes something won't work for you at one period in your life and it will work for you at a different period in your life. So it's good to keep a record of it. The third thing is this. If you're not doing so already, I'd ask you to begin to keep a spiritual journal. All of the spiritual giants throughout church history, that's too general, not all of them, but a lot of them, have stressed the value of journaling, of keeping a journal. Again, there's a parallel with the scientific community. When you do experiments, you record it to remember what works and what didn't work. If you're training for running, you do this. You keep a journal of your running so you can look back and see patterns. okay, this worked, this didn't work. And it kind of keeps you steered on course and it keeps you from repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Journaling is a really good thing. Plus it helps you to articulate what you're feeling, what you're thinking. In itself is a spiritual exercise. And I encourage you to do that. Just record some of your thoughts. What happened during prayer this time? What was going on in your life today? Begin to, what it does is when you objectify this sort of thing, the thoughts and the feelings that you have and you put it on paper, You give more reality to it. And what happens when you journal is that the spiritual dimension of your life begins to take on more reality. It's not just sort of some ethereal thing that you hit upon once in a while on a Sunday morning or whatever, but it's an ongoing aspect of your life. And so I would, if I were you, I'd encourage you to keep a journal in which you're going to write something about your spiritual stuff every day. This isn't a diary, okay? Diaries will record, you know, I've never kept a diary, but my daughter does, and I read it. No, I'm kidding. But she says, there she just kind of records what happened to her on that day and things like that and kind of this ordinary, everyday stuff. This is more for the spiritual aspect of your life. Now, that will maybe impact everything else about your life. So you may end up writing about what happened when you were at the gas station getting your car fixed. But the purpose of it is to keep an ongoing journal of your spiritual growth. Let me say another word about that. The mentality in which we need to approach spiritual disciplines is that our life is a project. Our life is a project. And a project requires intentionality. If you embark on a project, you say, okay, here's something I want to do. Here's something I want to achieve. And here's how I'm going to achieve it. You have a project. and then you set upon different ways to try to attain the goals of your project. And you have long-range goals and you have short-range goals and you keep track of that. Our life is a project. It is our project. Kierkegaard said it like this. The whole goal of life, I love this quote, the whole goal of life, this is the project of human existence, is to see how close it is. for how then again the goal of life I'm going to give you a paraphrase because I can't remember the exact wording but the goal of life is to see how close is it possible for a human being to get to God how close is it possible for a human being to get to God and to wake up in the morning and to make that your project how much of God can I experience today and to make that your sensual intentionality this is my project how close is it possible to get to God today and to begin to get a picture of what you want to be like a year from now we normally don't do this we normally are very haphazard about our lives okay sera sera you know we just kind of go about things i am what i am i shall always be what i am and just sort of leave it at that and that is the surest way to guarantee that that no growth is really going to occur because growth doesn't occur without intentionality not in this fallen world where there's a constant pull on us downward. We need to become very intentional about things, to make our life a project, an experiment. How close is it possible for a human being to get to God? And now to begin to do everything possible that we can do to achieve that end. Get up in the morning and to just remember that. Write it out in the refrigerator. So it's always in your face. And you'll forget it a lot during the day, but then come back to it. Oh yeah, I forgot what my life is about. I'm supposed to be trying to see how close it is to be, well, you know that quote. Okay, here's the outline. I didn't put any dates on this because I'm terrible at it. I didn't have any time schedule here. So I just have an order in which I like to investigate these disciplines, but I don't have a particular agenda as to the rate at which we're going to tackle them. But I think we can get through most of them in six weeks. Today is the introduction. Why is discipline necessary? And what kind of discipline is good? Then we're going to go into the disciplines of. What these are. Here's what these are. I looked over the course and over the studies that we had done, and I sort of extrapolated from there. Foundation-- I packaged it differently. You won't find any other person in history that packaged them just like this. But I extrapolated it from them, some central disciplines. And I used other contemporary resources as helps in doing this. And then kind of just parroted it down. So that's what we'll be discussing and trying throughout this class. The first one I want to get at will be fasting. It's fun to starve. I don't know why I came up with these cutesy titles, but that's what I did. Okay, and we'll be talking about that probably starting next week. The reason I did that up front, not because there's no sense of priority here or one's more important than the other. The one reason why I put that up front was because I think I'd like to at least open up the invitation for people who would like to begin to do this to choose Wednesdays as a day of fasting. And so we can all come to class on Wednesday nights starving. Yeah, we have a bunch of growly stomachs. I'll talk more about that later on. Second one is the discipline of honesty. I put that up front, too, because I'd like us to be really in on that and sharing honestly with what's going on in our journaling, telling the truth when a lie will work better. Then I want to talk about certain kinds of prayer, centering prayer. How do I stop thinking about shopping? There's a great wealth in the Christian tradition that has really come to terms with how to get our minds to slow down, which is one of the main problems we have when we pray. You know how it is. You start praying, and you get about five minutes, and it just goes, and now I'm thinking about going out to visit my mother-in-law next weekend or whatever. Our minds get so scattered. Then we come back, and we try to pray a little bit, and sometimes you can go like 15 minutes and not realize that you're doing this. I'll say, oh, yeah, I'm supposed to be praying. There are ways that we can begin to center our minds, begin to focus in. How do we become focused in prayer? So we're going to talk about some centering prayers. We'll talk about resting in Christ. This is one that we're not going to go too in-depth on because I dealt a lot with that this summer, and I don't want to presuppose that all of you heard that this summer, but it would be a review for a lot of you. But we'll talk about ways of resting in Christ, different ways in which we can have the discipline of just getting life from Christ, getting our source from Christ. That really is the foundation for all of these disciplines, as we're going to be seeing shortly. We'll talk about healing from memories. And again, that will be a review for a lot of you. But I want to look at ways in which we can, in a real practical way here, benefit by being freed from the past. And not living our lives, as we so frequently do, living our lives as an extension of things that were done to us a long time ago. We're simply a footnote to what was done to us. Our lives are forever the echo of a child's scream. And they don't need to be. We don't need to live our lives in tyranny to somebody in the past or to an event in the past. And there's ways of being freed from that. And even if it wasn't a trauma that occurred in the past, maybe it was just some kind of self-damaging message that you got in the past. Well, ways to be freed from that. And we're going to talk very practically how in prayer, what can we do? This is very much a hands-on sort of thing. What can we do to begin to be freed from that? We'll talk about thought control. Church history has had a lot to do with that because everyone in church history has had problems with that. What do you begin to do about your thoughts, those ungodly thoughts, the carnal thoughts, the worldly thoughts? How can we begin to get a handle on those things? In fact, until you're disciplined about your thought life, being disciplined about your behavior is not really going to do a whole lot of good because your behavior is simply an outgrowth of your thought life. As you think in your heart, the Bible says, so are you. And so what's really important is to begin to get to the root of the problem, which is our thought life. I don't know if it's possible to ever get total control over your thought life. I haven't gotten there yet, but to begin to be intentional about that, to see how much is it possible to do 2 Corinthians 10.5, to bring every thought into captivity into Jesus Christ. That's a good project to have. I want to know how much mastery can Christ have over my life today, and then tomorrow, and then throughout my life. The more that happens, the more it affects my behavior. Breaking nasty habits. We're going to talk a little bit about that. Cigarettes are not, my Lord. I don't mean to pick on smokers, but it's sort of the standard thing here. It's even politically correct now to come down on smoking. But we're going to talk about other nasty habits, too. Patterns of living, and that includes patterns of thought. How do you begin to break those things? They're so inground in us. you know, I'm 35 now. Man, I've had 35 years to develop ruts, and I've got some deep ones. Well, how do you begin to break those sorts of things? Is it possible? The discipline of spiritual warfare, or intercessory prayer, or supplication is sometimes called how to fight and win. How do you even begin to make that a reality in your life? Where it's something that's an ongoing aspect of your life. Again, we are very often like people in a battle that are blind and deaf to the bombs going off around us and the bullets flying past us. we're oblivious to that because we're not intentional about it. But this is an area, if you become intentional about it and begin to be disciplined about it, okay, and there's things you can do to make that happen, it's like all of a sudden the screen is pulled back and you begin to see things you never saw before. In fact, since God is desperate for warriors, you're going to find yourself being used. The screen will be pulled back, you begin to see things around you, and you begin to be used in this capacity. And I don't know if there's anything that can make your Christianity come alive than fighting a demon. It gets real then. I'm not talking about a pitchfork thing or something like that, but just confronting spiritual warfare. Man, you get energized. In fact, I'm beginning to see a pattern. Again, this is kind of like science. I'm plodding forward. I'm beginning to look back, look at the research, look at the journaling, and I'm seeing a pattern. That is that it seems like a person's, this is true of my life and as I investigate others, it's true of their lives too, that the spiritual dynamism that you have, the spiritual empowerment you have will be directly proportionate to the evil you're confronting. It's like there's a spiritual law going on. Maybe there is a spiritual law going on, and I'm just beginning to find it out, but that you only are as spiritually dynamic as is necessary. It's sort of a law of spiritual minimalism, that you'll never be endowed more than what you need. So if you want to be endowed with a lot of power, dive into hell. And then God's got to come through, or you're a lost cause. That's the way to do it. But I don't think if you're on a vacation resort, two things are going to happen. If you're on a vacation resort, and you're not in the trenches, but you're back sipping a martini somewhere on a beach, first of all, the devil's not interested in you because you're not doing any damage. Secondly, God's got no reason to spend a lot of time equipping you because you're not fighting. It's when you get in the trenches that the devil gets interested in you, and that's when God gets interested in you as a warrior because now he's got to equip you so you can defend yourself. If you want to learn how to fly, jump off a cliff. We're going to talk about Bible devotions. How not to fall asleep reading scripture. And this is a really important one. You know, a lot of us struggle with just boredom when we read the Bible. You know, can we be real with that? It's real boring. You read the Bible, it's kind of like, okay. And you do it because you're supposed to do it, you know, for a while. Then you quit doing it. But you just get bored with it. Or maybe just all it does is raise questions. You read a bunch of stuff. And this has happened to a lot of people. You read stuff, and it's like you can't figure it out. And to the degree that you can't figure it out, it doesn't sound right. So you give it up. You give up, and you just hope that there's somebody out there who knows what it means, and they can explain it when they get around to preaching on it. And this also has a negative aspect of the Christian tradition. It's kind of like, don't read the Bible for yourself because you'll get confused. The Catholic Church used to teach that. Don't read the Bible for yourself. It'll just screw you up. That's why we got priests. They'll tell you what it means. Now, what's interesting with Protestants, you know, Bible for every person, read it on your own, the Holy Spirit will lead you. We have this long tradition, but a lot of us do the same thing. You know, the wizard will know, the wizard will know, and we run to Dave. He'll explain it. It doesn't sound graceful, but I'm sure there's a graceful interpretation. So I want to know how can we begin to read the Bible in such a way that it really begins to minister to us. Again, Soren Kierkegaard is a great devotional writer. He talks about scripture coming alive when you can read it as a personal love letter from God to you. See, there's different ways of reading. You read the newspaper one way, you read a textbook another way, and you read the Bible a different way. And the trouble happens when a lot of times we read the Bible like we read everything else. And then it just sounds like everything else. But there's a way of reading the Bible such that it really can come alive. The Jesuits really got in on this. St. Ignatius of Loyola, boy, he really knew how to make the Scripture come alive. And he trained the Jesuits in doing that. And so we're going to try to recapture some of their stuff and say how can the Bible come alive to us. Then there's Bible study, which is different than Bible devotion. Bible study, where here the intentionality is, how can I learn more about what God's revealed to me, what God's revealed to humankind. And there's ways that you can study the Bible. And that's a very important discipline to be about. Learning on your own. What you learn on your own is far more precious than what someone tells you. And so, not that what someone tells you is bad, but it's good to learn on your own, to begin to develop the habit of studying the Bible systematically on your own. Okay, a couple other disciplines that maybe are going to sound a little peculiar to some of you. Solitude. It's one of the chief disciplines that you find talked about throughout church history. The value of being alone, of going off by yourself. I know, I got three kids, and I know that, you know, I define solitude as sitting at a certain place in a room by myself for 10 minutes a day. That's like peace and quiet. Some of you picked up on that reference, others of you didn't. But it's hard to get solitude. But there's a real need for that. Retreats are, I got it! He's talking about a toilet. it. There's a need for some solitude. So much of our life, when we're constantly interacting with other people, we become like little mirrors of other people. We don't think about anything except in terms of our PR, a public relations department. And we become completely objectified. We don't have an inner life at all, an internal life at all. There's really a need for some times of solitude, preferably once a day, but even throughout maybe in a year to find a time where you can go off on your own for a day or two. And you think, "Oh, that would be impossible to do." But there's ways of doing it if it's important enough to you. And boy, those times are... Some of my most profound times with God, I used to do this. I used to go out once a year for three weeks out to Montana, and all by myself, and now I think about it, it was a little dangerous, but I'd go out in the mountains and I'd get lost. I'd purposely get lost. I'd go where there weren't any trails or anything, just north of Yellowstone Park. And I'd purposely get lost and try to find my way out. And I had three weeks to do it, and I had enough food and stuff on it. And now I think about it, I was really crazy and irresponsible. But I was 20, and you're allowed to do that. I didn't have a flare gun or a pistol or anything, and there was bears all over the place. But I had a lot of interesting stories about that. But, man, I'd go out there, and I'd have a Bible, and I'd have a copy of Soren Kierkegaard's book, Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing. And I just spend the whole time with that. And oh man, for the first three days, I was in withdrawal. People withdraw. I was bored. I was lonely. I just, you know, you go through anxiety, but then you hit a level where it's like such peace. This is incredible. So solitude. Silence is another one. The discipline of silence. These aren't things you normally think about. But they're there throughout church history. The discipline of maintaining silence. Why is it that we are so awkward around one another when there's nothing to say? you know you get with one another and all of a sudden you ever have this happen this morning I'm going into Bethel and there's another person going into Bethel that I don't know and all of a sudden I see we're going to enter into the parking you know the right way at the same time okay what are we talking about well there's things we can talk about you know what's wrong with walking together alone in silence but it's like we got to say something we use language as a crutch just to jabber I think it's because we're silence is an indictment on us about how how empty our lives are and we're afraid of we always want to look full and we don't want to talk about our lives must be empty and so we talk see what an idol that is and and every idol sucks life and to be free from that idol you know that you didn't even know you had man it can be wonderful I've done this before I go into class and I just sit there in silence and stare at them and it's excruciating for me but it's excruciating for them too. Say something! Silence. I like to practice it in the class sometimes. What's really good, and it is an exercise that we developed in this class I taught at Bethel, is to have silence where you look at somebody in the eye and you say nothing. And for five minutes, stare at them. You're smashing idols left and right when you do that. You really are, because everyone in your body is saying, we should talk. And Then you develop nonverbal communication. Like, smile, you know. But to abstain from all that and just to look, to be okay being, to be okay being. Frugality. Talking about money and how we live. Simplicity of life has always been a chief attribute. That's partly why they had monasteries. To live as simply as possible. Read 1 Corinthians 7. That's what that's all about. Because to the degree that your life isn't simple, it's complex this is getting profound and to the degree it's complex you've got to think about different things you've got to be distracted but to live simply to live modestly I want you to know something here on these disciplines that I'm talking about I hope you're not even thinking what does he do all this? that's not fair I'm giving you information you're not an example I'm forever trying to get this to happen this is i find that'd be the hardest one i i frugality man it's really tough and i long for it can't you just get life simple you know how can you live more simply do we need all this extra stuff but we're going to talk about that how do they live financially responsible finally love and joy and love and joy become disciplines when they don't come natural in fact discipline always comes in when the natural runs out when things when things are natural to you you don't need discipline but discipline happens discipline is required when doing things naturally just doesn't cut it now you've got to be intentional about it well how can we grow in love in such a way that how can you be intentional about love without faking like you love when you don't love that's a really good question or how can you be intentional about being joyful and not fake like you're being joyful when you're not I think there's ways of doing it finally in the syllabus what I've given you is an annotated bibliography a couple of the books that I've read that I've really liked a lot. I gave you a little description of them. Let me just point out a couple of them here, okay, for those of you who want to do some reading on this. Make this class a project, and on your own, investigate as much as you can. Richard Foster's book, Celebrating Discipline, the first one there. It's a first-rate comprehensive book on the nature of and need for spiritual discipline. It is the classic, the modern classic. It's a very, very good book. I recommend it wholeheartedly. We're going to make that a required text, but I think they want like 15 bucks for it or something. And since none of us are frugal, we couldn't afford it. Only kidding. This is a joke. Jones' book, The Study of Spirituality, that's kind of an academic book, but that's one I used as a text in my course. And it's a good summary of what the major church spiritual fathers and mothers thought. Morton Kelsey's book, The Other Side of Silence. This is an excellent guide to Christian meditation. It really is a splendid book. Kind of heavy reading, and, you need to know, kind of heavily stooped in Jungian psychology. But in spite of that, it's a very, very good book. In fact, in some ways, because of that, because I don't think Carl Jung was totally off the wall. He had some insights on a lot of stuff. That's a book worth reading. Especially the last part of it is really good. Yeah? I'm dying to know what Jungian is like. Oh, yes. Carl Jung, J-U-N-G it's not Jung but Carl Jung at least that's how I was taught to pronounce it he was a psychologist he was a disciple of Freud for a while and broke off of Freud and got into a lot of strange stuff and some of it was good and a lot of it wasn't but he thought that the main driven force in the human life isn't our need to express sexuality, which Freud thought. And everything about us, from our laughter to everything else, is a result of repressing our sex drives. Freud was a pervert. Carl Jung, he was, and all he did, he just studied sexually dysfunctional people, and he based his theory of humanity on these sexually dysfunctional people. What do you expect? When do you get that? So Freud thought everything was sexual. Carl Jung broke off from that, and he thought the main need in humanity was spiritual, and that people are craving spiritual fulfillment. And then he developed really elaborate theories about this whole thing. A collective unconscious where he thought there was a universal mind, which has all these religious archetypes and stuff in it. It gets really kind of weird. But even on that, there's some good stuff. What's happened is that in the last two decades, the New Age movement has recruited Jung as sort of their guru. And so he's become totally discredited among evangelicals. Hi. Because of that association. And I think it's unfortunate. Some of his stuff is like New Ages, pantheistic kind of stuff. But other things are really valuable. Kelsey is a very good Christian writer, a believer. I know the man. But he finds a lot of credence in Carl Jung's thought, more than you need to, to benefit from this book. He also wrote a couple of books on speaking in tongues and other things. He's an Episcopalian priest who takes spirituality really seriously. It's really nice. Needham. David Needham's book, Birthright, is the classic work on Christian self-identity in Christ. And I put down here, it's required reading before you read Willard's book, for reasons I'll get to shortly. But it's a very good book on knowing who you are in Christ. Excellent book. Henry Nowen, he's a person I studied under. He taught at Yale Divinity School. He's got several books. All of them are worth reading. One is called The Genesee Diary. Another one is called The Wounded Healer. One book, it's very interesting, it's called Worshipping with the Icon that I found when I was on a retreat, a retreat of silence. And they had this book there. I didn't know he wrote this book, but I kind of perused it while I was there, and it was really, really good. And very unprosted, so you need to know that. But we're going to talk about icons a little bit later on in this course. Finally, The Desert Fathers. Really good works on spirituality. David Willard's book, finally, is the newest one out. I think it's 1990, called The Spirit of the Disciplines. This is also a text that I used in my course at Bethel. It's excellent on why discipline is necessary. It's superb on the biblical and theological foundations for discipline. He's got a really profound, I think, analysis of Paul's understanding of the reason why we're physical, the importance of physical existence, and the importance of bringing physical existence in control or under control. He's weak on the nature of healthy motivation for graceful living. If you read this and you haven't read Needham's book or for other reasons you're not really secure in who you are in Christ, you'll probably come away from this thinking that you need to do a whole lot of things to stay saved. And that's an unfortunate aspect of the book. It's more the way he words things than what he really believes, but that aside, it's a very good book. The selected classic authors on Christian spirituality, I'm just going to leave that here. I'm just giving this to you so that if you want to go to the library and look up some of these people, you can do that. What I did is I chose here some of the giants as authors in Christian spirituality, and I tried to give a representation of different sorts of authors who emphasize different things. So some of these names are going to be coming up a little but later on. And you might want to know them. The book by Soren Kierkegaard that I took for two years out to Montana was The Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing. The Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing. Soren Kierkegaard. No blackboard! How will I live? Oh, there we go. Can't get my cord here. He spelled his name K-I-E-R-K-E-G-A-A-R-D. And in Danish it's Kerkrgar. Soren Kerkrgar. I was intoxicated with this man for about two years in my college education. I just read everything he ever wrote. He's really, I disagree with him more than any philosopher in church history, I think. But when he's right, he's really right. And I define what is right. But he also has a series of, like, he calls them edifying discourses that are really good, where he just writes on spiritual themes. That's really good stuff. Yes.
