Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I thank you for the work of your spirit among us, the context of worship, and we pray now that as we open your word and sit again at your feet, the feet of the master teacher Jesus, that your spirit would continue to move among us and give strength and vitality of life to these words. I pray it in your name. Amen. Well, believe it or not, it was almost two and a half years ago. I went this week to check, January 7th, 2007, that we began this series of sermons that we've come to know as the way of the rabbi. And as you can imagine, with something that lasts that long, I get asked now and then, Dave, how long are we going to be in this thing? And they're not necessarily complaining, they just kind of want to know. And the honest answer to that is I don't really know. Even from the beginning, I didn't know. Except from the beginning, I did know some things. Because I knew, for instance, that at the beginning of this series, I had, and I think you had too, become captivated by this idea that Jesus could be seen and understood as, among other things, a first century rabbi. And then in many ways, understanding him in that context shed new light, not only on what Jesus was saying in the text, that we had always kind of been focused on, but why he was saying it, the way he was saying it. turns out that the way he was saying it was rabbinic. And if you were here at the beginning of this series, I think you remember how fun that was, actually, to start connecting some dots that we'd never connected before, like what it means to carry a rabbi's yoke, which we learned early on is a rabbi's way of interpreting, first of all, the Torah, but also how then to live Torah or the law of God out in everyday life. So when Jesus comes along and says verses that we've maybe heard all our lives, take my yoke upon you and learn of me, it just kind of sounds a little different. We hear it a little differently now. Or when he says, remember that early on? Come follow me. We learned how thrilling that would have been for any young person in Jesus' day to hear those words, from a rabbi of any kind that they respected because what those words would have meant to a first century young person, among other things, is that this rabbi who's saying this to me believes that I have what it takes to carry this rabbi's yoke, to follow this rabbi's way, but Jesus, we learned, was saying that phrase, come follow me, to the not good enoughs. Young men, particularly, who had not been said those words to by other rabbis, something most rabbis would never do, which kind of helped us understand at a little deeper level, at least in part why the disciples, when asked to follow Jesus, would follow him so quickly because they just couldn't believe that a rabbi of any kind, let alone one of Jesus' stature, would believe in them, come follow me, because I believe that you have what it takes to carry my wake, my yoke. and follow my way, and immediately they did. And while I didn't know how long it would take to cover all that, I did know we needed to cover all that. And then out of all of that came another awareness, another little dot got connected, that Jesus, when we were starting to see him in his historic context, was not a Christian, which was an odd thing to say when I first said it, but it's obvious. He was a Torah-observant Jew, so we talked about the Torah for several weeks, turned into months. That's how this stuff happens. Through the eyes of a first century Jew, we looked at the Torah, and we called it, if you remember, the law that Jesus loved. And then after that, I knew that we needed to study the Sermon on the Mount if we hoped to discover our rabbi's way, because there it was, all of it. His interpretation of Torah was in the Sermon on the Mount, and how it looked when it was being fulfilled, you could indeed call the Sermon on the Mount Mount Jesus' yoke. our rabbi's yoke. And the invitation constantly was to step into this and live this way, but I didn't know how long it would take. And then a few months into the Sermon on the Mount, you might remember that Steve Weins came on board, and he just won't shut up at all. And so that is why this thing has taken so long, I just want you to know. Yeah, there you go. There you go. So just a couple weeks ago, and you might have noted this, just before Easter, we came to the end. Matthew 7, Verse 29, Jesus finished these words, and the multitudes were amazed, so we're done. With the Sermon on the Mount, which is kind of a big deal, because we don't finish things very often around here. These things always do last long, but we're not done with the way of the rabbi. Because there's one more thing. I knew even when we began that to finish this rabbi's way thing well, we needed at some point to study the parables of Jesus. the parables of Jesus I'm introducing them today fascinating they are filled with a language of metaphor and analogy because the kingdom of God is like this and it's like that their purpose was to reveal realities of life in the kingdom of God but it's ironic because while their purpose was to reveal the effect they had on some was actually to conceal what their meaning was The stories in the parables were simple and earthy, not religious at all, though they were always or often about the kingdom of God or some facet of living in the kingdom of God. There was in the parables no mention of God or the text, if you will. They were stories about farmers and fields, about judges and victims, and coins and sheep, about wayward sons and wedding banquets, about building barns and towers and going to war and crooks and beggars and fig trees and manure. So they were simple and very earthy, but at the same time confusing and disturbing because the only ones who could understand them, it seemed, were those who had ears to hear and eyes to see. And what on earth does that mean? Sounds like a secret club. You just don't get it, do you? And I'm starting to resent them already. these parables are just kind of spinning all the time on on one hand their purpose is to reveal on the other hand the same parable to another person in the crowd the purpose is actually to conceal they're simple and earthy but at the same time confusing and disturbing as well it's kind of hard to pin them down it's why we'll probably take a couple weeks just introducing this whole thing and laying a foundation of understanding where it is these things are taking us. Eugene Peterson, in a book I got a hold of a couple of weeks ago called Tell It Slant, a book of his on the parables, has a fascinating take on the parables, I think, particularly those parables found in Luke's gospel, which he refers to as the travel narratives. Because Jesus does the parables, at least the ones he does in Luke, on his way from Galilee to Jerusalem through Samaria. Let me break it down like this for you so you get the picture. It really is fascinating. The symbolism of it is, I think, exciting. Galilee is where Jesus began his ministry. I think you know that. And in Galilee, he didn't tell stories like he does in other places. In Galilee, he mostly preached and teach. He would mostly preach and teach when he was in Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. The first words out of his mouth in Matthew and in Luke was a proclamation of the truth of God's kingdom. He is preaching and he is teaching in Galilee the precepts of God, often doing it in familiar synagogues to people who had a biblical base. They knew the Torah in Luke chapter four before the travel synagogue, before the travel narrative. Early on when he was in Galilee, he went into a synagogue and the first thing he did in the synagogue was to break open the book, break open the scroll, read from Torah. he read the prophet Isaiah, which is the kind of thing we would do in church. You would expect the text to be central. It was for Jesus in Galilee. And in Jerusalem is where his ministry ended. And in Jerusalem, he would do the same. He would preach and he would teach when he was there to people much the same as those in Galilee. Not in familiar synagogues, but in Jerusalem he would do it in the temple to people who, like in Galilee, had a biblical background, a biblical base. They knew the Torah. And though their interpretations of Torah varied widely, and they fought about their interpretations often in quite divisive ways, just like religious people and sometimes even Christians do today, they shared this common reference, this common frame of reference, this common language around the Scriptures, around Torah. But on his way from Galilee, where he began, to Jerusalem, where he ended, Jesus went through Samaria, not preaching or teaching or referring to the text, but in Samaria it was the telling of simple stories that pointed to and revealed the realities of life in the kingdom of God to people who didn't know Torah, who had no understanding nor desire for Torah. The point of the stories in that case, in that context, was to reveal life in the kingdom of God. And the key to the revelation, to the Samaritan kind of frame of reference, was their simplicity, was their earthiness. It was the simplicity that opened it up to them. Indeed, Peterson uses Samaria in this book as a metaphor for the way Jesus uses language with people who had very little or maybe no readiness to listen to the revelation of God, the kind of people who wouldn't show up on a Sunday to hear the text. Jesus uses a different kind of language for those kind of people and Peterson called it a Sunday to Sunday conversation. Galilee being kind of a metaphor for Sunday, the kind of thing we would do here. Jerusalem being kind of another metaphor for Sunday. But in between Sunday to Sunday, there is Samaria. And if you think about the metaphor, it's kind of Samaria is where we live from Sunday to Sunday. And when he was there in Samaria, where most of us live from Sunday to Sunday, he didn't preach he didn't teach he didn't hold up signs at football games that say john 3 16 remember that guy he's kind of disappeared the bushy hair and right in the end zone to you john 3 16 and everybody's going he's a witness no he's an idiot you're in samaria they don't understand what you're saying it's not helping he told simple stories designed to reveal but now here we spin again we're gonna experience this is going to give us whiplash. These parables really will do that because Samaria wasn't the only place Jesus spoke in parables. You know, Eugene Peterson rightly notices how he did that in Samaria in Luke's telling. But sometimes he did do parables in Galilee in a context like this or in Jerusalem. One time he did it at the house of Simon the Pharisee when they were reclining a table in Luke chapter 7. And the purpose in those contexts often was not so much to reveal as it was to conceal, but not even so much to conceal as to disturb. A Pharisee like Simon, who knew for sure what it was he knew for sure in order to drive some of those people a little bit deeper in their understanding, which is, as many of you know, very rabbinic. Indeed, we talked a lot about this at the beginning of the series two and a half years ago as we were coming to know Jesus as a rabbi, we were kind of laying some foundations then as well. You may remember that early on in this series, we became very familiar with the educational system of Jesus' day, an educational system that really does inform, kind of explains to us Jesus' use of parables and paradox and riddles and other methods of teaching as well, beginning in Bet-Sephir and Bet-Telmud, most children in Jesus' day. You may remember, I thought this was fascinating, by the age of 14, had memorized the entire Old Testament, pressing then in their educational system into what's called Bet Midrash. They would learn the rabbinic art of questions and answers. But their rabbinic art, you know, was not just answering a question with an answer. They would answer the question with another question, and then another question, and round and round they would go, and then we just connected that dot to how Jesus, like, I don't know, 300-some questions that he was asked twice or three times gave a direct answer. And I always used to think he was just being difficult. He was being rabbinic. This was a rabbinic thing he had learned in places like Bet Midrash, as well as the use of story and riddle and paradox and parable. All of which was designed to teach these young people how to think, not just what to think, but how to think, how to not just know the material, which was very important, but then to interact with it, get underneath it, be able to go all around it, internalize it, and to look at it from more than one perspective, particularly more than your perspective, and then to realize, and this gets a little edgy, that there's often more than one right answer, and that's where we start getting nervous, and then to learn how to hold things that apparently contradict, realizing that sometimes both things are true because happy are the happy that's true but happy are the sad as well according to jesus in matthew 5 that's also true both things are true all of which drives people like us crazy because we are um into linear mechanical and single interpretations of a lot of things particularly of scripture where we know for sure who's right, who's wrong, who's the good guy, who's the bad guy, who's in, who's out. Indeed, this kind of rabbinic thinking often scares us, quite frankly, does me, makes us nervous, because we think this kind of thinking will turn to relativism. And if it isn't handled well, it can, but it doesn't have to. When handled skillfully in the hands of a master teacher, like maybe like Jesus, if you stick with it, it doesn't turn to relativism. It turns to wisdom. Jesus was a wisdom teacher. It's one of the reasons he spoke in parables and used paradox and answered questions with more questions because he's calling you deeper. Now, ultimately, the purpose and the value of this kind of teaching, whether it be a paradox or a parable or a riddle, questions with questions was that it effectively brought people into what we've referred to in the past. I've talked about this with you before and used this phrase before, sacred space. It would bring you into sacred space. And the value of sacred space is that it's generally the only kind of space or environment where the possibility exists for authentic change or transformation. Most of the teaching we're familiar with, and we even think of teaching, it's informational. And that certainly is not a bad thing where you kind of get the information and you take notes and you memorize the list. And that's kind of the equivalent of memorizing Torah, I suppose. But what Jesus is doing with parables and other things like that is to drive you beyond that into something that could actually bring you into sacred space, which is transformation. Let me explain this a little bit more. with a little help from a number of authors who talk about this thing called the axis mundi. The axis mundi, which is kind of a fancy word that I like using, so you think maybe I'm smart. But all it means is the center point. The center point. Picture in your mind, it's very simple, a circle with a dot in the center. The dot in the center is the axis mundi. And the fact is that for most of us, most of the time, the axis mundi, the center of our lives is us. We are the center. Now, there is an upside to that, and the upside to that is this. Being the center is very comfortable, because the only view you will ever have or opinion you will ever hold is yours. We think what we've always thought. We know with certitude, again, who the good guys are, who the bad guys are, who's in, who's out, who's right, who's wrong, we're sure. And the upside of that is this. It feels great, doesn't it? Don't you? I just feel, when I know for sure, it's like, I can breathe now. But there's a downside to that. And the downside to that, always knowing for sure is this, you never grow. You never change. Indeed, transformation, quite frankly, is impossible for people like that because you see no need for change. You already know for sure. it was very comfortable. The ancients called that profane space as opposed to sacred space and it was called profane space not because it was dirty or immoral but because it was ordinary. Because it was common. Nothing in profane space is supernatural or transformational but the fact is this when you think of this and you know it's true I know it's true of me. Most of us, truthfully, don't have easy access into sacred space for a number of reasons. One, I think, is because of our Western orientation of thinking and culture, where most of us are told from day one that we are the center, actually, where what you need and want and think really is the ultimate thing. But it happens. This sacred space thing happens when, for whatever reason, you're knocked off center. And suddenly, the things you thought for sure, you're not so sure. Now, that's a very disturbing place to be, so I wouldn't call sacred space quiet space. Now, when I think of sacred space, I think of, you know, sacred space like this can be very disturbing, but it's an environment where you might actually begin to grow and change often through something unexpected, disappointing, disruptive, even catastrophic. It doesn't always have to be negative. I think I've told you this before. Sometimes you can enter into sacred space. The first time you fell in love, you had a sense of sacred space where maybe for the first time in your life, you weren't the center. That other person was. The birth of a child can bring you there. death of a loved one can bring you there. Authentic God experience can bring you there as well. But even there, often, if you think about authentic God experiences, some of yours over the years, they haven't always been like this, but often those even come, are brought about. It's not by a good sermon necessarily, but something unexpected, something disruptive, something catastrophic, even if you will. And again, that's not everyone's testimony, but that would be the testimony of the apostle Paul. Remember the apostle Paul on his way to Damascus. What was the characteristic of Paul on the road to Damascus? Among other things, it was this. He was absolutely sure that he was right. And then something very disturbing happened to him. He got a revelation. It was disturbing, catastrophic, got knocked off his proverbial horse, and then not so sure. And it was in that place of not being so sure of what you were so sure of. Transformation was possible. Sometimes we experience this sacred space in a worship service. Where the axis mundi, the center of all of our experience corporately, really is God. But mostly, even in a worship service, we don't. In fact, I think we kind of go in and out of this. That's how I experience it. Because when most of us come to worship, and I'm included in this, we are kind of still the center. Think with me on this. Indeed, we're in what I would call our critical mind, where what we do, actually in the worship context here, is critique what's going on. We all do this, so it's kind of, well, I've got to go bust it. We're all busted together. I'm in this too, because it's all about what we liked and what we didn't like. The music was too fast, too slow, too loud, too soft. I liked the speaker. I didn't like the speaker. I liked the talk. I didn't like to talk, which, by the way, keeps me as the center. It is egocentric. In fact, there's when we're in a place like that. We're in profane space. Not because it's dirty, it's just ordinary. It's what everybody does. And in that kind of space, we might leave a worship service feeling good about the service. Or we might leave feeling bad about the service. Even maybe irritated about the service. what was said or what was sung, but we won't leave any different. No transformation can take place when we're in that kind of place. It's interesting. When I think of that kind of stuff, I just reflect on the fact every once in a while, you know, we'll have a weekend. Well, I'll come home from the service, and Bonnie can attest to this, and I'll just walk in the door, sometimes on Saturday night, and I'll just go, oh, that was horrible. I felt like it was a bomb. Nothing worked. The word didn't work. The worship didn't work. The announcements were irritating. Even the announcements bugged me. Not today, but. But what's weird, over time, you know, I'll get an email that week, or maybe two weeks later, a letter from someone who was in that service I thought was a bomb, and they'll say something sometimes, like, amazing. I met with God. I was deeply moved. It was a transformational experience, and I've had those enough to kind of have to think that through. What did that mean? And I kind of used to think that that probably meant maybe it wasn't as bad as you thought, which might be true. But in light of what I'm talking about this morning, I think more likely it's this, that that person came into this room, and maybe you're in this kind of place right now. And when they came, they were in sacred space. They wouldn't have called it that. They didn't even know what this was. They were in sacred space when they came. Because maybe they were going through a divorce. And what that means, among other things, is everything they thought they knew for sure. I don't know for sure or maybe they came in aware of their sin and that was putting them in a place because I was sure I would never do that and then they did and they're in this disturbed place or maybe they came in surprised somehow by joy and if you're in a place like that I'm going to stretch it here but I can read from the phone book and you would hear the voice of God I'm not going to read from the phone book don't worry now the reason I'm telling you all that getting back to the point is because the rabbinic style of Jesus teaching particularly his use of parables was uniquely designed it's genius it's fabulous I just hope your sense of who Jesus is kind of just expands a little bit more because his teaching style was perfectly designed to create all of that to at least create the possibility for sacred space where people actually might change, not by simply providing answers for questions, which is what we want, but often by doing the exact opposite, by raising questions, by speaking in ways where the meaning is hidden, by use of paradox and parable precisely for this purpose, to disturb, to disrupt, to contradict what Richard Rohr calls conventional wisdom, what everybody thinks, because it creates the possibility for change. Let me give you some examples. There are actually several, one of the first and most obvious. Again, we've talked about this before. I find it fascinating, because this is a theme of Jesus, not just in his teaching, but it's kind of the theme of the kingdom of God, the great reversal themes. The upside down, we've talked about this for years, The upside-down realities of the kingdom of God. Well, that was used in his teaching as well. Reversal themes where he confronts and reverses the order of what most people think in order to make them think. So he says things like this. The first shall be last and the last shall be first. And we roll our eyes and go, that's really dumb. Okay, whatever. You got to think a little bit more about that. He's reversing the order. That's all that is. He loved to tell stories where the person you expected to be the hero is really the villain, and the person you expect to be the villain is really the hero. The Good Samaritan, perfect example of that. You have the priests and the Levites who are supposed to be the good guys. In fact, in the Good Samaritan story, one of the keys to the story is how it's set up because he is giving this parable to a teacher of the law who himself sees himself as a good guy, But in the story, the priests and the Levites, people like him, in the story Jesus tells, they're the bad guys because they ignore the person in pain. And the Samaritan in the story, the non-Jew, half-breed bad guy, is in the story the good guy. Amazing how subversive Jesus is. I mean, that story would be like me, telling a story where we, who are supposed to be the good guys, we're the good guys, aren't we? It would be like me telling a story where we, who are supposed to be the good guys, I tell the story in such a way that we're really the bad guys, and a Hindu or a Muslim is really the good guy. Not only is he or she a good person, but they are the person from whom we should learn what it means to be a neighbor. That's weird and very disturbing. And if you didn't know Jesus did it, you'd be ticked at me if I did that. Prodigal son is the same thing. You have a son who does it wrong, who takes his father's inheritance, breaks his father's heart, squanders everything he had. He did it wrong, but in the end, he is right. You have a son who his whole life did it right, but in the end, he is wrong. It's an incredible confrontation. Again, very disturbing because it means, among other things, that you can do it all right. and be all wrong. And you can do it all wrong and in the end, come alive to grace and understand deep things of the kingdom of God like forgiveness and restoration. You can end up being right. Which is precisely the parable of the publican and the Pharisee. In Luke's gospel, Luke 18, you remember this, the publican is in, not the publican, but the Pharisee is in the temple and he is praying because that's what Pharisees do. And he's in the temple because that's where they go. Thank you, God, I'm not like this scumbag over here. The Pharisee, his whole life, did it right. He really did. He went to synagogue, he went to church, he followed the rules, he gave a tithe, he knew the text, but he was wrong. Thank you, God, again, I'm not like him. And he was talking about the publican who did it all wrong his whole life. The publican was a tax gatherer. And every impression you would have of that person is that he did it wrong. He cheated, he lied, he stole, but in the end, he was the hero of the story. He did it right. Crying, Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner, not even willing to lift up his eyes toward heaven. Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner, because he saw his sin. Jesus is constantly spinning this stuff. Another thing that I find fascinating, and I just want you to keep remembering, and I'll kind of keep you in touch with this as we go through these parables, is that, again, this teaching style of parable and paradox and all of that stuff did not originate with Jesus. I mean, that's the whole point of this. It was rabbinic. Indeed, the psalmist is one of my favorite reversal themes when the psalmist says a verse that actually is familiar to many of us from a different place in the text, in the Bible, where the psalmist says that the stone that the builder rejected has become the chief cornerstone. Now, some of you are familiar with that verse because Peter uses it, that phrase he uses, in 1 Peter 2, 7. And Peter says that that cornerstone is speaking of Jesus, which it is. But it also speaks, does the psalmist speak, to what is known as the theology of the sacred wound. Let me explain that one. God, I love this. The theology of the sacred wound is where that thing in you that you most fear, it won't be hard for you to find this thing, that thing in you that you most reject, some sin, some failure, some shame, that you're convinced will keep you from God. Fact is, if faced, wept over, repented of, and forgiven, can in fact become the very thing that doesn't keep you from God, it's the thing that brings you to God, can in fact become the chief cornerstone of your life. Which is why sometimes you know this is true. You maybe haven't had these words around it, But as you look back on your life, some of the worst things and biggest failures that you would like to reject when actually embraced, when actually forgiven, and you receive grace for it, that thing you'd like to reject in some ways becomes the chief cornerstone of your whole life. It's called the sacred wound. Some of you are former alcoholics, or you would call yourself maybe an alcoholic, but you hit the bottom, and it was horrible, and you would like to reject that whole thing, but when you faced it, received grace for it, began to grow out of that, that horrible thing became the place that ultimately brought you to God, didn't keep you from God. You know what I'm talking about. I mean, one of the things we talk about around here a lot is 16 years ago, we kind of hit the wall as a church. I hit the wall kind of as a person, And there's parts of that season that I would like to reject, just kind of forget about, feel shame about, but in many ways it's become a cornerstone, a touchstone for transformation. It's fascinating because part of these reversal themes has to do with the fact that Jesus is introducing a kind of spirituality, not of perfection, but of imperfection. Blessed are the poor in spirit because they know they need. And the people who know they need are the ones who get the grace and the forgiveness and the deep things of God. And it all just keeps spinning. Reversal themes also are designed to pull us out of what I would call either-or thinking, where everything is either black or white. We know, again, with surety who the good guys are, who the bad guys are, who's in, who's out. You're either orthodox or you're a heretic. It's one or the other. It's interesting, if you're around real black and white people, I know they see it as a strength, because you know. And when you feel like you know, you kind of feel strong. Truth is, you're 12. So Jesus, dealing particularly with people who were either-or thinkers, always using these parables and these stories to pull people out of that, does these irritating things by praising. In the context of religious Jews, he praises the Syrophoenician woman. And he declares the faith of a Roman centurion. Are you kidding me? The centurion's our enemy. He's the reason we're oppressed. Jesus, in front of a bunch of religious Jews, says, I've never seen the kind of faith in all of Israel as I see in this guy you all hate. And then he goes on to say in Matthew 9, a little bit later, he says, will come from the east and the west and sit at the table of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And because we've talked about this before, the kingdom, the messianic table in the minds of the Jew was always about a life in the kingdom of God. But who was at the table and who was not at the table was always the question. Who's in? Who's out? Who's invited? Who's not? So Jesus comes along. I'm just telling you something. That many will come that you think are out who don't belong at the table who will come to this table of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and many who you think are in are really out. Point. It's not even to argue about who's in and who's out. The point is, maybe you don't know. Don't be so sure. Jesus would do that all the time. He loved metaphors of mixture, The collision of opposites, wheat and tares in Matthew 13. That reality is often a mixed bag, and so are you. These are things that I've just kind of, they're in kind of my DNA now. I just kind of think this way. That you are full of God, but it's not all or nothing. You are full of other things too. I mean, I even thought about this last night after I, you know, no, no, no, we're a mixed bag. There's wheat and tares in you and in us. And we need to know that about each other. We really do. Here's what I thought of how we have a tendency sometimes to idealize people. Oh, tares are so wonderful. It's all wheat. It's all wonderful. No, it's not. No, it's not. And then when we find out that it's not, because it's not, then we go the other way. We vilify them. Oh, they're all, they're all, no, they're not. But see, you'd be having to move into a kind of a wisdom now to be able to live like that. It's not all black and white. You'd like it like that. Then there's the loss in hidden images because Jesus seems to think that there are some things that we can actually know better by losing it, longing for it, suffering from it, searching for it, then rejoicing over it when you rediscover it than to have never lost it at all. So he tells the parable of the lost coin in Luke 15, the lost sheep in Matthew 18, the lost son, the prodigal again, who had to lose it, and then rediscover what he had all along, his father's house and his father's love in order to value it. You know what? Some of the deepest and wisest people that I know, and this is to get a step back, and I know you know this is true in your own life as well. Some of the deepest and wisest people that I know are people who at some point hit the wall, who even lost what they might have at the time called their faith. But it was precisely in the losing it and longing for it, particularly longing and searching for maybe something more substantial in their faith that in their searching for it, they rediscover it, and they rediscover it rejoicing. He loved images that spoke to growth and slow transformation, not magic wand or presto chango spirituality, the slow-growing seed of Mark 4 and Matthew 13. Even his analogy with Nicodemus of being born again, it speaks to, among other things, it actually speaks to process, which is not something we all get when we talk about being born again. Because to be born again, if you actually think about somebody being born, a seed is planted, then it might be an incredible experience that does that, which is kind of weird. But the life begins to come, and the life begins to grow. And sometimes you're not even aware of this thing, but it keeps on growing, and it keeps on growing. And then some things happen, but we don't get the process part. In fact, we generally have no idea how our culture has kind of shaped and influenced our theology, kind of what I would call the instant breakfast culture. So our evangelism even sometimes gets reduced to, I tell you what, you pray this prayer, you say these words, you're in, you're done. Like, what? What? Here's the bottom line. The teaching of Jesus, particularly as it's revealed in these parables we're going to be going into, will force us to face, among other things, our true loyalty systems. We think we're loyal to God and to truth and to love and to the Bible, and we want to be, when actually we're loyal to the way we already think and what we already believe. So here's my question. Are you willing to be disturbed? to be disrupted so that maybe you can enter into sacred space where real transformation by the power of God's Spirit can actually occur. Well, I think you are. So here we go. And even if you aren't, here we go. Let's pray as we close. Would you stand with me? Father I have the sense as I often do when we begin a new thing that we're beginning a journey and I just pray that you would give us the courage to be on it be in it stay in it as we acknowledge together that you are the Lord of it and you will lead us and we will follow as best we can I pray these things in Jesus name all God's people said Amen Amen God bless you you are dismissed Thank you.
