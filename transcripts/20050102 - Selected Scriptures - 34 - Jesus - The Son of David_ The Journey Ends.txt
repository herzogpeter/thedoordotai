We are bringing to an end a series of sermons that we have come to know as the journey of the heart. It has been quite a journey, I think you would agree if you've been on it with us. And a long journey too, beginning in September of 2003, believe it or not. That's when we began this thing. We wrap it up today, the first day of the new year, 2005. Preparing as we do for another journey of sorts. In fact, this talk is kind of capping that one and in some ways beginning this next journey, which we will also begin next week, what we're going to call a journey with the Holy Spirit. We're going to talk about who the Holy Spirit is in the next weeks and months and for a while. And we're going to talk about what the Holy Spirit does, and we're going to talk maybe most of all about how what the Holy Spirit of God does is what we so desperately need. And I absolutely believe, and know absolutely for me, that it is, this Holy Spirit journey is a critical part of my journey where I am right now in my life. And I absolutely believe it to be a critical part of our church's journey as we move into the things that God has called us to do. Things that cannot be done, cannot be done without anything less than the supernatural breath of God. Holy Spirit of God, and we need to know more about the Holy Spirit, and I will be the chief learner in that. Today, we say goodbye to David, whose life in 1 and 2 Samuel we used as our guide for this journey of the heart. It's a journey that began, you may remember, in 1 Samuel 16, when Samuel the prophet came to the house of Jesse looking for a king, bypassing more obvious choices like Eliab, the oldest and the biggest and the strongest of Jesse's sons, and because of those things, he looked like the best choice. God, through Samuel, chose David instead with this explanation, that while man looks on the outward appearance, and therefore Eliab would be the obvious choice, God looks at the heart, and he saw something did God in David's heart that pleased him, that caused him to choose David before the oldest son, the biggest, the strongest, what looked like the best. He saw something in David's heart, and so did we. For we found in David a person who had, among other things, a passionate heart, a courageous heart. One of the very first stories we told of David was how as a young boy, full of faith, he stood down the giants called Goliath. He had a worshiping heart, characterized at times by wild abandon. In 2 Samuel 6, 14, it says that he danced before the Lord with all his might. And I remember the day that we talked about that and the joy that surrounded that as we kind of plugged into the things that caused David to dance. It was the presence of God. It's what he wanted more than anything else. And that told us a little bit more about his heart. We found him to be a person who had a loyal heart. In his friendship with Jonathan, we saw that when David loved you, you stayed loved. David had a patient, submissive, and obedient to God heart, and we saw that evidenced in a number of ways, but I think primarily in his dealings with King Saul. When King Saul was filled with a jealous heart trying to kill David, David refused to usurp and take matters into his own hands, submitted to God, was obedient to God, let God do with Saul what he would. David, we found, also had a compassionate and generous heart, and we saw that embodied in a number of places, but maybe primarily the best place was in his dealings with Mephibosheth. Remember Mephibosheth, the crippled one who was part of Saul's family, and after David had come into the throne, he looked around and Saul was gone and Jonathan was gone as well, and this question just rose up in him. Who in Saul's house is still alive who I could just bless? I just want to be generous to somebody in the house of Saul. And we saw that generosity in his compassion. But we saw other things in David's heart, as well as the real good things were disturbing things, things that were confusing to us. It made us wonder how could somebody who had that kind of heart do those kinds of things? We found him to be a person who also had an adulterous heart, a forgetful wandering heart. We called it a mixed bag heart. Remember, it was in the spring when kings go off to war that David didn't in 2 Samuel 11, and it was that context. He looked over the porch, and he saw Bathsheba and took what he wanted, thus spiraling down into death-dealing kinds of sin, and we began to wonder what happened to this guy's heart. But the bigger question, actually, you might recall, was not just what happened to David's heart, but could what happened to David's heart happen to our heart? And we spent some time wondering about that. David, who in his youth was a great warrior and eventually a great king, was a failure as a father. And that broke his heart. Remember that? Oh, Absalom, my son, my son. But here's the deal. In spite of these apparent inconsistencies that we saw in David and the obvious frailties we saw in him as well, the fact is this, David's name still stands. Not only as the greatest king that Israel ever had, but also it stands as a hero of faith in the big story that belongs to God. Indeed, Jesus himself, in spite of David's inconsistencies and obvious frailties, Jesus himself, without hesitation, without any shame, allowed himself to be identified with David in this way, by having one of his messianic titles applied to him being this, Jesus was the son of David. The fact is it was one of his most important messianic titles, Jesus, son of David. Just to give some perspective on that, I think it is interesting that the very first verse of the very first chapter of the very first gospel in all of the New Testament begins with these words. The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David. Right there at the beginning, at the very end of the New Testament. Revelation 22, verse 16. The very last recorded words of Jesus are these. I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and offspring of David. Not ashamed to be identified with him. Didn't hesitate. Regardless of David's frailties and inconsistencies, I want to end our journey that we've been on for well over a year by reflecting just a little bit on this connection between David, who we have been studying week after week, and the son of David, who we know to be Jesus himself. Why was Jesus called by this title, son of David? It's not a distinction given to anyone else in the Old Testament, and I find that interesting. He's not called, for instance, the son of Moses or the son of Elijah or Isaiah. It certainly wasn't, as I've already kind of established. It wasn't because of his flawless moral character. Other characters, like Joseph, for instance, would seem better choices. But not if you understand what God was up to through all of this. You see, in many ways, this title that was given to Jesus, son of David, wasn't about David at all. This title, in fact, was a lot more about Jesus and what it reveals to us about Jesus. I'll give you two things that it reveals. The first is this. It reveals and it speaks to hope. Does this title, the son of David. Let me explain why that is because you need some history to understand why that is. In Jesus' day, David's reign as king was thought of and remembered as the golden age of Israel. And we would remember some of these things just because of our study in these last several months, over a year. He was only their second king, that is Israel's second king. Saul I was a disappointment and quite divisive. When David became king, he united the country. They routed the enemies, the Philistines, and enjoyed freedom from them just about the entire time that David reigned. Under his reign, he led the people of Israel into unprecedented prosperity and devotion to God. Solomon, who followed David, started very well. Asked God for wisdom, God gave it, and his kingdom flourished and looked like it was going to go very well. But in the end, he began to spiral down, and in the end of his reign, the kingdom was divided, Judah in the north, Israel to the south, and from there, it went downhill, where king after king after king brought the people of Israel into literally centuries of oppression by foreign powers. So by the first century, by the time Jesus comes on the scene, Jesus who is called the Son of David, the glory of Israel is gone. For as long as anyone could remember, they were just the pawns of whoever happened to be ruling them at the time from the Babylonians then, the Assyrians, then the Greeks, and in Jesus' day, it clearly was the Romans. By the time Jesus was on the scene, the Israelites were nothing but a second-rate, oppressed, obscure, run-down people whose only hope, and this hope seemed like a thin thing to many people, especially if they were just in tune with how long it had been since David was on the throne, the only hope they had was the return of the king. If only we could go back to those days, and you can kind of resonate with the good old days that people speak of. Something that became known among them as messianic hope, and messianic hope for them was thought to be found in the root of Jesse. If we're going to have hope again, we've got to go back to those days. It was the root of Jesse. It will be the son of David. And just the thought of David returning or the son of David, taking that rightful place again and bringing us back to the golden days would cause hope to rise in people's hearts. Now I was trying to think of a corollary to this in our culture and we don't have many actually I mean we don't have kings and kingdoms in the specific sense but we actually do. I was trying to think of a kind of kingdom in our day that someone would call a dynasty or a golden age and the first thing I thought was of a stupid thing but that's me. Actually I thought of the Chicago Bulls. I'm from Chicago and you know that and some of those alliances are still there and addictions, actually, with the Chicago Cubs and the Bulls and all these weird things that have never left me. And I remember the days when Michael Jordan played, and many of you do as well. It was called the Golden Age of Unprecedented Success. Indeed, many of you remember, I sure do, when NBA teams came into Chicago, the presence of Michael Jordan appeared unto them. And the glory of Michael Jordan shone round about them. And they were sore afraid. But when he left, the glory left with him. Ichabod, it was written, the glory had departed. The Chicago Bulls became a second-rate oppressed, obscure, run-down basketball team. But there was this thing that kind of murmured, as it were, through the people of Chicago. And people began to talk and whisper and hardly dared to hope. Do you think he'd ever come back? Do you think he'd ever come back? And Michael Jordan would. He returned. Well, guess what? You know what happened. He won three championships and then he left. dilly-dallied in some baseball, and then he came back. They won three more championships. I will never forget the day that Michael Jordan came back. Two words on the front page of the Chicago Sun-Times. Now, obviously, I didn't live in Chicago because I was already here by this time, but it got national press. Two words on the front page of the Chicago Sun-Times, he's back. And with those two words, a whole city was filled with what? Hope. That's a really stupid story, I know. But that's the only kind I have. Actually, it does connect me in some weird way with the kinds of things people were feeling when they thought of returning to things the way they used to be and people who've lost hope that it will ever be that way again. It's interesting to note, important to note, that throughout the New Testament, this title, Son of David, was used almost exclusively by people who were in circumstances where they had no hope and were crying out for help. And in the declaration, and they would declare, they would look at Jesus and they would call him the Son of David. And often when they would call him Son of David, others would say, don't be calling him that because people understood what that was meaning. And it was that we are identifying as you, as the one who's gonna bring back what used to be. So when these people, hopeless people, would cry out to Jesus and declare him to be the son of David, in the declaration, I think, was almost a question. You can almost hear a question as they're declaring him the son of David. At the same time, they're wondering, are you really the one that can have an impact on my life and change the circumstances of my life? Is there really a reason? Is there really in you a reason to hope? Is there really in you a reason to believe that what God used to do in what we call the golden age, that God still can do what he used to do? I wonder if any of you have ever, in hopelessness, cried out to God that way. Cried out to God that way, and in your crying out to God, there's this question. I wonder if you really are the one who can deliver and can heal and can forgive. I wonder, do you really still do what you used to do in what we call the golden age that we read about sometimes in the Bible? You know, it's in here, Acts 4, but how come it's not here? In Matthew 9, 27, Jesus is passing through this area, and it says as Jesus passed from there, two blind men followed him. Two blind men would be hopeless, desperate, hopeless that anything other than some supernatural, beyond anything they'd ever seen, power would come to them and give them sight. Two blind men followed him, not caring what people said, oh, what people thought, cried out with a loud voice, didn't care about propriety, saying this, have mercy on us, son of David. And in the declaration was a question, are you really the one? Is there really reason to hope? And he stopped and he turned, and he healed them both. Later, a Canaanite woman from that same vicinity came to Jesus crying out, again, not caring what people thought or propriety of any kind. Son of David, have mercy on me. I have no hope other than you being the son of David, for my daughter is suffering from demon possession. And he stopped and he looked and he felt compassion and he healed that child. He delivered that child. In the Gospel of Mark, when Bartimaeus heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth who was coming toward him. He began to shout out repeatedly, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. And the text says many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more as if to say, don't you guys get it? He's back. He's back. So get your hopes up. And some people did. And some people believed, even in not believing, helped my unbelief, and some people didn't, but some people did. Began to believe that that's what God used to do in whatever they would define as the golden age, he still does. And things that used to happen, we read about them in Sunday school, they still do. And in that shout, son of David, have mercy on me, is a question but also a belief that what God used to do, he still does. He's back. Beloved, this is where this end of our talk about David is the beginning of our talk of the Holy Spirit because for us, I believe he is back in the form of the Holy Spirit with whom we are going to begin a journey next week. First thing in this title, Son of David Speaks to His Hope. hope rises with that name. Second thing is that this title reveals, Son of David reveals or speaks to about Jesus is his willingness to identify himself with sin and with sinners. Sinners just like you and just like me. Now we see this willingness that Jesus had to identify with sin and sinners in a number of places throughout the scriptures. It's part of his character, we know that. But as it relates to this title of his, the Son of Man, and how the Son of Man, that title, reveals his willingness to identify with sinners, we don't really see that many places, but clearly we see it in the very first gospel, in the very first chapter that I made reference to just a moment ago, the book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. To Abraham was born Isaac, to Isaac was born Jacob. And on it goes, this genealogy of people who begat other people. For 17 verses, we find out who begat who. Passages of Scripture for expository preachers are nightmares. What do you find interesting in people begatting people? Unless you're going to do a series on sex or something like that. I could do that and be the only thing. Sorry. See, I don't care who begat who. You know, some years ago, my mom spent some money. I hope it wasn't a lot, but I know she spent some money to trace our family line. She saw something online and it had something to do with promising that we'll be able to find the bloodlines of your family and trace them all the way back to the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve. And evidently they did that. I go all the way back there. You know, I have the book somewhere. It's a big thick book about like that. I don't know where that book is in my house. I know I have it in my possession somewhere. I don't know where it is. And do you know why I don't know where it is? Because I don't care. I couldn't care less. Where I, I don't care about it. Past anybody I actually knew, I don't care. Not so in Israel. Not so, in fact, I'm bringing that up to play it in contrast to how different that would have been among God's people in the first century. Bloodlines were critical in ways we don't understand. Central to their identity as a people. It qualified you in many respects for a variety of things. Priests, for example, could be disqualified from their priesthood if they couldn't establish their bloodline all the way back to Aaron. Establish credibility in ways and for reasons that we don't understand and don't care about, it mattered to them. Therefore, the genealogy here in the beginning of the gospel, while it may seem like boring stuff to us, is extremely important in terms of qualifying this son of David and establishing credibility. Why would I listen to him? Where are you from? would be the question. With that in mind, let me read a bit. Verse 2, the genealogy starts from the son of David, the son of Abraham. To Abraham was born Isaac and to Jacob, and Isaac, Jacob, and to Jacob was born Judah and his brothers, and to Judah were born Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Stop right there. Why are we told that Judah was born to Perez and Zerah by Tamar? Now, again, that would not get any of our attention we would just keep on reading and being bored silly with this genealogy. But any first century person reading this genealogy would stop right there, read no further. This whole thing is discredited. I don't care who you are, what you're able to do. This is not a genealogy that anybody's going to write because Tamar's a woman. Let me just explain a little thing about genealogies. Only Jews would be listed, first of all, in your genealogy. Second of all, among Jews, only men would be listed. It's your father that matters in the patriarchal system that they had. Not your mother. Your mother is a good person, I'm sure. But in that system, who you wanted to identify was the father. And among men, only respectable men. So when we come to Tamar, she's got one strike. She's a woman. And there's a question, why would she even be mentioned? Because she didn't need to be. Second thing, she was Aramian, which means she was an outsider. She was a non-Jew. On top of that, strike three, Genesis 38 reveals that when Tamar was widowed, she was so desperate to have children that she disguised herself as a prostitute and seduced her late husband's father. Strike one, she's a woman. Strike two, she's not a Jew. Strike three, she's scandalous. But here she is in the genealogy of the son of David. Right, we didn't have to mention her. We didn't have to know that Perez and Zerah was born by Tamar. We didn't need to know. They just had to leave that out. The reason it's here is because it's intentional. It's in here on purpose. Verse 5, another woman is mentioned. Salmon was born Boaz by Rahab. Once again, why are we being told who gave them birth? You just don't put that in a genealogy. Rahab, we know a little bit more about her. Some of you know Rahab the what? Harlot. Strike one, she's a woman. Strike two, she's a harlot. Strike three, she's a Canaanite, not an Israelite, but here she is. And she's here on purpose. It's about communicating something to us about who the son of David is and what he came to do and what he cares about. Later in verse 5, the same verse, another woman, Ruth, who was a wonderful woman of God, but she was a Moabite. the Moabites were the enemies of Israel look at verse 6 and to Jesse was born David the king and now we're down into the David thing and to David was born Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah and here we're being told again who gave birth to the son and the father by her who doesn't even mention her name now we know her to be Bathsheba but it goes out of Matthew goes out of his way to identify Bathsheba, not as David's wife, goes out of his way to identify her as the wife of Uriah, the what? The Hittite. How many strikes we got here? She's a woman, strike one. She's married to a Hittite, not an Israelite, strike two. She's an adulteress, strike three. But here she is. What's the point? It's simply this. Matthew is right at the beginning in a way that first century readers may or may not have picked up, may have been scandalized enough to not read any further, to discredit him completely. But he's tipping his hand here in what looks like boring information. And what he's tipping his hand about is this, that Jesus, the son of David, was not afraid to identify himself with sin or with sinners, that Jesus would throw open the doors of his kingdom to anyone who wanted to enter in, even Tamar or Rahab, even David. He would open the doors of his kingdom to men and women, to Jews and Gentiles, to sinners and saints, to sinners just like you and just like me. See, Jesus was called the son of David, not because David was so perfect. If he was looking for someone who was perfect, he probably would have picked Joseph, the son of Joseph. Joseph in the Old Testament, stands as one of the examples of the most godly men that ever lived. David, the son of David, wasn't because David was perfect. In fact, it may be in part because he wasn't perfect, just like you and just like me. See, Jesus took on this title not just because of who David was, but primarily because of who he was. Jesus, son of David, full of grace and truth. Jesus, son of David, instiller of hope. Jesus, son of David, have mercy on us. Why? Because we need now what the people in the New Testament who are crying out to you, son of David, have mercy on us, needed. We need the same thing. Jesus, son of David, have mercy on us because we need forgiving and we need delivering and we need healing and we need empowering and we need to know, God, that you still do what you used to do and that the golden age is not just in these pages someplace. That who you were is who you are. That what you did is what you do. By the power of your Holy Spirit. You see, beloved, you've got to get into the story here and understand that we are not that different than the two blind men on the road. We are not that different than the Canaanite woman with a demonized daughter. We are not that different than Bartimaeus who said, Lord, have mercy on us. Son of David, have mercy on us. Son of David, meaning, meaning, I'm just putting my hope in this Jesus that the one who used to still does. because if you don't move we have no hope if you don'T heal if you don't deliver if you don't empower if you don't forgive if you don't do what God used to do and what people look back on as the golden age we have no hope Jesus son of David have mercy on us Jesus son of David have mercy on us I'd like to introduce I wonder if that could even become part of our prayer language as we go to God, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on us. And it might be something we could bring to God when we're feeling those mixtures of belief and hope, hope and question. I'm hoping, God, that you still do this stuff. I haven't seen it for a while. People in Jesus' day hadn't seen it for centuries. Acts 16, 36, one of my favorite verses about David, says this, Then David, after he served the purposes of God in his generation, fell asleep. Think about it this way. David had his day. David was an interesting person. He was born. He had some gifts. David was a person who got a lot of things right. We spent a year and a half looking at some of the things that he got right. David was a person that got a lot of things wrong. We spent a lot of time looking at the things that David got wrong, just like you and just like me. But when I think of that verse of David serving the purposes of God in his generation and then passing on, what dawns on me about me and about us is this. that this is our day. This is my day. And your day. This is the time that we have to serve the purposes of God in our generation. This is it. And here's what I know about us. We're going to get a lot of things right. We already have. And so have you. Gotten a lot of things right. And we're going to get, I have a prediction for 2005. We're going to get a lot of things wrong. but by daily putting our confidence in and learning to cooperate with the son of David by the power of the Holy Spirit who we're going to learn more and more about we can be and we already are part of the big story that belongs to God and that is why beloved you and I can come now to this table and to at this table join the likes of Tamar and Rahab and Ruth and Bathsheba and even David and the reason we can come to this table with the likes of them is not because of David, who we admire and enjoyed studying his life, but we can come to this table because of the son of David, who's had mercy on us. The son of David full of grace and truth. The son of David instiller of hope, forgiver of sins, infuser of life. The son of David's healer, deliverer, empowerer. Son of David, have mercy on us. I'm going to ask you to I'm going to ask you to enter into this just by entering into a spirit of prayer would you do that with me if it helps you to close your eyes do that if you don't want you don't have to I don't care if you do that but I invite you to just get quiet in your spirit here Jesus son of David have mercy on us where have you lost hope where have you even given up believing that God could do anything about this thing you feel hopeless about so you've even quit bringing it up would you at least have enough energy energy just energy like a blind man crying out oh Jesus I don't even know what to ask for. I need mercy. You know, when they ask for mercy, they didn't even ask to be healed. They just, give me mercy. Jesus healed them. Jesus delivered them. Let me ask you a question in this quiet place as you're just maybe slowly being able to center in on the presence of God among us here, even in your own heart. As we think about 2005, it's the first day. It's natural for us to think about the year past. For some of you, it was a really good year. For some of you, it was a horrible year. For most of you, it was a mixed bag. So we're looking to 2005. Let me ask you a question. Make it your question. What do you need from God this year? What do you need that only he could do? What do you need from God that you've quit believing he even does anymore? Because, you know, the golden age is over. you know you've come to believe that and as we move now into this next phase of our journey as a church and begin to talk about the life and the power of the Holy Spirit of God that is going to communicate to us in a variety of ways you know what I'm back what I used to do I still do I wonder if you could bring bring that thing to the table and come with this simple phrase, Son of David, have mercy on us. Son of David, have mercy on us. For unless your spirit moves with power in my marriage or in my body or in my mind or in this situation or in my friend's life. I have no hope. Son of David, have mercy. We're gonna go to the table now and ask the stewards to come and join me. I'll have just a word of instruction and prayer down there. Thank you.
