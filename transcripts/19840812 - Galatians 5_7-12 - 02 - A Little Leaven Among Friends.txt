Galatians chapter 5, starting in verse 7. We pick up our study just where we left off. Verse 7, you were running well, Galatians, who hindered you from obeying the truth? This persuasion that you find yourself wrapped up in did not come from him who calls you. A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough. I have confidence in you and the Lord that you will adopt no other view, but the one who is disturbing you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is. But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Verse 11. But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished. Would that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves. I want you to pray with me. And as I ask you every Sunday, that you would open your hearts to what the Spirit has for you, and that you would lift me up as well. As the Word of God is delivered. Let's pray. Jesus, my heart has been full of the things that you have given me. And my heart has been blessed again this morning in the singing that caused me to reflect again on you and your glory. It makes me think even more of the power of the church in whom that glory dwells. I pray this morning that as we dive into this text and tear it apart and apply it to our lives and to our church, that we will leave with the overwhelming feeling that we have heard from you, that we have heard your voice, that we know your mind, that we even understand your heart. I pray Jesus even for a filling of my spirit in a special way to deliver the truth with clarity and power in Jesus name, amen during Jesus earthly ministry one of the things that we are aware of that he did over and over and he was consumed in doing was teaching his disciples discipling his disciples and one of the things he talked about over and over and over again was something that they didn't understand because it hadn't come and that was this, the kingdom of God. It was the church age. Something is going to be totally different when I leave. The church is going to be a whole new organism that you don't know anything about and even as he spoke to them about it, they would try to grasp it but they couldn't put it together until one day the Holy Spirit came, filled them and the church was established. But when he spoke of the church, he painted a glorious picture of it. He said it's going to be like this. It's going to be made up of a whole new race of people. It's not going to be just a bunch of people who affirm certain doctrines, but the church is a whole new race of people, reborn by the Spirit of God, recreated in Jesus Christ, new creatures in Christ. And that law which now, disciples, is written on stone, when that Holy Spirit comes, this whole thing is going to be turned around because that law, God's moral law, is going to be written on people's hearts. and they are going to be characterized by strange things. They are going to hunger and thirst for righteousness and they are going to be the salt of the earth. Of the church, Jesus said this, I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. Every time I read that verse or deliver that text, I feel like I need to explain it because I think we have the idea about that verse that what that means is, I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail is this, that what we need to do is sit in this church, huddle around, hold each other's hands, just confident that the gates of hell won't get in here and get us. And we'll just kind of sit here and the gates of hell are out there and the big bad wolf huffing and puffing will blow us down. But they won't get us because Jesus promised. It doesn't mean that. The church that is the church, made up of people in whom God dwells, is called to storm the gates of hell. And the gates of hell don't have a chance against us. We're the big bad wolf. to the church he said occupy till i come when he said that he didn't mean take up space on the corner of 45th and florida he said occupy till i come make a difference in fact you are the salt of the earth and to christ when we hear that kind of exhortation and that kind of description of who we are in Jesus Christ, what the church really is. To Christ we say, how? He says, Acts 1, verse 8, when the Holy Spirit comes, you will receive power that you don't know about now. And the result of that is this, you shall be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and in Judea and into the Samaria and into the other most parts of the world. I want you to notice something about that. When he says the Holy Spirit comes. This is what will happen. You shall be my witnesses. There are no shoulds in there. You should be my witnesses. No, it doesn't say that. Those people in whom the Spirit of God dwells are His witnesses. They will be. The church, the church, a glorious people, a group of people who all believe the right doctrine, who all believe Jesus is God and died for their sin and rose from the dead and he's coming again. That's not, no, no, no. That's not the church. A lot of people believe that stuff. Satan believes that. You say you believe in God, James 5? Good for you. So does Satan. Big deal. That is not the church. The church is a group of people who have placed their trust wholly in Christ in and in whom God, alive by his Holy Spirit, has taken up his residence. That ought I give you goosebumps. God's alive in me. And if you've placed your trust in Christ, He's alive in you. That's the church. But I want to tell you something. While Jesus was teaching these disciples who the church was and what it could do and what it would do, He also taught them some other things and that was this. You need to be warned, disciples. You need to be warned that the kingdom age, the church age, while it will be a glorious age, will also be a very confusing age. And I'll tell you why. The kingdom of God can be compared to a field. Matthew chapter 13. And the field goes like this. One day the true teacher walked through that field and he sowed seeds. And that seed bore fruit. And it was real. And it was great. And it was wheat. But you need to know something as well, that during the night the enemy came and he sowed tares. And the tares were false. They were not wheat. They were weeds. And there are some things about that text in Matthew 13, verses 21, and following that we need to understand. The most significant of which I believe is this, that it was the same field. It wasn't a field down the street, it wasn't one around the corner, it wasn't a different church, it was in that same field. Where there were real fruit, there was also something that was false. And he says what you need to know about the church age is that it's going to be a confusing age, because that which is real is going to be right in there with that which is false. and everybody's going to call themselves wheat. They aren't all wheat. He continues that teaching in Matthew 7 when he says things like this. He expands on it and he says, while there is wheat and there are tares, you need to know something. It's not that hard to tell them apart. By their fruit you shall know them. Good trees produce good fruit. Bad trees produce bad fruit. I said salt, you are the salt of the earth. Remember before, I said you are the salt of the earth. Jesus didn't say you should be the salt of the earth. He said if you're a believer, if Jesus is alive in you, you will be. That's who you are. Good trees produce good fruit. Bad trees don't. But then he warns about that and says this. Not everyone who says, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom. In fact, many, many will say, Lord, Lord, look at all I've done. Look at how I've prophesied and look at how I've cast out demons and look how I've performed miracles and built these churches, all these wonderful things. And I will declare to you, depart from me, I never knew you. The church age in all its glory is also a very confusing age because that which is real is growing up right next to that which is false. And I just wonder if while I was describing the glory of the church, some of you weren't getting goosebumps because you were thinking, I don't see that. I see us talking about that but I don't see that very often I see a church that talks about faith and it talks about glory and it talks about God but I don't see us entering into those kinds of things I see us as impotent and our impotence I believe is often caused by two things one one the lack of understanding that the church age is a confusing age, that there are wheat and tares, that not all who say Lord, Lord are entering into the kingdom. That's one of the reasons that we have tension in the church. Not all those who say Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom. Again, I've said this a million times, but you will never have unity between a tare and a wheat. You can't have it, even though they're right there in the middle. The second thing is this. Not only will impotence be generated by our lack of understanding and awareness that this is a fact, but secondly, the thing that will destroy the church and render us impotent is failing, having seen that and understand that, failing to do anything about it. That will render us impotent as well. I want you to hear this. I believe as evangelicals, we somehow think that we are immune to this problem. I don't think it's true. I don't think we're immune to this problem. I believe that because of the fact that as evangelicals, we have made a verbal commitment to the Word of God, and that is good. Every one of us believe that the Word of God is the Word of God. And we need to hold it high. And we sometimes think, I'm afraid, that because we have made that verbal commitment, that God's Word is true, that somehow that's going to kind of ferret out all the true and the false things. we see this problem in the liberal church you see the weed and the tears oh yeah i can see it over there we even have people come to our church from other churches and they say to us and we feel real encouraged because they say things like this oh man i just saw so many people who call themselves christians but they weren't and i come here and i did it out and we get this idea because we verbally hold up the word of god and preach the word of god that the problem isn't here if we believe that I think we're in trouble because we'll never confront it when we see it we'll never even recognize it we'll never even look for it how do you think Satan could render us powerless most effectively how do you think he would attack well I think he'd come in with liberalism and modernism and communism and some other ism you know these isms are dangerous I don't think he would do that because I believe with all my heart that persecution from the outside does not destroy the church it makes it stronger how would he do it then And from the inside, that's how. Every time. You know how? With tares among the wheat. With religious people who say, Lord, Lord. Who say all the right stuff. Who are externally spiritual. But they are false brethren who hinder the work of God. And I believe with all my heart that unless the church of Jesus Christ, one, knows that principle. Knows that that is a principle operative in the church. Jesus warned about it. and two is willing to confront the issue the church will flounder at best and be devoured at worst how do you deal with it you said first of all recognize the problem how do you deal with it not only did jesus talk about the church in glorious terms and not only did jesus teach the disciples that it would be a confusing time because false is right in there with truth he told us how he showed us how he showed us how you see even before the church age came we had people. There were people who were this kind of person, who were tares among the wheat, who were not true believers, who were not true people of God. The people you might even already thought of them, they were the Pharisees. They were the Pharisees. Externally, they looked great. Externally, they were real spiritual. They were the pious of the pious. They were the devout of the devout. They were the concerned of the concerned. They were literally the leaders of the spiritual people. the reality about them with all of their external show was this they were vipers hypocrites problem was they had such a good act oh man how do you cut through that they look so good they look so right everybody was intimidated by them they were slick how do you confront them they never made a mistake they always said it right you know even in dialogues with jesus you can kind of flip through your mind and through into the gospels when Jesus was dealing with Pharisees. And remember when the ox fell in the ditch and the disciples held him out and helped him out and the Pharisees came to Jesus with this question. They said, oh, Jesus, what about the Sabbath? You know what? They didn't give a rip about the Sabbath. They had all these double questions sounding real spiritual like they cared about. They They didn't care about the Sabbath. They wanted to nail Jesus. And then the woman in adultery. The Pharisees come to Jesus and say, What does the law say? Sounding real spiritual. Got all sorts of concern. They didn't care at all about that woman. They didn't care at all about the law. What did Jesus do? What did Jesus do with these tears? What did Jesus do with these people who looked real good, but they weren't real at all? He said, Oh my, did I do that? I didn't mean to make a mistake. I'll try to do it the way you want to do it. I'll figure it out. What is it that you want me to do, Pharisee? I'll do that way. Huh. He didn't do that at all. When he saw hypocrisy, he confronted it. Even, I want you to know something, when somebody comes at you like that, like a Pharisee, and they're slick, and they look like they're real concerned, only they're not, it's real hard to confront. It's real hard, right? Pharisees look good. He confronted it. I want you to turn, in fact, to see a confrontation of the Pharisees in Matthew 23. if I can find it Matthew 23 here's what he says to the Pharisees woe to you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites for you tithe mint and dill and cumin and you have neglected the weightier provisions of the law justice and mercy and faithfulness but these are the things that you should have done without neglecting the others you blind guides he's blowing them up who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. Verse 25. For you clean, I like this, for what you do is clean the outside of the cup. Get that picture. You clean the outside of the cup and of the dish so that the outside of it may become clean also. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites, for you are like whitewashed tombs. On the outside, you know, a pillar, a little pillar looking real good, a whitewashed tomb. But inside you're full of dead men's bones and other uncleanness. Even so, you too outwardly, outwardly appear to be righteous men. Ha ha! But inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. Woe to you, scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build tombs of the prophets, adorn the monuments of the righteous, all this wonderful activity, and say, if I had been living in the days of the fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets. Consequently, you bear witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up the measure of the guilt of your fathers. You serpents, brutal. You brutal vipers, how shall you escape the sentence of hell? Answer, you won't. Guess what? Guess what? The inception of the church age did not mark the end of Pharisaism. Pharisaism simply took the cloak of legalistic Christianity, external religious fervor, phony piety, evil hypocrisy, very spiritual looking people on their way straight to hell. This, beloved, is the issue of Galatians chapter 4, verse 5. I bet you were wondering why I was saying all that when we were in Galatians. This is the issue of Galatians chapter 4 and chapter 5. And there is a reason I said all that before we got to the text. It's this. Every once in a while, I think as we study the Word of God, we need to get the big picture. We need to realize that as we are studying these principles of legalism in the book of Galatians, that this is not some sort of isolated incident. That it is some sort of thing that Paul is just kind of riding on. That it just happened to be the problem of the Galatians. You need to know, and I need to have affirmed in my mind, that Jesus warned about it. Paul dealt with it. And we need to deal with it too. Let me catch you up. with the text. The problem in the book of Galatia, these Galatian churches, first of all, was legalism. These people were no longer living in freedom. They began to wrap themselves in externals. They were living in bondage, and they were exhibiting no life in their living. They were exhibiting no evidence of God's presence in their life. Paul looked at that, and he said, I don't get it. When I see people who have been set free living in bondage, that doesn't wash. I don't get it. When I see people in whom God dwells, but there is no evidence of God's dwelling, I don't get it. But there's three possibilities. There's three reasons why that can happen. One reason is this. Maybe they forgot who they were. Every time a Christian stumbles or falls into faithlessness, doesn't necessarily mean they aren't a Christian. That's a real dangerous conclusion to jump to. Paul spent a lot of time, you remember, in chapter 4. Back to chapter 4, Galatians. You remember in chapter 4, he spent a lot of time identifying to these Galatian believers who they were in Jesus. Over and over he said, listen, you are not under the law. You're under grace. You're not under this Pidegogos, this guy with this little stick bouncing you around. You have come to the master teacher. You are no longer a slave. Now you're a son. You are no longer a child. Now you are an heir. You need to wake up to who you are and quit letting these false brethren infect you with this legalistic message. But there's another reason why this could happen. There's another reason why people who look like they've been set free are living in bondage. And that is this. They never really were set free. You see, they were stillborn. Chapter 4, verse 11. I fear for you that perhaps I have labored over you in vain. Remember what that means? That doesn't mean that Paul, the preacher, the apostle, the missionary, went to the field and worked real hard and tried real hard to get these people, but they never did respond. I just worked so hard. It doesn't mean that. The word labored has to do with giving birth to a child. He says basically this, the reason I don't see any life in your life is because there is none. You are stillborn. We went through some motions. We went through a few spiritual gyrations. It felt like birth was coming, but evidently it was a stillborn. You were in a spiritual abortion. I think we need to confront this again in our church. We need to confront this in our Christian living and dealing even with our kids and our young people. Very often when we see people who grew up in the church and they had some sort of spiritual gyration sometime in their life, it may be that they need to be reminded of who they are. But we need to at least consider the possibility that the reason there is no evidence of life is because there is no life. They were stillborn. But there is one more thing. There is one more possibility that explains the behavior of legalism in the life of someone who calls himself a believer. One more explanation. in the life of someone who calls himself a believer for having no evidence of real spirit life. And this is where it ties in with what I've been saying in my introduction. It is the problem of the Pharisees in the church age. It is the parallel, beloved, to Matthew 7, Matthew 13, and Matthew 23. It is this. Lots of people say, Lord, Lord. Lots of people say, Lord, Lord. Lots of people say, Abraham is my father, God is my father, the alliance is my denomination, and this is my church. What we need to realize is this. While many may claim to be sons of Abraham, Paul says, by the way, we are now in chapter 4, verse 22. While many may claim to be sons of Abraham, what you need to realize is that Abraham had two sons. Abraham had two sons. One of them was legitimate, the other was illegitimate. One was born of faith, the other was born of flesh. One was born of natural causes, the other was born of supernatural causes. The Spirit of God was the only thing that made that happen. Then he told them why he told them that in verse 29. Why is he going through all this stuff, identifying a natural born son and a supernaturally born son? The illegitimate and the legitimate. I'm going to tell you why. Because that fact explains why there is tension in this Galatian church. I'll tell you why. Verse 29. But as at that time, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also. The reason there is strife in this Galatian church, the reason there is tension, the reason these people are living in bondage, the reason they have not been set free is the same kind of problem that the Pharisees had. Many people say, Lord, Lord. Many people call Abraham their father. Not all are. And what you need to know is those people who are not supernaturally born of God will attack the ones who are. So what do you do? What do you do? Two things. Verse 30, cast out the bondwoman and her son. Discipline. I'm not going to go into that now. We dealt with it before. And then chapter 5, verse 1. Here's the second thing you do. When you realize that fact, You keep standing firm in the freedom with which Christ has set you free. Chapter 5, verse 1. In other words, don't you give in to the naturally born illegitimate son of Abraham. And then he continued to warn them as we get into chapter 2 through 6. We dealt with this for two weeks. He warned them, listen, I am telling you the situation. It's just like when Jesus was here. There were Pharisees who looked real spiritual, but they were vipers. In our church, in the Galatian church, there are those who are supernaturally born of God. There are those who are not. And if you give in, spiritually or physically, to those who are not born of the Spirit of God, you need to know what the results are going to be. First of all, Christ will be of no benefit to you, verse 2. You are a debtor to the whole law, verse 3. You are severed from Christ, verse 4. You are fallen from grace. Verse 4 again. Today, with a passion and I believe with a degree of anger, the Apostle Paul continues his warning to these people concerning this. There's five more things that I want us to know about the Ishmaels. Those are, by the way, that is the naturally born son of Abraham, not a true born son of God. They are not believers. They are not Christians. They look very much like it, but they are pharisaical. Absolutely. What you need to know, the Apostle Paul says, is this. There are five things you need to know. First of all, you need to know this. Point one. Ishmael's naturally born people hinder the truth. They keep you from running. Verse 7. You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? Point one. Know this. They hinder the truth of God. I want to look at this verse real quickly and teach it. Who hindered you from running? Who hindered you from obeying the truth? This little word who is very important. We need to understand it. He is asking a rhetorical question here. When he says, who hindered you from running well? Who hindered you from obeying the truth? He doesn't want to know their name. He knows, okay? They know who it is. It's the Ishmaels. It's the Judaizers. It's the legalists. That's who did it. He doesn't want to know their name. What he is asking, this who is very specific in the Greek. It means this. What kind of person is this? Let me say it a different way so you get the meaning. Galatians who in the world would you allow to do this to you? that's what he means he doesn't want to know his name he doesn't want to know who they are they know who they are who in the world it's as if it should be that who is like in capital letters who in the world would you allow to do this to you to bring you back into bondage having been set free I want you to notice something about Paul's rebuke to these people it is a loving rebuke even though it's full of all sorts of strong words it is a loving rebuke. It's as if he's taking these people by the neck and saying, listen, you guys are Isaacs. You have been set free by Christ. You have been indwelt by his spirit. What in the world are you doing? I just went to a football game last Friday night. My brother's a coach. I love to watch him coach. He had a time where he had to grab his kids by the neck in love and rattle their cage a little bit. He said, you guys don't understand how good you are. And he yelled at him like that. He just yelled at him, you don't know how good you are. It's like he's mad at him, but they got all fired up. He really thinks we're good. Paul's doing the same thing. Can you catch that? Paul's doing the same thing. He's saying, you guys are Isaacs. What in the world are you giving in to Ishmael? Naturally born people for. I don't even get it. Wake up. Who in the world could possibly have that much power, that much influence, that much intimidation? Who could be intimidating you to the point that you would actually relinquish your freedom and your joy in Jesus to them? And again, I hear that ringing in my ear. Listen, you are an Isaac. You are an Isaac. That illegitimate imposter has nothing on you. There's something else to grasp here, though. And it's a principle I want you to know. The work of the Ishmaels in the church of Jesus Christ is not benign. That's the whole point of this point. They hinder the truth. The work of the Ishmaels in the church of Christ is not benign. Get this. If you're taking notes, I want you to write this down. they actively, underline that twice, they actively hinder the work of God in the church. I know that from chapter 4, verse 29. As at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also for them and also for us. Remember when I preached Hebrews chapter 12 and we talked about running the race. Run the race with endurance and put off all the things that entangle you and slow you down. And we talked about the fact that in the church, very often things get in our way that hinder us from running well. People very often get on the track that I am running and very often they are uncommitted Christians, people who haven't really seen the warfare and aren't committed to running the race. And they kind of stand in the way and we have to spend all sorts of time getting around them and working around them and all that kind of stuff. Okay, you remember that. I want you to know that that's not what this is saying. that's not what this is saying those people, uncommitted Christians stand in the track, they get in the way they are a nuisance and I've got all sorts of problems with them and they keep us from running well but that is not what this text is saying it's saying something far more profound than that it is saying this they do not just stand there in the track they actively try to get you to stop running well they are an actively negative influence in the church that's what a naturally born Ishmael is this pharisaical type looks real spiritual their activity is actively evil they sow seeds of dissension they plot and scheme against what God is doing they don't think they're doing that but that's exactly what they do that is their job that is who they are that's who they are and I want you to know something that by not recognizing that this is in the church not recognizing and affirming that what Jesus said about the church age wheat and tares is true by not recognizing that it is here and then resisting it and confronting it, God's desire for this church, open door, could be stifled. Giving in to the Ishmaels means we stop running. You can't run. And some of us think, nah, that could never happen. That could never happen. God will rule. God will rule. He is in control. You know what? That is absolutely right. God is in control, and He will rule if God's people have the courage to live by faith and believe Him. And part of living by faith, and part of obeying what God has called us to do, is dealing with the Ishmael problem. And you're going to see that even more clear as we get down to some other points. But if we don't deal with it, if we don't recognize its existence, and at least have eyes to be aware of it, God's purposes in this church will be stifled We will stop running Example, Moses with the people of God in the wilderness Had escaped from the land of Egypt by faith We're moving God had given him a promise It was this, the promised land All sorts of wonderful things And he said all you have to do is believe me every step of the way Believe me for things you can't see For things you can't feel When you think everything is being deserted You just keep believing me and stepping out in faith. You keep stepping out in faith. And they had great leadership. They had good direction. They had demonstrations of power in their midst. And you know what they did? They wandered in the wilderness for 40 years. Why? I believe they quit running. Somewhere along the line, they started listening to the Ishmaels. Something I want you to know about the Ishmaels even in that midst, in that particular group. The Ishmaels were not many in number. The false brethren were not many in number. In fact, in a few minutes, I'm going to refer to a text in 2 Timothy that indicates that Moses' opposition were by two men, specifically Janus and Jambres. And they opposed Moses. But you know what they did? They were the ones who actively opposed. The problem is this. They infected the whole group so that as a congregation, as a group, they failed to believe God. They wandered in the wilderness. they listened to the Ishmaels. They stopped running. At another time in their history, remember this? They went to Kadesh Barnea, and they were just about to enter the promised land. God said to them, you just possessed the land. They sent out spies. They sent out spies. It was wonderful. They came back with this report. We look like grasshoppers in their sight. We look like grasshoppers in their sight. We don't have a chance. We better not go. There were only two people who came back with a report that sounded anything like an Isaac. It was Caleb and Joshua. And they said this, you're right, the walls are big. You're right, they are huge. You're right, it is a land of milk and honey, and they have much more physically than we do. But we can go, and God can prevail. Who'd they listen to? The Ishmaels, that's who. What happened? Nothing. Nothing. They stopped running. They didn't go to the promised land. Not then. Ishmaels, with their lack of faith, with their lack of vision, with their spiritual blindness, hinder the work of God in the church. That's their job, that's who they are. Secondly, they're not of God. Secondly, they're not of God. Verse 8, This persuasion did not come from him who calls you. This legalism that has infected the church, this external stuff, did not come from the one, here it's literally, did not come from the one who set you free. Why did he tell them that? Wouldn't that be obvious? Wouldn't that be obvious that this message, This legalism, this stuff from Ishmael would just be dripping with venom so everyone would see and they would just be able to spot it. Can't they tell? That's exactly the problem. I hope this picture is beginning to get a little more clear to you. That's exactly the problem with the Ishmael thing. That's exactly the problem with the Pharisee. Pharisaical legalism looks good. It's real slick. Remember Matthew 23. You spend all this time cleaning and polishing the outside of the cup problem, inside it's poison. And you've got all these wonderful tombs that are just beautiful, whitewashed sepulchres, but they're full of dead men's bones. Remember false teachers? When we first went into Galatians, when we first got into the study, we talked about what a false teacher looks like. What do they look like? They have fangs. They look like Snidely Whiplash, remember? They have fangs. they hiss and they spit venom and they walk around saying, Jesus is a curse. Jesus is a curse. No, they don't. That would be wonderful. We'd spot them right now. No, they don't. They put on a cloak of decency. They're hard to spot. When legalism comes into the church, you better know it's not from God. It's not from God. Ishmael's, one, hinder the truth. Two, are not from God. Three, they contaminate the church. This is brutal. Verse 9. a little leaven leavens the whole lump this is a simple proverb it's used often in scripture it is a symbol of sin I think that when most of us think of this particular verse we think of it in context with sexual immorality don't we? a little leaven leavens the whole lump 1 Corinthians 5 Paul is dealing with that in a church in Corinth and someone was living with with his father's mother or something like that oh well it was immoral it was a bad thing to do okay and we think of that it's real obvious and then the whole point was that a little leaven you let that kind of sexual immorality live in the church and not deal with it it will infect and effect the entire church body in fact it had they had begun to really kind of think well we understand grace because we put up with this we're just kind of accepting free people they didn't understand grace at all. It is a symbol of sin, but we need to realize that this parable, this little proverb, I mean, was used in different ways. In Matthew chapter 16, verse 6, it says, beware, friends, of the leaven of the Pharisees. Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees. What was their leaven? It was not sexual immorality. It was not that at all. No Pharisee would ever be involved in that. It was an internal thing. They were hypocrites. They had all the external stuff, but nothing was real inside. The real thrust, however, of this little proverb, verse 9, a little leaven leavens the whole lump, is this emphasis on a little. A little. It doesn't take much to pollute and render impotent the body of Christ. Just a little leaven. The whole point of leaven is you have this goal, and you just put a little smidgen of leaven in there, and it goes through the whole thing right now. I've got to be honest with you. My feeling is this, that I don't believe most Christians take this seriously. I don't think we do. In fact, I believe to a large degree, we take verses like that, and we would nod our head, and we go, oh yeah, that's true, I can see it happening, oh yes. But to a large degree, I believe we disregard it. And here's why I think we disregard it. I believe we disregard it, and our disregarding of it can be demonstrated in the fact that most of us take great comfort in the fact that in our church, we can be pretty sure that the number of Ishmaels is very small in number. It's a very small number. We take great comfort in the fact that most of us are Isaacs. And I like that too. I address the people of God here, and I assume to a large degree that I am speaking to people people in whom the Spirit of God dwells. Maybe there's a few Ishmaels. You want to know something? Paul does not give us any reason to have comfort in that fact. If we really do believe the Word of God is the Word and we take it seriously as we say we do, there is no reason for comfort in the fact that maybe there's just a few Ishmaels among us. No reason at all. Why? A little leaven leavens the whole lump. And they hinder you from running well. They actively attack. Let me give you an illustration. Old Testament. Remember Achan? Remember Achan? Many of you don't. Now you will. God was blessing the people of Israel and they were winning great victories. In fact, God had promised them victory after victory after victory. All they had to do was believe God and one other thing, they couldn't take any spoils for themselves. Individuals. And they were winning victories and God was blessing and the spirit was moving and they all sensed it and they were all happy and God was doing a work among them. And then what Achan did was this. He took some spoils for himself and he dug a hole in his tent and he put them in there and he buried them. It was wonderful. No one will know. No one will be able to tell but something happened, you see. Something happened. Immediately, there was something that in the camp among God's people, the blessing was gone. The victory was gone and it might have even been just something they sensed all of a sudden, what's wrong? I remember feeling God's presence and knowing he was real and moving among us and now, what? I don't know what it is. Maybe it's us. Maybe we've done something. I don't get it. And they began to be defeated and it was as if the presence of God had departed. Well, it had. Why is that? Because a little leaven leavens the whole lump. That's why. You know what they did? They found him and they disciplined him. In fact, they did more than I think I'd be willing, well, I know I'd be willing to do. They killed him and his family and they buried him under a bunch of stones. Now, wait a minute. Dave, this is getting a little crazy. You know, I'm all for this Ishmael Isaac stuff. I'm all for understanding the distinction. In fact, I've never even heard this before. It's really exciting. And I feel like I'm really growing under this. But what are you going to do? I mean, it sounds like if we follow through with what you're saying here, we're just going to go on this big witch hunt. Did you see it? We'll have a questionnaire. See if you're really an Ishmael or Isaac. Are you an Ishmael? We're just going to do do do do do do do do. A little spoof, you know, little eyeglasses, and we'll be looking under everybody's mail to see if they're Ishmaels. It'll be a little conquest, an inquest. All these people, everybody would be scared if they think I'm an Ishmael. I wonder if they think I'm an Ishmael. You know, that's a disgusting mentality. That would, you know, under the guise of preaching liberty and grace, we'd become the most legalistic, fearful kind of church you can imagine. No, that's not what I mean at all. No, we wouldn't do that. We're not here to go worry about ferreting out the Ishmaels. I don't have time, for one thing. The other thing is I don't know if I can do it well. The other thing is this, I don't have to. Teaching here, listen, teaching here, I don't have to. And neither do you. You know why? They expose themselves, that's why. They expose themselves. Let me tell you why. Let me tell you how. 2 Timothy, here's the text I was referring to before. Turn to it. Well, you don't need to turn to it. I can read it. 2 Timothy 3, verses 8 and 9 says this, And just as Jonas and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men, who are these men? They were false brethren. So these men also will oppose the truth. He was talking about a problem that Timothy was having. He was referring back to Moses, who had the same problem. You ever think that nothing is new under the sun? The same problem Moses had, Timothy had, Paul had, we have. Just as Janus and Jambres opposed Moses, so these false brethren also will oppose the truth. But, get excited, you ready to get excited? But, they will not make further progress. Why? This is great. For their folly will be obvious to all. They'll expose themselves. everything they say reveals faithlessness everything they do reveals who they are 1 Corinthians 11 verses 18 and 19 says the same thing in essence he says this to this church in Corinth I hear that there are divisions and factions among you what you need to know is these things need to be what? what do you mean? we're supposed to be united and blissful and skipping down with our hands held in flowers, daisies What do you mean? There will be divisions and factions and these things need must be. I'll tell you why they need to be. Because when divisions and factions come, here's what happens. Those who are approved become apparent. And those who are not do too. I don't got time to go ferreting them out. They'll expose themselves. What do we do then? Go, okay, there they are. There they are. Now we'll ignore them. Now we'll make sure that their voice is not heard in the church guess what can't do it can't do it why because a little leaven leavens the whole lump that's why discipline in the church we're real quick to discipline immorality we jump all over that but hypocrisy I hate to do this because my dad is here this morning and I don't want to embarrass him but I want to tell you something. I am thankful to God that I grew up in a church where we heard preaching that just didn't talk about faith. I saw faith in our church. We kept stepping out beyond what was reasonable. We kept stepping out into areas that we didn't have any control and believed God and God was always there and we grew and I as a young person grew because of that. I want to tell you something else. I grew up in a church also that disciplined sin. Didn't just talk about discipline. Discipline did it. And I remember one incident in particular that it wasn't about sexual immorality at all. It was about a bitter person who evidenced, exposed, that person exposed himself to be not of God at all. And they disciplined that person. Real irony about that church, real irony was this, that church preached grace. And I want to tell you something, it was the kind of grace we talked about last week. It wasn't the double message. It was on one track. It was so much on one track that sometimes people in the area who didn't go to that church, who didn't really understand what was going on in that church, sometimes looked at that church and said, oh, all they do is talk about grace and freedom. And they're just libertines and they just do anything they want to do. They just talk about grace, grace, freedom, acceptance, love. Oh, wonderful. Where do you take a stand? No, the irony of that church, that church that spoke grace also disciplines sin more than any other church I'd ever known. How does that go together? How do you put those, they seem to contradict. Grace is free and love and acceptance and everybody and we'll just include you all and then discipline right out of the church. Why is that? I'll tell you why it is. Catch this. Oh, I want you to see this. You know why it goes together? Because people who preach grace and teach grace and it's on one message, you know what grace does? It drives the message into the heart. It doesn't allow anymore for externals to rule at all. It exposes that which is external. It drives the message to the heart. And if at the heart you are not real, you will be exposed by grace. I'll tell you something. When I look at our church, I get so excited. Churches go through periods of time where there are breakthroughs. I even look for them. I look in our church's life and I see breakthroughs, a little thing where it's just struggle, struggle, struggle. I don't see it. I don't see it all of a sudden. Bam, a breakthrough. I go, wow, and there's life. What am I talking about? Last week, I think we had a breakthrough. I think we had a breakthrough last week. It was in the area of faith. Tuesday night at our quarterly meeting we adopted a budget that we do not have the ability to handle for the first time since I've been here we have got something that we cannot do God's gonna and we are demonstrating you know what's exciting to me that the kids are growing up in the same kind of church I grew up in where we don't just talk about faith but we have stepped out in faith and we're going to see God provide that need and we're going to see God move among you as God moves on you to give and meet the need and see that challenge met and exceeded. My feeling is this. We ain't seen nothing yet in terms of stepping out in faith. But you know what? That step, that physical step of faith, moving into a budget that is more than we can afford, took time to get there. We would preach on faith and preach on faith and preach on faith and everybody would go, oh yeah, we need to have faith. Oh, pastor, I just appreciated that sermon. that was really good then we broke through and did it see then you break through and did it I want to tell you something else and this is something I don't know if it's going to come today tomorrow next year two years I hope not long agreeing like this in principle to the principle of discipline like we so often agree in principle to the principle of faith but not only just agreeing with the principle of discipline but as a church beginning to do it. I feel like I'm playing the part of a prophet who is saying, this is where we need to go, and if we don't, we're going to be in trouble. I believe that's the next major breakthrough that we need to see. These Ishmaels hinder the truth. They're not of God. They contaminate the church. Third, they will be... Fourth, they will be judged. Verse 10. They will be... I have confidence in you, Paul says, in the Lord, that you will adopt no other view. I want to stop right there and explain. I want you to notice how he qualifies this I have confidence in you stop that you will adopt no other view I have confidence that you will see this and agree but he doesn't have confidence that everybody will see it and agree I have confidence in you qualification in the Lord those of you who are in the Lord in whom Jesus is I have every confidence that those of you who are supernaturally born sons of Abraham Isaac will have no other view than this. Won't be any argument from you. He really sets him up, doesn't he? If you disagree with this, you're in trouble. And he does, and I agree. And it's right. But know this. But the one who is disturbing you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is. Legalists, I think we get the picture, but sometimes you just need to say it. Legalists, Ishmaels, are not just Christians who got a different perspective on things. Legalists are false teachers, wolves in sheep's clothing targeted for the judgment of God. If you begin to believe that you can do it yourself, you have defiled the gospel. We said that last week as well. You got to keep it on one track. Ishmael's hindered the truth. They're not from God. They contaminate the church. They will be judged. Fifth, they always persecute true teachers. One of the ways you can tell an Ishmael is they do this. Verse 11. but I brethren if I still preach circumcision why am I still being persecuted why am I still being persecuted now I need to explain this verse because it's really bizarre I mean when I first looked at it I thought it was totally off the wall it didn't fit in with the flow at all let me explain it this way like Pharisees Judaizers and Ishmaels are very excuse me are very very hard to confront the reason is is all of their religion is external everything they have is external beloved that is all they have There is nothing internal. And what they do, because they have such a good external game going, and they are so able to feign sincerity, and feign cooperation, and even feign support, what happened in this church specifically was this. These Judaizers, Ishmaels, came into the Galatian cities and said this, We know you love Paul, and we love him too. Baloney. They hated Paul. We love him too. And we now want you to know that Paul's with us. Paul's with us. He approves of circumcision. And I'll tell you, I'll give you the proof. You see, he circumcised Timothy. Guess what he did? He did. In fact, in Acts chapter 16, verses 1 through 3, he took Timothy and had him circumcised. What we need to know is this. We don't have time to teach this whole thing. What we need to know is this. Paul did not circumcise Timothy because if he did, he'd be more spiritual. He did not circumcise Timothy because if he did, he would be saved. He did not circumcise him for any external reason other than this. It didn't make him any more spiritual at all. It was this. Timothy was part Jew and part Greek. He was being called of God to minister to Jews. He had never been circumcised. Paul said this. For expediency's sake, for the ability of you to minister to these people with freedom and not have any kind of stumbling block at all, this does not make you more spiritual, but if it gives you a better reception with them, why don't you get circumcised? He said, fine, no problem. We'll do it. they use that on Paul to say he's with us he believes in circumcision Paul says this listen folks if I really am doing that why are they still persecuting me that's not true let me ask you a question why do Ishmaels attack true teachers you ever think on that Why do these Pharisees, why do these Judaizers, naturally born, why do they spend so much time attacking the true teachers? I'll tell you why. It's very, very apparent. We see it from the Pharisees in Jesus' day, to the Judaizers in this day, to our day as well. The reason they attack is this. True teachers expose their hypocrisy. So it happens. You know what? Legalists thrive in a legalistic church. Legalists thrive in a church where teaching is mush. Where we get little sermonettes for Christianettes and everybody kind of floats along. Everybody's great. Legalists thrive in that. If you begin to get good teaching and deep teaching, the word of God begins to be heard. What happens is hypocrisy begins to be exposed because falsehood cannot exist with truth. Keeps shedding light on it. Keeps shedding light on it. True teachers go past the external. True teachers drive to the heart. True teachers destroy the law. The Pharisees hated Jesus. Why? Why? Because he said he was the Messiah, partly. But I'll tell you why they really hated him. I'll tell you why something seethed inside of them and wanted to see him crucified eventually did. I'll tell you why. Because they exposed, he exposed them as being the hypocrites that they were. And all of this massive religious thing that they had built around them was crumbling in his presence. That, by the way, when it refers to the stumbling, then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished. That is what the stumbling block of the cross is. The stumbling block of the cross is this, that the cross comes into your measly, selfish, external show of religion and blows it up, says it doesn't mean a thing. If there's not something inside you, if the Spirit of God is not inside you, you have nothing, Pharisee. What could make him more angry? Nothing. Finally, he wraps it up with this personal thought in verse 12. Would that those who are troubling you with this external mush, with this legalism, with this Ishmael mentality, would that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves. Think he sounds a little angry? I think he does. You know what it means? I'm almost embarrassed to say. What it means literally is the word mutilate means to castrate. Unless you think that Paul is just kind of giving them some sort of sanctified go jump in the lake. You know, I wish that those guys would just go jump in the lake. I wish that those guys would just go fly a kite. I wish those guys would just go mule like themselves. He's not doing that. It's more than that. It sounds like that, but it's more than that. You see, there was in that area, he's saying this, if you guys want to move into legalistic stuff, If you want to get all excited about circumcision and all these external things that indicate that you're really holy, you want to get all excited about that, I'll tell you what, you go all the way. He is angry. He is spitting. He is furious. He says, if you want to just introduce all this little external stuff, you do this. Go ahead, do it. But go all the way. Go all the way. Don't just circumcise yourself. Go all the way. And it wasn't even, still, it just wasn't just crude. He was saying something that those Galatians specifically would relate to. You see, in that area there was the Phrygians. They had a goddess called Sibel. And all the priests of that temple, in an act of reverence, in an act of trying to earn merit and favor with this goddess, would do, in fact, that act upon themselves. And it was recognized by everybody as being totally pagan. You know what Paul's saying in his 12th verse? He's saying this, legalism is pagan. Legalism is pagan. It isn't just another brand of Christianity. beloved Paul loved the church and when phony pharisaical naturally born Ishmael threatened it and hindered it and contaminated it and attacked it he went to war my prayer is this that we would love the church as much to go to war for it know this Ishmael's hinder you from running they are not of God they contaminate the church they always persecute true teachers beloved it was for freedom that christ that is free therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery you know what i do not believe that we can be successful in spiritual things unless we realize that success in spiritual things means entering into a war but i want you to know this as well isaacs as we discover who we are in jesus as we discover who God is, as we begin as a body of believers to really believe God, you know this too. As we enter into warfare, it is a war we cannot lose. In fact, it is a war that's already won. All we have to do is believe. Let's pray. Father, I feel in my heart that you have spoken. I thank you for your word. that goes so deep and plunges the depths and exposes and reveals and encourages all at once. Thank you for this morning, for the singing, for the music, for your spirit's presence. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
