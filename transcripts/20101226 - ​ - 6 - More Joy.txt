Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Let's praise we go to the Word. Father, I thank you for the work of your Spirit, the context of our worship and singing. And I pray now that as we break open the word, your spirit would be strong in this as well. And I pray it in your name. Amen. Last week, if you were here, I'm sure you remember that we lit the fourth candle of Advent, which is the candle of joy. And we talked about what Luke described in his gospel as the good news of great joy. Luke 2, verse 10. And don't be afraid. The angel said to the shepherds, for I bring you good news of great joy, which was and is designed by God to not be just for a few, but to somehow, to someway get to and touch all people. And that one of the primary ways that that actually happens in real life, that it actually gets to all people, is when people, particularly God's people, begin to go and do the kinds of things that God through Christ would go and do. And as it turns out, what God through Christ went and did the most was to give. Remember this? And to give, and to give, and to give, and to give, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. And through his son, in a variety of manifested ways, he gave, and he gave, and he gave, and he gave. And then Jesus turned to this ragtag group of people who had come to so believe in him and to love him so much that they wanted actually to be like him. He turned to them near the end of his earthly ministry and said in effect this to them, now you go and do what I have gone and done, which is to give and to give and to give. and as you do, that will bring joy to more than just a few. For this good news of great joy is designed by God to somehow, to some way, be for all people. And if you were here last week, you also know that we actually got a little taste of that joy as we invited you to give. Remember that at the end of the service, the sermon was preached. Stephan then told you that at the back of the auditorium were gonna be buckets and we were gonna, because we're the community of Jesus and we think this joy can spread when we give and people receive what they need. We ask you to give whatever it was you had. And if you're here, I know you remember. And others of you who might have need were in that same service invited to go to those same buckets and take out of those buckets whatever it was that you needed. And we had a couple of songs for all that to happen and people ran. It was interesting. I mean, it was no hesitation at all. People moved to those buckets and gave and gave and gave and others who needed received. And all of it was joy. There were stories. all week long coming in of joy. For those who had need, it was joy. For those who gave, it was joy. There were tears of joy, unexpected joy. Some of you didn't have any cash, but you wanted to give, so you gave gift cards. There were gift cards back there. People gave watches and jewelry. Someone gave a ring. We don't know what to do with it, so please take it back. I'm kidding. I don't know. You guys, the stories, it was like the ushers kind of had a front row seat to this whole thing. As you can imagine, kind of back there, all of you are kind of looking this forward, so you don't really know what's going on back there. But our ushers were kind of back there, and they noticed someone's hesitation, helped this weeping woman take what she needed, and then they gave her a little bit more, and that was joy. We heard stories, again, from the ushers, watching people come and go to the bucket. Some of them were putting in, some of them were taking out, not knowing what to do or how to help, and so often they just prayed. We heard stories of people coming out and coming back in to give, sometimes a little more, to take maybe what they really needed, and all of it was joy. In fact, I got this email from Deb Rav, one of our head usher, and the stories were amazing. I don't know if I'm going to take all this time to do this, but I kind of do. One usher noticed a lady by herself frozen midway to the basket. She looked like she wanted to approach the basket, but just couldn't bring herself to do it. Some of you know exactly how that felt, because a lot of you who had need didn't go to take out of this. The usher approached her and learned she had a large electric bill and was unable to pay. He encouraged her to take the money out of the basket to cover the bill, but she couldn't move. He invited her to come with him, and he took her by the hands of the basket. She had previously told him the amount of the bill. He took out enough to cover that and then gave her some more, and he told her it was okay, and that's what the money's for. She was in tears. I love that story. You know what it is? It's joy. It's joy in the stories keep coming. Two ushers noticed a woman alone crying by a basket. They spoke with her and learned she'd been out of work for five years. They told her to take as much money from the basket as she needed. She was reluctant and filled with shame. They felt this shame on her so strongly that they prayed with her, anointed her with oil, provided her with the information regarding our benevolent fund, other churches that have job loss groups, etc., etc. The stories go on and on and on, and all of it was joy. And after everything was said and done, we still had $13,000 left over. because apparently one of the stories of all this giving another story was that people really were hesitant to take we had to kind of drag some of these people yeah no no no you take and take a little bit more and and so this week as we're talking about this what do we do what do we do with all that that that extra money yeah well well the answer to that is it's going to eventually go into what we have here is called the benevolent fund a word about that um a benevolent fund is used all year long, actually, to help meet the needs of open-door attenders in a variety of ways. It happens all year long. Just a few weeks ago, we sent out over $16,000 worth of gift cards to Cub and to Target to help people get through some of their holiday issues. And so that's kind of always going on. But before we just kind of dump it into the benevolent fund, we wanted this week, and didn't know how to do this, and I don't know if this is the best way, but this is the way we're going to do it. We wanted to give people an opportunity to kind of put their hand in a bucket like one more time, especially those of you who really have a need and you kind of think, other people have needs much greater than mine. We just want to ask you to get over that. And we want to give you an opportunity to put your hand in the bucket one more time. Here's how. You can call the church. That's one way. And maybe an even easier way, it would be to get online and get a hold of us at needhelpatthedoor.org. I have a feeling this information's in the bulletin or on our website, needhelpatthedoor.org. You just give us your need, and we will take care of that. The Benevolent Fund, there's going to be a limit on how much we can give right now. If you need more than what the limit is, then you can get involved in the Benevolent Fund. But we want to keep this thing going. And all of that brings me now to what I want to talk about today. Because I want to talk about joy. We talked about that last week. Well, that's why I've entitled this Sunday sermon, More Joy. I did. In part because I can't get enough of this. In part because we don't get enough of this. In part because sometimes we have a very difficult time finding this, experiencing this joy. And so today we're going to talk about joy when it's sometimes hard to find. It's interesting to me as it relates to this issue of joy because I grew up in a spiritual tradition that put a great emphasis on the deity of Christ. And that's a tradition I'm very grateful for. And it's an emphasis, the deity of Christ, that Jesus really was God. It's a very, very important thing to emphasize. And we emphasize it here. But an inadvertent result of that emphasis was that we, at least me, I, had a hard time sometimes entering into or imagining the humanity of Jesus. So the idea of Jesus, for instance, just having a good time, sitting around a campfire and laughing out loud. I mean, I don't mean just ha, ha, ha. I mean like a belly laugh. Hard to conceive, which is why I love to try and conceive it. I was told all my life to be like Christ, and we're all encouraged to be like Christ, and I always wanted that, and I still do want that. But sometimes I would wonder, was he like me? Was he at all like me? It's kind of hard to imagine. Especially when I think of being like a 10-year-old boy, Jesus, like me. It's hard to imagine. Probably not like me. Because Jesus, we're told this all from the scriptures, was a man of sorrows. The prophet Isaiah says, a man of sorrows was Jesus well acquainted with grief. So if he was joyful, and he probably was because he did everything right, even joy, it was probably kind of a serious, sober, measured, controlled kind of joy, like that kind of joy. Except, except that when Jesus went to a wedding and they ran out of wine, he made more. You ever wonder why? Well, this is weird because, you know, in this tradition I grew up in where it was all about the deity of Christ and Jesus really is God. The answer to that question was very clear. The reason he turned the water into wine was to affirm his deity. He turned water into wine to prove that he was God. I'm God. Want proof? Watch this. Water to wine. Here it is. And I think that does kind of lend some credence to something there. I would be suspicious of what's going on with him. But what if, in addition to that, okay, what if he turned the water to wine, And this sounds very irreverent, but kind of human. What if he did that to keep the party going? Nobody said that in my church. What if he did it to communicate in a very tangible, earthy, human way a little bit of what he was like and what life in the kingdom of God is like, that sometimes life in the kingdom, it's not every day, but sometimes it's like singing and dancing and laughing. for joy. In the Hebrew language, it's very helpful. Hebrew is helpful to us in giving us a picture here because the Hebrew communicates the meaning of a word through action. So when you get the meaning of a Hebrew word, it's not something you can just think of. It's almost like you have to see it. So joy, literally in the Hebrew, is translated or described as bright and shiny. And that's not something you think of. You have to see that. And you've seen bright and shining. I know you have, and you've seen it in many places. Almost always you'll see bright and shining at a wedding. On the face of the bride and the groom, on the face of the bride and the groom, what you will see is bright and shining. What you see there is joy. It's leaping and jumping too, literally in the Hebrew. Joy is leaping and jumping, bright and shining, because when people get struck with joy, when they just get affected by joy, they go all bright and shining. They might start leaping and jumping. they might go running around in circles. You ever seen anybody do that? Mostly children. You know who does it the most? Grandchildren. Whoa! And once they stop, running around in circles, because I start and then they follow. They never want to stop. I'm telling you, it's like a dog chasing a stick that you throw. And here's what you hear over and over again. Papa, do it again. Tickle me again. Taste me again. Find me again. Throw me up in the air again. Swing me round and round again and again and again. You know what that is? It's joy. Bright and shining, leaping, jumping, running around in circles, joy. You know what else it is? And it's hard to believe this, maybe, but it's God. It's who he is. It's what he does. Indeed, Jesus in John 15 told his disciples that at least part of his mission, wasn't the only thing, but it was part of his mission, was that he would be able somehow to put his joy into them. John 15, 11, that my, this is my prayer, that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be made complete. Which raises this question. Where'd it go? The joy, where all are bright and shining, jumping, leaping, running round in circles, where'd that go? G.K. Chesterton, and one of his most famous quotes from a book that he wrote entitled Orthodoxy, provides at least part of the answer, I think, when he says this. I'm quoting him here. He says, that the joy we see so instinctively in children is even more profound in God. Children have abounding vitality because they are in spirit fierce and free. Therefore, they want things repeated and unchanged. So they say, do it again, do it again. And the grown-up does it again until he's nearly dead. I love this. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough, he says, to exult in monotony. Is it possible that God says every morning, do it again to the sun. And every evening do it again to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike. It may be that God makes every daisy separately but has never gotten tired of making them. It may be that he has an eternal appetite, the eternal appetite of infancy. Not so with us, he says. And this is the kicker. Not so with us. For we have sinned and have grown old, and our Father is younger than we. See, some of us have lost our joy and gratitude to the idealism of youth. Remember that? That you used to call faith. For we've grown old, and our Father is older than we. It was several years ago, Todd Hunter came here and did a series on the kingdom of God along with Dallas Willard. And I've mentioned this to you before, but not in this particular context, where in the flow of his teaching, he said something that didn't seem exactly connected to the teaching on the kingdom of God. It was kind of this random thing, he said, but it was reflecting on all of the people that he had ministered to over the years. And this is what he said, that none of the people who had real effective ministry that he ever knew, he said that none of them ever finished well. And I was stunned by that statement, and he went on to clarify that he didn't, because you automatically think of some moral failure, and everyone you ever knew failed that way, and it wasn't what he meant. Because when he talked about not finishing well, what he meant by that was that none of them, and this was maybe even at least this scary, none of them finished with joy. For most of the people he knew, for whatever reason, gave a lot to ministry or whatever, but they ended bitter and disappointed and disillusioned, even cynical at the end. For whatever reason, good people, like you and me, they had grown old. And their father was younger than they. See, the problem, the question is this. How do we live a life of authentic joy when life is hard? Because life is hard. How do we live a life of authentic joy when things go wrong? Because things go wrong. when dreams are dashed, because dreams get dashed. Because to be joyful in the face of those kinds of things seems not only impossible, maybe even in the face of some things you're facing right now, it seems not only impossible, but to be joyful in the face of those things sometimes feels idiotic. Requiring a kind of denial. If I'm going to be joyful here and just start hopping around, you know, shining and bright and all that nonsense, become what my dad used to call a cheerful idiot. You know, I know people like that. Where they're joyful, all right. But the reason they're joyful is primarily because they have no idea what's actually going on. Living in kind of denial, entirely disconnected from the realities of pain and suffering that you're facing. And those people kind of irritate you. But I'm not talking about people living in denial. I'm not talking about cheerful idiots. And I'm certainly not calling for that because for most of us, our problem isn't that. I mean, I've met some fearful idiots in my life, but that's not generally what I run into. Because for most of us, our problem is that all we can ever see is the problem. All we can identify is what's wrong with our husband or our wife or our kids or our church or our school or our job or our boss, developing what Robert Hughes describes as a culture of complaints. Indeed, we live in a culture, you know it's true, it so values cynicism and complaints that if you're not cynical, you must be stupid. Am I right about it? If you're not cynical, you must be naive, you must be blind. So cynicism, in certain contexts, is kind of a sign of intelligence that you know how bad it is. And you can name it. You're brilliant. I used to actually think cynicism was a spiritual gift, and I had it. and all that raises this question again how do we get over this how do we turn cynicism into joy without becoming a cheerful idiot because here's the deal life is hard pain is real disappointments are unavoidable dreams will be dashed sorrow will come calling you're not always going to get what you want and you will probably fail sometime, somehow, some way which means that if you don't find sometime, some way, some place to sing and laugh and dance for joy if you don't find some way to tap that well here's the deal you're not going to be in it for the long haul because without some joy I'm sorry but you're not going to survive that marriage and you know the teenage years they're coming they're even tougher in some ways than the little kid years and if you don't find some joy in the middle of that you're going to run away, you're going to bail out, you're going to disengage this is why the first thing I would suggest in this battle to rediscover joy is number one consider it a command which is a ridiculous thing to say, I know, half of you just checked out he's an idiot, I'm leaving I commend you to be joyful that's a stupid thing you can't command joy I know you can't and it's a weird thing to say but here's one of the things that kind of reeled me back to wondering about this somebody I really respect said this in a book John Orper John Orper in his book that many of you have read The Life You've Always Wanted remember that many of you read The Life You've Always Wanted says this he calls this a command but he says joylessness this is where he really goes with joylessness he says joylessness is a sin. He calls it serious sin, but it's a sin, he says, and I'm quoting him here, that is most readily tolerated in the church. It is rarely the object of church discipline. You're just a grump. They don't, televangelists don't get canceled for lack of joy, but how much damage have joyless Christians, not only have they done to themselves, but to the cause of Christ, he wonders. James Joyce, in a book he wrote entitled Portrait of an Artist, writes of the main character's decision to not become a priest. Here's why. Because what he thought would happen to his face would become like the faces of other religious people he knew, a mirthless mask reflecting a sunken day, sour-faced and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated anger. Whoa. How often have people misunderstood God because they attributed to him the grim, judgmental, defensive, soul-wearying spirit of many who claim to be his followers. Francis de Sales says there is a being in the universe who wants you to live in sorrow and just kind of to stay there, but it isn't God. The evil one is pleased with sadness and melancholy because he himself is so and will be for all eternity. Hence, he desires that everyone should be like him. So first suggestion is consider it, this joyfulness, a command. But it still sounds ridiculous. Because when you hear a command to be joyful, after you just check me out, you probably go to one of three places. I command you to be joyful. You probably go to one of three places, two of which won't help. The first place we go is, if it's a command, some people would pretend to be joyful when they're not because you want to be obedient, so you put on a happy face and call that joy, but that's the cheerful idiot I said we're not going to be. So that doesn't work. The other place to go when you hear the command to be joyful is that you just shut down because it feels so phony to act like you're joyful when you're not. So you just see this is ridiculous. I don't even know where to go with this. But the third response to this being like a command that you can't get around is to actually go to a place that might be productive if you kind of go through this thing. It's actually to begin to wonder, why does that irritate me so much that it's a command? Why do I have so little joy? And a command makes me not able to avoid it. If I'm going to be a grump and it's a command, then you're really disobedient. So why are you so lacking joy? And maybe ask yourself this question in addition to that first question, What would I have to have to feel joy? What circumstance would have to change? What person would have to be different for me to feel joy? And as you continue to kind of do this work, if you can identify that thing, circumstance, or that person, that if they changed would give you joy, then you've identified your source of joy. And if your source of joy is contingent upon or dependent upon something or someone out there somewhere. Here's the bad news. I can give you, I can promise you very little joy. Unless, of course, you're able to control all those circumstances or control all those people, which is precisely what many of us try to do, how many of us live, but living that way where you're bent on controlling all the circumstances and managing all the people living that way, even if you're managed to at some level do it, is exhausting. It's exhausting. And it's also why so many of us have grown old. And our father is younger than we. But if you begin to actually go there and to fearlessly begin to wonder why this command to joy feels impossible, you've at least begun the journey, hopefully back to God, Hopefully back to God as your only adequate source of life and joy. A couple weeks ago we talked about this in the context of peace. So number one, consider it a command. Number two, this one's very helpful. Get over yourself. Merry Christmas. No, seriously, seriously, think about this. If you can kind of enter into this, I think you can get it. You know why some of us are so joyless? Because we're entirely self-absorbed, which means that whatever joy you have is entirely contingent on everything lining up the way it has to line up just for you, everything going your way in your time, fulfilling your desires and needs and wants. And we all go into this from time to time. We go in and out. I certainly do. Indeed, indeed, there's two ways that I can always tell that I'm in one of those self-absorbed kind of seasons. Number one, Bonnie tells me, Hey, you are so... Anyway. The other is this. And you can kind of self-evaluate this. Minor things become really big. That's one of the ways you can tell you're self-absorbed. The guy was just way too slow going on the green light, you know. Two seconds, anyway. So here's some advice for joy. Like I said, get over yourself. You're not the center of the universe. It doesn't all revolve around you. And one of the reasons I'm delighted to bring this one up, because it kind of does sound kind of edgy. Get over yourself like I'm yelling at you. What I love about bringing this particular thing up this particular week is because you know it's true. Because last week, a whole bunch of you did it when you gave to those buckets in the back. One of the stories that I loved the most was of person after person who in a position themselves, when they had need, the first instinct they had was to give what they had. You know what that means? You forgot about yourself. This is just a little tiny way you felt this. You know what I'm talking about. You forgot about yourself. You had need. But you just dug down there, and there were 20 bucks there, and you gave it. Person after person after person could tell that kind of story. And it resulted in joy. Sunny afternoon, I got a call from a friend of mine named Joe. Joe was going to come over to my house and do some stuff around the house for me because I'm inept at certain things. And he couldn't do it, and he tried to tell me why. But before he told me why he couldn't make it, he just started talking about the service. He says, Dave, the service was incredible. And our kids just saw we went to the bucket, and they emptied their purses and their wallets, whatever they had. I did the same, and I just gave it and said, Joe, I know kind of your situation as a construction worker, and he builds houses with the downturn in the economy. people aren't building houses so he's been in a really rough spot and he said no he says I don't need anything it's just so much fun to give he forgot about himself but then he told me why he couldn't make it why he didn't come that week he said on Wednesday my truck got stolen his truck got stolen and I says Joe all your equipment's in there all your tools are in there the computer was in there and I said you didn't take anything I said Dave it was just joy it was joy I think there's a lot of people like Joe A lot of people like Joe Who You know I don't got to yell at you Get over yourself You get opportunities like that You know what I'm talking about You forget about yourself And you give And it's joy But that story Let's me give one more push To those of you Who kind of say Ah People have greater needs than me We have $13,000 And we have to give it away do us a favor and ask for it okay another suggestion for turning the cynicism into joy establish some rhythms for joy this might sound a little contrived but but it isn't and it will help it's not the it's if you have huge huge things maybe this isn't the biggest thing you need but it's an important way of living the writer of Ecclesiastes makes this observation about life that everything that to everything there is a season There's a time to be born and there's a time to die There's a time for every purpose And there's heaven, there's a time to weep And when it's time to weep, weep And then there's a time to laugh And when it's time to laugh, laugh Then there's a time to mourn And when it's time to mourn, you should mourn And then there's a time to dance So do you know what time it is? I like that phrase Because it reminds me of something my parents used to say to me Because they thought I didn't know what time it was because they used to say this, you always think it's time to laugh. I thought that was funny, but apparently not. Here's the deal. Sometimes it is time to laugh and to dance and to sing for joy. And if you don't find the time, if you don't understand the rhythms, you will grow old and your father will be younger than you. You know, when our kids were young, we had four kids, and when they were really little kids, it was really hard in those years to connect, for Bonnie and I to connect. And I know we have a lot of young parents, and it's just this incredible ongoing kind of thing to how, you know, we love our kids, we love each other, but I don't, you know, we're just, it's always about the kids, and we kind of built into our marriage this kind of rhythm. I don't know, we weren't maybe twice a year. It may not sound like very much, but twice a year where we would get away and find someone to watch the kids overnight, and we would just get away for a night or a day and a half or maybe two and a half days and kind of do that maybe twice a year. And now we would fight the whole time, so that was not always a good thing. That isn't true. Actually, what would happen when we would get away and we would kind of enter into this rhythm of being away from the kids, even when they were little, was by the end of that time, we'd look at each other and go, I remember you. I remember you. And I remember why we got married, and there was a rhythm of what? Joy. Sounds contrived. Now, if you've got huge problems, I mean, let's get away for two days. No, that's like putting band-aid on, you know, a staph infection. It's not going to work, but let's just assume this rhythm of joy is an important thing to do. the Old Testament, God seemed joy, deemed joy so important, especially during hard times, especially during hard times. And by the way, they were always hard. That he actually established these rhythms by commanding certain rituals, certain festivals at certain times of year, and they were designed to just enjoy. Deuteronomy 14, 26 actually tells, God actually tells them how. Here's how I want you to have this celebration. And you got to know, this is always coming in the context of very difficult times. So here's, for this period of time, for this, I want you to stop worrying about all that stuff. And Deuteronomy 14, 26, I want you to spend the money for whatever your heart desires, for oxen or sheep or wine or strong drink or whatever your heart desires. And there you eat in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice, you and your household. Sounds like your house probably yesterday. Sounds like my house yesterday with all the kids over and the grandkids as well, laughing and singing and dancing for joy. And we were all there. And so was God in the presence of the Lord your God. Rejoice, you and your households. Nehemiah 8 verse 9, same thing. Going through a particularly tough time. In fact, this Nehemiah text, it's significant because they were going through a season of repentance where they were repairing and God was kind of revealing to them some things that needed to be rebuilt in their lives and in their community life together to bring back the centrality of the word of God and the centrality of worship. And you know when you deal with those kinds of things and you kind of face your sin, it's hard work. And so it says in Nehemiah 8, 9, in the middle of that, that Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra, who was the chief, the priest, and the scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to the people, this day is holy to the Lord your God. So it's a holy day. you maybe don't know that but holy day that's why we get the word holiday therefore do not mourn and weep we're going to get back to that and that's the work we're doing right now but you need to take a day off for the people had been weeping as they heard the words of the law and from the words of the law they were seeing their sin and that's hard work so nehemiah says we just need to take a break so go your way and eat of the fat which is the choices of mates and drink of the sweet King James clarifies that as the sweet wine and send portions of this food and drink to him who has nothing prepared for this day is holy to our Lord. It is a holy day, a holiday, so do not grieve. Not today. Give it a rest. You can go back to that tomorrow because grieving, like all of life, is hard work. And if you hope to have the strength you need to actually do that grieving work and that repentance work, which you have to do and it's hard work you're going to have to find some rhythms of joy in the middle of that. Which brings me to my final thought about joy. It's this. Whatever joy you ever experience it will always, always, always be in spite of something. Because it's never going to just line up perfectly for you where everything is perfect, where there are no complaints, which calls us, therefore, to what Karl Barth refers to as the discipline of defiant gratitude and joy. Habakkuk 3.17 says it this way. I love this. And let it just kind of lead us into a song of praise. Though the fig tree should not blossom, and there be no fruit on the vine, though the yield of the olive should fail, and the fields produce no food, though the flock should be cut off from the fold, and there be no cattle in the stall. Though the Vikings should lose twice in one year to the Bears. Sorry, I ruined this whole thing. Yet what? I will exalt in the Lord and I will rejoice in the God of my salvation. Friends, let's stand together. Could have brought the band out for this, but I thought other than try and sing them to the band, I want us to sing this out like these words are.
