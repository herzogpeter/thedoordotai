Music Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth. This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city. Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and the family of David, in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him and was with child. And while they were there, the days were completed for Mary to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son. And she wrapped him in cloths. And she laid him in a manger. Because there was no room for them in the inn. And so it is, friends. The word has become flesh. And dwells among us. We saw his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father. full of grace and truth. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. The word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory to have actually been there. When the word did indeed become flesh, so much easier to believe. Don't you think? If you could have seen it to be able, like the Apostle John and the epistle that bears his name, 1 John 1 verse 1. He's kind of laying out the whole epistle by saying that he was able to proclaim the things he was about to proclaim to them, that he was able to say the things that were things that he had seen, things that we've looked at and touched with our hands and heard with our ears to have actually been there. when it all happened, when the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. So they got to see these first ones, these apostle ones, when it all happened. And they got to say during their life and in the physical life of Jesus, there he is, right over there. There's God in a manger, and now he's up there and over there. So much easier, I don't know, I think, to believe. if you could see it. Well, he's nagging doubts that we sometimes have about who he really is, even if he really is, would vanish, I think. Don't you think if we could see? If we could have been there when it happened, when the word became flesh and dwelt among us, it says they beheld his glory. They got to see. They got to see. But it wasn't always glory that they saw. Sometimes they did, but a lot of people didn't see the glory, which to us seems to be right in front of their face, because others saw just a baby. That's all they saw was a baby. It's kind of still what some people see. Isn't that a cute little story? Think we'll go to church that day. And sometimes they saw a man from Nazareth, no less, which gave him not much credibility. Others saw more than that. Many in Jesus' day saw, in fact, a prophet. More even than that, a prophet who was a miracle worker, while others whole time thought he was a fraud. This guy is fake. And when the day came that he hung from a cross, they knew they were right. Fraud. I knew it. I knew it all along. Because it wasn't always glory that people saw. Indeed, as it turns out, the very thing that we tend to think, at least I tend to think, would make it easier to believe that he's real. Because he's there, I can see him. He's God right over there. He's got a face, he's got a voice, he's got a name. For some, that very visible thing didn't make it easier to believe, it made it harder to believe because in his visibility, in his humanity, God somehow became ordinary. Isaiah 53 kind of touches on this, affirms this when it says that he had no stately form or majesty, that we should look upon him, no special appearance, that we should notice him, be attracted to him, which means that the glory was there, to be sure, but it was veiled. It was hidden, veiled in flesh, is this song we sing often at Christmas. Hark to herald angels sing, veiled in flesh is one of the lines, the Godhead see veiled incarnate deity, and that brings with it a problem, particularly for the people who lived in the day that Jesus was physically born. And the problem was this. They were a people, particularly the Jewish people to whom Jesus came, these first century Jews, they were a people who had been raised on stories about God and experiences with God that was recorded in places like the Exodus. And they had places in their minds like Mount Sinai and Mount Carmel. So in their experience and in their expectation, when God showed up, it was with bolts of lightning and crashes of thunder and flashes of fire and pillars of smoke. So this is a tough sell in some ways, because this time a baby is born. So this time the entrance, if you will, of God into human reality doesn't blast the treetops. It didn't shake the ground. It didn't make you cower and cringe when he showed up this time. So how can he be God? Indeed, it was as if in Jesus, I think on purpose, God, okay, turned down the volume. so we could maybe hear this time without distortion, so we could maybe see without squinting and cringing. But now what we get is a baby born in a barn. An ordinary person. Great. An ordinary person, for goodness sake, from this no-account town of Nazareth, Joseph and Mary's boy, nice enough people, but quite common, actually. Neighbors who watched him grow up, weren't that impressed. In fact, John 1 says that when this light appeared, that is Jesus, he came to his own. He's speaking specifically of his own hometown, and his own received him not. They didn't believe he was inside. In fact, his own family at one point thought he was crazy, because it wasn't always glory that people saw. So what would you see? I mean, I kind of started with this question. Wouldn't it be great to have been there to see, but it kind of makes me wonder what would we actually see. Let me ask you this. What would you want to see? Maybe the baby in a manger. I don't know. For me, it wouldn't be the baby. I know that's not very Christmas-like, but it wouldn't interest me much. Not even actually the man. What I would want to see, and this would make all these questions I have go away. I'd want to see the miracles that would do it. All those nagging doubts about who he really is, and if he really is, would vanish, I'm sure. I mean, seriously, no one, you think, who ever saw him heal a blind man, or feed 5,000, shut down a storm, or call Lazarus, that would do it, out of the tomb. Ever doubted after that, wouldn't they? If only we'd been there. When the Word became flesh, we could have seen it, held it, heard it, and all those nagging doubts would vanish or so. So we think, let's think a little more. As far as anything curious reality in the scriptures, that even Jesus himself had kind of an ambivalence around miracles from time to time. He did use them and obviously did them. He even pointed to them from time to time as being proof of who he was. In John 10 he says, Believe me when I say to you that I and the Father are one. if you don't believe the words I say, then believe the miracles themselves, who he pointed to them. But even when he healed people, we've talked about this before, he didn't heal everyone who left the ones unhealed a bit bothered. At the pool of Bethesda, he healed a man who'd been lame from birth, but there were lots of people there lame, and he healed one. Why not the other? Or the other when he raised Lazarus. Great! Well, why not him? And why not her? Why not more? And even when he did do miracles, he often downplayed it, saying these cryptic things like, don't tell anybody why. Actually, I think there's a number of reasons, but for our purposes this morning, I think this evening, one is this. I think maybe it's because he knew. actually the shallow effect that most miracles have. You may not believe that because you're kind of pithed. You don't see more, but the truth is all through redemptive history, this is consistently the way it is. Miracles have very little to do with fostering deep abiding faith. I mean, think about this. Who saw more than the miraculous power of God than the Israelites In the Exodus, they saw the parting of the Red Sea. They saw the pillar of smoke, the pillar of fire, manna from heaven every morning. And the response to these provisions of God, supernatural things kind of routinely coming to them, the response routinely was disbelief, disobedience, grumbling and complaining. It was never enough. Who saw more? Who saw more than Peter, James, and John? Not only in the whole life of Jesus, but in Matthew 17, there's this fabulous, fascinating event where, it's called the transfiguration, where the veil is pulled back of Jesus' flesh. He pulls it back for these three guys to see the unveiled glory of God. I'm telling you, if I saw that, I'd be done. I mean, never doubt again. But two weeks later, these same guys deserted him, denied they ever knew him. One more kind of curious picture that you think is going to enhance faith, and it kind of goes against it a little bit. Jesus is standing on a hill. This is very close to the time of his death. He's overlooking Jerusalem, and as he's looking at Jerusalem, the city that he loves, being fully God, you know, he weeps. He's weeping. saying this, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often I longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wing, but you were not willing. And he weeps, and I think, you're God. What do you mean they're not willing? If you're God, be God, be in charge. Please, Just be in charge. Make them. Do what you want them to do. Overwhelm them. Be God. Instead, he weeps. That drives me crazy. Why? Why does he do that? Soren Kierkegaard, in a story I love, particularly this time of year, begins to answer this question. with the story of a king who loved a humble maid. And this king, like our king, was like no other king. Every statesman trembled before his power. No one dared breathe a word against him, for he had the strength to crush all opponents. And yet this mighty king was melted, come on, okay, by love for a humble maid. But how could he declare his love for her? In an odd sort of way, his very kingliness tied his hands. If he brought her to the palace and crowned her head with jewels and clothed her body with royal robes, she would surely not resist. No one resisted him. But would she love him? She would say she loved him, of course, but would she really? Or would she live with him in fear, nursing a private grudge for the life she had left behind? Would she be happy at his side? how could he know if he rode to her forest cottage in his royal carriage with an armed escort waving bright banners that too would overwhelm him he did not want a cringing subject he wanted a lover he wanted an equal he wanted her to forget that he was the king and she a humble maid and let shared love cross over the gulf between them for it is only in love that an unequal can be made equal, concludes Kierkegaard. The king, then convinced he could not elevate the maiden without crushing her freedom, resolved himself to descend. He clothed himself as a beggar and approached her cottage incognito with a warm cloak fluttering loosely about him. It was no mere disguise, but it was a new identity he took on. He renounced the throne to win her hand. See, our God whose name is Jesus desires what power can never win because he is a king who wants not just subservience but love. Thus, rather than overwhelming or mowing down Jerusalem or Rome or any other worldly power, he chose the slow, I hate it, hard way of incarnation, love, and death, a conquest from within. And so he says, by sending this child, I want to win you, I want to woo you, but to do that, he not only became ordinary, which creates some problems, he also became vulnerable. Reality to which Philip Yancey in his book Disappointment with God responds with these words, I'm quoting Yancey here, that those who believe in God can never, in a way, be sure of him again. For once you have seen God in a stable, you can never be sure where he might appear or to what lengths he might go or to what depths of self-humiliation he might actually descend in his wild pursuit of you. For those who believe in God, it means that God himself is never entirely safe from us. Indeed, he comes in such a way that we can always turn him down. Yancey then further observes this, that today the major events of Jesus' life are marked on calendars around the world. Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter. Of the three, however, only the middle one, the crucifixion, took place in the open for all the world to see. Think about that. At the moment when God seemed downright helpless, that was when the cameras of history were rolling, recording it all. Large crowds gathered to watch him die that day. And when four men wrote up the accounts of Jesus' life in the Gospels, they collectively devoted one-third of their Gospels to that time of apparent failure, when he died. The spectacle of the cross, the most public event of Jesus' life, reveals the vast difference between a God who proves himself through power and one who proves himself through love. Other gods, Roman gods, for example, enforced worship in Jesus' own lifetime. Some Jews were slaughtered for not bowing down to Caesar, but Jesus never forced anyone, anyone here ever to believe in him. preferred to act by appeal drawing people out of themselves and into himself and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth but it wasn't always glory that people saw so what do you see? cute little baby a man, prophet, a miracle worker, a fraud, victim, religious junk maybe is what you see or associate with this. But God, after he spoke long ago to the Father, says the writer of Hebrews in the prophets, in many portions and in many ways, in his last days has spoken to us through his Son whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he made the world, and he, that is Jesus. It's the radiance of his glory, the exact representation of his nature. So what do you see? I'll tell you what I see. What the angels saw, and what the shepherds and magi saw, what the prophets and apostles, what the writers of scriptures saw, they saw the Christ, the anointed one of God, Emmanuel, God with us. His name is Jesus, who, although he existed in the form of God, regarded equality with God, a thing not to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking on the form of a slave, a bond slave, and being found in the appearance of a man. He humbled himself by becoming obedient, obedient even to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore, God highly exalted him and bestowed upon him the name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father. and that is what we see. I hope you can see it to help us to see what we can't see unless you help us see it.
