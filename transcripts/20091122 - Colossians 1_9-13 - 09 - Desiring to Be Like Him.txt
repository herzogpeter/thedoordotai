Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Well, it's good to be back home. I think most of you know that Bonnie and I were in Belfast, Northern Ireland, for the last couple of weeks. And we are home. It was the fifth time that we've been able to go there in the last ten years. And the result of that, kind of going back several times, is that these relationships and the effect of the ministry, just over the years, has grown and deepened beyond the preaching. I mean, there's really a connection around that in ways that kind of stagger me a bit. In terms of how the preaching and the teaching has, in fact, influenced this church over there. But because of the relational things, we get invited into things that go beyond that with elders and staff. And even churches in the community that are kind of amazing. Wonderful, lifelong friends like Helen and Raymond. All the elders and staff of the Newton Greta Baptist Church. People like David and Glenn and Brian and Sam who are going to buy me dinner for mentioning their names. They don't know that, but they are. When we go back. But again, I've got to tell you, having done this several times in Belfast, and even having, you know, I speak in other places, I kind of left telling you I wanted you to come with us this time. And I've got to tell you, it was one of the best parts of this trip that you did come with us. We formed that blog, and I know that a number of you dialed in, too. What I came to discover was that it was really hard for some of you to comment because you had to go through all of these things, so we didn't get a lot of comments. But Sandy Lubrant told me when we got home that one Friday she sent out an all-church email kind of reminding people about the blog. And 1,500 people hit that thing just in that one day. So I just know that a lot of you were kind of following along with us. And that just felt really good. We felt the presence of your prayers and your interest in that whole thing. I loved doing this blog thing with Bonnie in particular. Again, it kind of helped me do it. It helped me stay in it. And I just got to say, you got to trust me that because she was part of this thing, you saw things and heard things that you wouldn't have if it was just me doing the blogs. But you wouldn't have gotten love and kisses if it was just her. See, I don't know. If you did get the blogs, you saw me, I would dial out going love and kisses. And one time I did get a kick. I loved doing this one. And I said, I love you all, as I signed off, except for one of you. And you know who you are. You remember that? Bonnie's watching me do that. She goes, you're not going to send that. I go, yeah, I am, click. And I said, Bonnie, Bonnie, this is open door. They have a sense of humor. Except for one of you. And you know who you are. Oh, you guys, last Saturday night. This was kind of a sense of being together last Saturday night, 11 o'clock, 11.30 at night. Bonnie and I were just going to bed, put my head on the pillow, and just like a movie, it came to my mind. I'm doing the math. It's 5.30 at night in Minneapolis. At 5.30, they were probably taking the offering, and Steve was stepping into the pulpit, and I felt connected. And just prayed for Steve and for you. And the next morning, I got up, and it was 9.30 in the morning, and we were just about ready to go to church. and I was upstairs in this room where the computer is with the family we were staying with. And I'm doing the math. It's 9.30 in the morning. I'm praying for church where I'm going and for you guys as well. But it's 3.30 in the morning here, so I email Steve right away. And I said, I'm praying for you. What are you doing? You lazy bum. You're sleeping, aren't you? Couldn't hang. Couldn't tarry one hour. In fact, if you wonder why they're laughing, that's a Bible joke. But the fact is, we were together. And later the next day, Steve did email and told me about how in this service, you guys kind of did the math yourself and realized Bonnie and I, because of the time, were getting ready for the evening service in Belfast, and you guys joined us in prayer, and that just marked the whole thing. It was just a marvelous thing. So many stories I could tell you, and we just don't have time, but I want to tell you one. about these people that you may never meet, that you chose to pray for. I remember that the last talk before I left was to hold them in your hearts. These people, just like the church in Colossae, that Paul never knew these people, but we're gonna pray that they be filled with a deep in their bones knowing of the love of God in order that they might walk worthy. Let me tell you about one of the people that you may never meet. Her name is Leanne. First talk I did there two Sundays ago was out of the parables. brought to parables in Luke 15. And you may remember the story of the wandering sheep and then the lost coin. And they were all designed to illustrate what kind of God God is. And God is the kind of God who doesn't mind doing the dirty work of going after a lowly sheep. And he's like a crazy woman. Remember that one? I just love that picture. God is like this crazy woman who goes on sweeping and won't stop sweeping until he finds this lost coin. And the lost coin were the lost little ones. I told you, not even having a will to leave God. They don't hate God. They don't know enough about God. They're just people who've slipped through the cracks. And we painted this picture of this crazy woman. And I made reference to that crazy 50s, 60s preacher guy who I made fun of. Remember, I even did his voice and said, when does he stop sweeping it? Until he finds it. Remember that? And then he even suggested that this crazy woman, that some of these lost little ones who never do know God, I wonder if the first thing they see when they do die is this crazy woman sweeping. And I preached that. With all of that in mind, let me introduce you to Leanne, a missionary from Afghanistan. 50, late 50s. She was in the Newton Breida Baptist Church because she was home on leave, exhausted spiritually, physically, in every way. Her husband was still in Afghanistan doing a marvelous work in the university there. And because of his life, people loved him and were open to him. She had worked in the women's prisons in Afghanistan. And the women and the girls section of the Young Offenders Center and these young girls were in prison. Just hang on here. They were in prison because most of the girls were there for being raped. Just get your head around that. To make a long story short, I have come home to Northern Ireland to try to recover. My husband returned to Afghanistan in August. He's coming back for a break in December. But what has broken my heart, she writes, more than the close inside look into the hopelessness, violence, and brutality towards Afghan women and girls with names, faces, personalities, and shattered hopes and dreams. What's been hardest is the fact that I am not allowed to share Jesus with them, except in rare private moments when I've been able to surreptitiously pray with one or another. I've agonized over how can they respond to the gospel when they're not even allowed to hear it. So when you shared about the little coin from Luke 15 and the crazy woman sweeping, it meant so much to me because it describes my Afghan friends so perfectly. In my questioning, God has comforted me over the years with the promise. that he is righteous and good, and one day he will bring to justice every living soul. If I didn't know that, I would go under. But when you quoted in passing the heretic thoughts of that preacher from the 50s, whose name I forget, it was like God was hugging me. I've never heard anyone say anything like that before, and I have not had the courage to share with too many my heretic ideas. I'm completely content to leave it as a bigger mystery than me and wait for God's time to reveal his shining glory, But I will be holding on to Luke 15, 8 through 10 when I return to my post in northern Afghanistan, hopefully in February. It thrills my heart to know that the frantic woman sweeping furiously every nook and corner of her house and yard, this is our God. And then she signs off with a lighter heart, Lena. And it just makes me think of Colossians 1, verse 3. We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you. Ever since we heard of your faith in Christ, Lena, your love for the saints, which comes from the hope which is bearing fruit not only in you, but in all the world. And now part of that hope for Leanne includes the sight of this crazy woman sweeping. So thanks for coming with us on this journey and praying for these people that you may never meet, that they might be filled with the, in their bones, knowledge of God's love for them. Because now, they're praying for you, too. One more thing before we go to the offering. Each month, whether the news is good or bad, or somewhere in between, we are committed to giving a home base update and to let you know about the financial condition of our church. Unfortunately, the news this month is more bad than good. Last month, our goal was $385,000, and we received $307,000, which means we were short by about $78,000. The goal this month is $451,000, and as of last week, we've received $216,000. Combine this with the fact that we missed our goal in September by 89,000. The news is, like I said, more bad than good. Truth is, it's caught us off guard a bit, but by off guard I don't mean we didn't notice. We did notice. But after three months of this, it appears that our new normal is a lot lower than our budget. And it's not a normal that we can easily absorb, because the budget that we're not making now already reflects the deep cuts that most of you already know about because we've spoken of it quite often. The fact is, I'm not sure what to say about all this. As if anything I say could magically change this or fix this and kind of make it go away. And I know that a lot of us are going through some very difficult times financially, and most churches are as well, quite frankly. But to those of you who consider open door your home and hold in your heart the work of God's Spirit among us and even beyond us, we just ask you, again, seriously, to pray, which I know many of you are doing, and to give, and to wonder if there's more that you can give, and to not assume. I don't know if I've ever said it this straight before, but it's important that we not assume that the ministry here, that we've grown accustomed to experiencing here at Open Door, to not assume that it always will be the way you see it now. Or to assume that someone else is probably carrying this. It's easy, I think, in a big crowd to kind of look around and go, ah, somebody's getting it. It's like as if it's too big to fail. It's not. And it would be very important to not assume those kinds of things because sometimes, you know, we do that kind of thing. Now, I'm aware that numbers of you already give a lot beyond faithfully. I know that numbers of you give sacrificially here to this church. But the fact is this. There's this 80-20 rule. And I've kind of talked to you about this before. And this 80-20 rule actually is true in our church. And the 80-20 rule is this. That 20% of the people in a lot of churches, and it's true in our church, give 80% of the financial resources to keep things going and expanding, which means that 80% of the people give little or nothing for a variety of reasons. And while in different circumstances, it's possible to absorb that kind of percentage. It's not a healthy percentage. It doesn't speak well to, I even think, basic obedience and things, but it's a percentage you can absorb. We can't absorb that kind of percentage anymore. We just can't. And if this is your home, and your heart is settled on the work of God's Spirit in this place and cares about that and where it goes, we need all of you. We just need all of you. And we can do this. So let's pray as we move to the offering and then into the ministry of the Word. I thank you, God, for the power of your Spirit and the life of your Spirit. place in the lives of individual people and in some strange way in us as a corporate people from whom this message of your amazing grace is moving into places that we don't even know about and we're grateful for that. We pray now that as we give it would be used by you to further those purposes of your kingdom in this church, in this city, in this nation around the world. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Well, open your Bibles with me, if you have them, to the book of Colossians. Still in the first chapter, as today we enter into our third week, actually, of dealing with Paul's prayer to the people in Colossae, a prayer that is a reflection of his desire for them, indeed his love for them, even though he didn't know them. He prays this for them, beginning in verse 9, Colossians 1 verse 9 saying this, that for this reason also, since the day we heard of it, the it there being, their faith in Christ Jesus, their love for all the saints, which springs from the hope that's laid up for them in heaven, we have not ceased to pray for you and ask specifically this for you, that you may be filled up with deep in your bones knowing of his will, which we came to realize literally meant God's desire for them, his love, his yes toward them. And I pray that for you in order that. See a little phrase at the beginning of verse 10? What that's called is a henoclaus, this in order that. It's a henoclaus, which I know moves you all very deeply. Nothing quite like a good henoclaus to get the tears flowing. But the fact is, this henoclaus here, it is significant. It's why I'm pointing it out, because a henoclaus means that what's about to be said is predicated on what was just said. So it kind of goes like this. My prayer, says Paul, is that you would first be filled with that in your bones knowing of the love, desire, and God's heart for you in order that you may be able to walk in a manner that's worthy of the Lord, desiring to please him in all respects because it's that in your bones knowing of God's love and desire and heart for you that actually, in the Greek here, empowers you and stirs in you the desire to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, desiring to please him in all respects. Indeed, Ephesians 5 verse 1, Ephesians, a book that Paul wrote just about the same time he wrote Colossae, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, all kind of written at the same time while Paul was in prison, and they all have very much the same flavor. It's why we kind of keep referring back and forth to them. Ephesians 5 verse 1 has very much the same vibe, the very same order of things when Paul there exhorts the church in Ephesus to be imitators of God. In other words, to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, just like children. The Greek word there for children is paideia, which means a small child. You've got a picture in your mind, a small child. And when you have a small child who knows in their bones that their parents are for them and love them, little children like that who just kind of knows that want to be just like their mommy and their daddy desiring to please them in every way it's just instinctive mommy mommy mommy daddy daddy daddy look at this look at me and what they're doing that they want you to see may not be that worthy of note um it might be that proverbial half-eaten apple that stephan started talking about a few weeks ago, but their desire is to please you, mom and dad, and it delights the heart of every mom and every dad, including the heart of God. I have a picture in my mind of a little kid trying to follow his father or his mother through the snow, so he or she tries to put their feet wherever their mommy or daddy puts their feet. Why? Because wherever you go, I want to go. It's like an instinct. You can't get it out of them. And however you walk, I want to walk even though this little kid, in trying to walk the way daddy walks, sometimes stumbles and falls. It's what the little kid wants, so he keeps getting up and trying to put his feet, whereas daddy or his mommy puts theirs, which stirs in me this vivid memory. I've shared it with you before. It's one of my favorite little kid stories of myself. I was three or four years old. My dad's leaving for work, and as fast as my four-year-old legs could run, I'm running for the door before he leaves, and I'm screaming, I'm screaming, where are you going, where are you going, where are you going? And he turns around, looks up at me with a twinkle in his eye, and says, I'm going crazy, want to come? And you know what I said, yeah, I didn't have any idea what he meant. It's just that at four years old, my spirit toward my daddy was wherever you go, I want to go. Crazy, I'll go there with you. If you're there, I'll go there. Whatever you do, I want to do. But that kind of desire to be like your daddy is predicated on something else first. It's actually embodied in another memory I have of my dad who, from time to time in ways that, to me, felt quite random, would look at me and say, boy, you make my heart glad. And far more than he ever knew, because usually when he would say that to me, I'd feel embarrassed and I'd stare out the window and act like I didn't even hear him. The truth is, that stirred in me a deep desire to walk in a manner that was worthy of that. Desiring to please him in every respect, because I knew in my bones that he was for me. All of which means that Steve Weins, last week when he preached, was right. Indeed, he was dead on when he said, pretty much as his primary thesis, that when you come to know in your bones the kind of God who loves you, pursues you, forgives you, clothes you, and restores you, it stirs in you a deep desire to please him, and to serve him, and to be just like him. And what I want to touch on today, given all that, is that that was true for Paul himself. Indeed, the prayer that Paul is praying here for the Colossians was rooted in and is emanating from something that he personally knew to be true because he'd experienced it himself, which means, among other things, that this prayer we're studying in the book of Colossians is not some perfunctory apostolic pronouncement because it's coming from someplace in Paul that's personal. And it's why today I want to examine that personal place from which this prayer is coming, in part because I think it will help give us a picture of what it actually might look like for this prayer to be answered in a human being's life because we can see it in Paul, who in Philippians chapter 2 is describing and disclosing the passions of his life, reducing them to three, all of which are reflected in Colossians, in his prayer for them, passion number one, that I may know him. Now, we talked about this, actually, just a few weeks ago. Philippians 3, verse 8, he says, this is my primary passion in life. First of all, that I may know him. And it's not just the pertinent facts about him, but to know his relentless tenderness and his amazing grace, and that on your worst day you can run toward him, because that's the kind of God God is. So when Paul prays for the Colossians, Interesting, that being his personally, the priority for his own passion, when he prays for the Colossians, the first thing he prays for them is that they would know him too. That very same way, in their bones, knowing. So passion number one is that I may know him, and it's what I'm praying for you as well in Colossians. Passion number two, that I may be found in him, he says in Philippians 3 verse 9, which, as you know, if you've been with us in the study of Colossians, this is a primary theme. In the book of Colossians, we've spoken of it often, to be in Christ, in Colossae, to be in Christ when you're in pain. A couple of weeks ago in our Novembering service, Jen talked about being in Christ when you're in loss, all of which results in passion number three. And it brings us to what I've just been talking about. My third passion is this. I want to be just like him. I want to know him, be found in him. I want to be just like him, which I think is precisely and quite simply what Paul is saying in Philippians 3, verse 10. Though he's not using those words, here's actually what he says, Philippians 3, verse 10. I just want to know him. Indeed, I want to know everything about him, including the power of his resurrection. See that in verse 10. And the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed even to his death, which is actually quite extreme. to be conformed to his death. But the picture I get very clearly is this, when he's talking this way, is the Apostle Paul himself, and I invite you to kind of see him this way too, becoming in his spirit actually like the child that he told the Ephesians to be like in Ephesians 5 verse 1. Remember, to be imitators of God just like children. So what I hear Paul saying, like a child, in Philippians 3 verse 10 is this. whatever he did, I want to do. Whatever he experienced, I want to experience. Resurrection, did he do that? Then I do too. And I can hear some curmudgeonly person saying, well, you can't want that because Jesus is God and you're not. And I think Paul would respond, too late. I already want it. And to, in some way, experience the power of that resurrection, not just when I die. I want to experience the power of that resurrection while I live. And oh, by the way, Paul says in verse 12, this is very important, in verse 12 of Philippians 3, it's not that I've arrived or have already obtained it. No, because I'm like a child, like a little kid in many ways, though we don't see Paul that way. I'm like a child who can't always put his feet where his daddy puts his, but make no mistake, it's what I want. It's why I press on in order that one day I may lay hold of. In other words, that I one day may be able to put my feet exactly where my daddy puts his. And when he talks about the fellowship of his sufferings there in verse 10, which is a weird thing to say, sounds odd to us, I just hear him saying, somewhat like a child, you don't understand, it's just this, that whatever Jesus felt, I want to feel it, whatever he suffered, I want to suffer. the things that hurt him I want those things to hurt me whatever grieved him I want those things to grieve me whatever gladdened him I want those things to gladden me in other words I want to be just like him however he lived I want to live however he died I want to die to be conformed to the image of his death he seems to be saying which sounds a little weird a bit over the top so let me explain that because I don't think Paul is saying here and we've talked about this before, but just to clarify again, he's not saying, I want to die the way Jesus died. He doesn't have some weird masochistic picture of him going, Jesus died on a cross, so I want to have nails in my hands as well. He's not saying that because there wouldn't be any value in that. There wouldn't be any efficacy to that. I think what he's saying is not I want to die the way he died. He's saying, I want to live the way he died, which still sounds a little weird, so let me say it this way. Because what I hear him saying in Philippians 3 verse 10 and then it transfers to this prayer is that it's my desire to have those things that characterize Jesus in his dying to mark and characterize me in my living and I think that's what it means to be conformed to the image of his death and no, I haven't arrived says Paul in verse 12 or obtained it yet because I'm in ways that might make you uncomfortable kind of like a little kid sometimes who can't always put his feet where his daddy puts his, but make no mistake, it's what I want. And it's why I press on. In order that one day I may lay hold of, I may be able to put my feet exactly where my daddy puts his. Now, before we bring all of that stuff back to the prayer in Colossians, which we're gonna do in just a few minutes, I'd like to suggest four things that I think characterized Jesus in his dying that Paul would undoubtedly say, I want to have characterized me in my living. The first thing is this, that Jesus died serving. That in his suffering and in his dying, Jesus fundamentally was serving you and me and the world. Mark 10, 32 sets the context for where I get this because they were on the road, it says in verse 32, going up to Jerusalem and Jesus was walking on ahead of them and they were all amazed, though others who followed were fearful. And again, he took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen. Pretty amazing things were going to happen, saying we're going to go up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man, he's speaking of himself, so I'm going to kind of change the personal pronoun here, where I will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him, or me, to death, deliver me to the Gentiles. They will mock me, spit on me, scourge me, and kill me. But three days later, I will rise again. And what's weird is in that context, a pretty significant event about to happen, James and John are arguing about who's going to be greatest in the kingdom, which kind of makes you want to punch him in a Christian way. To which Jesus says, in effect, as he hears them grumbling and arguing for this place of honor, verse 38, he says, in effect, you guys just don't get it. You don't know what you're even asking for here. In verse 42, he calls them to himself with what I think is great patience and says, and I have to find it, Mark 10, verse 42. And says to them, you know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them, and that's just the way it is, but it's not to be so among you. For whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant, And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man, he's speaking of himself, did not come to be served, but to serve. And the biggest example of that being true is when you give your life a ransom for many. So in his death, he wasn't just dying, he was serving. And I believe if Paul was here, he might say this. Look at the cross. Picture in your mind Jesus hanging from the cross. What do you see? What do you hear? Well, there may be lots of things that you see and lots of things you hear, but what I hear is this. Jesus, and he doesn't say these words, but just by virtue that he's there, I hear him saying, I came not to be served, but to serve, and this is proof. So no, it's not about dying the way he died. I have no desire to die the way he died. It's about living the way he died, and he died serving. And I'm not instinctively a great servant. But here's the deal for me. I want to be just like him. Whatever he did, I want to do. Whatever he felt, I want to feel. And no, it's not that I've arrived. I haven't arrived, verse 12. Because in some ways, I'm still like a child who can't always put his feet where his daddy puts his, but make no mistake, it's what I want, and it's why I press on, in order that one day I may lay hold of, I may be able to put my feet exactly where he puts his, and all of that is what I'm praying for you, Colossians chapter 1, that you would walk that way too, worthy of the Lord, like him, that's all it means, to be like him, desiring to please him in every respect, and I can't make you want that stuff. That's why I'm praying for this stuff. To be real in you, says Paul in Colossians 1, all of which is coming from his personal passion to be like Jesus. He died serving, and he died obeying. To get a picture of this, join Jesus with me in your mind in the garden. Moments from his arrest, hours from his agony, saying this to God the Father, Father, if there be another way, let this cup pass. Yet not my will, but thine be done. Which makes this kind of obedience a special kind of obedience in his dying obedience, because it's an obedience that costs and hurts and frightens. And it's obedience that many of you, maybe most of you, have at one time in your life had to walk into. It's an obedience, literally, that doesn't want to go there, do that. Wouldn't choose it, yet not my will, but thine be done. It's an obedience marked by and leavened with the spirit of submission to God, Regardless the cost. And if Paul were here, I believe what he'd say is, no, it has nothing to do with desiring to die the way he died. I want to live the way he died. And he died obeying and submitting and serving. And obedience doesn't come natural to me. But I want to be just like him. And sometimes like a child, I stumble and fall. but I want to walk this way. And he died believing. 1 Peter 2.23, Peter is reflecting on not just one event but kind of the season, that period of time when Jesus was going through his suffering, when he stood before Pilate, when the soldiers were mocking him and spitting on him. It says that during that whole time in his life that he, though being reviled, he reviled not again. Which kind of gives you a passive picture. He was sitting there taking it. But the next phrase is very informative because he wasn't passive. It says, being reviled, you reviled not again. But he was actively during that time entrusting himself and trusting himself to the Father who judges rightly the living and the dead. So as he's taking all this stuff and his obedience is costing him, he is deeply believing and trusting in the one who judges righteously the living and the dead. He died believing. Now, there is a kind of faith, spoken of it often here actually at Open Door, that when energized, Hebrews 11.33 says, conquers kingdoms, performs acts of righteousness, obtains promises, shuts the mouths of lions, conquers the power of fire, escapes the edge of the sword, becomes mighty in war, puts foreign armies to flight. That kind of faith is childlike, it is simple, it is wonderful, it is pure. C.S. Lewis of this kind of faith says that it is able to swallow great gulps of the impossible and believe. It's David facing Goliath faith. It's Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Facing the fiery furnace faith But there's another kind of faith That is also vital That we don't value, I don't think, as much And it's the kind of faith we see in Jesus On the cross, in his death It's the kind of faith that's exercised When the heavens are silent And the foreign armies aren't being put to flight and the disease isn't being cured. And God has seemed to turn his back. Hebrews 11.35 says, Others, you see, were tortured, not accepting their release in order that they might obtain a better resurrection. Others received mockings, scourgings, chains, imprisonments. They were stoned. Others were sawn in two. Tempted, they were put to death with a sword, destitute, afflicted, treated men of whom the world was not worthy, but gained approval through their believing God through that. Philip Yancey, in his book, Disappointment with God, speaks poignantly of this kind of faith when he says, childlike faith, wondrous as it is, if not seasoned, may not survive when the miracle does not come, when the urgent prayer gets no answer, when the dense gray fog obscures any sign of God's presence or concern in such times when the fog rolls in, calls for something more than childlike faith, and I will use the word fidelity for that kind of faith. The kind of faith God values most and seems to develop best when everything fuzzes over, when God is silent, when the fog rolls in. When Abraham had that kind of faith, so did Moses and Joseph and David and Hezekiah and all the prophets and the faceless men and women of Hebrews chapter 11. And Jesus had it too when he hung on a cross saying, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? And if Paul were here, I'm pretty sure he'd say, You guys, it's not about dying the way he died. It's about living the way he died. And he died serving and obeying. and he died believing, and I want to be just like him. And no, I haven't arrived, because in some ways I'm still like a kid who can't always put his feet where his daddy puts his, but make no mistake, it's what I want. And it's what I'm praying for you as well in Colossians chapter 1. Finally, he died forgiving. Father, forgive them. Brennan Manning in his book, Abba's Child, asks this question. And in many ways it's our question. How can you forgive? Especially that. The demands of forgiveness are so daunting that they seem humanly impossible. Only reckless confidence in a source greater than ourselves can empower us to forgive the wounds inflicted by others in boundary moments such as these. There is only one place to go. The cross. now go there and stay there for a long time and watch as Abba's only begotten son dies utterly alone and in bloody disgrace now watch further as in that place of pain he breathes forgiveness on his tormentors at the moment of their greatest cruelty and mercilessness and if Paul were here I'm just positive he'd say it's not about dying the way he died It's about living the way he died, and he died serving, obeying, believing, and forgiving. And I want to be just like him. And no, I haven't arrived. Forgiveness is not my first instinct. But make no mistake, it's what I want. And so we pray. back to Colossians 1 now all of that desire let's take all of that desire I'm hoping I've found some of yours to serve, to be like him all of that desire to obey and believe and forgive let's bring that back to Colossians 1 and pray first that you would be filled with that in your bones knowing of God's desire and love and yes toward you, in order that you might be able to actually walk this way in a manner that is worthy of, consistent with, a lot like the Lord desiring to please him in your believing and in your serving and in your obeying and in your forgiving. But like little kids who really want to put our feet where our daddy puts his. We sometimes don't. And sometimes, hard as we try, we can't. So we stumble and we fall, and when we do, we sometimes figure, what's the use? Especially if you've fallen more than once or twice. Who hasn't? And you come up thinking, I'm just going to lay here. I'll never be like him. Who am I kidding? And then we pray. And then we really pray. Indeed, as I just pull this together right now, I want to pray. Would you bow your head? Close your eyes. Enter in to this spirit of prayer. I'm going to speak some things. over you and bring you some places in prayer. First thing in prayer that I want you to bring, I want you to bring your stumbling. I want you to bring all your disobedience and all of your unbelief. Can you see it? some of you that's all you can see is your failure and your sin well here's what I pray especially if you can see it and it's all you can see that you would be filled Holy Spirit come right now and fill your sons and daughters in their bones with the knowing of your desire for them, of your love for them. And I pray you do that in order that they may be empowered to get up again and start to walk. again. In a manner that is worthy. That is consistent with our Lord. Holy Spirit, come just in this quiet place. Jesus died forgiving he died serving so who do you need to serve and who do you need to forgive right now in this quiet place ask God to show you a face of someone maybe you're ticked at right now because they're not serving you ask God for a face of someone you need to forgive and this I pray that you would be filled up with this in your bones knowing of his desire for you in order that you may walk and maybe this morning get up and walk in a manner that is worthy of, consistent with the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, increasing the knowledge of God, strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father. Giving thanks to the Father, which is where we pick it up next week. Holy Spirit, come. Minister your life. Minister the Spirit, the passion that was in Paul to us. And I pray it in Jesus' name. All God's people said, amen. God bless you as you leave. Go in peace. Thank you.
