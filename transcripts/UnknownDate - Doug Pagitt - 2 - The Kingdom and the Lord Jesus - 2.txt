Well, good morning. My name is Doug, and if you were not here last week, I'm the fill-in speaker. The regular person who does this is on vacation, and if you were here last week, I guess I'm still Doug and still the fill-in speaker. And we have been trying to go on a little journey. I asked you last week if you would wonder with me about some things, if you would go on a little trip. And I even suggested that it was going to be like going on a two-week-long blind date, or at least two weeks, two different week blind date. It's not like we were together for two weeks or anything. But for two different times, we would sort of have conversation and we would get to know each other a little bit and wonder about some things. So I'm going to invite you to continue wondering with me. Last week, I had suggested that there's something about this invitation of Jesus to join into the kingdom life that was confusing to me and perplexing in my understanding of God and the way that I thought things were supposed to go. And so they were part of the story of Jesus that didn't fit with how I thought the part of the story of Jesus was supposed to go. I had suggested that my understanding was that I was taught, I don't know where it came from, it's just sort of over time. I was told that things started really good in the Garden of Eden. And if you were around last week, maybe you remember that, but it was a long time ago. So, I don't know, 167 hours ago, I think with some of you, we started into all this. So I had suggested that, look, it started out really good, and then sin came into the world, and then things got really bad for a long time. We have all those stories in the Old Testament of how bad it was. And then it got really good for a little while while Jesus was around, and then it's gotten really bad again, and now we're sort of living in this period of time, waiting around to be delivered out of all of this world. But the story of Jesus and the way that Jesus lived in the world seems to run a little differently than that sort of understanding. And so I asked you if you'd wonder with me about what it could mean when Jesus, before his death, burial, resurrection, ascension, promised return, before that, he invites people to step into the kingdom of God and to live in this kingdom. And so I said, hey, let's wonder together. Let's dream a little bit. Let's think on some of these things, and let's sort of get our heads around them. So I'd like to continue that wondering with you for our second date here. And this is really our last one. I'm sorry to tell you, but I don't think this is going to work out. And I really hope we can stay friends, but I'm not planning to be back next week. But you have a wonderful personality, and if I ever meet a friend that I think, you know, you'd really connect with, I'd recommend, you know, a date without hesitation. All the rest of that. I married the girl I dated in high school, so I don't really know how that goes. I just have friends that tell me that that's sort of how it goes. So I'd like for you to wonder with me a little bit more about what's going on with this. Because when Jesus comes on the scene, he starts to turn people a little bit. He starts to switch things on people. See, it's Jesus who went up to Galilee and was saying in Galilee about the things of God. And he was saying to people in Galilee that the kingdom of God was near and was nearby. In fact, we looked at this same passage. After John, who was Jesus' friend and cousin, actually, and was the baptizer, after John was put into prison which is an interesting thing in and of itself really that the person doing the things of God baptizing people into the life and the way of God and living in the kingdom of God gets put in prison not everybody's all the time happy about people who want to live in the kingdom but anyway Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the good news of God now wonder with me about this because there's something significant if you're familiar with the story you might be able to connect with what's significant about this people thought during that day that it was in Jerusalem, in the holy city inside the temple. That's where the good news of God rested. That's where proximity to God could be found. That's where you moved really close to God. But instead of Jesus being in that place down in the temple, he was way up north by the Sea of Galilee, a long way away, saying things to people that were normally only said in the temple, but now he's saying them up in Galilee. So he says to the people there, while he's proclaiming the good news of God. See, the good news of God is not limited to Jesus's death, burial, resurrection, ascension, promised return. There was a good news that Jesus was proclaiming far before this. So he goes on, and he says these words. The time has come. The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news. So he's up in Galilee with people who are Galileans because they lived in Galilee. I mean, it's not that complicated of a thing, but they're called Galileans. And so they're living up there a long way away from the religious people down in Jerusalem. And yet Jesus says to those people way up north, way up in the back, the kingdom of God is close. Step into it. Live in it. Now what was so unbelievable to people of the day was they thought that Jesus was getting it a little wrong because they were the religious people and they thought that the holy people, that the righteous people, that the ones who were right with God, they're the ones for whom the kingdom of God was close to. Not these ordinary folks, but they didn't have the story wrong because they were mean. They didn't have the story wrong because they were stupid. They had the story maybe a little confused and they weren't trying to exclude people. They were trying to live right. It's one of the things about religious people. Religious people, like a lot of us in the room, we try to live right. And we try to follow God. And we really want to do it right. But sometimes in their day and sometimes in our day, even as religious people, we get a little turned around. And we get the story a little mixed up. So when Jesus is way up in the north, and he's saying to people there, the kingdom of God, it's nearby. You can step into this kingdom. You can live in this kingdom. You have access to it. He wasn't trying to make up a new story. He was trying to invite people into that very same story. He was trying to invite them into the story of Abraham and to the story all the way through the Old Testament where the kingdom of God was open and it was active and it was working, even for the people way up north. But people didn't understand Jesus. they thought that he had the story wrong they thought that it was the religious ones the holy ones the right ones because that's the way god is because god is religious because god is holy and because god is right so they wanted it to be just right and they knew that if you're way up there saying those things well you've got this a little messed up you've got it a little bit turned around they were used to having the things of god said from certain places by certain people in certain ways. And anybody who decided to change that story and say it any other way, well, I don't know, they're a little goofy. There's something wrong with them. So he gets up finally and ends up back in Jerusalem, back in the temple where everybody feels comfortable and everything is the way it's supposed to be now. And things are the way they're meant to be. And yeah, thank you very much. People were really confused by Jesus. Long before Jesus became the maker of heaven and earth and the king and the Lord and the savior and the beautiful one and the promised one and the precious one, he was called a nut and a liar and a heretic and one who wasn't teaching the story of God because everybody knew that it was in the temple where the righteous people could go. That's where the kingdom of God dwelled. Not out there by the side of the lake. No, the kingdom of God's not out there. The kingdom of God is down here. And they had the story wrong. They were confused. But they were trying. They weren't bad. They were doing the very best they could do. They're people like us that try to be faithful and try to live with God. And God wasn't mad at him. He just wanted to tell him the rest of the story. So we're going to pick up a little piece of that story. It's in Matthew 21. Finally, when Jesus gets back down to the temple, and he goes into the temple, the people had already concluded, this guy's got it turned around. I mean, he's a good guy, and, you know, he comes from a good family, except there were some stories about his mom when she was younger that I'm not really sure how all that worked out. But anyway, he comes from a good family, and he seems to do the work of God, but oh, it's such a shame that he's got it all wrong now. Telling those people on the outside that the kingdom of God is theirs within them, close enough where they could step into it. See, when he says the kingdom of God is near, I don't think he's saying it's just soon to come. There are people who hold to that, and they're really smart people, and they might be right, and maybe I've got it turned around. But when Jesus says the time has come, the kingdom of God is near. I don't think he's saying the time has come the kingdom of God will come soon. I think he's saying now's the time. The kingdom of God is close and you can step into it. You can live into it. But they were all the outsiders outside the religious circles that Jesus says they can come in like the woman that he met at the well that we talked about last week, that Samaritan woman invited in to the kingdom. In Matthew 21 and it picks up a piece of the story. And if you don't know the Bible, Matthew is one of the writers of a biography of Jesus. And there are four of those, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And so Matthew writes one of these biographies about Jesus. And so he tells about when he goes down to the temple where the religious people are. Because one of the great things about Jesus, he could move in both worlds. He could go up by the Sea of Galilee, he could go up to Samaria, and he could come down into the temple. And so it goes like this. I'll read it for you, and then I guess you can follow along on the magical screen. Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. Now, if you're not familiar with the things of the Bible, then you might get a little confused about the priests. The priests here are not Catholic priests or Episcopal priests like we might be familiar with today. They were the Jewish priests and the elders of the people or the really advanced ones, the people that understood the story of Jesus or of God, that they had it all write those people, the priests and the elders of the people. I mean, they were the ones that, they understood things. So when common folk, you know, like us, would hear the priests say something, they'd go, well, I mean, I'm not going to argue with the priest. So the priests and the elders decided to take on Jesus because he was so clearly confused. Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people, they came to him, and they said, by what authority are you doing these things? and who gave you this authority? What do you think you're doing? You're out here healing people and doing all this, but your message, the message is so wrong. So they were so confused because they're trying to live with God, I think. I really do. I mean, sometimes you can, if you're familiar with the Bible, you can read this thing, you can think that all the religious people were just really wicked, evil folks. They're not. I mean, it might seem like that even in our day, but we're not. We just get a little screwed up sometimes and act really mean, and it makes us seem like we're wicked. And they weren't trying to be wicked then either. They were just trying to follow God, but they were a little turned around, a little confused. And they said, we can see what you're doing, and it looks like the activity of God, but it can't be because your message is so turned around. Because you're inviting all of these wrong kind of people to live in the kingdom, and we all know that they can't live in the kingdom. It's only the chosen ones that get to enter the kingdom. It's only the Jews properly trained and properly living that God loves and is close to. So when Jesus sees a blind man sitting by the side of the road walks by and his disciples said to him, a classic conversation of religious people of the day, okay this blind man here who has this bad thing happened to him since he was a little baby, was it his sin or his parents' sin that caused him to be blind? The only two options, right? He's obviously opposed to God so God is punishing him so whose fault is it? And Jesus said it's neither. It's so the glory of God can be revealed in his life. So the glory of God, so that the kingdom of God can come alive? People thought that that kind of man was outside the scope of the kingdom, and Jesus says, no, he's going to be sitting right in the center of it. And they said, oh, yeah. Boy, we really thought we saw some potential in you. And then you come up with this stuff. By what authority are you doing these things, they asked, And who gave you this authority because you've got the message all wrong? And Jesus replied, well, I will also ask you one question. And if you answer me, then I'll tell you by what authority I'm doing these things. He's such a smart aleck sometimes, in my opinion. Now, some people think, no, Jesus was the divine, holy one of God, and he can't be a smart aleck. So then I guess he was just insightful and brilliant and sort of turned it around on him, if you like it that way. But let's just, just for the, just wonder with me. about maybe him being a little sassy. I will also ask you one question, and if you answer me, then I'll tell you by what authority I'm doing these things. John's baptism. Where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or was it from men? Really big question today. See, because John, the baptizer, the one that got put into prison and stuff, was a big player in the story of Jesus. Keeps coming up, this John the baptizer. What's crazy about John the baptizer is that he was out there baptizing people in the Jordan River before Jesus even came on the scene publicly, like he's just sort of living around, and before he comes on the scene, John is out baptizing people in a baptism of repentance so that they can enter the kingdom of God. He's baptizing people and saying, you're now going to enter into the kingdom of God. He's baptizing them for the forgiveness of their sin and repentance so they can enter into the kingdom of God. And there's some people that get so tripped out by that because they thought there is no way to enter into repentance with God. I mean, that was like Jesus' idea. Some people think God was like really mean, and then Jesus came around, and you know, God changed his mind a little bit and became a whole lot nicer. No, the whole time God has been opening up the kingdom life for people to enter into it. So there John is out baptizing people into the kingdom life. And some of the religious leaders of the day, they just despise John. So they have this dilemma when Jesus says, Okay, I'll tell you by what authority, if you answer me this one question. John, baptism, was it from heaven or was it from men? Did he make it up or was he doing the activities of God? Well, they discussed it among themselves. And they said, if we say from heaven, then, Jesus is going to ask, then why didn't you believe him? But if we say from men, we're afraid of the people, for they hold that John was a prophet. So they were stuck. If they said heaven, Jesus would say, well then, that's all I'm doing. But if we say people, or if we say for men, then the people are going to go crazy, and they're going to, I don't know, beat us up, or they were afraid of them. That's kind of interesting, isn't it? The people hold to the baptism and repentance for the kingdom of God from John are a scary enough bunch of thugs that they were going to beat up the religious priests. That's a weird day. So they answered Jesus, and they said, we don't know. Great answer. I don't know. Very eighth grade, isn't it? I don't know. Then he said, Jesus, neither will I answer you by what authority I'm doing these things. I'm not going to tell you then. Poses another one. What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first son and he said, son, go and work in the vineyard. The son said, I will not. But later changed his mind and went and worked. Said no, but then later actually did it. Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. Go to work in the vineyard. And his son said, I will, sir, but never did. Jesus said to the religious leaders, which of the two did what his father wanted? The first, they answered. And Jesus said to them, I'll tell you the truth. The tax collectors and the prostitutes, the people that you think are outside the kingdom of God that live their life in such a way that they said they wouldn't live in the kingdom, have changed their minds, and they're living in the kingdom. They were baptized by John, and they're living in the rhythm of God. The tax collectors and the prostitutes, they're entering the kingdom of God before you, who said you would, but actually won't. For John came to show you the way of righteousness, and you didn't believe him. The tax collectors and the prostitutes, they did. And even after you saw this, you still didn't repent and believe. And they were even more confused. What do you mean these people who are so clearly outside the things of God, how can they get access into it? And it was the good news. The good news was that the kingdom of God was near and that everyone could repent and step into it, that it wasn't restricted and held for only the special ones. And this completely bamboozled the followers of Jesus because they were told from the time they were the littlest of kids where the kingdom of God dwelled and who had access. In the temple, in the special parts, that's where. And here Jesus is running around the side of the sea and saying things to all kinds of people all over the place. Disciples were so confused, especially Peter. Peter was really close to Jesus. He was one of the real insiders with Jesus. Very good friend. In fact, Jesus had said of Peter one time, Peter, you are going to be such a participant in the kingdom of God that whatever you hold to here on earth will be held to in heaven. Whatever you let go of will be let go of in heaven. To those who follow in the Catholic stream of Christianity, they would track a thing called apostolic succession from one apostle all the way down to the current pope. that Peter was such a major player. He was so significant in the things of Jesus. He mattered so much. He was a true insider. And he had the story of who had access to the kingdom of God wrong. It's a wonderful bit of the story for a bunch of knuckleheads like us who also get it wrong at times, get all turned around and messed up. It's not because we're not faithful to God. It's not because we don't see the things of Jesus. It's not because we're spiritually inferior. It's just we've got it wrong. Peter was trying to follow God, but he still thought that it was the Jews, the Jews who were clean, the Jews who were right, and the Jews who had access to the things of the kingdom of God through Jesus. So everybody had to become a Jew before they could have access to the things of the kingdom. And he didn't just believe it for a day. He didn't just believe it, and then after Jesus' death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and promised return, Peter said, oh, I changed my mind. No, it was probably a decade or more that Peter not only believed it, but he taught it. and he was wrong and he confesses that he was wrong he'll say we'll look at it a minute i was wrong about that what a wonderful thing that maybe what it means to be a follower of jesus isn't that we're right about everything maybe it's that we're living in the kingdom of god in harmony with god and humbly trying to live in the way of jesus hey yeah we got it messed up on some points and people come along and God corrects us. And some of us, that takes us a long time. It took Peter a long time too. So that story that we heard read during the time when we were singing, that Faith and Jeff read for us, was the beginning of this really important story. In fact, in the structure of the Bible, you have this part where the things of Jesus start. It's what we refer to as the New Testament because it sort of picks up after the things of the old one. And you have the story of Jesus starting with the Gospels. And then following those four tellings, the next one is sort of a biography of the followers of Jesus and what did they do, how did they live. And so in that book called the book of Acts of the Apostles, it tells a story. The book of Acts is actually 28 chapters long, and two of those chapters spend time dealing with this story that we heard a part of read earlier. One fourteenth of it deals with this story of the people following Jesus, that they had the story a little turned around. thinking that the kingdom of God only reside on the insiders and not for all of those out there. So the story that we read involved Peter. Peter's praying one day around lunchtime. He would pray three times a day, probably nine in noon and three in the afternoon, and he would be praying. And this one afternoon, he's up there praying, and he goes into this trance, and he has this vision that this sheet is lowered in front of him, And this voice says to him, Peter, get up and kill and eat. But on the sheet are these animals that Peter, as a good Jewish follower of God, would never eat. No way is he going to eat those things. And he looks at the sheet, and the voice says to him, Peter, get up and kill and eat. And what does Peter say? No, I'm not going to. I know what's right, and I'm not going to eat those things. They're unpure, or they're impure. They're unclean. I'm not going to eat those things I know the right way well what is Peter thinking he's in the middle of this vision and this voice says to him get up and eat maybe Peter just confuses being righteous with being stubborn so he says no but he doesn't just say oh I don't think so he says no Lord I won't do it starts arguing with this voice about what he's going to do and then the voice says anything that God has called clean, don't you call unclean, Peter. And it happens three times. Like he can't get it through his head. Over and over he has to hear it. Some of you that know all the insides of the Bible stuff might connect with Jesus saying to Peter, do you love me? Feed my sheep. Do you love me? Do you love me? Three times. And then three times it takes this. some people who are really trying to live in the harmony with God and the rhythm of God as religious people it just takes us a little while to get broken open even if it's God doing it so Peter's sitting there and he's having this this vision and then the spirit says to him hey hey Peter there's some guys downstairs you need to go talk to them because the story really doesn't start with Peter the part that faith read came first it started with this guy named Cornelius a centurion, a non-Jew, not even a Christian, but somebody who lived this righteous life, and God saw his life, saw the way he lived, and answered his prayer, and sent a spirit, an angel, to this Cornelius to talk to him, and says, God has seen the wonderful way you've been living in the kingdom, Cornelius, and I want you to take your men and send them over to this little town called Joppa to a guy named Simon's house and ask for another fellow named Simon, but he also goes by Peter, so you don't bring the wrong one. Go over and ask that one named Simon, also Peter, if he'll come and tell you the rest of the story, Cornelius, because you're living in the kingdom, but you don't have the rest of the story. So at the end of the book of Acts that we looked at last week, when the apostle Paul is said to be living in Rome, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ, it starts to make sense in the life of Cornelius, this guy who was living in the kingdom but didn't know the whole story of Jesus. Not unclean, not removed from the things of God, just unaware of the rest of the story but living in the kingdom, invited in, much like the followers of Jesus who were baptized by John and brought out of the river so they could go live in the kingdom of God and Jesus saying to the people by the Sea of Galilee, step into the kingdom of God but they didn't believe that Jesus was who he really was until after his life, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension. They were living in the kingdom before they had the full story of Jesus. Same thing with Cornelius. Living in the kingdom. So the spirit comes and says to Cornelius, send your men over to the town of Joppa and get this man named Peter. And Cornelius does it right away. What a difference, huh? the religious one of Jesus argues with God about it the non-Christian non-Jew Cornelius God-fearer kingdom liver does it right away so the men are there and Peter they stay the night at Peter's house and they come over the next day and this is all spinning around because Peter has it so clear he knows he's been doing this a long time and he's got the story straight, so he thinks. And the story picks up and reads like this. The next day, Peter started out with them and some of the brothers from Joppa went along. The following day, he arrived in Caesarea. So it takes him like four days for all this stuff to happen. Don't you wonder why the spirit that spoke to Cornelius didn't just tell Cornelius the rest of the story? Why does he have to drag Peter into all this? Just seems like that's how it works sometimes, huh? We just get dragged in to the activities of God. Not because we're making it up, but because God already talked to Cornelius, and has already talked to Peter, and it's all coming together. The following day, they arrived in Caesarea, and Cornelius was expecting them, so he called together his relatives and his close friends. He's got a whole house full of people. He wants them all to hear. Cornelius has got to be going out of his mind, because he had always been told by the Jewish people, well, good work, Cornelius, but, you know, that's not really what gets you right with God. Being the chosen people is what gets you right with God. All this sort of kingdom living that you're doing, well, it's not, I mean, we really respect you, but you're not really in the fold. And then God speaks to Cornelius, and Cornelius starts to think, maybe I'm in. Maybe I'm apart. Maybe Peter's going to tell me how it all fits together. Well, the world hasn't changed too much in 2,000 years, really, has it? We still run around with people who are living in the kingdom of God and they don't know the rest of the story. These Cornelius types who's so excited that Peter's going to come, just thrilled. As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at Peter's feet in reverence. But Peter made him get up, stand up, he said. I'm only a man myself. Here Cornelius, who's not even a follower of Jesus, sees this one that God said he's supposed to listen to, and Cornelius just falls on his feet, on his knees, right at his feet, maybe even laid down. Peter said, no, no, no, no, this is not what this is about. It's not like I hold the secrets to all of this. Get up. Let me finish the story for you. I'm only a man. Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people, like, whew. I mean, he's supposed to go talk to Cornelius, and now there's all these people. What are they doing here? Could all these people be living in the kingdom already? Peter went inside, found this large group of people, and he said to them, okay, you're well aware that this is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or to visit him? I'm not even supposed to be here. The law that I follow, the way of my life, says that you people are not in harmony with God and you are unclean and I'm supposed to stay away from you before you defile me. So I'm trying to figure this out because it seems like God sent me here. And here Peter is still being turned around by the teachings of Jesus. You're well aware that it's against our law for me to be here. But God has shown me that I am not to call any man impure or unclean. So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. Well, yeah, he didn't bring up the other thing about eating, but, you know. So he just, you know, he was a big crowd. He was sort of trying to, you know, a little embarrassing. Then he says, may I ask why you sent for me? What a posture. What an attitude. Not, okay, yeah, I'm glad you guys are all here. I got a lot to say. Boy, I mean, I'll tell you, I walked with Jesus. I know this scoop. Let me tell you how this goes. All right, here we go. Oh, he walks in and he says, yeah, I lived with Jesus. But you know what? I think I had it wrong. because I thought you were unclean. I thought you were impure. I thought you were outside the things of God. And now I'm finding out that you're not at all, that God is talking to you too. So he doesn't come in as the big cocky apostle that's got it all put together and as a know-it-all. Instead, he comes in and says, why did you send for me? I mean, what am I doing here? How does my bit of the story fit into your life and your part of the story? Look, maybe we're supposed to learn something from this attitude. to find these kingdom livers. I've said that seven times in the last thing, and I just have this picture of this slab of liver. These people living in the kingdom. May I ask, why did you send for me? And Cornelius answered, okay, four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour at three in the afternoon, and Peter's got to be thinking, huh, that's what I do. Wow. maybe there's other people living the rhythm of God that I thought were so impure and unclean and what do you know there's people living in the kingdom maybe we need to have eyes to see and ears to hear and hearts to notice and noses to smell when people are living in the kingdom and encourage that and then tell them the rest of the story four days ago I was in my house and I was praying at this hour at three in the afternoon suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me and he said to me Cornelius, and I can't believe he knew my name. God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. It counted. I thought you Jews had told me all along that that kind of workspace stuff didn't count. It counted. God noticed. Send to Joppa for Simon, who's called Peter. He's a guest in the home of Simon the Tanner, who lives by the sea. Cornelius must have thought, boy, God keeps pretty close tabs on you, doesn't he? Peter's probably thinking, whoo, he sure does. Watch out where I go. Now he probably knows I'm here. Well, that's okay. He sent me here, so it's okay for me to be here. So I sent for you immediately and it was good for you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us. Didn't know the whole story of Jesus. so God sends Peter to round out the story preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus and there's some people who are living in the kingdom of God and need to know the rest of the story about the teachings of Jesus and there's some people my guess who are living who know the story of Jesus but they're not living in the kingdom the two have to come together then Peter began to speak I now realize how true it is that God doesn't show favoritism. Now he realizes that? All the way through the Old Testament, it's saying that Jesus was saying that. It was being said over and over, and Peter's still just now getting it through. Oh, I thought that, you know, I thought God picks her. Oh, but God accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right. You know the message that God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus, who's Lord of all. You know what has happened through Judea, beginning in Galilee, after the baptism of John. After the baptism that John preached, I'm sorry. How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil because God was with him. We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him, hanging him on a tree, but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. And he wasn't seen by all the people, but witnesses whom God had already chosen by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. And all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name. And while Peter was still speaking this word, The Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. The same thing that happened to Peter at Pentecost. The same thing that Peter said happened to Jesus. The Spirit of God was upon Jesus, and now the Spirit of God was upon Peter, and now the Spirit of God is upon these folks. And the story gets finished out, and now the kingdom livers inside the story of Jesus. While Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came and all heard the message, And the circumcised believers, meaning the ones who were the Jews, the circumcised believers, had come with Peter, were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. I mean, this was such a major thing. We might read it and just think, oh, that's a neat little story. To them, it completely unwrapped what they thought was wrapped up, settled. That the Gentiles were living in the kingdom of God and they needed to hear the rest of the story because God's paying attention to them and listening to their prayers. And they can go in and they can say, yeah, God told us that you're doing all this great stuff and now let me round out the story for you. Let me finish it. They were astonished. For they heard them speaking in tongues just as they did at the day of Pentecost and praising God. And then Peter said, can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They've received the Holy Spirit just as we have. So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus, and they asked Peter to stay with him for a few days. Now Peter's living with them, not just visiting, but staying overnight. And Peter goes back in the next chapter of the book of Acts and starts telling all the followers of Jesus in Jerusalem, you wouldn't believe it. The kingdom of God is unfolding faster than we can bring the message. And what do you know? We don't bring the message first, and then the kingdom's unleashed. We go to the places where the kingdom of God is living, and we tell them the rest of the story of Jesus. And it reformed them, and it redefined them, and the beat's been going on for 2,000 years. People getting the story, getting it a little mixed up, getting it turned around, saying, I thought I had this thing straight, but I had it all messed up. But that's all right, I'm like Peter. And people like Cornelius saying, I didn't know the whole story of Jesus, but I've been trying to live in the kingdom of God, and now I've got the rest of the story. So you have kingdom living people and you have people that know the story of Jesus coming together into a people who follow God in the way of Jesus. And it's the good news again to everyone who hears it. Those way up in Galilee and those way down in Jerusalem and those to the very ends of the earth. That the good news, the access to the kingdom of God will be preached to the ends of the earth beginning in Jerusalem and going to Samaria and going to the ends of the earth. ah it's good news at least i think it is i wonder on this stuff and i think yeah yeah yeah there we go and let's live in a world we can go out and find the kingdom of god and tell people the rest of the story and encourage people when we see it wherever we see it we can say that looks like the activity of god there yeah you're doing it way to go that's good that's what god does and it sort of answers for me some of these things about my friends who seem to be living so right in the world but don't seem to care a thing about the religiousness or the teachings of Jesus. Well, where do they fit in the whole story? They're not just bad, dirty, rotten people that need to be saved from their selfish lives. I do have friends like that too. And Peter talks about those people and says, you know, look, you're just living as a sinful generation. And then there's people who are living the kingdom life and they're like Cornelius. And then there's people who know all the things about Jesus and they're not living in it either. And somewhere it's got to all come together. all right sorry i've taken too much of your time why don't we stand up and i will pray a benediction okay god we have gotten together on a couple of occasions here and uh thank you for the opportunity for me to step into the lives of of these people in this community of faith and we ask that you would lead us and you would guide us that when we meet people living in the kingdom that we would have eyes to see it and ears to hear it and noses to smell it help us to be like Peter who can say what do you have for us? you seem to be living in the kingdom you seem to be doing the kingdom things let me tell you the rest of the story and for those that we meet that don't seem to care a thing about the things of the kingdom of God let us be light and let us be help and let us even be conviction that people should be living to bring about the harmony of God in the world and to those of us who know the story of Jesus and are living in the kingdom bless our activity bless our work bless what we do lead us, teach us, open us up bend us and have your way so we pray your kingdom would come that your will would be done on earth all over the earth just as it is in heaven let us see it, hear it, smell it and live in it for it's your kingdom it's your power and it's your glory forever and ever amen amen, God bless Thank you.
