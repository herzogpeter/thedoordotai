Lord, I thank you so much for your spirit. And just even as we move into the teaching time and awareness that we really do need to hear concepts and have passages explained. But your spirit teaches and your spirit does teach. And things are changed and our minds are transformed and our hearts are renewed. And Father, we pray that the power of your spirit would be actively moving among us. And that as we close off this book of Job, that the truth of it would continue to affect us and go with us as we leave. We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. To say that Job has been hurt would be an amazing understatement. When he went to a funeral, he buried ten of his children. At the very beginning of our drama with him, he lost all of his money. Then he became sick. Friends came to minister to him. When they came at the beginning, they did a wonderful job. They spent seven days with him without saying a word. That silent ministry to Job communicated volumes to him relative to their support of him. And what finally dawned on Job in a subtle way but very profound was that maybe if there's nobody else I can tell what I really feel, I can tell it to these guys because they have been with me for this whole time. And so the intimacy that was established by their silence and just empathy with Job for those first seven days emboldened him to share his inner heart. What happened, however, was that his honesty, the honesty of his inner heart wasn't real clean. It wasn't real appropriate. And when it began to come out, the hurt, despairing heart did not sound like a victorious Christian to them. and his words threatened their tightly bound formulas, and these three friends of Job, we spent a number of weeks hearing how they began to beat Job up and get him to be quiet relative to the things that he was saying. Instead of being a help to Job, they left him like a cat up a tree. Eliphaz was the moralizer, Bildad was the oversimplifier, and Zophar was the guilt bomber. In chapter 31, we saw Job beginning to defend himself in ways that were almost silly. He, in verse 1, talked about how he made a covenant with his eyes and he doesn't even look at girls. He was beginning to accumulate evidence that he really didn't deserve all this stuff that had happened to him. In verse 9, if my heart has been enticed by a woman or if I lurked at my neighbor's doorway, may my wife grind for another and all these terrible things happen. And I wish I could find it right now, but he talked about having his arm ripped off and his elbow broken at the socket and all this kind of wonderful stuff, if I'm telling a lie. And it was getting a little bit bizarre. In chapter 32, verse 1, after Job had begun to bring his defense for himself, saying that I'm really not a bad guy, in fact, I'm great, I've never done anything wrong, that was an opportunity for these three guys to get out. In chapter 32, verse 1, these three men ceased answering Job because he was righteous in his own eyes. And that's where we met Elihu last week. Elihu came on in chapter 32, verse 2, and we found out that Elihu had some good help for Job. We also learned that Elihu didn't necessarily say all the right things. He, in fact, said even some things that the three friends said. But he came to Job with a different spirit and a different attitude that allowed some of the things that Elihu had to say to get through and genuinely minister to Job. I gave you a couple of them last week about what Job did, or what Elihu did. The first thing we saw Elihu do was he operated from a foundation of being genuine and honest. He operated from a foundation of being genuine and honest. He was real. Because he was honest and real, he didn't come to Job with a lot of pious clich√©s and empty chatter. The second thing we found out about Elihu last week was that he identified with Job. He got on the same level with him. He didn't condescend. Remind you of that in chapter 32, verse 11. Behold, I waited for your words. I listened to your reasonings while you pondered what to say. I paid close attention to you. Indeed, there was no one who refuted you, Job, not one of you who answered his words. Not one of you who answered his words. I'm on your side. I realize that these guys have been beating you up and treating you unjustly. He identified with them. Chapter 33, verse 6 and 7. Behold, I belong to God like you. I too have been formed out of the clay. Behold, no fear of me should terrify you, nor should my pressure weigh heavily upon you. I'm like you are. He was, again, a totally different spirit than these other three guys. I'm like you. You're a man. I'm a man. God made you. He made me. God loves you. He loves me. And you don't have to worry about me pressuring you. I'm not going to weigh heavy on you. But I'm going to be honest with you. He identified with Job. The third thing he did was that he created or brought with him an atmosphere of acceptance that didn't necessarily approve of what Job was doing. Again, one of the things we talked about last week in introducing Elihu was we were so wrapped up in all the things that the three friends did wrong and all the things they said wrong, we might have been left wondering, well, what is our response supposed to be? I suppose when people say incredibly bizarre things, we're just supposed to go, oh, okay, that's okay. And that wasn't what happened with Elihu. There were a lot of things that Job said that needed to be confronted. They needed to be corrected and redirected, changed. And Job was able to bring to, or Elihu was able to bring to Job confrontations that didn't, however, threaten the dignity of the man. An atmosphere of acceptance of the person without necessarily approving of the behavior. Chapter 33, verse 8. I've heard everything you've said. Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the sound of your words. I have heard everything you said, but I'm not abandoning you. I haven't left. I'm going to stay here and deal with this with you. While the friends were saying, in effect, and we're just going to leave Job with the Lord, Elihu was picking him up off the doorstep and bringing him in to be a friend. This atmosphere of acceptance that doesn't necessarily approve of the behavior is somewhat in line with what we're talking about right now on Sunday morning, the whole concept of discipline. You remember in Matthew 18, verse 15, it said, If a brother strays away, you go to him in private, and if he listens to you, you've won the brother. And the word win there, remember, that means it's the winning of a treasure. And this is coming to a confrontation and coming to someone with something you need to say, but the purpose of your coming isn't to beat them up, and it isn't to prove that you're right, and it isn't to humiliate them. The reason you're coming and the reason Elihu is coming is to win a treasure. I see Job as a treasure, so I'm going to come to him, and I'm going to even say some hard things, but I'm here because I value him. That's what's going on here. Atmosphere of acceptance without approval. We kind of went into that in depth with a lot of illustrations. The last thing I want to give you about Elihu has to do with confrontation very quickly. He did confront. We've kind of had this laced all the way through there. In chapter 33, verse 12, he says, Behold, let me tell you, you are not right in this, Job. That's a direct confrontation. for God is greater than man. Atmosphere of acceptance, I loved you, Job, but you need to hear something. You are not right in this. Talked a little bit last time about the fact that we really have a hard time with confrontation because very often confrontation is associated with enormous amounts of anger. The reason for that is because most of us don't get the courage to confront until we get angry enough. And that is not what's happening here. Confrontation here is brought with a view to heal. Sometimes the reason I don't want to confront somebody and tell them some bad news is because I really do love them and I don't want to hurt them. Sometimes the reason I don't want to give them the bad news and tell them it's because I really love me and I don't want them to hurt me. Because if I give them a confrontation, they might come back at me. And so it has nothing to do with love for them. It's really about self-protection. But the idea that I'm not going to confront you because I care so much about you really doesn't wash. If I really see you moving towards something that's shipwrecking your life, and for me never to say anything does not communicate care at all, that would be like a doctor who knew I had cancer but didn't want him to give me the bad news that I needed surgery because he loved me so much He just didn't think I could handle the fact that I needed surgery or chemotherapy. I would really be sad if I had a doctor who cared about me so much that when I needed surgery and he knew it, he didn't tell me. That's not a caring person. Confrontation comes with a view to heal, with a view to restore. And because of that, they do the hard thing. He did that. He gave instruction. He gave a way to go. This is the fifth thing. he gave hope to him. Let's look briefly at this. And basically what he did is he pointed him to Jesus without even knowing about Jesus yet. It's kind of some bizarre language in here, but it's very prophetic in terms of its previewing of a mediator of the Christ. Let's start in verse 13 when he gives Job a way to go. Not only does he confront him, but he kind of gives him a way out. There is hope for you. I'm not just going to dump this on you. There's a way for you to go. You are not right in this, verse 12, verse 13, or 14. You need to know some things. Indeed, God speaks once or twice, yet no one notices. In a dream, in a vision of the night, when sound sleep falls on men while they slumber in their beds, then he opens the ears of men and seals their instruction that he may turn man aside from his conduct and keep man from pride. What he's saying here is, Job, you need to understand something. I'm going to bring you a different direction than the other three came because I understand something. God speaks to people different ways. They've got the idea that the only way God communicates is through nice things. If you do well, things go well, then you get rewarded. But God communicates and gets people's attention different ways. God speaks once or twice, yet no one notices, but he comes in different ways, in dreams, in visions, sound asleep, all sorts of different ways. He doesn't just speak through sunny skies. And maybe what's going on with you right now, Job, is God's trying to get your attention. I do not agree with the other three guys, but God may be using this pain to get your attention about some things. Your concept of God is off. He says this in verse 18, He keeps back his soul from the pit and his life from passing into Sheol. He, capital H, is God. You have been hearing from these three friends of yours that God is punishing you. God is not in that business with you. What God does is keep his soul back from the pit. That's what his ministry to people is, is to hold people back. And his life from passing into Sheol, that's what God does. You've got a wrong concept of God, and it's been given to you by these three friends of yours. So let's straighten out your thinking a little bit. He's not your punisher. In verse 23, however, is where he begins to talk about this mediator. If there is an angel as a mediator for him, as a person, for a person, an interpreter, if there is someone who can explain this, a mediator is someone who just gets in between. And by the way, remember just, I think it was last week, where we talked about Job who was crying out for a mediator. I want a mercy seat. I want a place I can go and bring my heart and bring my complaint. And I want somebody who will stand between God and get his hand on God and put his hand on me and somehow bring us together. There is a mediator for him, one out of a thousand, to remind a man what is right for him. There is a mediator, Job, one out of a thousand. Now that's kind of interesting. We know the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star, the fairest of what? Ten thousand. He is saying here there is one, one out of a thousand, to remind man of what is right for him. Then let him, this mediator, be gracious to man, to him, and say, deliver him from going down into the pit. I have found a ransom. I have found a ransom. Jesus said this thousands of years after Job. I came to give my life as a ransom for many. Verse 25. When this mediator comes, the work of him in someone's life is that the person's flesh can become fresher than youth. Let him return to the days of youthful vigor. then they will pray to God and God will accept him. This is veiled. This is a preview. Let his flesh become fresher than youth. Let him return to the days of youthful vigor. You know what that is? That's the regeneration of a life, the regeneration of a body, a body that is decayed. There's almost a metaphor going on here of Job in his body full of putrid boils. A mediator is going to come and bring back youthful vigor. That's a metaphor of spiritual regeneration. A mediator is going to come. One in a thousand. Regenerate. Youthful vigor will return. And when that happens, men will be able to pray to God and God will accept him. That he may see his face with joy and restore his righteousness to man. This is incredible here. It's kind of... I don't have time to go into all the depths of this, but remind you, This is the very first book in the Old Testament. Genesis was not the first book written. Job was the first book written. It's not the first in order here, but it was the first book written. And it says, And he may restore his, capital H, God's righteousness to man, is what it says there, literally. That's what salvation does. God gives his righteousness to men. That's what the mediator is going to do. And he will sing to men, If any say, I have sinned and perverted what is right, and it is not proper for me, he has redeemed my soul. Read it this way as well. He will redeem my soul, if I pray that, from going into the pit, and my life shall see the light. Verse 29. Behold, God does all these oftentimes with men. You've had an idea of God that he is your punisher, he is your enemy, he is your mediator, He is your redeemer. He is the one who wants to pick you out of the pit. He is the one who wants to regenerate you. For Job, like for many of you, those can be really nice words and even minister to you at some level while you're hearing them, but there's still something necessary that needs to happen. And that is somewhere along the line, those words need to begin to take on energy and become reality, and there needs to even be a meeting with God somehow. In chapter 38, as we just continue to kind of flow through this thing, what happens is this ministry of Elihu, as he's sharing with him, again, I want to just emphasize that I don't think, and this is a comfort to us, Elihu is not the perfect counselor. He doesn't say everything just right. There were times when he talked too much, when he hit too hard, But again, one of the reasons he succeeded was having listened to the three friends and all of their sermonizing and all of their scolding, all of their preaching and pressuring. Elihu was not threatened by his honesty. He listened. And then the high point of the entire dialogue happens when Elihu is speaking and all of a sudden the voice of Elihu in chapter 38 gets lost in the voice of God. Think about that. The voice of Elihu in chapter 37 and chapter 38 turns into the voice of God. Before I even read that, I want you to think about that, because I think that concept that I just gave you, the voice of a man or a woman sharing with a friend, all of a sudden becoming the voice of God, is probably the ultimate of what a Christian friend can do for another. Now, I think that God spoke to Job. I think God speaks today, too. And I'm not sure how the voice came to Job, and I think the voice of God comes to men and women differently now. Sometimes there is a direct communication from God to the spirit of a man or a woman. But sometimes it does come through the voice, literally, of a friend, of a counselor, of a teacher, of someone who cares for you. And I know it's happened to you. You've maybe never thought of this as being a Job experience where God was talking to you. But have you ever been listening to a friend or a confidant or someone who really cared for you and you're hearing their words and all of a sudden something really clicks and you can just tell you're hearing the voice of God. And you're not confusing their voice with God's voice. What they're saying is coming right from God. And you even kind of go away for a while because you heard God's voice and all of a sudden you're hearing God's voice. One of the things we established in this whole course, or tried to, was that one of the purposes was to help people who were going through grief themselves, but the other thing was that we wanted to put in hands a little bit, some tools that would help us be better caregivers and better friends. And I can't think of a better experience, a more exciting experience, to be on the giving end of being with a friend and ministering to them and then having them connect with God's voice, not mine, not yours, all of a sudden God's beginning to speak to them. Suddenly God's got Job's attention in chapter 38. Then the Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind and said, Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? Let's look at the whirlwind first. The Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind. I'm not sure how I picture that. Some would argue, and I think argue well, that it was a physical whirlwind, that there was sand and it came and it was a big wind, and if we were doing a movie, that's how we'd do it. It would look like that. The wind would come up and Cecil B. DeMille would, Cecil Life? Well, somebody like him would do that. And it would be like a physical burning bush. That would be a physical wind. But I think it's just as possible that the whirlwind was the kind of whirlwind that some of you have had. without it being some unbelievably bizarre thing, there is such a thing as a whirlwind of the mind. And you have had a whirlwind of the mind where God has begun to speak to you in the whirlwind. A desperate moment, a time when you're just holding your head, you're hanging on, this is too much, your friends are doubting you, you're doubting your friends, you're doubting yourself, you're doubting God. Somebody may be hanging on to you right now and they're kind of getting through to you just a little bit, but you're in a storm. And the storm that is your life, the storm that is the circumstance you find yourself in, is such that dust is all over the place. It's in your face. You're losing your bearings. You can't see very clearly. You don't hurt as much as you are desperate and scared. You're in a whirlwind. And it's just a metaphor of what your life is like right now. The sand is everywhere. You don't know where you are. The most dangerous thing in the world for you to do right now would be to make decisions. By the way, a good idea when you're ministering to someone in a whirlwind, I've never forgotten this since this kind of dawned on me, and this is like a little tiny piece. These are these little pieces that you might remember these more than anything else I say, but when somebody's in a whirlwind, don't give them directions. Hang on to them. Wait for the dust to settle. Because you don't know where to go. But God begins in the whirlwind of where Job is at. In the middle of a storm, Job is the epitome of defensive, non-receptive, closed-minded hostility. And that defensive, non-receptive, closed-minded hostility is the definition of the storm. And God begins to speak. By the way, I gave you this thing about Elihu speaking and then God speaking, and all of a sudden Elihu's words were like God's. They are the same. In chapter 37, verse 18, Elihu says to Job in a confrontation, Can you with him spread out the skies, strong as molten mirror? And he was confronting him with a barrage of things. And all of a sudden he hears God saying in chapter 38, verse 4, Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? He's saying the same thing. Elihu's words became God's words. A meeting was taking place. The whirlwind was happening. Finally, God's got Job's attention. And what we're going to do now is look at this dialogue. It's really more of a monologue where God begins to deal with Job. It's kind of a wrestling with him. It wouldn't hurt at all to see dust fly if this was a drama in your mind. And God begins to come on Job and question him. Verse 2. Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? It's extremely important that I exegete this for you. The word darken there means to doubt. Write that in your Bible, if you're a Bible marker. I did that in mine. The word darken there means to doubt. The word counsel there in the Hebrew means concern or care. Read it this way now. Who is this that doubts my care? Who is this that doubts my concern? by words without knowledge. You got it all figured out, Job. I don't care about you. And there's all the evidence, because everything's going bad. Who is this that doubts my concern by words without knowledge? I don't know if you'd like this, but here's God saying to Job, gird up your loins like a man. You know what that means? Get ready for a fight. We're going to go at it right now, okay? You've doubted my concern for you. Gird up your loins by a man, and I will ask you, and you can instruct me. Job, I've got a question for you. Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me if you have understanding. Verse 8. Who enclosed the sea with doors when, bursting forth, it went out from the womb? When I made a cloud its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band, and I placed boundaries on it, and I set a bolt at the doors, and I said, Thus far you shall come but no further, And here shall your proud wave stop. Where were you when all that happened? When I told the ocean, no, that's it, right there, you stop. Have you ever wondered about that? I never have. No, when you hear a verse like that, you go, yeah, that's really kind of weird. Why does the ocean stop like Florida? I don't know. Anyway, because God said, no, that's it, stop right there. Anyway, verse 12. It does weird images, doesn't it? Anyway, okay. Verse 12. Have you ever in your life commanded the morning and caused the dawn to know its place? How did the dawn know that it's supposed to happen in the morning? Anyway, verse 16. Have you entered into the springs of the sea or have you walked into the recesses of the deep? Have you entered the storehouses of snow or have you seen storehouses of hail? Do you know where I keep that stuff? Anyway, I think it's funny. You know where I keep that? Have you seen the storehouses of snow? They're huge. Or the hail, when I bring the hail. You know where I keep that stuff? You ever seen that? Verse 36. Who has put wisdom in the innermost being or has given understanding to the mind? You know what he's saying here is that Job, I know the inner workings of the heart and I know the inner workings of the mind. Chapter 39, verse 1. Do you know the time that mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the deer? Verse 5. Who sent out the wild donkey free? And who loosed the bonds of the swift donkey? Same chapter, verse 26. Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, stretching his wings toward the south? Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high? I'm not reading you all these verses. If I did, it would just be even more of a barrage. God is just overwhelming Job with evidence that he is God and you're not. I am God and you're not. Then, chapter 40, verse 1, the Lord said to Job, will the fault finder contend with the Almighty? Let him who reproves God answer it. Chapter 40, verse 3. It gets interesting here. Then Job answered the Lord and said, Behold, I am insignificant. Okay, that's an appropriate response. I think I would respond like that. what can I reply to you? You are the one who commanded the eagles. You are the one who told the ocean to stop. You are the one who put wisdom in the innermost being. I can't fight with this, and so I am going to shut up. Behold, I lay my hand on my mouth. I'm really sorry I said a word. Eliphaz, Zophar, and Bildad couldn't shut me up, but you can. Here we go. I'm not going to say another word. Once I have spoken, and I will not answer even twice, I have spoken, but I will add no more. I put my foot in my mouth once. In fact, I put my foot in my mouth twice, but I'm not going to do it anymore. And then God does something I don't understand, unless there's something else going on. Then the Lord answered Job out of the stone. He starts pouring it on again. He does it again. Lord answered Job out of the storm and said, Now gird up your loins like a man. Why is he saying that? It's very important that you understand he has said this before. In chapter 38, verse 3, when we started this whole conversation, he said, Now gird your loins up like a man. Get ready. You have doubted my concern. This is who I am. This is one of the things that proves my concern. Job then, in response to his overwhelming display of majesty and power, says, okay, I'm going to respond the way I think you want me to respond. I won't talk anymore. I won't say anymore. In verse 6, it's as if what God is saying, you need to really catch this. It's as if God is saying, okay, Job, your response to this, be quiet now, I'm not going to say what's really going on inside me anymore. Just evidence is that you didn't really get not what I said, but why I said it. You didn't get why I said that. You haven't heard me. You need to catch what's happening here. You didn't hear me right. You need to know, Job, and I'm going to give you this in just a couple of verses. I was not flexing my godly muscles to intimidate you. I did not demonstrate my majesty and power to shut you up. That was not the ultimate intention. Bringing a genuine spirit of humility is okay, but I did not do this to turn you off. So we're going to start all over again from the beginning, back where we began, gird up your loins like a man. Job, I'm wrestling with you and for you. I want you to come out and talk to me. Verse 10, adorn yourself with eminence and dignity and clothe yourself with honor and majesty. I want you to pour out the overflowings of your anger. I want you to come at me. Job, and then he goes on with the whole thing again with where were you and all this. Job, I want you to know something. It is a true thing. I am all-powerful. I am majestic. And my power indicates something. And you kind of picked up a piece of it, but you're making the wrong conclusion. My power indicates that I don't have any need of you. You weren't anywhere when I created this stuff. You weren't there. And I am God who has no need of you. I function independently of you. I function independently of your approval. That is a good lesson to get, Job. But my purpose in telling you that I am God and you are not was not to make you grovel. My majesty is a fact. But my majesty becomes a significant fact to you, Job, when you begin to realize that I, who am God, majestic, powerful, made the world, everything in it, didn't need you to do it, loves you, wants you to come to me, wants you to pour out the overflowings of your anger. I, who am God, want you to be here. I still want you to come. I still want you to pour it out. I love you. This is a very deep truth. God does not have need of us. He functions independently of us. And there is nothing that we can do to earn his love and acceptance. But this God who is majesty and is power and did make it all and did say to the ocean, stop there, and you had nothing to do with that, says to us who had nothing to do with any of that, I love you, I care about you, I want you to come to me in honor and majesty in yours and pour out the overflowings of your heart. I want you to do that to this God who is the creator of it all. and when you just you got the wrong response humility yes but I want you to come not this I want you to come and I gave you this picture of my majesty not to just shut you up I gave it to you to let you know that this one who is majesty loves you Job does begin to get it in chapter 42 Job answered the Lord and said, I know that thou canst do all things, that no purpose of thine can be thwarted. Who is this then that hides counsel? And again, what that means, who is this that has doubted your concern without knowledge that has been me? I have doubted your concern, and I didn't know what I was talking about. When you demonstrate your majesty the way you have, the power that you have, the glory that you are, therefore, when I was doubting your concern without knowledge what was going on, I declared things that I didn't understand. He hates me. He lets the wicked get away with murder. He doesn't know what's going on. I declared things that I did not understand, and things too wonderful for me which I did not know. the things that were too wonderful for him that he did not know, was that God does care. He is concerned. Hear now and I will speak. He's not saying, I'm going to put my hand in my mouth now. That's what he said at the first barrage. Hear now and I will speak. I'm going to speak some different things, though. My speaking is really going to be asking thee, and instruct me. Here's the changed life in verse 5. Behold, I have heard of thee with the hearing of my ear, but now I see you with my eye. Therefore I retract and I repent in dust and ashes. I have heard of thee with the hearing of my ear. The way I translate that through the grid of my life is I have heard of thee with the hearing of my ear is like saying I was raised in a Christian home. Therefore, I was raised in a Christian home and therefore I went to Sunday school all my life and therefore I heard this stuff since I was a little kid but now I finally come to a point where I know who God is. I see you with my eye. It's a statement of intimacy. I repent, I turn away, I change my mind, I ask God for forgiveness and Job has a change in heart. At this point, a couple things. Number one, none of the pain is gone. there hasn't been any healing nobody's been raised from the dead the boils are still there that's point number one but the heart has changed okay to get to the changed heart though he had to go through a process and the biggest most painful part of the process was saying inappropriate but honest things that was the process that brought him to intimacy the other thing that you need to note at this verse at verse 5 and 6 is that at the point at which he's saying, behold, I heard of you, but now I see you, he doesn't know why. There is no answering the question why yet. He has had no insight into what happened in heaven between Satan and God. He doesn't know anything about that. If he did, it would probably have added six or seven chapters to this. But that is a very significant piece in this because I think one of the things that we struggle with when we go through pain is we really believe that if I could figure out why, then it would be okay. I'd be able to deal with my grief better if I just knew why this happened. I also think that's a piece you need to know if you're going to be a caregiver. Because one of the things we really get intimidated by when we're wanting to be a caregiver with a friend is that we really feel like I don't have any real significant ministry with my friend unless I can explain to them why. And the fact is, you don't know. That's the true thing. You don't know why. What happened to Job that gave him his release was not that he finally figured out why. See, I think that's a lie. we think if I could figure out why then I'll be no you won't, no you won't Job discovered who? Job discovered God he discovered that God was real in the middle of the pain Job did not have a why and he was too honest to make one up sometimes we do that too have you ever done that? you kind of make one up well this is it, it happened like this five years later you figure out it really was all great you make one up what Job got a hold of was God, him. That was it. My only hope is Jesus. And everything else had gotten God. We would say it. Our only hope is Jesus. Verse 6, he repents. It's the final dimension of the drama except for the completion. And then I'm going to back off and deal a little bit with the why because that does plague us. Let's just look at the way the whole thing wraps up in verse 7. It came about after the Lord had spoken these words. But the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, and this is tremendously satisfying to read these verses. If you've been with us every week and heard the stupid things that Eliphaz, Zophar, and Bildad said, this is going to feel like, ah, good. Anyway, Eliphaz the Temanite said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job did. Now, I can't possibly do this for you, but whatever God can give you right now in terms of playing tapes back over the last couple of weeks and all of the things that Eliphaz, Zophar, and Bildad said, on behalf of God, good people have good things happen to them. If you're godly, it'll all be great. If you have something bad happen to you, it's because you're in sin. God said to them, you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. And Job said some incredibly, you know, un-Christian things. I see the wicked prosper. Ah, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. He was telling true things. He didn't have the whole picture, but Job was the one I could work with. Therefore, go, take yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and my servant Job will pray for you. That's great, isn't that great? Anyway. For I will accept him so that I may not do with you according to your folly. What that means is I'm not going to give you everything you deserve, which is grace and mercy, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Namathite went and did as the Lord told him, and the Lord accepted Job. Verse 10. And this is the epilogue. As the credits are rolling, the Lord restored the fortunes of Job when he prayed for his friends, and the Lord increased all that Job had twofold, all his brothers and all his sisters and all who had known him before came to him and ate bread with him in his house and they consoled him and comforted him for all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him. And each one gave him one piece of money and each had a ring of gold. And the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, a whole bunch, a whole bunch. Verse 16, And after this Job lived 140 years, saw his sons and his grandsons four generations, and Job died. an old man and full of days. In other words, he lived happily ever after. That's great. There are some people who don't die full of days. There are some people who die with the questions still on their lips and misunderstandings still in their heart, but they can die the way Job. Job could have died in verse 5, and it would have been victory without all the other stuff returned. What I want to deal with, to close with, is what is the dilemma of the whole thing. Going back and asking the hard question of why does this whole thing happen in the first place? I really don't like that picture that we see in Job chapter 1. Let's go back there. You know, I'm really glad it all turned out great. I can see how God was working on Job and those three friends, and it's kind of a model for us, but isn't that an awful lot of pain? And the real question isn't theoretical. Is God, is he going to go sickle them to me? Is that going to happen to me? Verse 8, And the Lord said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil. That's the scenario that I want to just address a little bit, look at. The fact is this, that life is a war. There is a conflict going on. Whether we like to look at it in foundations class, I'm going to get into a little deeper, the whole concept of spiritual warfare. But there is a cosmic conflict going on, and Satan does want to war against us. And Ephesians chapter 6 talks about the fact that Satan is at war with us, and we need to put on the whole armor of God, and Satan literally would like to destroy us. How is it that Satan is then allowed to somehow move in and these kinds of things happen? Well, one, I don't know for sure. I mean, I don't know, ultimately. I have some senses of things that I want to share with you. At least two truths. One is this, that there are times when God lets the heads down. All of why I don't know. I have some ideas. But one of the things that I know for sure, there's a lot of things I don't know for sure, but there is one thing that I know for sure, and that is this, that even in a situation as icky as my spirit reacts to this picture of Satan coming and God seemingly picking Job, one of the things we need to understand is this. Principle number one, God picks the point of battle. God picks the point of battle. Satan does not. God said, look at Job. Now, on one hand, that looks very unfair, but there's something else about that that we need to affirm. God is the one who picks the point of battle there are two reasons God picks the point of battle number one the reason he is picking Job is not to humiliate and destroy Job number one the reason God picks the point of battle in a person's life is to defeat Satan at that point any good general if he's going into war what he wants to do is we're going to have conflict we're going to have a war but I want to be able to pick where we fight this and how we fight it on my terms the warfare that's going on here is painful and icky but it's going to be on God's terms God chooses the point of battle again, you know, wiggle around on that pin a little bit that he picked Job somehow meaning he might pick you, I don't like that but he did it to defeat Satan there to leave ashes in his mouth and another thing he did it to build Job, to test the saints. I'm going to explain what testing means because I don't think it means what most of us think. At the battle plan, at the point of battle, when God was being confronted by Satan, it's as if God is saying this, Satan, you don't know this, But here's my idea in this whole thing with Job. In a world where prosperity, luxury, and comfort are the aim of most efforts, where health and happiness is the object of almost every prayer I hear, where the companionship of friends and family is the highest form of fellowship that most people ever know, that is where the enemy is going to move. He is going to move on family and friends, health and happiness. He is going to move on prosperity, luxury, and comfort. but I'm here to tell you Satan and it's my agenda and again you don't see it but it is where you move but it is also at that same point that I'm going to defeat you Satan in Job's life let me read that again in a world where prosperity luxury and comfort are the aim of most efforts health and happiness the object of most prayer the companionship of friends and family the highest form of fellowship that is where the enemy is going to move but that is where I am going to defeat the enemy right in all those places because when people lose them all they are going to reel they're going to they're going to spin but in the end they're going to find out that i am too sufficient even then and they will come forth as gold my people will and at the end of that whole thing you're going to end with ashes in your mouth satan though the battle is waged i'm going to win it and satan's going to have ashes in his mouth Okay, he picks the point of battle. That's important. He does it to defeat Satan at that point. He does it to defeat Satan in your life. The second reason, and this will get that, is to test the saints. And I want to turn to 1 Corinthians 10 for this. There's a teaching I did a long time ago in 1 Corinthians that fits like this with this. Again, this is under the overall heading of God picks the point of battle. The verse is one you've probably heard before often. No temptation has overtaken you, but such as is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but will with the temptation provide the way of escape also, that you may be able to endure it. The first word I want to talk about there is temptation. Just in breaking the text now, we've got to figure out what that means. I don't know what comes to your mind, but there generally isn't a whole lot of mystery about a temptation, a good old-fashioned temptation. I know one when I see one. Generally, we think of some evil thing that seduces us, that entices us, that calls us, some sort of a seduction. When I think of something that seduces or calls me, I generally think of a sexual thing, a sexual seduction, a moral seducing, some sort of ethical, again, seducing to do something that is wrong. It could be something broader than ethical, moral, or sexual. It could be something that just calls to me. I mean, it could be a piece of cake on the counter that's going, I taste really good. You know, and it's calling me, and I'm being drawn. It's a temptation, you know, and I'm wanting to go. That's how we think of temptations. They're things that call to us. And we're not supposed to yield to temptation. This particular word is different than a seduction that is enticing me to evil. The Greek word here is the Greek word perasmas. This word is perasmas. And it's a far broader sense than something that is seducing me to evil. The literal word has no moral connotation. Perasmos has no more, it isn't, to be perasmos is not good or bad. You're not being perasmos too good or bad. It's just, a perasmos is a test. It is defined this way. It is to test something, to try, to prove, to test, to try, to prove. In the case of metal, if you were to perasmos metal, you would be assaying the metal, to assay the metal. Let me say it more clearly. It is a solicitation, not a seduction, but it is a solicitation. It is the calling forth of something. It is the calling forth of something. If you're taking notes, write this down and it'll make sense later. Hmm. Say it this way. To peras mas is to test something, to try something, to prove something. When you're testing something, you are soliciting or calling forth something. Think of it in metal. If you are to test the metal, you are calling forth what? What's the purity of the metal? You're calling out the purity. That's what a test is for. That is what a perasmas is for. Most of you went through school feeling like tests were supposed to humiliate you. That was their design. That is not the design of a test, even in school. The purpose of a test is to call out what is there. In fact, after I've given you all these other stupid little words, what I really want to get to is this. A perasmos is calling, the design of it is to call out from you what is already there. When you take a test in school, it's to call out the knowledge that you have under some pressure, under some heat, you know, and it calls out what's there. A solicitation of calling forth. Let me give you some examples. Matthew 4.1. The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted. that's the word, tempted the Greek word is perasmas in this text too what was he tempted did the Holy Spirit lead Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted to sin no, that's not the meaning of the word it wasn't being drawn to sin the temptation there was a solicitation he was calling forth from Jesus he was revealing the purpose of the temptation was to reveal something in Jesus to make something manifest in Jesus that was already there and that was through the process of the testing in the wilderness it called forth his holiness his righteousness his dependency the test called it out it said time to come it came see that keep hanging with me on this again he was not tested and brought into the wilderness to be tested or tempted to sin the tempting again we got to almost erase our understanding of tempting is a seduction to sin. It is not that. It is a calling forth of something that's already there. In Jesus' temptation, the calling out called out righteousness. It called out holiness. That was what was there. Hebrews 11 speaks of Genesis 22, when God tempted Abraham, and it was dealing with the sacrifice of Isaac. And the temptation wasn't tempting him to sin. Let's see if he trips up here. He failed. He passed. That kind of mentality. It's not a test to see if you fail, a test to see if you pass. That is not in view. The testing was to call from Abraham what was there, and that was what? Faith. The testing for Jesus was not, let's see if he passes. Oh, he passed. I guess he can go on and be the Messiah. Oh, he failed. That's it. Ends in chapter 4. That's how we think of a test. The test is to call forth something. It called faith out of Abraham. It called righteousness, holiness, and dependency out of Jesus. Again, this is so new, because we still think of tempting or testing as pass, fail, calling to sin. Job went through a perasmas. Job went through a test. And it wasn't to see, ah, he failed, ah, he passed. It was to call something out that wouldn't have come out any other way. What do you mean? Okay, now let's take this understanding of temptation in verse 13 of 1 Corinthians and go back in our minds to Job. In the very beginning, chapter 1, there were some things that God knew about Job. What did he know about Job? First of all, he knew that Job was righteous, verse 8. Chapter 1, verse 8, he knew that he was righteous, he was upright, he was fearing God, and he turned away from evil. There was something else that God knew about Job. Not only was he righteous, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil, but Job was shallow. How do you know that? How do I know that God knew that? The way we know that God knew he was shallow was because at the very end of the book, the final word is, before I heard you with the hearing of my ear, now I see you with my eye. Before, even though there was righteousness, uprightness, fearing God and turning away from evil, whatever the manifestation of that was, it was a shallow thing compared to the intimacy I know now. And so it was that God, in this thing that looks so terrible with Satan, goes, consider my son Job. Righteous, upright, fearing God, turning away from evil. But I'm going to call something forth from him that is going to put ashes in Satan's mouth and bring this guy forth as gold. And nothing else would bring it out the way this is going to. And I'm going to love him the whole time. The test, however, again, I want to just keep nailing this, is not to see if he fails and if he passes. the test is to call something out let me illustrate how it's not failing and passing as we go through this the hedge went down the pain came his first response Job's first response chapter 1 verse 20 and 22 he arose, he tore his robe, he shaved his head and he worshipped God naked I came, naked I'll go the Lord gives, the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord and in all this, Job did not sin, neither did he blame God. If a test, if a temptation, if when God tests you is a pass and fail thing, what happened just there? He passed. End of test, you get an A. It's not the purpose of a test. It's not the purpose of a test. He gave the right answer, but a test isn't just to get the right, that's to call for something that needs to be called out, wouldn't be called out any other way. We're going to get depth out of this guy. We're going to have an intimacy and a power. So we're going to go a little deeper. Pain continued. Chapter 3, remember what happened then? He wasn't saying the right things anymore. He wasn't saying, blessed be the name of the Lord. He was saying, where did God go? I think this is terrible. I hate this whole thing. Chapter 10, verse 1, I loathe life, and I will give full vent to my complaint, and I don't care who knows it. and again roll the tape all of the incredibly inappropriate sometimes vile things that job said god doesn't care he's mean remember that week when we talked about that what dawned on job was that my fear isn't that he's not real it's that he's mean he just really doesn't care well, failed the test you failed that's not what a test is it's not what a test is it's not about passing something is being solicited from Job something is being pulled out from him that is there it is there because we know it's there righteous, upright, fearing God turning away from evil but something deeper about that needs to be pulled out in the process of the test and I tell you this is extremely important that we understand this as we relate to people especially in church when some people are going through a test and God's calling something out the process for Job there were times he did not look very good he did not say appropriate things sometimes I wonder what Peter looked like when he was being sifted like wheat you know remember that when Jesus said that to Peter Peter you're going to be sifted like wheat and the whole drama isn't played out for us in scripture what Peter went through I know part of that was when he denied Jesus that was part of his inappropriate stuff but Peter the sifting isn't because I don't care about you you might feel like that in the middle of it but it's because I'm going to call forth something out of you that wouldn't get called out any other way because Peter you are righteous and you are upright and you fear God and you turn away from evil, but you are incredibly shallow. So we're going to call something out. They turned up to heat. Not pass, fail. Because at one point he passed, another time he looked like he failed. So what is he calling out of Job? Well, we kind of already know, don't we? Chapter 19, 32, 13 through 21, we saw him last week fall into the pit, pity me, pity me, but then something came out of Job and there was a passion in it that I don't think would have ever been come, it would have never come out of this upright, righteous, everything is working out just fine, chapter 1 Job. He said this, get a piece of paper, no, put it in a book, no, write it on a rock. I know that my Redeemer lives and he will stand and so will I. And I want that written on a rock because tomorrow I'm going to forget that. There was an affirmation of truth. That got called out. But also what God called out of Job is chapter 42, verse 5. I heard of thee with the hearing of my ear, but now I see you with my eye. And you know, quite frankly, if we could interview Job, I think he would say this. There is nothing about the experience that I can say I enjoy. There is no way I would want to sit here and stupidly say, it was really great. But at the end of this whole thing, there was an intimacy with God now that Job had that made what he had before, when he was called even by God, righteous, upright, fearing God, turning away from evil. It made it look like he didn't know him then in comparison to what he knew now. That's perasmas. Not testing to pass or fail. Did you pass the test? Oh, you failed the test. You know, when you're in a test, you're going to, I hope this is a liberating thought, you're going to be goofy in the test. You're going to have good responses in the test. That's not the test. The test is when maturity begins to come. Conor, I'll join when you meet various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. In the hands of God, a prayer asimus is used to call forth righteousness, holiness, faith, and dependency. In the hands of Satan, that same thing is used to call forth striving, fear, and sin. By the way, it's another thing about back to 1 Corinthians 14. No temptation has overtaken you. That's an important thing to note. The temptation that comes, the trial that comes, is not because you stumbled into sin. We would be gentle if you did with you. But this is not something that has overtaken you. I mean, it is not something that you have stumbled into. It's something that overtook you. And I don't know if you've ever felt like that, but sometimes when pain comes to our life, it's like it chased us down. And that's what happens here. It's overtaken them. It's when you have too much money. It's too much money at the end of the money. It overtook you. could be deeper than that. Could be sickness that just came. Death, it just overtook you. It came to you. A relationship you care about goes sour. It overtook you. A dream that died, it overtook you. It became the object of scorn for some reason. It overtook you. It came to you. Abuse, it came to you. It's common to man. temptations that come running after you trials designed by God to call out deeper things are common to man again let me just give you these little tiny pieces of this whole thing the Greek word there for common to man, man there is anthropos, it means human these kinds of trials that aren't deserved they don't have any connection with you doing a bad thing and now you're getting nothing like that that kind of trial is common that is designed by the way to bring comfort what it tells you is that you're not alone I don't know about you but as I go through issues in my life that are very confusing and things that happen or come to me that don't make sense and don't feel fair I need to know that I'm not the only one there's something else about this common to man piece that I think is very significant for our ministry concept as we consider this class in that light. One of the things about this is this. When I realize that pain and unfair things are common to man, it motivates me to minister. And I hope it's a motivation for you to minister. The reason it's a motivator for ministry is because it helps you realize that no matter where you go, no matter who you talk to, no matter how good they look, they have pain. let that just sink in think about that when you go to work tomorrow when I go speak other places I kind of feel I feel like the freest place I am when I ever preach any place is here and sometimes I go out somewhere else and it's always awkward just like you guys if you meet somebody new you're just kind of whatever and I feel like there's an intimacy here because I feel like even though we don't know every individual we know each other we kind of live together I go somewhere else and everybody's got their three piece suit on and one of the things that really helps me whenever I go anywhere else to minister is I have this basic assumption in my life. I don't care how good they look. I don't care how capable they seem. I don't care how wonderful they appear. There's one thing I know about every single person in this room of faces that I'll never see again. Maybe every one of them have pain. You know why? It's common to man. It's anthropos. It's just the way it is. And knowing that liberates us to share. Because see, what happens is, And that's the second thing. It not only motivates us to minister, it liberates us to share and be transparent ourselves. Because what you can do is, if you really realize that on basis of Scripture, it's common to man, on basis of Scripture, you can go in and minister to people with this crazy idea. And I do this. And it's weird, because some of this really did liberate me. I do move into relationships with people with this crazy idea that if I'm personally struggling with something, or if I have questions about something, or if I have feelings I don't understand and don't even like, then so do you. I think whatever I've got, however bizarre it might seem, and you need to know that about yourself. Whatever you've got, whatever you're going through, whatever feelings you have, whatever questions you struggle with, whatever doubts plague you, you need to know that whatever they are, they are anthropos. They are common to man. Everybody's got them. Everybody in this room's got them. Some hide that very well, and some get very angry when you get close to that, but it's there. It is there. When you realize that whatever's going on in you is going on in somebody else, it makes it a lot easier for you to share something because you're not the only one. You aren't. It's kind of one of the things that kicks Galatians 6 in where it talks about bearing one another's burdens and thus fulfill the law of Christ. One of the little cliches we had around open door. years ago when we went through Galatians 6 was we need to bear one another's burdens and thus fulfill the law of Christ, but you can't bear what someone doesn't share. And one of the things that sets us free is realizing that whatever it is that you're bearing is common to man. Everybody has something like that. This is a little side piece on that, but sometimes what God is calling forth from you when you go through a trial, when you go through some pain, and it's part of preparation for ministry, sometimes what God's calling forth from people is just plain compassion. I think there are people who it just seems like everything is just, you know, it's like Job said. Remember? Oh, I wish I could remember the exact words. But how incredible it is when you don't have pain how the answers are easy for you. I'm paraphrasing that. Do you remember that? It's incredible how you don't have pain and you've got all the answers. One of the things that is a real gift from God to some people is they get a little bit of pain. And all of a sudden, they get a lot more gentle with people who are in pain. do you know anybody right now is having problems with their marriage and you got it all figured out I'm not telling you that you shouldn't be involved and shouldn't love them and shouldn't maybe give them some advice but maybe the way you're doing it isn't very gentle because yours is so easy and maybe a little bit of trouble there would be a little gift to you to make you a little more gentle in dealing with somebody else's pain it produces compassion 1 Corinthians 1.4 says that speaking of God who comforts us in our affliction that we may be able to comfort those who are in pain themselves we need to know that no matter how everybody looks and how nice they look and all together everybody struggles it's common to man the promise of God there is a promise in here the promise is this God is faithful and some of you if you're in deep pain right now or if you've gone through it and you're going yeah right faithful to do what well the text says he's faithful to not allow the temptation or the test to go beyond that which you are able but will with the temptation provide the way of escape that you may be able to bear it. He will provide the way of escape. And there's another place where some of you are going, oh yeah, he didn't provide a way for me to escape. He hasn't provided a way for me to escape. I pray all the time for an escape, and there's no escape. I don't have an easy answer for you here, but here is the answer. It's in the text. providing the way of escape that you may be able to endure it. Get this. The way out, the way out of the pain, the way out of the residue you've got left of a yucky life or pain or whatever it is, the way out of all that junk is not always God going, poof, a way out, bingo, and you're gone. The way out is that you may be able to endure it. The way out is through. The way out is through, that you may be able to endure it. That Greek word is going through it. The way out is to go through it. I'm giving you some examples of that. In Gethsemane, Jesus did something that I can relate to. Knowing the cross was imminent, he began to pray, and he prayed, and he prayed, and he prayed. And then with sweat drops of blood, he said, Let this cup pass from me. and I think God gave him a promise I'm going to be faithful and I will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able but will with that trial provide the way, the way of escape and the way of escape is what? through, the way of escape is through and so he took the cup, he went through the pain he went through the experience keeping our eyes fixed on Christ Hebrews, I think it is Hebrews 12 Keep our eyes fixed on Christ, who for the joy set before him endured the cross. He what? He went what? Through the cross. The way out was what? Through. And I'm going to hang on to you through. God sometimes just goes poof, and it's gone. But the promise of God is I'm going to be with you through it. And sometimes I'm afraid that what short circuits the process that God has us in to go through it is this desire and even some lies to us that that God will. God's just going to go poof and it's all gone and we keep waiting for that and it doesn't really come and then we have somebody tell us in the name of Jesus it came and so we pretend it's there and it's not there. The way out is through. It's a funny thing about resurrection. You know, resurrection power where the power of God is released and something that was dead comes to life. in order to experience resurrection. You've got to die first. You've got to go through that. I must go to Jerusalem. Remember that a couple weeks ago? Suffer many things and die in order to be raised again. The way out is through. Some of us are like our marriage is fixed. And we think, I believe in coming forward. We have incredible ministry here. Poof, it's better. Great. The way out is through, friend. Process. We've been conned into a quick fix theology for almost everything. Lollipop Christianity is what I call it. God is kind of a Santa Claus, and if I'm good, he prospers me, and if I'm not, he punishes me. Some of what, if nothing else you get about tonight, the biggest piece some of you need is to realize that, For some of you, the only way out, for you, of the pain in your life, the junk in your marriage, is not by coming and waiting for a magic wand to go over it. It's going to be through. You're going to go through, and God's going to bring you through, and you're going to come out the other side alive. But knowing that the way out is through, here's where the promise is to come. As I go through, I know some things. As I go through, what I know is this, God is faithful. As I go through, God is faithful. And he is faithful to never let me go. I belong to him. I am clay in the potter's hands. And as he is dealing with me, he is making something valuable. And I'm going to tell you something else. If I am going through something, I can, with my mind, believe that he is faithful. He's hanging on to me, and he's making something valuable. And nothing can separate me from the love of Christ. But I'd really like to have some people around me affirming that too. And if you think that's kind of, yeah, well, that just kind of affirms our, you know, infallibility and we're so wimpy. The biggest thing that broke Jesus' heart in the Garden of Gethsemane was what? Remember when he came to the disciples, can't you be with me? I just want you to be with me. I don't want you to preach a sermon. I don't want you to give me any answers. I don't want you to solve my problem. You can't solve my problem. I just want you to be with me. One of my favorite passages is about a human touch and how that helps me realize that God is faithful, somebody to remind me about God's grace and his love and that nothing can separate me because I talk to myself all the time and sometimes it don't work. 2 Corinthians 7, where Paul says, when we were in Macedonia, our flesh, we had conflicts without, we had fears within. We had conflicts without, we had fears within. But God who comforts the depressed, Paul was depressed, which is a comfort to me, God who comforts the depressed comforted us by the coming of what? Titus. The coming of a friend. Who told him, Paul, God's faithful. Nothing can separate you from the love of God and nothing can separate you from the love of Titus because I'm here for you. It's kind of, I don't want to overdo this, but it's kind of the same metaphor we've had on Sunday morning. Remember Sunday morning? A couple weeks ago, it was 11 through 14. I am the shepherd and if you get lost, I'm going to pursue you. For two weeks we heard that from Steve and then from me, from me and then from Steve. God pursues us, God pursues us, God pursues us. And in the next passage that we're in right now, he's saying one of the ways I want to pursue my little ones is through people. You pursue, you pursue. God is faithful. One of the ways that faithfulness is going to get affirmed is through the body reminding the body that that's a true thing. He's faithful to not allow more than we're able. Again, the thing there is we think, doesn't he ever just deliver whammo? Yeah. I think he does deliver, and sometimes he does that when we're not ready for more. Let me give you an example of that. James, or John, 18, 7 and 9. This was when the Roman soldiers were coming for Jesus to take him and kill him. And Jesus, at that time, said, I am Jesus, but let these go their way. he gave a command to the soldiers, let these who are with me go their way. And then it said something very weird because it doesn't seem terribly significant to let these go their way. But he said, so that what was prophesied will be fulfilled, that of those whom thou hast given to me, I have lost not one. Okay, what he's doing there is he's protecting the disciples. He's saying, I am the one you're looking for, take me, but let these go their way. You do not have a right to touch them. And there was a protection of God on them that they did not go through what they couldn't handle yet then. And so said, you can't do it because I have not lost one of my little ones yet. And I never will. God protected them. God didn't allow them to go through what they couldn't handle yet. But you know what I know about the disciples later? Was that they did go through some things. In fact, all but one died a martyr's death. So they did. there was a time when God, even on the disciples, physically let the hedge go down, and every one of them got killed. There was another time when he said no. I already gave this piece. I think that God is faithful, not allow more than able. Find a friend. I've already given you that piece, but find a friend. I think when you're going through this kind of stuff, you need to find a friend. You need to know who you are. You need to know whose you are. And Jesus said, of those whom thou hast given to me, I have lost not one. And maybe after all of that, you can say with Job, I don't know much anymore. And some of you might be on the end of a trial. Some of you might be in the middle of one. Some of you might be in the beginning of one. Some of you might be in a place where it looks like your whole life has been one. And I don't know much anymore. But I know this. I know my Redeemer lives. And he will stand. And so will I. Write it on a rock. And out of that begins to come things called forth from us, like depth and faith and power and life. Let's pray. Jesus, I pray that the power of your Spirit would be released upon people who may be right now going through a trial, who may be looking for quick fixes, and while, God, we affirm the fact that you can come and bring healing that is instantaneous, even in those situations where you bring healing, very often the healing you bring is a healing so that we can continue to go through the process, so that we aren't debilitated, that you heal wounds so we can continue to go through what we need to go through so we can come out a mature man or woman. and God we just want to come against the shallowness of so many of our perceptions the perceptions of the Eliphaz, Zophar and Bildads who even though we can laugh at them sometimes we hold those same perceptions but Father we want to be walking in such a way that we are having called forth from us deeper dependence and deeper confidence and deeper hanging on to you as our only source, as you graciously strip away from us every other God that we run to. I pray you do that. I hate it when you do that. But you're our only adequate source of life. You're our only adequate source of water. You're the only one who quenches our thirst. You're the only one who satisfies the hunger of our soul. I pray that in a myriad of ways you would continue to teach us that the way you taught it to Job so that we can say with him continually God, the way I see you now compared to last year last year I heard of you with the hearing of my ear and now I see you with my eye and God, we want our process to be such that we kind of say that all the time that it's getting deeper and more real and more profound and more intimate. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you.
