Today's scripture reading is from Isaiah 61. to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called Oaks of Righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor. They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated. They will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations. For I, the Lord, love justice. I hate robbery and wrongdoing. In my faithfulness, I will reward my people and make an everlasting covenant with death. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Thank you. and the star of that show was Elijah. I think most of you know that we've been following the lectionary and for our Advent reflections and services and sermons and the text you just heard was indeed from the lectionary for the week where the prophet Isaiah says these words that to me are very stirring when he says the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon me because he's anointed me. He has sent me to preach good news. That is the words of the prophet. It's the kind of thing a prophet says and I love the sound of it actually. I love the confidence I hear in those words. A kind of fierceness of purpose and resolve that comes to you when you're in one of those places where you actually know. The Spirit of the Lord is on me right now because he has anointed me he has sent me to preach. But preach, particularly, says Isaiah, good news to the poor he has sent me to bind up. He has sent me to proclaim and to release, to comfort and provide for all who mourn and those who grieve, and to bestow upon them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, a garment of praise instead of despair. He has sent me, has sent us, to renew and replace the ancient places, to repair the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations. Think of something devastated for generations. You think of a city, you might be thinking of building buildings, and it might involve that, but expand this larger in terms of metaphor. Think of people groups, of families devastated for generations. And the spirit of Elijah, when the spirit of God is on him, is that we are all about restoring those things, rebuilding those things that for generations have been destroyed. And when something's been destroyed for generations, most people give up hope. It's the kind of thing that prophets talk about, and it's precisely the thing, and I find this very interesting, powerful, as a matter of fact, that Jesus actually, at the inauguration of his ministry, when he returned to Nazareth and presented himself in the synagogue, he said exactly these words. When he opened the book of Isaiah, he went to this very passage to be, as it were, his mission statement, his purpose statement, the manifesto, as it were, of his entire ministry, saying, the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon me. He wasn't just upon Isaiah, he's upon me, says Jesus, because the Lord has anointed me. He has sent me to proclaim good news specifically to the poor. So apparently when the sovereign Lord or the spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon you, when he has in fact anointed you, one of the ways you can tell that that's actually happened isn't that they talk loud. It's that it's really good news, particularly for the poor. It's going to have an effect on, interestingly, the poor. How many of you know, as you just reflect on the realities of the life we live and the world we live in, that there's not a lot of good news in our world, in the kingdoms of this world, for the poor, for the unprotected. Not a lot of good news for the unattractive, for the unwanted, for the very young and the very old. For those who have no voice and have no choice. And if it's something that you can actually dial into and feel that there's not a lot of good news for the disenfranchised, unprotected, unattractive, you can actually buy that, enter into, or begin to enter into the authentic spirit of Advent. Because the spirit of Advent begins with longing. And longing is something we try our best to avoid. but if you can't avoid it and you feel it, you've now entered into Advent. It begins with an ache. For things in the world, in our marriage, in our church, in our whatever, for things to somehow be different, to be better, to somehow be made right. So the cry that comes from that longing, consistent also with Advent, this was the first week of Advent, is this, restore us, God, revive us. We pray, make your face to shine upon us, come down to us and save us. It's the song we began to sing in the very first week of Advent a couple of weeks ago. And then into that song, into that longing, there comes a voice. Which is the second week of Advent. And we heard the voice in Mark chapter 1 and John chapter 1. The voice of one crying in the wilderness. It's a weird kind of thing. This is voice way out there somewhere. But the voice is saying essentially this. Restoration and revival is on the way. It is something you can enter into and experience. You can be revived. But the voice also says this. You need to get ready for this voice. We need to prepare as not just individuals, but as a people. We need to make straight the path to remove the hindrances that are preventing this restoration to come, this revival to be visited upon the people of God by God himself. So repent is the word of the second week of Advent that we dealt with last week. But it's a word that Peter Kapsner, in his dealing with this word last week, rightly said, often reacted to defensively, sometimes dismissively, defensively because we often connect the word repent with a long bony finger of condemnation, repent, you know, or we dismiss it because we kind of connect it to some crackpot on the corner wearing a placard that says repent, yeah, whatever. It's so easy to dismiss that kind of weirdness. But as Peter pointed out last week, That wasn't the case. In Mark 1, chapter 5, when this voice in the wilderness was declaring that word, we need to repent, we need to turn, because in Mark 1, verse 5, the whole Judean countryside was going out to him, that is, out to John the Baptist, and all the people of Jerusalem were being baptized by him in the Jordan. They were confessing their sins, and in their confession of sin and their turning, They were getting what they wanted. They were being restored. They were being revived. It was a revival. When the people of God are revived, when they awaken from their slumber that we often fall into, it's really good news. But not just for the people of God. When the people of God are revived, it's really good news. For the people of God, but according to the Scriptures, it's really good news, not just for them. truth is it's really good news for the poor and those who are set at the margins. It's really good news for the prisoner and those who are captive and all those who mourn and those who grieve because when the spirit of the sovereign Lord comes upon his people, particularly when he comes upon his people again because they've been revived, his people begin to see what they didn't see when they were sleeping, they begin to see the poor. They begin to see the prisoner again. They begin to see again all those who mourn and those who grieve. And they begin to be, not because somebody told them to, it's just that they awakened from their slumber and then they begin to give themselves to the renewing of the ancient places and the rebuilding of the ruined cities devastated by generations that everybody else is saying, don't bother with that. It will do no good. It's been generations, we're going to turn that thing around, says the people of God in every generation, whenever they're revived, whenever they awaken from their slumber. It's fascinating, really, when I think of this in this particular context, connected to the poor and the disenfranchised in Jesus' day and in Isaiah's day, and the need to be revived as the people of God to address those things, because I grew up hearing about revival. and longing for revival where people would turn to God and would confess their sin. And we would always long for that. And every once in a while you'd see a glimpse of that here and there. It was always a sweet thing. But the sin, in the context that I grew up in, in the church, was almost always individual sin that we were repenting of, being called to repent of. And that is part of the call. And it's a very significant thing and appropriate thing to be calling people to repent of, turn away from what amounted to physical indulgence kinds of sins or behaviors. So repentance meant people quit smoking. And that was, wow, or they quit drinking, which is also something that you might need to turn from. They quit yelling at their kids, which is another thing to turn from, I suppose. But repenting of our entitlements economically, what? It just sounds so weird. The repenting of our callousness toward the poor or those held captive by systems that kept them there. I mean, if somebody talked like that in the context of my understanding of repentance when I was growing up, it would have looked at them weird. It just wasn't on the radar. And anyone who talked about things like that, who actually had passion to rebuild the proverbial ruined cities, devastated for generations. They sounded, that guy's liberal, I think. It just wasn't spiritual. Spiritual is when you dealt with your personal sins, and it's an important thing to deal with those sins. But here's the deal, and we need to get this. As a church, in the day we live in, we need to get this as the people of God, because historically, there really are a variety of ways that the people of God would wander away from God and need to return, to restore, to say, revive us, O God. But among the most significant, and you just need to read the whole book, like get into the prophets, among the most significant and often the most damaging, particularly damaging to the people of God relative to their mission in the world, was when as a people they would forget things like mercy, They would no longer do justice because that was just so basic. Justice and mercy was so basic, foundational to who they were as a people. So if you forget something fundamental to your identity and purpose as a people, you're missing something, forgetting something pretty significant. The prophet Micah summed it up pretty well when he said in Micah chapter 6 verse 8, What does the Lord require of you? Let me keep it simple for you, says the prophet. Just this, do justice, love mercy, walk humbly, that's it. But like people always do, like we always do, they would forget, which is why the prophet Isaiah says what he says in Isaiah 61, but it's also why he says what he says two chapters earlier, three chapters, whatever, I do do the math. in Isaiah 58 verse 3 when he says you guys love to go to church that's obviously my paraphrase you are careful to observe the religious ceremonies of the day and and days of fasting you do very well but on the day you do this is Isaiah 58 verse 3 you should see it on the screen on the day you do your fasting you do as you please you go to church but actually the way you live your life you just do what you please. You exploit all your workers and when your fasting ends it results in quarrels and strife and striking each other with wicked fists. You don't care for the poor anymore. You used to. Verse 7. You don't divide your bread with the hungry. You used to but you don't anymore or bring the homeless poor into the house anymore because you used to. But they do what we do. They forgot. And they most often did that. That is, forget. During seasons of success. It's fascinating. And if you just check your own spirit, I mean, I go, I know, I know, I know. I know. That's not when things are tough. It's when things get easy. All of a sudden, this entitlement thing slides in. You don't even know it came when you finally got the power that you were, God help us. When you got the wealth, when you got the money, that's when they would begin to forget. And if you read the prophets, and I recommend you do, you'll see that nothing, there was nothing that sent the people of God into exile more consistently and more quickly than their neglect of the poor and those who were far off, who'd been pushed down and been excluded, been marginalized. Let me give you an example of this. It's actually in my mind kind of a chilling example with a story, and it's a recurring story. In fact, it's our story. It really is. I think we can recover from these things when we see these stories as being our stories. It begins in Exodus 3. This is part of the story we're all very familiar with. We've even spoken of it recently in Exodus 3 where the people of God are in this very familiar place. Guess where that is? Exile. Remember this? We talked about this a few weeks ago. The pattern was they would go into exile. They would cry to be restored, revive us, revive us. They would repent. They would be delivered. Well, now they're in exile. They're in slavery. They're in Egypt. Now, in your mind, let Egypt be what it really is because Egypt is a real place with real people who became real slaves. But in your mind, I want you to dial into the fact that Egypt is also a symbol. It's also a picture of two kinds of slavery. There are slaves there, but there's two kinds of slavery, two kinds of sin. The first is individual sin. And in that context, we all have individual Egypts, if you will. Think about it this way. The individual Egypts that you have and I have are those places in our lives where we are in some bondage, if you will, to some kind of sin. But it's not ours, it's mine. So it's my personal struggle with anger or fear or lust or pride or control. And when you go there to those places of anger and fear and lust and whatever they are, and especially if you get stuck there and you're not getting free from that anger or pride or whatever, you're in Egypt. You're in exile. You're not going to hell. You're not entirely cut off from God. But in that particular arena, you're far from God. You've wandered far from home, but it's also a symbol, Egypt is, of what I want you to understand today as systemic sin. It's not just your individual sin anymore. What we're talking about now is when people get exploited and oppressed systematically, they are being held down, they are being kept out, they are being enslaved. To get your head around this, think of the isms. is a system that systematically holds people down, keeps people out. It's not the only ism, though. Capitalism is an ism, and it does the same thing. It's a system that systematically does things to people. There are consumerism systems, racism systems. Think of religious systems. You don't know of any of those that hold people down, keep people out, oppress and exploit. Never heard of that. these are systems they're demonically empowered by the way there are political systems economic systems corporate systems there are family systems some of you that's maybe that's the easiest way to get your head around this because you and i came from family systems and some of them exploited you they held you down they kept you out they were unbelievably oppressive and if there was anything you needed to be restored from, it was from that system that devoured you. And in every case, whenever you're dealing with a systemic kind of thing here, there needs to be a deliverer. There needs to be a redeemer of some sort, literally a person, a kind of Moses, if you will, someone who will into that family or economy or political system or whatever it is, fight the fight. stand up and say enough to the system which by the way is exactly what Jesus did remember when he came to the religious system of his day he stood up and said you're nuts that was again my paraphrase so they're in Egypt and now they're free come in your mind with me now to a place called Sinai and at Sinai the mountain a number of things happened there we're connected to the bringing of the Ten Commandments but actually for the story's sake I want you to dial into the fact that there is the place they were reminded of their identity it says in Exodus chapter 19 verse 5 you are a people of God's own possession but not just their identity they were reminded of their purpose Isaiah 49 verse 6 for I have called you to be a light to the nations so that my salvation that my kind of deliverance may reach the ends of the earth. In other words, God is saying to his people who were in bondage, but now they're free, I didn't rescue you from this oppressive system, Egypt, to simply become an exclusive club of rescued people. That's not why I gave you your freedom. I rescued you that you might become a rescuer yourself. A people who having been delivered from an oppressive system, whatever it might be, political, religious, economic, family, that held them down and held them out, would now be confronting the same kind of systemic sin. Wherever they sought, politically, economically, religiously, thus setting people free the way they were set free, which again is precisely what we see Jesus doing when he comes with his ministry, when he, for instance, touched a leper and ate with sinners. He wasn't just being nice. He was actually making a prophetic statement with these symbolic gestures. He was confronting a system. He was confronting a religious system that had pushed people like lepers down, that had kept people like sinners out. And in the touching of them, he was saying, no more of that. and when he told the parable in Luke chapter 12 about a man who was building bigger and bigger barns and more and more barns to hold all of his stuff and he was doing that right in the middle of abject poverty where nobody else around him had any stuff but here he is building bigger and bigger barns to store his stuff Jesus was confronting a system It wasn't just confronting this guy. He was confronting a system, but this time it was an economic system, which brings us to the third place in the story. It speaks to the cycle that all of us get into as the people of God in every generation, and we need to wake up about it, and it's found in 1 Kings 10. 1 Kings 10 is fascinating because we've gone from Egypt. Now they're free. Now they remember their identity and their purpose in 1 Kings 10. They're at the top of their game. They know who they are as the people of God, and by all accounts, it looks like they're doing their mission such that in 1 Kings 10, we see the queen of Sheba, actually, is visiting with King Solomon, saying very nice things about Solomon. Look at it on the screen, 1 Kings 10, verse 8. She says this, how blessed are your men, O Solomon, how blessed are your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom. And I'm sure Solomon was going, oh, forget it. I don't, I'm just me. Anyway. And then she says in verse 9, amazing. This is like we've won. This is evangelism. Blessed be the Lord your God, who obviously delighted in you. Why would she think that? Well, because of your wealth and because she would equate like everyone does wealth with the blessing of God. He's obviously delighted with you to set you on the throne of Israel because the Lord loved Israel forever and made you king in order to do justice and righteousness. So I'm just telling you, by every external measure, looking at what's going on here, they have entered into who they are as a people, Solomon and the people, and they are doing their mission and they're doing it in the big way because they got the Queen of Sheba on their side. I mean, who cares, therefore, if they're cutting some corners? Who cares? See, if maybe they've compromised how they do the mission, who cares? If maybe they've forgotten, actually, who they are and why they're here. Where do you get that maybe they forgot who they are and why they're here? well, if you're reading all of 1 Kings, you would notice something very weird and actually disturbing a chapter previous. 1 Kings 9, verse 15 says this, kind of innocuously, just kind of in the course of the story. Now, this is the account of the forced labor that Solomon levied to build the house of the Lord. He's going to build the house of God. Good for you, Solomon. Praise the Lord. And his own house and the wall of Jerusalem and Milo and Hazar and Megiddo and Gezar. All of those cities were cities that in Solomon's day needed to be rebuilt. Let's rebuild the city. And everybody goes, Amen. Let's do it. That's a good thing. But did you hear what came first? Because he did all that building, Lord's house, his house, wall of Jerusalem, and all these cities that needed some help, he did it with slaves. Verse 15. This is the account of the forced labor. If you actually let yourself be in the story, that should take your breath away. Like how, what? How can, I don't get it. How do you go from, I don't get how you go from having been a slave to owning slaves. I don't get it. I don't get it. They must have forgotten. they must have forgotten what it felt like to be a slave because they're doing it and they must have forgotten a lot more they must have forgotten who they are and why they're here but we built a big city don't care don't care so what this means and it's really frightening because when you're successful you don't see it what this means is Solomon and the people of God had become like everybody else, common. What do you mean they had split ordinary? Is what they were. Because they were using people the way everybody does. And they were oppressing people the way everybody does. So that now they were just another system. That like every other system, be it political or religious or economic or even a sick family system would use its power to exploit and oppress, to push people down, to keep people out. But something rises in me because I'm thinking, but hey, we got the Queen of Sheba here saying we're good. She was particularly impressed with our wealth, even acknowledging the Hebrew God as being God. Blessed be the God of Solomon. but Solomon in truth even though he kind of won the queen of Sheba and was impressed with the Hebrew God actually Solomon was no longer providing an accurate picture of God because God didn't build that wall and God didn't build that temple and God didn't build his house or Solomon's house or those cities you know who built a house and the slaves did. Solomon's greed did. He just called it God. Which makes Solomon's kingdom just a Jewish version of every other kingdom and every other system that uses their power to systematically push people down and keep people out to exploit and oppress the poor. So God does what he always does in situations like this. Okay, he blows a horn, he sends the prophets. Here they come. And one of the first is Isaiah, and the message of the prophets is always the same. It's not very complicated. Remember! You forgot who you are and why you're here. Remember and repent and return to your identity as a people and to your mission. Because you weren't supposed to just get rich, Solomon. You were supposed to be an alternative to every other system that uses power to get what they want. Isaiah actually said it this way to the Solomons of his day in Isaiah chapter 1. I've grown tired of your worship services, says the Lord God through the prophet Isaiah. Your incense and calling of your solemn assemblies are an abomination to me. You want me to show up at church? I ain't showing up. Such that when you spread out your hands, he's speaking here to the people of God. When you spread out your hands in worship and prayer, I hide my eyes. And even when you multiply your prayers, I'm not listening. And while it sometimes takes a while for the people of God in every generation to even recognize that they're in exile again, eventually they do. If they are the people of God, eventually they do recognize it. And it's hard. Because I think you can be in exile and not know it. Solomon would be the example of that because, you know, the Queen of Sheba is saying, oh, I think the Hebrew God is the God. And we got all this success, so it's really hard to see you're in exile. But the lights were out for him. They were out. He was in exile and didn't know it, but eventually the people of God get it. And often it starts in these little places of people's hearts where they go, something's wrong. And out of that something's wrong, guess what happens? The song of Advent begins to emerge because they start saying things like this, restore us, restore us, revive us, remind us. And when the people of God do begin to talk like that, singing songs like that, their longing has returned for things to be different, and their longing has returned for things to be made right and whole. The prophet then says to the people of God who are now being awakened, okay. I mean, the prophets are pretty stern, but when the people said, oh, okay, the prophets said, okay. Because that's what God said, okay. He will restore you. He will revive you. And he always does every time we turn. he says okay because you are my people and if you're saying yes to the mission I will put the spirit of the sovereign God on you to do your mission which means that you you don't do this repentance thing though sitting in church because it's about re-engaging in mission so this time the prophets would say to the people of God I don't want you to go to church to do this particular repentance if you want to experience revival now this is kind of fun for me too because when I think of revival I think of a tent or I think of a church and we're all confessing our personal sin which is a very good thing but in this particular repentance you don't do it in church but what I want you to do and where you're going to do this repentance is kind of out there so he says, Isaiah does in chapter 1 verse 17 here's how you do this go and learn to do good just go and learn to do good start seeking justice what do you mean? look around prove the ruthless defend the orphan plead for the widow I'll never forget I went some years ago to a spiritual director for the very first time in a really dark place and really feeling low and kind of depressed and I poured out my stuff to him and at the end of it he said this thing just what? what? he said you know I think you need to go feed the poor and I went, you're an idiot. And I didn't say that out loud. I go, did you hear what I said? It wasn't actually until I got to the parking lot that I realized what he said to me. Dude, get over yourself. Go. Care about somebody besides yourself. Isaiah 58, verse 6, says it this way. Go. Loosen the bonds of wickedness. Undo the bands of the yoke. Let the oppressed go free. Divide your bread with the hungry. Bring the hungry poor into the house. Clothe the naked. Give yourselves to the hungry. Think of somebody beside yourself. Satisfy the desire of the afflicted. And as you do, next verse is incredible. As you do, you're praying for revival, right? As you do, verse 8, here's what will happen. Then your light will break forth like the dawn. Then your recovery will speedily spring forth. Both your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard. And then you will call, restore me, and the Lord will answer. You will cry, and he will say, here I am. Because you've finally remembered who you are and why you're here. And there's your revival, and there's your restoration. Because now you remember and you finally returned to your identity and your mission, which brings us back to Isaiah 61, where the prophet announces what he knows to be true, and what he knows to be true is this, that the Spirit of the Sovereign God is upon me, because the Spirit of God has anointed me, he has sent me, because he has affected me, says Isaiah, and he gave me, he's a prophet of people, so he's also saying this, he gave us people an identity as a people and he gave to us a mission around which we are to orient our entire lives. Because our mission is simply his mission. And God's mission is tikkun olam, the healing of the world, the restoration of all things. And when, as a people, we actually begin to do those kinds of things, it ends up being really good news. But not just for us, because we're experiencing good stuff here. We will experience good stuff. But it will be good news for who? For the poor. For all the unprotected. For the unattractive. For the unwanted. Because our mission as a people is to partner with God in his mission. So all of a sudden, we're back to binding up the brokenhearted. We're back to binding up and being with all those who mourn and those who grieve. And we're back to bestowing upon them the crown of beauty. Instead of ashes, a garment of praise. And instead of despair, we're back rebuilding the ancient ruins. It's why we're here. We're back to repair the ruined cities devastated by generations and because they've been generations of dysfunction. Everybody's given up, but not us. Not the people of God because we're about the mission of God. Because those things devastated have been devastated by systemic sin that pushed people down and kept them out. They exploited people and oppressed people. Holy moly, this is, I can't get my head around this. How do I preach this? So Thursday morning I wake up really early, like not healthy early, 3.30 in the morning early. But I was wide awake. I was kind of awakened. I was thinking about this sermon and what it meant, but actually I was thinking about people I know. I was thinking about actually some of you. Ordinary people. Not like a prophet. Isaiah's too much. I can't get around my head and be like Isaiah. The people I was thinking of were not like that at all. In fact, what I woke up remembering was a lead team meeting that I was in and Al Shuck was speaking at this meeting. He wasn't the speaker. He was just talking about some stuff relative to people in our church, and he was telling us a story. He's just kind of saying, if we're going to become a people, because that's what we're talking about, we need to know our people. And he told the story of Angie and John. John and Angie usually sit right over here, and I don't know if I see them, but John and Angie. John's an usher. You can see, you know, remember, John, you know, maybe him. Neither of them look much like Isaiah to me. But for 34 years, they've done foster care mostly for adolescent girls. But for the last eight years, Al was telling us, they've kind of focused on special needs adults as well, led to involvement with Special Olympics. Now they're regularly serving as coaches with the Special Olympics. But seven years ago, they opened their heart to a 50-year-old woman with Down syndrome named Lorna. That's Lorna right there. And they cared for her. And two years ago, her failing health made life quite difficult for John and Angie and for Lorna as well. But they stayed with her and they cared for her. And they ministered to her physical body as her physical body was wasting away. Till recently, Lorna went to be with Jesus. I remember several weeks ago, John came up to me and wanted me to pray for him for the anointing, For the Sovereign Lord to be on him and Angie to minister to this dear one that they loved so much. For the presence of Jesus to be in that home and it was. But as many of you know, grieving not only brings sadness, but memories too. And some of them are joyful. So Al's telling us this story about how recently when Angie was ready to go to bed, just before she turned out the light, she noticed a tiny glass jar on the dresser. It was lip balm. Very moving lip balm is. Lip balm that for two years, every single night, Angie had put on Lorna's lips. This little thing. She saw the jar and it was holy. See, neither one of them look like Isaiah. They don't scream like me. But when the spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon people like Angie and John, it's really good news for people like Lorna, for the poor, For the unprotected and the unwanted. For all who mourn and those who grieve. Steve Person is a friend of mine. Steve grew up in our church. Here's a picture of Steve with his wife and his buddy named Daryl. Steve Weems is a guy who knows the dark side of someone else's need. To use someone for themselves because he was used by a relative to satisfy that person's need. And it left Steve with lots of pain and lots of stuff to work with. But the spirit of the sovereign Lord was upon Steve Person. And I don't mean that in some glamorous way. He got an anointing and so it was all better. No, it means that the Spirit of the Lord was on him in a way that gave him the courage to dig down deep, to dive down deep into this dark place of pain and dysfunction and distrust, to find a healing that's still in progress. But because he did, the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord was on Steve Person. And you know what that was? That was really good news for this kid named Daryl. Who Steve's been with for six years, and now Daryl's looking for a college. You got another one, there's... Steve gave me these two pictures, the one at the wedding and this one. You just wanted to say, Dave, I just want you to know Daryl's part of our life. He's just part of our life. He started out as a mentoring relationship, but now Daryl's a brother. So Daryl got a brother, and Steve got a brother. Steve is a rebuilder of ruined cities. You get that? He's not Isaiah. Steve is a rebuilder of ruined cities, devastated for generations that everybody else gives up on. But he rediscovered who he is and why he's here. Thursday after our all-staff Christmas lunch, I was talking about this very thing to a few at my table, and the next day I got an email from somebody at the table, Katie Beasley, who said, you know the story you were telling, the stuff you were saying made me think of my mom, actually, who doesn't look at all like Elijah and doesn't yell near as much as me, as you. But the spirit of the Lord, of the sovereign Lord, was on my mom when my father left us for another woman years ago. Because my mom dug down deep. It wasn't a magic wand. She went down deep into that pain, and she went there with God, and she did serious work with issues of rejection and her identity and her shame. And all of that was really good news, said Katie, for me. And for my children. Because when the Spirit of the Lord is upon you, it's really good news. For your children. And for your children's children. I even thought of Tom and Debbie Johnson. and then, which is weird, I thought of Tom and Debbie because I saw Tom this last Tuesday night. He's on staff here for several years. Some of you know Tom, some of you don't. When a connection, he was on staff for many years. Where are you going? Just stay here. It's good. We need you. But he made this weird connection in Slovakia and when he did it, that turned into a call and when it turned into a call, he did what you do. He did what you do. He acted like, you know, you're already your whole life around this stuff. So he sold his house. What an idiot. Anyway, there they are. Debbie looks like Debbie but I think they airbrushed the other picture of Tom he doesn't look that good actually I actually hope he's here but here's the deal neither one of them are Elijah but here's when the spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon people like that ordinary people like that as it turns out it's really good news for kids like this and a whole bunch more just like him here's the deal let me close with this this is just who we are and we forget and it's why we're here it's who we are it's why we're here to be a people for God's own possession a people who divide their bread with the hungry it's who we are it's why we're here there's no other reason to be here I mean forget your fasting I don't care about that people who satisfy by desire of the afflicted, people who bind up the brokenhearted and all who mourn and those who grieve, who rebuild the ancient ruins and repair the ruined cities devastated for generations, who bestow on these people who have no dignity anymore a crown of beauty instead of ashes, a garment of praise instead of despair, and so open door. In this Advent season, here we are approaching Christmas. Got lots to do, parties to go to, go to all of them, have a great time. I'm serious. As we go and do what we do and go the places we have to go, just one thing. Let's just remember who we are. And why we're here. And if in the next couple of weeks you forget who we are and why you're here, And by the way, you will. You will. So will I. All you have to do is turn. In the moment, just turn. And return. And remember who you are and why we're here. And guess what will happen? You will see. Someone you didn't see. Might be in your own family. you will hear something you didn't hear and this is the spirit of David as we wait and wait and wait would you stand with me as we close Spirit of the Sovereign Lord we thank you for reminders for reminding us even this day of who we are and why we're here because we forget and we are grateful that when we remember you restore us and you revive us so do it again do it again do it again we pray and all God's people said Amen. God bless you as you leave. Thank you.
