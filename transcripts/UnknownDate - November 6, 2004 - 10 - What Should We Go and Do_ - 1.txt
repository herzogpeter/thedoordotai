If you could just comment on what happened last night, how you thought it went or whatever. Okay. Well, Dick and Becky were there and maybe someone else was there, so you can ask them too what they thought. For that kind of an occasion, I thought it went very well. Obviously, it was well advertised and everything. The room was overflowing, and I thought people listened very well, and I tried my best to communicate as well as possible on the subject. The subject was, really the subject was how the university teaches morality, and what is the morality they teach. And that was in the context of the denial of many leading educators that they teach any morality. And this is really a fantastic illusion. And all you have to do is candidly watch what happens, and you see it. And the students actually do know this. But the faculty and administration often doesn't know it. And then that goes hand in hand with leading educators saying, "We must teach morality." So it's quite an interesting and troubling thing, and I just talked about that some, and then I suggested that the university should apply its resources, which is supposed to be careful thought and examination of issues to arrive at the truth, that they apply that kind of approach to the teachings, the moral teachings of Jesus, particularly things like you should love your neighbor as yourself, and that they should try to find the center of moral teaching in the will to good. And, you know, I talked about that, referred to some literature and so on. I thought everything was that people were attentive and listened and seemed to pick up on what I was saying, which isn't always easy with that kind of talk. I refused to go places and read papers, so I just kind of talk like I do here. I have a feeling to have a paper read at you is one of the biggest wastes of time that most people experience. Fulton Sheen, you may remember him and someone once asked him, why does he just talk? And he said he was standing at the back of a cathedral once by a lady listening to a bishop read a sermon And the lady turned, sort of turned away and said, if he can't remember it, how does he expect us to? So, you know, if you proceed the way that I do or Todd does or probably Keith and Dave do too, you don't hit all the important points and so on. But there's no point in hitting the important points if people aren't going to hear it and can't keep it. So try to do something. But they seem to listen very well, even when I was kind of bearing down and reading a few paragraphs to make sure about some of the points that I got them right because they were recording it, you know. And so you want to make sure that you say some things just right, and we want to do that here too, but then not just grind away at you with that. And I thought it went well. Ask Dick and Becky. They were there, and they can give you a report also. But I was very, very happy with the event. And the conversation afterwards was... They finally came and hauled me off because the people were just saying such interesting and good things and raising questions. okay now I want to just kind of go over a little checklist with you the things we've been talking about are things that are accessible to everyone and God has made that real and true we still need to find our way into it. And so it's important that we state things carefully and state sometimes the same thing in different ways and try to give people and ourselves a chance to really change our minds and our feelings and get a different hold on where we are in real life. And so this, as we come down to the end here, I'd like to say a few things that I hope will move in that direction. One is I'm going right back to this issue of the gospel because that's our biggest problem is we have a default gospel in this culture. And usually for most Americans, I think, who are serious about religion, it is the gospel that Jesus suffered for your sins. and if you believe that he did you will not have to suffer for your sins and that will mean that you go to heaven when you die because they'll not be able to find any reason to keep you out and now I'm hoping that by the time you leave here if you're not already in a different mode when you come to think about what is the message that you will be when you leave here. And we had a good conversation just now. And one gentleman was asking, he said, we got a definition of the left and right gospel and so on, but what is the definition of the fourth gospel and not the Gospel of John, of course, but the fourth Gospel being the alternative to trust the sufferings of Christ on your behalf and you'll go to heaven when you die. Participate in Jesus' activity on behalf of the oppressed and on that Gospel usually there's nothing is said about what's going to happen to you when you die. And usually nothing is said about sin. So there's some pretty big omissions there, though liberation is an important idea. Take care of your church and it'll take care of you. That was the third gospel. And then the fourth gospel is put your confidence in Jesus and live now in the kingdom of God. Trust Jesus is the whole deal. But now, that doesn't mean trust something he said or something that he did. You trust him. There is one God and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus. Now, see, we all understand that verbally, and we say, well, I have a personal relationship to Jesus Christ, and that's what we want. But the problem is that that gets emptied out of practical meaning if you don't understand that that means the whole person. Now, if you understand, and I do hope that some of you have had a good experience working with Colossians 3, if you understand that, that's what trusting Jesus means. If you then be risen with Christ, see, that's the personal relationship, risen with Him, crucified with Him, living now with Him. That's trusting Jesus. That's what it means to trust Jesus. Again, not something He did, you can trust that too. Not something He said, you can trust that too. Not even trusting the church. There you have to be a little more carefully, but generally speaking, it's still true that there's no salvation outside the church. It's just a question of what the church is. So you're going to be in relationship to the church unless you live on an island somewhere and the kingdom of God is still there. But if you live a normal life, you need the called out people of God around you. You can trust that. But not just that. The religion is too important to be left to the church. Because religion basically means relating yourself back to God. And you can actually miss that in a church. It's been done. And then that explains why things get kind of bad in this young lady that Todd was talking about then. And so many other people who, and you know, one of the forms of discourse in our society is, I'm very spiritual, but I'm not religious. You ever hear that? Yeah. So now, I want to just make one more pass on this issue. and the way I prefer to work is just take you to the scriptures and let you chew on that. And so look with me, if you will, now just a moment at 1 John 1, 1 John chapter 1. And John, with his magnificent vision of Christ and what he's doing, John always tries to take the whole, in the whole picture, you remember he starts out his gospel by saying, in the beginning. And really you have to understand that that is exactly parallel with Genesis 1. In the beginning was the word. And what does John, gospel of John chapter 1, the prologue it talks about. Basically, it talks about creation. Without Him, nothing was made. He made the world. He was in the world. And then, of course, redemption comes in that. But now look at this passage here, and I'm just making one more swoop over this issue of what is the gospel now. I'm giving you some verses to tie this to. What was from the beginning, we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, beheld with our hands handled, concerning the word of life. The life was manifest. We've seen it. The life is God in action. See, that's God in action. It was manifest. and now we saw it and bear witness with you and we proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us. What we have seen, what we have heard, we proclaim to you that you may have fellowship with us and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. And these things we write to you so that our joy may be made complete. Now look at verse 5. This is the message we have heard from him and announced to you. Now just stop there. What do you think? Now you're not looking at this, okay? Don't look. How would you finish that sentence? This is the message we have heard from him and announced to you. How would you finish that sentence? See, how you will finish that sentence will determine what you accept as the gospel. This is what we heard from him. Now here's how the sentence is finished by John. God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. It's a double negative in the Greek. It's not none. That might be English for it. There's no darkness in God. Not none. Can you preach that? Can you bring that to your neighbors out of love and the sense that they desperately need to hear it? See, that's the same as the gospel, whosoever will may come. That's the same as the gospel, repent for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand. And it is a gospel that goes out to all the world. Look at Romans 9 with me for a moment. We don't visit Romans 9 very often, but it really has some important things to say to us. In Romans 9, Paul is talking about the gospel, And he's talking about how for the gospel to be heard, there needs to be a preacher. And really, you need to read this in conjunction with Romans 8 and what we referred to an answer to a question about all creation groaning, waiting for the children of God to be manifest. But in chapter 9, here's what he's saying. I'm sorry, chapter 10, verse 15. How shall they preach unless they be sent? He's going back to whoever shall call upon the Lord shall be saved. So who will be saved? Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord. Well, how shall they call upon in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? Now then, stop there for a moment. What is our next move? An appeal for missionaries. Right? Now let's see what Paul says. And this won't take away the need for missionaries, but we need to hear what he's saying. So verse 16, However, they did not all heed the glad tidings that they heard, referring back to Isaiah's statement. For Isaiah said, Lord, who has believed our report? So faith comes from hearing and hearing by the word of Christ. Now, this is the shocking part for you, and you need to think this through in conjunction with what John said about the message. But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed, they have. Their voice has gone out into all the earth and their words to the end of the world. Now, what's that about? That's Psalm 19. Do you remember what Psalm 19 says? Better go back and look at it. It says, The heavens are telling the glory of God, and their expanse is declaring His work. Day unto day pours forth speech, and night to night reveals knowledge. There is no speech, nor are there words. Their voice is not heard, but their line has gone out to all the earth, and their utterance to the end of the world. One more passage, Romans 1 now. Romans 1. This is talking about the gospel of Christ, the power of God unto salvation, and that is desperately needed by everyone. Everyone needs that. But he says, Verse 19, because that which is known about God is evident within human beings and their knowledge of the world. For God has made it evident to them, for since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes, his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood through that which has been made so that they are without excuse. Now, what does all of this say to us? Well, what it says to us is that the goodness of God is manifest, And we can miss it if we turn away from it. And we live among a people that has turned away from it, and they miss it. And if you listen to the sophistical reasonings of people who try to evade and avoid this and watch how they work, you'll see that this is a project of avoidance. But the truth of the matter is they have a knowledge. There is a God. They are suspicious, at least, that he's supposed to be good. But because they have turned away from him, in mass, collective humanity has turned away from him, there has grown up a wall of resistance to God that is presided over by the ruler of darkness. And so he addresses the mind and confuses people and in that condition they are responsible but they are also hopeless. And so they need to hear about Jesus Christ and Christ comes with his message and his kingdom and his person because the kingdom is in him. He is the king. And now then he tells them about God and when Jesus came he said, in effect, He said, forget what you think you know about God. I will tell you about God. And then his role in human history is to bring to the fullness the vision of God as he really is. So, the gospel is a story about who God is and what he's doing. The gospel is not just a message to be proclaimed, our friend Todd says, it is the form of our participation in what God is doing in and for the world. That's a good word. What it really comes down to is God is this glorious, wonderful being God. And He is of such a nature that you're invited to be a part of His life. And we can't begin to comprehend that glory at this point in our careers. but we will progressively apprehend it and the best way we can go to it is behold the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. That means just look at Jesus and what he's doing and see the full picture and then as we engage with that we are transformed into that same likeness. So we move into the life of God and I read to you the other night or sometime, 2 Peter, where it talks about, we've been made partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. So now we're part of the life that God is living. We're part of the life that Jesus is now living on earth, and that is eternal life. John 17, 3, we talked about, this is eternal life that they would know you. But knowledge is always interactive relationship. It's never had knowledge. When the Bible speaks of knowledge, it's talking about interactive relationship. This is eternal life, that they would know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you sent. Now, if you leave here today and go home and you do not find the kingdom of God gloriously present in everything that you do this afternoon, we will not have succeeded. See, that's a way of trying to help us see where to locate the message that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. So what are you going to do this afternoon? Take a nap. That's good. Maybe you're going to bake some bread. Maybe you're going to work on your car. I saw a beautiful illustration of kingdom this morning when we pulled in. someone with a grand old car out there had parked it across two parking spaces. That's kingdom. That's saying, speaking of the range of my effective will. Now, that's wonderful, you know. God is present throughout all of your life now and that's where the kingdom of God is. And I'm hoping that after you have gone through all these hours with Todd and me here talking about this, that you're prepared now to see where you are and what you are doing as the location of the kingdom of God. Nature is one of the instrumentalities of the kingdom. It is an expression of the kingdom of God. That's why when you go out into nature, if you're there to see and enjoy, it so refreshes you. That's why just stopping and drinking in a beautiful sunrise or sunset affects you the way it does. and don't you just want to stand there and sort of go you just want to take that in. See that's God. That's the kingdom of God. That's what Paul is talking about. The heavens declare the glory of God. Do you believe that? Yeah. And you see now everything that God has done in his creation is an expression of his objective, which is to create something as great and good as himself. Maybe I better say that again. See, that's what the created universe is about. The great goodwill of God, His love, naturally moves into, not necessarily, that's another story, that isn't the Christian story. The Christian story is it is a choice, it is a will to create the greatest possible good. And of course, that's an infinite task because He is infinite, and He will not be able in any length of time to create a good as great as Himself. But He pours forth in His goodness all of creation, and then He puts you and me right in the middle of it and says, now, would you please do what I do? Would you love and create goodness? I give you this power. Didn't have to, but I want to. And I put you in your world, and that's the place for you to do it. And while you're here, there's a lot of training going on and a lot of reparation that has to be made because you've been hurt by your own choices and the choices of others, and so you're set in the wrong direction and all these dimensions of the self, heart, soul, mind, spirit, body, so on. All of those have been set off in the wrong direction. That has to be corrected, but the object is to bring you back, and where I bring you back is where you are. And now, if you take that assignment and go with it, then you can begin to understand the teaching God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, and He's committed the ministry of this Word to you. So, you are active, actively engaged in bringing all of creation into Christ. And that's why, go back now to Romans 8, that's why creation is groaning, waiting for you, waiting for me, waiting for the outcome of human history, which is God is going to take out of human history a group of people that he will inhabit in a marvelous community that will govern the universe. So now you and I, we work from where we are and in our finitude we grow by claiming where we are and what is given to us by being the people we are through birth, nation, language, time and history, point in the development of Maple Grove. That is the name of this place, right? And that's you. See, that's your place. So now you're the light of the world and you're the salt of the earth. Jesus said that. That's the gospel. That has the whole thing in it. God has put you in the place you are in to be light and salt there. And if you don't do that, no one else will. Because that's your place. That's your kingdom. And if you understand that, well, then you're ready for a kind of life that the world looks for but can't find. And 1 Peter 1 talks about this in verse 8. Although you have not seen Him, you love Him. And though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and glorified. The translations have trouble with that word, glory. And you know the old song, joy unspeakable and full of glory. Now, consider this. That is the natural condition of the person who fully understands and trusts Jesus. Joy unspeakable and full of glory. Now, you think you'll need a shot of cocaine? No. Joy unspeakable and full of glory, those aren't people who are reaching for all the addictions that we have in human life because they are living and experiencing the sufficiency of life in the kingdom of God. So now, I have to go over that again and take the time because I'm hoping that when you are asking yourself, what is the gospel, your answer would use the modulations that appear in Scripture. And a part of that is, the gospel is, I'm never going to die. I'm going to go to heaven when I die. and God loves me and he's going to take care of me forever. That's right. But also try putting it in terms that God is light and in him is no darkness. So you put it in terms of the natural world that God has made and placed himself in it and made himself available as Psalm 19 and Romans 10 says. So make sure that you include that. Now, when you do that, then your whole life will be participation, the form of our participation. And then things like, "How do I reach my neighbors?" Well, just try loving them and being with them because the kingdom of God is in you, that will be something that cannot be hid. Don't push it. You don't have to push it. It does the pushing. Now, if you practice that, you will have to have real faith in your own heart that this is true. And that will mean, among other things, that if to reach your neighbors, you have to love them, and if you have to love them, you have to be with them, you'll find ways of doing that. And in your contact with them, the kingdom will flow. And that's what Jesus is talking about when he says, talks all that stuff about living water. In John 7, from their belly shall flow rivers of living water. Well, you just get up next to your neighbor and let your belly flow. Now, it won't flow unless you've been to John 4 and learned and received what Jesus said when he said, he that believes on me shall never thirst. But the water that I shall give to him will be a well of water, a spring of water welling up to everlasting life. See, that is, that's why we have joy unspeakable and full of glory because we've tied into this and now we've come to the place we're resting in it. We're resting in it. I'm talking about where we come. I'll say a moment more about discipleship in a moment, because that's how we come to that. But we are resting in the abundance and fullness of Christ. Now, you're going to do that when you go from here and you go wherever you're going for lunch, and whatever you do this afternoon and tonight, and that's what your life ahead of you is. And that's what it means to do everything you do, whether in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father through Him. You have to practice that. Because if you're the normal person, you're not used to doing that. And a lot of the stuff you do, you think of as somehow outside the sacred religious stuff that you do. Now, that's what you have to break down if you're going to understand and live in the kingdom, walk in the kingdom, manifest the character and power of Christ. You have to just become so relaxed in that. That everywhere you are, you understand that this is the presence of the kingdom. And you have to get over rejecting a lot of stuff that you've rejected because you don't think it's good enough. It's that it has what it's supposed to have. see, the world comes along and lays all this stuff on you about why who you are and what you are and what you're doing is not special, shall we say. And you have to reject that. You say, no, now is the time. Here is the place. You stop postponing it and thinking there is another time. No, wherever you are now, whenever you are, that's the time, that's the place. And if, for example, you're in a situation, we've talked about loving your enemies and so on, that's not something you do later. You do it now, whenever that occasion arise. This is the time to do it. And then you rely on the kingdom and step into that, and you're able to do it because God is with you. That's the meaning of the presence of the kingdom. The practice of the presence of God is an active thing that says, I am now obeying Him, and He is living through me, and that's why I'm able to do and be who I am. Okay, so now I'm going to check off a few other things here. But the first thing you check off is, what do I tell myself is the gospel? What I tell myself? Not what you tell others, but what you think is the gospel. That's the first thing. What do I tell myself is the gospel? And you have to check that and make sure that you have the vision that we've been talking about. And then check your obedience. First check, the gospel. Second check, obedience. Jesus said, those who hear my words and do not do them are like foolish people who build their houses on sand and the storms come and the house falls. And we have a culture of hearing and not doing. Now, you could almost say that is the character of Western culture. They know about Jesus. Sometimes they don't got it right, but that's why they're so capable of judging the church, is because they know about Jesus. And if you listen to them judging the church, it will always be long lines that Jesus himself said. I often tell people, you think you know about the church, the greatest critic of the church is Jesus Christ. But then they don't turn around and do it. See, they talk about all the hypocrites in the church and practice hypocrisy themselves. And the right response to folks who feel like it's important that the church would do what Jesus said is, well, you do it. You show us how to do it. Agree with them, in other words. Say, you're absolutely right. How are you doing? Or how's that working for you? See, and so now then we look at what Jesus said and we say, that's for me. That's for me. Now here I'm moving fast. I don't have time to go into it in great detail, but just think of the things that Jesus taught, say in Matthew 5. And say, that's for me. then in the moment where you are living your life, where you are, do the things that he said. Thank you.
