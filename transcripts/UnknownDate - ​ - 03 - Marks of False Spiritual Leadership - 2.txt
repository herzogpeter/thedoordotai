I think you're aware of the fact that we are dealing in this class with the issue of spiritual abuse, and the context for the study is not just my ramblings, though I will ramble. It's Matthew 23. As Jesus is standing in the courtyard of the temple, it is simply days before he is to be crucified, and I really believe, as I've kind of caught the drama of the Gospel of Matthew, that I think what brought to a crescendo the hatred of the Pharisees and gave them the final energy to go over the top and nail them to a cross, which they'd wanted to do for a long time, is this event and the things that he says in terms of exposing their false spirituality and the false system that they were a part of. And what we've been dealing with or calling this is marks of false spiritual leadership or spiritual abuse. The way the text actually breaks down is, I believe, verses 1 through 12, Jesus is giving characteristics. Here's how you spot them. Remember last week we started with a warning or a perspective biblically that the issue of false spiritual leadership is not a new thing, that Ezekiel spoke of it and Paul spoke of it and spoke of them as wells without water and people who say they hear from God but they don't really hear from God. But our question was, how do you spot a well without water? someone who's a false leader because the frightening thing is that these leaders come in the form of safety. They are the pastors, the elders, on and on and on. If there's anybody we should trust, it's them. And so Matthew 23 becomes a tremendous help to us in terms of discerning what is false and what is true. We dealt with three characteristics last week that help us identify a false leadership or a false system, and that is, first of all, a false basis of authority. Verse 2, the scribes Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses, and the basis of the authority that they seated themselves in was their position, their rank, their title. We dealt with that last week. The second mark of false spiritual leadership was in verse 3, but do not according to their deeds, for they say things, but do not do them. They say, but do not do, and we talked about the context or the concept of a double life and went deeply into that. The third was that verse 4, they tie up heavy loads and lay them on men's shoulders, but are themselves unwilling to move them with so much as a finger. They tie weights of, number one, works righteousness, number two, performance-based Christianity, and number three, role reversal. I want to move directly into the next characteristic of a false spiritual leadership. Verse five, how do you spot them? Here's how you spot them. They do all their deeds to be noticed by men, for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments. And they love the place of honor at banquets in the chief seats and the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces and being called by men, Rabbi. Let's stop right there and pray. Father, I pray again that you would come visit with us through your word. I pray that your spirit would powerfully be active among us and again mindful of some of the things we said at the beginning of last week's study that probably all of us have been victimized by spiritual abuse at some level. But also, all of us have probably perpetrated abuse spiritually at some level, and we all stand again this week in the same need of healing and also of repentance. And so, Father, I pray that you, by your Spirit, would bring the dynamic that is necessary for our growth in this study. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Now, I gave you a number of characteristics by reading those three verses there. Let's deal with the first one first. They do all their deeds to be noticed by men. They broaden their phylacteries, lengthen the tassels of their garments. They wear their religion on the outside, is simply how I would say that. Literally, it is a performance they put on. They get tremendous ego satisfaction from posturing and parading and projecting an image. And once they have projected an image, they spend enormous amounts of time protecting that image. How things look is what matters. And by the way, one of the real dangers of systems like this, where the focus of attention begins to be how things look is what matters in projecting this image, is that if that attitude is at the leadership level, it will filter down to the people. And we'll have people who are acting like Christians rather than being Christians. They'll learn how to act. They'll learn how to talk. They'll learn the language. They'll learn the behaviors, which ones are acceptable, which ones aren't. And we conform ourselves externally to a code of behaviors that may or may not be good. They may even be good behaviors. But they're being born of this desire or need to look good, not born of an internal work of the Spirit. And it's a mark of a false system. Let me just explain some of the things in the text and then move on to apply it a little further. the way they demonstrated their spirituality was to broaden their phylacteries. Now, I haven't had to confront many people for doing that recently because we don't even know what a phylactery is. Actually, it comes from a biblical source, but the concept of a phylactery is not a biblical concept. Let me explain. In Deuteronomy 6, verse 8, and also in Deuteronomy 11, verse 16, it said this, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and thou shalt bind them upon your hand and upon your mind, and as frontals on your head. You shall bind them, these commandments, on your hand, and they shall be as frontals on your head. Now, originally, in Deuteronomy, when the Jews first heard that command, they knew what it meant. And what it meant was this. Let the love of God, thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul, and mind. Let the love of God be the controlling factor in what you do with your hand. Let that internal devotion to God be what emanates out and controls what you do. And also let it be the controlling factor on your mind. But there's a problem, and that is this. When the reality of love for God is no longer the focus, and our hearts grow dim, instead of going, wait a minute, I got a dull heart, and I need to have the flame in my heart for God fanned a little bit so that these external things will come, if I'm in a system where how things look, I don't worry about the heart anymore. I just spend all my attention making sure that I'm looking good on the outside. And it crawls, our righteousness does, to the outside because when it's on the outside, I can parade my piety. And literally, these Pharisees had gotten to the point where they put these commandments, Deuteronomy 6, verse 8, and Deuteronomy 11, verse 16, wrote them on a piece of paper, put them in a little box, and it was called a phylactery. they bound it to their wrists. A little box with the commandment, love the Lord to God with all their hearts and soul and mind. Put it on their wrists and then wrapped it up. In fact, they had very elaborate ways that they would wrap it on their wrists. It would be on their wrists and then they would put it through this finger and that finger and I don't remember all the ways and up their elbow and down straps. Very elaborate. Hello! Hello! Thank you. I love the Lord. Anyway. And they would put it on their forehead too. And the little box, love the Lord to God with all their hearts and soul and mind. Forgetting that that's supposed to be like inside. Okay, they put it on their forehead. forehead and when it says they broaden their phylactery it simply means that they would make it real big they make a real big box falling off their hand because the bigger the box was obviously the more i loved god it was all an external performance how things looked is what mattered tremendous ego satisfaction again from posturing and parading phylactery by the way literally is a word that might kind of sound familiar literally means means of protection and we we get the word prophylactic from that means of protection actually that word was borrowed from the pagans who wore phylacteries and didn't put love the lord god with all your heart soul mind in it but they would wear these phylacteries they were religious charms to ward off evil spirits and that was the means of protection see they wear a religious charm and it would keep the the evil spirits away and that was their phylactery now these love the lord you got to all your heart soul mind things these little religious mementos that made me look real spiritually were for them phylacteries or means of protection against sin. And what it did was it just gave them one other thing besides God to be their source. And their source was how they looked. That's what made them feel okay about themselves. And again, to broaden them simply meant to make them big, to make them obvious. And basically what it said or communicated was a mentality. And the mentality was this, that by my dress or how I look, I can set myself apart as a cut above from you. And now we all compete. And the whole competition is about who looks the most spiritual. I'll give this a pretty practical application. It might sound like I'm meddling a little bit, but that's okay. It was early in my ministry here at Open Door, and I had two young men come in my office from a Bible college, and they were involved in a pastoral studies course, meaning the course was designed to teach them how to be a pastor and the kinds of things you needed to know to be a pastor. And I shared some of my heart with them, and they were supposed to interview me and spend some time, and we did that. And as I began to kind of pick their brain a little bit in terms of what they were learning, what happened really was they began to hear what I was saying in significant contrast to what they'd been hearing in the class. And so, again, I just kind of asked them some questions to get out what was going on. And fundamentally, what they were being taught was how to act like a pastor. That was the focus of the court. And the kinds of things they spent tremendous amounts of time on were things like how you sit on the platform. Whether you cross your legs or not, I had one pastor actually tell me, never show people your souls, only show them your soul. That meaning, don't show them this, show them your soul. Meaning, don't cross your legs. Okay, I know that many of you have been blessed by the fact that I don't cross my legs on the platform. I think you're just, thank God he doesn't do that. But the big, you know, and I wouldn't even mention this, except this was big. This was real important. This is how you do it. How you dress was very important. Always appearing to be the authority was so important that if you're working on your car, young men, you just need to know this from a veteran, and that's who was teaching the course too, by the way, was a veteran pastor. What you need to know is that if you're ever working on your car and you get kind of greasy and you find out, hey, I need a part, I need to go to the auto store, but I'm full of grease, oh my, what am I going to do? What you do is you take a shower, you get out of your dirty clothes, you put on your suit, you go to the auto store, you buy your part, you go home, because somebody might see you and you won't look good. True story. Phone rings in our house, he goes on to say, and it's a very good idea to have the phone of the church ring in your house. Now, if your desire with that is to serve the people and be available to people, that's okay, that's okay. The motive for this was this. Every time you answer the phone in your house, even though you're watching the Cubs game or Twins game, The answer to the phone, First Christian Church, First Christian Church, that's what you do. And the beauty of it is this, people will always think you're working. And the key is that they think you're working. Because what matters most? Image, how things work. Look, very important that your children and your wife in public call you pastor. Why? Because image is everything. He taught them how to act like pastors. The result is that I think the people under that kind of leadership learn how to act like Christians. i'm not interested in all people who are not act like christians i'm interested in people who are christians because they're born of the spirit and from the born in the spirit born of the spirit inside here life comes life that's one of the ways you can you can identify something wrong that's wrong paul dealt with this in galatians 6 when he said this he's speaking of the judaizers who had come to the galatian church the galatian church being a group of people who had been saved by grace and were living in grace and walking by the Spirit. And all of a sudden, the Judaizers came along and kind of fouled all that up by giving them a bunch of external performance to focus on rather than the life of the Spirit. And chapter 3 is a real good chapter at the very beginning, the first few verses of Paul yelling at them, who has bewitched you? You were saved by the Spirit, now you're being perfected by the flesh. Get back in line. 12th verse of the final chapter, describing these Judaizers, he says they are those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh. They make a good showing in the flesh. That's exactly the same dynamic as this right here, those who do their deeds to be noticed by men. A good showing in the flesh. I read that verse years ago for the first time, and I just closed my eyes and I kind of scanned my experience of the church, a good showing in the flesh. People who knew how to act like Christians, never said certain words, always said other words, never went certain places, always went other places, had all the behavior down pat. They made a good show. They looked good. And by the way, that was one of the reasons they were so hard to confront. But you could tell in your spirit, and you could never make the judgment, you'd never say it out loud, but there rarely was this sense of love, joy, peace, long-suffering generalists. I hardly ever felt that, and that's all subjective, so I'm not going to judge. Leave that alone. But they were always so incredibly appropriate, but you always wondered what was inside, and whatever it was, I didn't want it. I was never drawn to them, but they looked good, and because that was a fair show, it was terribly hard to confront. I mean, they never, ever had wine touch their lips. They never played cards, not even rook, nothing. They make a fair so in the flesh. There's an unspoken motto, again, unspoken is the key, is an unspoken motto in systems where how things look is what matters. We're broadening the phylacteries, external performance is what sells. The motto is this, how things look is what matters here. Okay? There's a principle that I believe is irrefutable. I believe it. And the principle is this, if you are in a system where how things look is what matters, how things are will never get dealt with. Think about that. If you're on a system, make it a family system, a church system, a school system, whatever, where how things look on the outside is what really matters. Here's the promise. What's really going on in your life will never get dealt with. How things are won't get dealt with. I'm explaining it like this. Let's say your marriage is going down the tubes. Let's not even make it that bad. You're just struggling. And you just know there isn't any joy in it. There isn't any life in it. Yes, you love your wife. Yes, you love your husband. But it's a commitment. You know, and there's no joy in your home anymore. And maybe there used to be, but there isn't now. But you're in a system where how things look is what matters. And you might even just sour all week long, absolutely dried up. Maybe it's worse than dried up. You're fighting like cats and dogs all the way at church, but you're in a system where how things look is what matters. You hit the door, and what do you do? If you're in a system where how things look is what matters. Lovey-dovey, arm-in-arm, and maybe not that extreme. you know maybe by being extreme you know lovey-dovey everything's wonderful not maybe wonderful but certainly nothing's wrong no one would have a clue why because how things look is what matters if how things look is what matters how things are won't get dealt with and how things are in your marriage is terrible are terrible it's terrible but you'll never get to that because how things look is what matters and that's where you'll spend all your energy making sure everybody else thinks our marriage is incredible i thought about that a little bit and and as bizarre thought dawned on me, and that was this. It actually, in systems like this, this is why they're so abusive. In systems like this, where how things look is what matters, it actually became more important that you thought I had a good marriage than I really had a good marriage. See? It's bizarre. So I spent all my energy, I spent all my, see, we only have so much energy, all of us. What we spend it on matters. So I, but I spent all my energy making sure you all thought I was a great parent. You all thought we had a great marriage, and I was so tired after that, and didn't have time to work on my marriage? God was exhausted by the time I convinced you all we had a great marriage. If you're in a system where how things really are is what matters, I might so honor my marriage by saying out loud in a system like that, excuse me, excuse me, we really love God and we really love each other, but we're really dying right now because we get some help. You could never say that in a system where how things look is what matters. Where people are brought in their phylacteries and lengthening the tassels of their robe, nobody is going to say that. A system where how things look as it matters, and you're struggling with your spirituality. Let's just say you got a lot of questions about God. God's let you down. You've had some pain that's unexplainable. It isn't fair, and you got a lot of doubts and a lot of fear and a lot of things going on in here in terms of whether he's even there, but how things look as it matters. And you're sitting in Sunday school class where everybody's broadening their phylacteries and lengthening their tassels, and you're wondering if God exists. Do you say that out loud? No. No. You do a couple of things. One, you might just leave the church. That's why a lot of people, I ain't got the hassle to do this. I'm not going to mess. Some people, however, are so hooked into the system that they can't even think of leaving this system. So they stay and they spend all their energy dying on the inside because they got all sorts of unanswered questions, which, by the way, are questions God's okay with. God is not petty and puny like most of us. He can handle hard questions. Read Job. But it's become more important in this system that you think I'm spiritual than I really be spiritual. So I sit in the Sunday school class and they ask the questions and I answer them right. They aren't the real answer, they're just the right answer. Big difference, right? But by the way, I may sound like I'm picking on you. You know how I know this stuff? I look in the mirror. That's how I do. I've done all that. I've done it. I grew up in the church. I was a pastor's kid. I knew how to give all the right answers, and they weren't the real answer. Kept people off my back. They thought I was spiritual. It was a bunch of baloney. But it became more important that people think you're spiritual. And again, I get this weird illustration. You only got so much energy. So I spent all my energy making you think I'm spiritual. And when it comes time to do any inside work that I need to do, I'm too tired. I already spent all my energy making sure you thought I was spiritual. And nothing's real. What if you're depressed in a system like this? But how things look is what matters. And everybody's brought in their phylacteries and lengthening the tassels on their garments. But you're depressed. What do you say? In that system, I'm depressed? No. You've been hearing verses all the time how Christians never get depressed and we got the joy of the Lord. The joy of the Lord's great. If it's real. The only way to get the joy of the Lord, if you don't got the joy of the Lord, though, is to say, I don't have the joy of the Lord. I don't have that. But if you're in a system where how things look matters and you're depressed, it's going to become more important that people think you're not depressed and you're really not depressed. And so you put on a happy face, and on and on we go. I got some good news for you, by the way, if you ever get depressed. It's one of my favorite verses. You've probably heard it before, if you've been around me very long. It's in 2 Corinthians 7, where Paul says, When we were in Macedonia, our flesh had no rest. We had conflicts without, we had fears within. But God who comforts the, what? Depressed. But God who comforts the depressed. I first read that, I go, what? Depressed. Who is depressed here? Who? Who is depressed in that text? Paul. Paul was depressed. But God who comforts the depressed, that's me, comforted us by the coming of Titus. One of the ways to deal with depression or discouragement is not by denying you're depressed and discouraged. In fact, that will get you more depressed. Promise. 1 Corinthians 7.6. And it's one of the reasons why systems like this are false systems. Systems like that that keep us from being real and honest about what's really going on in our marriages and in our hearts and in our lives are not systems born of the kingdom of God. They're born of the pit of hell. I believe that. and we keep going to church and slapping on happy faces and broadening our phylacteries, and nobody's getting well. Some of you have already observed this. Some of the sickest people you know in the world go to church every Sunday because it's all this incredible facade, just this incredible pretend. Next thing that we're going to deal with today is they love the place of honor at banquets and chief seats in the synagogues. They require the accolades of men, and the key word there is require. They have to have this. It's what they live for. The place of honor at banquets. I don't know what image you have in your mind when it comes to that, but I think of something as simple as the speaker's table at a banquet. I mean, have you ever been to church banquets and there's a speaker's table? Now, wait a minute now, just so you don't go too far here. I'm prone to that. There's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with a speaker's table at a banquet. Nothing wrong with the place of honor at a banquet. If somebody gets honored at a banquet, there's nothing wrong with that. Please know that. The problem with these people in the text was they loved that place. They had to have that place. And the chief seats. Not the cheap seats, the chief seats. The thing I have in my mind, again, growing up in a church on the platform, are these seats where the pastor and everybody sits. And there's nothing wrong sitting up there. I like how they look. There's visual things, though. They communicate things visually, and they're like thrones. Just keep balanced here. There's nothing wrong with sitting up on the stage. There's nothing wrong with having a place of honor at a banquet. My best, my favorite story about this place of honor at a banquet was a wonderful banquet we had for a wonderful woman in our church. And this illustrates that places of honor at a banquet are great. In fact, I hope everybody in their life sometimes gets the place of honor at a banquet. It's a good thing. Edith Keel was her name. Many of you knew her. She has since gone to be with the Lord. But Edith was a lady who, since I was here in this church, was in our church all the time she had a servant's heart she was working in the kitchen when spring would spring she would be out in the yard of the church planting flowers and she was there as much or more than some of our staff she should we joked with her that she should have been a staff person and she loved to serve and anytime there was a little luncheon or a funeral wedding she was always there working and working and working finally it dawned on us as staff we're we don't catch on real quick but we should just we should just bless this lady and had a had a um a little uh a banquet for her in her honor. But there was a problem with doing this. We wanted it to be a surprise, but she was always in the kitchen. And so how are we going to get around this and do this without her knowing? So what we did, incredible brainstorm, we'll put her in charge. I love this story. So we put Edith in charge of her own surprise banquet. So Edith, tell you what, you know, deal with the tables, get the, you know, things. There's going to be about this many people there and we'll bring the food and you arrange it and we'll be down there and here's a cake. And we had a cake, told her it was an appreciation for a guy named ed church had gotten big enough she figured out i don't know that's ed guy edith we added edith later you know edith so anyway the banquet is just about to start all the staff walked downstairs it was a luncheon thing and we all walked downstairs we all kind of got in place and there was this one empty chair and edith i'll never forget the picture was if that was the doorway there she was kind of leaning up against the doorway there's a big smile on her face because this is what she loved to do she just and and she didn't want to impose it all she was going to stay off to the side and just kind of stay out of the way and just serve everybody which is what she loves to do and just as we're about to sit down everybody looked at her and said edith this is for you this whole thing is for you and um she was mortified and then we kind of dragged her out and put her in that empty chair and we ate our lunch and she was absolutely delighted she looked like a just a little little child absolutely drinking it all in and she had a hard time doing that one of the things i knew about her she had a hard time letting stuff in good things like that and this, you can see it sinking in. It was just wonderful. And then after the luncheon, we all went around the circle and all the staff people just shared a little thing about her that they appreciated. And it was an incredible blessing. She's had the place of honor at the banquet. Is that a good thing? That's a great thing. She's way different than the Pharisees here who had to have it. They had to have it. It's how they fed themselves. It's how they validated themselves. And respectful greetings in the marketplace are extremely important being called by men rabbi. By the way, the interesting thing there, the rabbi is a Latin equivalent which translates docera or doctor, a man of letters. A little bit more study revealed that not only did the rabbis require respectful greetings and being called by men rabbi, but there were instructions as to how people would address them. And when I'm in public, you talk to me this way. When I'm in private, you talk to me this way. And if you didn't address them certain ways in certain areas for propriety, there was discipline of some sort, whatever. I don't know what the discipline was. And again, you know, I would never get into this if it wasn't in the text, because it sounds like we're meddling now. But it's hard for me to think of anything more clear than this. When I first came here, one of the questions, what do you want us to call you? And I know what they meant. I like to play dumb sometimes, but I know what they meant. Do we call you Reverend Johnson, Pastor Johnson, Pastor Dave, da-da-da-da. And I told them, well, my name is Dave. I introduced myself to people as Dave. I answered to Dave. It's a weird thing. All my life, I'm walking down the street. Somebody says, Dave. I go, what? You know, I turn. Funny story about this. Again, in the early days here at Open Door, in the old building, we had the services pumped into the nursery. And at the time, Jesse was, what, three? Three years old, something. Jesse, Jeff's daughter. My voice started coming over the intercom. You know, it was real staticky and stuff like that. But she could hear my voice. was up in the corner. She starts looking at it, real puzzled. And all of a sudden, a light goes on in her head like, I have solved the mystery of the universe. That's Johnson. And a sweet little lady who was taking care of the nursery picked her up and put her on her knee and says, no, this is Reverend Johnson. She looked back up at the box and goes, nah, that's Johnson. Titles, degree recognition. and that stuff's big to a Pharisee. Okay, verse 8, but you do not be called rabbi for one is your teacher and all are your brothers. Don't call anyone on earth your father for one is your father who is in heaven and do not be called leaders for one is your leader that is Christ. Now that's kind of a puzzling thing. I just, I want to land on this a little bit. It sounds almost legalistic. Like if we were going to obey this, we'd go, don't call anybody a leader and don't call anybody a rabbi and don't call anybody father. I don't, I think that misses the point here. Let me, let me give you some background stuff here. Rabbi, don't let anybody call you rabbi. Rabbi speaks of knowledge. Rabbi would be one who is a source of knowledge, and I think the confrontation Jesus is making here is this. Don't let people treat you as if you were, and don't you present yourself as if you are the source of knowledge. Don't do that. Leader speaks of authority. I am the leader. I have the authority, and it speaks of direction. Don't you present yourself as, and don't you let treat people treat you as if you are the source of authority. People have authority, don't let people treat you and don't present yourself as the source of authority. There's only one source of authority, God. There's only one source of knowledge, God. And Father speaks to a source of what? Life. And don't you dare, as a leader, a spiritual leader, present yourself to anybody and don't let people treat you as if you are a source of life. There's only one source of life, that's God. All of a sudden, with that kind of obscure run of scripture, I think, explained quite simply, all of a sudden it's real easy now to spot a false leader. You know how you spot them? One way is that they will point to themselves and present themselves as a source of knowledge. They will point to themselves and present themselves as a source of authority. And they will point to themselves and present themselves as a source of life. True shepherds are real easy to spot. They always point you to and offer you Jesus as your only source of authority, your only source of life, your only source of knowledge. He's our only hope. That's our theme song kind of around here. Our only hope is who? Him. And one of the things that happens is that sometimes we attribute to people characteristics and attributes that don't belong on them, either because they perpetrate it, they kind of feed that, or we just put it on them. And as the pastor here, one of the things I need to say and go real free in saying is this, that if you ever look at me, and you might from time to time, you might, if you hear me every Sunday morning or something like that, and that's the only perspective you have of me, you might from time to time look at me as some sort of source of knowledge, authority, guidance, or life. But here's what I'm going to promise you. If you ever do that, you'll always be disappointed. Eventually, you'll be real disappointed. In fact, somewhere along the line, you're going to go past disappointed in me to getting real angry at me. Know why? Because the authority you thought I was, and the life you thought I had for you, you'll find that I don't, that I'm not the source of authority. I'm not the source of life. I'm not the source of all knowledge. And if you thought I was, you get close enough, you're going to get real disappointed and you're going to get real angry because people can't fill you. I think that in the broad spectrum of things, I'm a pretty good shepherd, but I think I'm a real lousy God. I'm a real lousy source for anybody. So are you. That's about a false leader. That's really no mystery. Let's kind of tie the whole thing together that we have so far. One of the ways you spot is they have false bases of authority. They lack congruity. They keep the load on and weigh people down in a variety of ways. They wear their spirituality on the outside. It's a performance that they put on. It's an image they project. They require the recognition of men and call that respect. Letters, degrees, and titles matter a lot. And they point to themselves and present themselves as a source of truth, authority, and life. And just to add to all of that, spiritual leadership problem is something I said earlier, is that that kind of leadership style produces people like that, who have the same external performance and need to be noticed, and all that shallow stuff. And some people in systems like that end up being real self-righteous because they can put up a real good external front. Some people end up getting real tired and real scared. Others so despairing of ever measuring up and having it look good out here and ever becoming a doctor or an authority or a rabbi. Just despair of carrying all that load and all that performance and they give up and flush the whole God thing out the window. It's a little thing from me to you. One of the things that when I give that last piece about people who just flush the whole God thing down the tubes, Jeff and I are in the middle of writing this and this is going to become a book. In fact, it's coming out in the fall, hopefully. One of the things that dawned on us recently was, and I'd like you to pray about this, we think that this could have as powerful a secular impact as a church impact. I would love to see this spiritual abuse thing in B. Dalton because I think an awful lot of people who could possibly be candidates for the kingdom of God don't even consider it because their experience of the church, of God, what came through a church that did this stuff to them. And they haven't rejected God. They've rejected this. and they need to meet God. Let me give you a little kind of divergence here for thinking before we go to the next section here. And that is this. One of the ironies of this study as we're kind of talking about false spiritual leadership and all that is that there are passages of Scripture that speak of our need to submit to authority, follow authority, and shepherds. Hebrews 13, 17 says, Obey your leaders, submit to them. Keep a watch over your souls as those who give an account. Let them do this with joy, not with grief. For they would be unprofitable for you if you do that. 1 Timothy 5.17 says, Let elders who rule well be worthy of double honor. Those things are true. Those are significant passages of Scripture and there are certain people who need to hear them. One of the things I want to just throw in the hopper of your thinking is if verses like that have been used on you to get you to shut up about false things you've seen, know this, that one of the things our study is revealing, from the mouth of Jesus, is that while those verses are true, we can't afford to be naive. Why? Because not everyone who looks like a shepherd is. That's why Jesus knew that. Not everyone who looks safe is. Not everyone who looks genuine is. And Jesus, in this chapter, is giving us ways to tell. Acts chapter 20, Paul said, Grievous wolves will come in from where? Among you. That's scary. From among you. It won't be from the outside coming in. It will be from among you. And when these grievous wolves come in from among you, they will not spare the flock. There will be wolves in sheep's clothing. All my life I thought wolves in sheep's clothing were false Christians. Now, there are false Christians. But I remember going through Matthew, and some of you were here when we did this and discovered what a wolf in sheep's clothing was, was a false shepherd. Remember that? Here's how it goes. A wolf was somebody who devours the flock, And sheep's clothing was not trying to look like a sheep. It was trying to look like a shepherd. See, the shepherd did indeed get his wool from the sheep. And they would wear the clothing of the sheep. And the clothing that the sheep provided, the cloak, as it were. And the false shepherd would wear the cloak of the shepherd. And so all the sheep would start to follow. And they would go, oh, he's safe. Oh, he's wonderful. Oh, he's telling me the truth. Oh, he'll bring me where it's good for me. And they followed this wolf who was wearing the cloak of a shepherd, a false shepherd. And so one of the things this reveals to us, this text, among other things, is that we can't afford to be naive. Why? Well, obviously, for some of the reasons we've been saying, but as we come to verse 13, when I first started tonight, I told you that verses 1 through 12 were the characteristics of false leaders. In verse 13, something changes in the text, and it's something, it's a nuance that I think is, I'm right about, but it's as if Jesus is turning the heat up a little bit, and he's just kind of flipping it up a notch. And it's as if he's saying this. In verses 1 through 12, I showed you the characteristics. Now I'm going to show you the impact of those characteristics. And I believe that at least part of the reason that he's going now to show the impact of these characteristics is because of our tendency and the potential tendency of the original hearers to minimize what they just heard. Let me explain. Please get this. I think it's possible to hear the characteristics I just laid out for you from this text, and at the end of it say, Yeah, well, that's, you know, oh, yeah, I've seen that and I've experienced that. But it's, you know, it's not that big a deal. And we're really on the same team. And we're talking about maybe some little differences in ministry style and approach and personality and direction. But we're really kind of all in there. It's okay. In verse 13, it's as if Jesus is saying, in case that's what you're thinking, you're not going to think that after this. Because we're not on the same team. When you see those characteristics, Let me tell you what those characteristics do. They are not benign. Verse 13, because they shut off the kingdom of heaven from men. They don't enter in themselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. Here's the kicker. They shut off the kingdom from people. That's why these things are serious. Don't go thinking these are benign. It's not okay. They shut off the kingdom. Let's take this a phrase at a time. Shut off. Literally, it means to slam the door in the face, making entry impossible. It literally means to slam the door in the face, making entry impossible. Next word I want to look at is kingdom. That word kingdom is significant. Literally, it is the Greek word basileia, and all it means is the rule of God, the reign of God, the sphere of God's rule. Now, when I first got that, you know, one of the fun things with Scripture is to, when you just kind of stick with the text and let the text talk, You sometimes become aware of verbiage that we've kind of developed that isn't biblical at all. It isn't necessarily wrong, but it's not biblical. And let the text say it. What dawned on me was that the text didn't say they shut you off from church. It doesn't say that. It doesn't say they shut you off from the temple. It doesn't say they shut you off from church membership or religion or being a Christian even in some sense. What it says they shut you off from, chosen by the Holy Spirit, is kingdom, the reign of God, the rule of God. You get shut off from the rule of God. What gets shut off is really experiencing the vibrant, alive, free joy that comes when God is allowed to really reign in a corporate body, in a family, in an individual life. That's what you're shut off from, the exhilarating joy of being in a place or a system where God is the one who's really in charge. As that concept began to dawn on me, I began to think, and it began to dawn on me that lots of people, you would concur, I believe, have experienced church. Lots of people have experienced the temple of some sort, religion of some sort, some sort of Christianity, some brand of Christianity. But again, trying to stick with the text here and being as firm with it as I can, what this text seems to be saying to me is if that experience of religion, church, temple, whatever, came in the context of verses 1 through 12, false bases of authority, tying heavy weights, external performance, religious pride, they didn't experience the kingdom. They didn't experience the reign of God. They experienced church. Scary thought. Just kind of let that sit there. Interesting to me that in this last public confrontation on the Pharisees, he's not ranting and raving about their theology. No, you have a bad view of the deity of Christ. You have a bad view of the triune God. Didn't yell about their theology. In fact, when we did this, I don't know, it was a little over a year ago, Matthew 23. We'd already spent a long time in Matthew, and we had kind of gotten the flow of that book. And one of the things we discovered was that these Pharisees and scribes knew the Bible better than anybody. In fact, it was a weird thought when we were dealing with the baptism of the Spirit and the disciples, and they were being empowered to minister. These Pharisees knew the Bible way better than the disciples did. They knew the Bible. They had their theology down pat. They could answer any question you'd ask. He's not yelling at them about their theology. He's yelling at them about these other things, false authority, heavy weights, not understanding grace, external performance, no internal reality. When that happens, it shuts the kingdom off from people. And that's what God's angry about. It says something hard in here too, because they shut off the kingdom of heaven from men, for you do not enter in yourselves. He's saying that to the Pharisees, by the way. This is woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, in case you want to know about the syntax, the very beginning. There's no way for me to create what a bomb that had to be, but he is saying this to the elders of the church, okay? He's saying this to the equivalent today of the pastor of the church. You are the ones who are telling everybody else how to get into the kingdom, and everybody's kind of bumping up against you, trying to jump through your hopes, and what nobody knows is you haven't even gone in yourself. It sounds kind of rough. It sounds kind of mean. I want to back off that and go, it probably doesn't mean it. It probably doesn't apply to anybody I know. Any church I've ever been to, it probably doesn't apply, even though these characteristics may be. There couldn't be. All of a sudden, though, when that little phrase came, even though you haven't entered it in yourself, a light went on. It was a light of explanation. You haven't entered it in yourself. What it explained all of a sudden was why they tied heavy weights on it, why they had a false base of authority, why spirituality was all external. Why? Because they hadn't entered it in themselves. That's why. All of a sudden I understand. That's why it's all out here and not in here. Because it's not in here. That's why. And if all you have is this and not this, what are you going to give people? This. not this because you can't give what you don't have. See if the reign of God really is there then there will be real authority. If the reign of God is really there you're going to do what Jesus did and what Jesus did was lift the load. He didn't put it on and give you no way to get it off. If the reign of God is there righteousness will be real. It won't just be this external performance and if righteousness is real the reign of God is real you're going to point to Jesus not yourself. It's just the way it is. Now a little qualifier here. I think there are degrees to which the kingdom can be shut off. Let me explain that. And this can even help me explain how sometimes I, and even enter into, that I sometimes shut the experience of the kingdom off to people. I think at one level, the way false systems can blatantly shut people off from the kingdom is that their influence could be so powerfully negative that people would be incapable of being saved, almost. And in that sense, the kingdom shut off. You get it? So they wouldn't get saved because they never heard the truth. I think there's another way, however, that the kingdom can be shut off. And I think I'm okay with this. And that is this, that people who genuinely are redeemed have come to that point where last week I told you about weights that get put on, works, righteousness, and they never get saved. But sometimes after we understand salvation is by grace, after that we put the load back on for everything else. I think there are people who genuinely get saved and recognize that Jesus is their only hope for salvation. And the door, as it relates to salvation, has been opened. But when they get in there, the experience, the everyday experience of what it feels like to be living by the reign and rule of God is shut off. Because what they're living by is the edicts and the manipulations of an individual, the pastor possibly. And they may be saved. The pastor might even be saved. But the reign of God in terms of everyday life isn't there. So his authority is false, or her person who's in the leadership position is not lifting loads. He's putting loads on it even though they understand salvation by grace. And part of the reason they're putting a load on you is what? you know why they get an incredible load on them that's why by the way they do role reversal why is that because they get their value from how they look and how they look is partly contention on how their church looks so i got to crack you in the shape so i look okay because i'm carrying an incredible load because i don't understand grace for my living i understood it for salvation i'm the pastor so in that sense i think a lot of people have come into the kingdom as it relates to salvation but in terms of experiencing the reign of god in their life in their church not a clue maybe the most troubling piece of the verse is the next phrase nor do you allow those who are entering to go in lights go on when you just read that phrase what that tells me is this the people who are being shut off from the experience of the kingdom or being shut off for from salvation because of these systems are not people who are actively rebelliously rejecting god there are people who are looking for god by the way that explains why god's so angry so it explains why he turned the tables over in the temple because the ones who are getting shut off aren't the aren't the people are going, hey, God stinks. Who cares about anybody who believes in God is an idiot. No, no. These people are ones who are looking for God like crazy. And in a gentleness in their own spirit, they're seeking God. And they're longing and they're responding to a God-induced prompting. And in their search for God, they ran into these guys. And when they ran into these guys, they welcomed them into their church. Thank you for coming. In fact, these guys go about on sea and land to make one proselyte. Oh, this is getting worse and worse, isn't it? verse 15 i got that out of they welcome them into their synagogue their movement their cult their sunday school class whatever it is but the experience of the reign of god is shut off from them picture i have in my mind's eye somebody's searching for god maybe they've tried everything else the world has to offer that might sound a bit trite but everything is empty and i'll go okay the only answer i think that's left for the emptiness of my life is god what would be the logical place to go if you're looking for god church why because there's an advertisement there's a promise that a church makes. It's just by virtue of the cross on the front. What's the promise? You'll find God here. And they go to this church, and what they find is what Jesus called the brood of vipers. Brood of vipers is an incredible illustration. He calls them that later on in this very chapter. In Palestine, a viper is a snake, a little black thing, deadly poisonous, but they used to hide in cool places, often around other sticks and often in cool caves. and you're in a desert, and two things could happen. You're looking at a cave, and you're hot, and you're thirsty, and the cave, because it's cool, promises what? Rest. I'm going to go in there like a church. I'm going to go in there, but it's a brood of vipers. And when you get in there that's supposed to be cool, and it's supposed to be rest, and it's supposed to be God, you get vipers latching onto you, and they suck the life out of you, inject their poison, and they don't let go. And the other thing is the viper would go around sticks. In fact, when Paul was bit by a viper, I think the context was that he was looking for kindling wood, and they would be around little sticks of wood and you'd pick up a viper thinking it was a piece of wood. What I liked about that, if I'm picking up a piece of wood, it's because it's going to do what? It's going to help me. It's going to warm me. It's going to help me. Well, the thing I thought was going to help me is going to kill me. But I thought I would get help there and I didn't. It shut the kingdom off from me. The most graphic picture of this, biblically, I think, is Matthew 21, verse 12 and following. It's when Jesus cleansed the temple. Let me just read enough to remind you of what happens there. Jesus entered the temple, cast out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves and said to them, it is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer, but you've made it a robber's den. Meaning, my house was designed by God to be a place where people could come and meet with God, but you've made it a place where people get ripped off when they come here. Let's enter into that text and that picture this way. Become a family with me. Okay, it's Passover. That's when this happens. And I'm the dad and you can be the dad or the mom of this family. We got our kids and we've been planning all year to go to the Passover and this is the first year that the kids are old enough to understand what the Passover is all about. We're kind of excited. We've been telling the kids about God and how you meet with God and he's a God of love and a God of grace and but of holiness and justice and mercy and all these little lessons around our table. And all year long, we've been telling the kids about the shedding of blood. Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission. I know you don't fully understand it, but it's just a powerful picture of God's redemption and God's cleansing and the Passover lamb. We tell them a story that I will pass over you when I see the blood. And we talk about a Messiah to come and the hope that is there. And all year long we raise as a family this little lamb. And this, by the way, was a common thing. They would very often bring to Passover the lamb that was the favorite lamb, the lamb without spot or blemish. And the heart of this was this would be a sacrifice of love. I'm just going to give God something we really love. This is going to be hard and we're going to cry, but we love God and so we're going to give them this little lamb we raise. This is a pet and the kids are coming and they're taking care of the lamb and they're a little bit sad, but they're kind of excited too about meeting with God. And if there's any place in the world you meet with God, it's where? At the temple. So they go to Passover and they go to the temple. And as you come into Jerusalem, after you get by the mass of the people, there's two very powerful images that assault your senses. The first one, as the dad with my little kids and this little lamb, very intimidating is the temple itself. And so we're looking at the temple. Let's just look at it physically. The construction of the temple itself communicated some things. And among all the things the temple construction communicated was this. You can't get to God. It was made up of six courts, all of them ascending like this. They kind of, an outer court, inner, inner, inner, inner, inner, inner, right to the mount where the Holy of Holies was. And as I would be coming up the steps of this temple, this powerfully imposing building, I would move into the first court, the court of the Gentiles. In the court of the Gentiles, everybody could go. You could have Jews and Gentiles, men and women, slave and free children could go in there, animals could go in there. Everybody was invited into the courtyard of the Gentiles. Right past that courtyard was a very large imposing door into which only Jewish males could go. No, I think women could go into that next one, but only Jews. The next one after that, only Jewish males could go. The next one after that was only priests, and then so on and so on and so on, until after you kept going to courts, each court eliminating a few more people. okay so you got to the final court which was the holy of holies into which one priest the high priest could only go one time a year which all of that communicates something i'm not deciphering all this yet but there's something in my gut i can't get the guy i don't want to get the guy right after i've kind of processed all that imposing stuff not even going to share that with my kids because that'll just be confusing for them there's the there's the other image that assaults me right now in the courtyard of the gentiles and that is the bazaar of annas now Annas was the high priest, previous to Caiaphas, who is the high priest now. And Annas was the previous high priest. And when Annas was in business, he set up this bazaar, or this marketplace, in the courtyard of the Gentiles. Huge place. This bazaar, B-A-Z-A-A-R, was bazaar, B-I-Z-A-R-E. Designed originally, maybe, with the intent of helping people. What it provided was implements of worship, oil, candles, incense, lambs, doves. And the service, obviously, that would provide is that pilgrims are coming from all over, literally, the world. Some would be bringing their implements, lose them on the way. Robbers lose them. A dove or a lamb dies on the way. They forget something. So in their courtyard, they can buy it. So that's good. That's a service. Problem is, is in this courtyard, every single thing there that you could buy for worship, to get to God, by the way, costs ten times what its real value is. Kind of intimidates me. I'm feeling a little bit nervous. To get to God is going to cost me lots. But it's okay. I brought all my stuff. I'm all ready. My heart of love is here. Our little lamb is fine. And just as I'm ready to offer this lamb to the priest at the door, who then takes it in to sacrifice it, I see this other little thing there called the booth of approval. I'm told about the booth of approval. I didn't know about that, but I go to the booth of approval, and this is where the offering that I brought gets approved by a Pharisee. I stand in line, and as I'm in line and watching what's going on in front of me, I get this sinking feeling as one after another is rejected. And I get this feeling that my lamb's going to get rejected. I get to the front of the line. I find out, sure enough, my lamb was rejected too. It wasn't good enough. It wasn't big enough. It wasn't pure enough. How dare you bring something so puny? but it's okay go to one of the booths where we sell lambs pre-approved pre-approved you don't have to come back here if you buy a lamb at one of these booths here you'll be able to get to god you'll be able to get to god so you go to one of the booths doesn't really matter which one you look around you shop around try this booth the kids thought this guy looked friendly so we went there paid ten times what the lamb was worth didn't even get our lamb so all this love stuff is out the window find out there that there was all sorts of little implements and little trinkets that we didn't have we needed okay we'll buy that too how come that booth says we don't need that and this booth says we do I don't know I guess we'll just be at this booth and do what this booth says you get the picture it's like the booths are like all these different churches and all these different denominations They got all these little hoops you got to jump through to get to God. And the real scary thing is they spend all their time and all their money, all their life in the courtyard of the Gentiles, paying through the nose to get to God and never do it. Never do. It shuts off the door of the kingdom to people who are trying to enter. Jesus walked into that and had a fit. Rage. Righteous indignation. He ripped their face off. And I think today there's a confusion of the booths. There's a confusion of the booths. And everybody's got different hoops you've got to jump through. And if you go to this church, you find out what the rules are and how they broaden their phylacteries, and you figure it out after about six months, and then you fit in. You pay, and you pay, and you pay, and you pay, and you wonder why you never sense intimacy with God. You know what I love about this 21st chapter of Matthew? It says in the 14th verse, wow, I love this verse. Picture this. Jesus is raging, turning the tables. The doves are flying everywhere. The money changers are running. I kind of picture in my mind's eye the Pharisees and the money changers kind of peeking around the corner in the dark with beady little eyes and then it says in verse 14 the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed him I love that verse missed that verse all my life until I kind of put this together blind lame blind people lame people spent their whole life in the temple in the corner. Because the business of the temple was what? The booths. Making bucks. So the blind people and the lame people were always off to the side. They were a nuisance to the ministry. When Jesus turned over the tables and confronted the garbage and the system, guess what happened? The blind and the lame people became the ministry. They became the ministry. I love that verse. How do you tell if your church is a kingdom church? How big your building is, that's how you tell. How big your budget is, that's how you tell. No. I'll tell you how you can tell. If the blind and lame are getting healed, that's how you can tell. Because when they are the ministry, that's a kingdom place. That's the kingdom place. But where we've got a false base of authority, we're tying heavy loads on people, and it's all external performance. Only the external performers are the ones that are going to fit in here anyway. And the blind and lame people are going to be off to the side a nuisance to our real ministry. They're always getting in the way. I just love it that Jesus blew that up. He's more mad about that than I am. I don't think I need to make a strong appeal for the reality that these kinds of things can happen in the church. I think I've already established that. I do want to give you one more passage that helps to affirm it, though. And by the way, let me say it this way. This whole business of being shut off by the kingdom, and I'll get back to this thing about the degrees to which I think you can either be shut off for salvation or also just the experience. and let me say it this way. Whenever or wherever or the degree to which you experience the characteristics of verses 1 through 12 let me say it that way. The degree to which the characteristics of verses 1 through 12 are in operation it is to that degree that the kingdom will be shut off. Does that make sense? The degree to which those characteristics are in place and the order of business it is to that degree that the kingdom will be shut off. if not salvation-wise, experiential-wise. A good illustration of this happening among redeemed people, because some would still argue, well, none of these people in the temple were redeemed anyway, so it can't happen in the church. Okay, fine. Galatians, it happened in Galatians. The Galatians were saved, redeemed genuinely. The Judaizers came, put the load back on them of external performance. They did not come in, the Judaizers, and say, Jesus is accursed, and say that. They didn't say grace is a lie. No, they preach grace, kind of. And they didn't come in and say salvation is by works. No, they didn't say that. They said Jesus is great. Salvation is wonderful, but it isn't enough. Give me a break. Grace is wonderful, but you're going to have to earn it. Jesus plus circumcision, Jesus plus observing days, Jesus plus tongues, Jesus plus church attendance, Jesus plus daily devotions, Jesus plus communion, and on and on and on. And before I know it, my only hope is no longer Jesus. My only hope is me cranking out tongues and cranking out attendance and cranking out devotions and cranking out communion and cranking out days and weeks and months. Who has bewitched you? Who in the world has bewitched you? This is the only thing I want to know from you. Verse 2, Galatians 3. Did you receive the Spirit by works of law or by hearing with faith? That's a great confrontation because it sends them back. When you got saved, remember when you got redeemed? Remember, remember, remember? How'd that happen? You finally do it good enough? No, no. No, it was by... You received it by the Spirit. And you heard it, and you received it by hearing with faith, not by your cranking it out. Are you so foolish, having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? That's what they were doing. And the experience of the kingdom, the experience of the reign of God was being shut off because of that. put it all together when there is false bases of authority an incongruent life they say but do not the piling out of loads religious rules traditions rituals shame never the strong arm of grace to lift the load when religion is worn on the outside externally when we need to be noticed and there's a a categoric lack of humility when titles degrees, status, and recognition is demanded, know this, those things are not benign. They are not harmless. Oh, it's just the way they are. No, they're not irritating but harmless things. They literally shut off the kingdom from people who are trying to enter in. Next characteristic, they devour people. This one hurts a little bit. Well, like the other ones don't, they do too. this this characteristic is where i got the whole concept of spiritual abuse what do you scribes verse 14 and pharisees you hypocrites because you devour widows houses stop right there you devour people this issue of devour is what i dealt with devouring is what i kind of introduced last time as being one of the loads that we put on people's backs and that is this whole concept of role reversal and role reversal just to remind you of it is simply this that instead of the shepherd being there for the sheep, the sheep are there for the shepherd. And my need to be affirmed is dealt with by making you look good. And so I get my life from how you look and how you perform. Instead of using the pastor, instead of using his or her authority and power and strength to give to the flock, nurture the flock, and protect the flock, they use their authority and power and strength and intelligence and knowledge even of the Bible sometimes to take from people, fleece the flock, devour the flock. Ezekiel 34 verse 2. I read some of this last time. What are the shepherds of Israel? You have been feeding yourselves. Should not the shepherds feed the flock? That's a role reversal. You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool. You slaughter the sheep and feed yourselves. Zechariah 11 16. You devour the flesh of fat sheep and tear off their hooves. I had more scripture on that last time if you want to go back to your notes on that. Let me kind of get down to the illustration that's kind of hard to hear. What we have in this dynamic of role reversal is a classic definition of spiritual abuse. And though it is a bit frightening, and maybe almost too graphic, the best parallel I can think of to spiritual abuse is sexual abuse. In fact, my whole understanding of spiritual abuse began to explode in terms of, yeah, like that, when I compared spiritual abuse to sexual abuse, or any kind of abuse. Let me draw the parallels for you. Let's talk about sexual abuse first. Take it away from the spiritual context. We're not talking about any pastors. We're talking about parents and uncles now, and aunts. Abuse, specifically sexual abuse, is when a person, in this case we'll just make it a parent, man or woman, who was put into the life of that child to protect that child, to nurture that child, feed that child, meet the needs of the child, begins to use their power. And parents, we have power. If for no other reason that we're bigger than them. Admit that. I mean, agree with that? We're bigger than them. So instead of using my strength and my size in the life of this little one to give him and lift him or her and nurture him and get around them, I begin to use my power because I can to take from them and use them. and all of a sudden instead of me being there for the child the child is there for me that's called role reversal when it happens between a parent a child it's called abuse it's abuse whether it's sexual i get my sexual needs met through this child perverse as that might be that's that's how i get it done i get my emotional needs sometimes met through that child and that's why this child has to perform not because i care about them being successful in wife, it's because their performance makes me look good. Some of you have lived with that all your life. Never been accepted, never good enough. It was never enough, and you lived your whole life trying to make them okay. And they were never okay. They got all their okayness from you. If you've ever stumbled, it was over. It devours people. That sucks the life out of people. When a parent comes into the life of a child and takes the life from the child instead of giving strength to it, let's keep it in this context of sexual abuse, the victim, this child, is incredibly confused. And it's unbelievably frightening. Keep making the parallels, if you can, to spiritual abuse. Keep kind of going elder, pastor, parent, uncle, sheep, child. When it's happening between a parent and a child, parent sexually abuses, takes life from the child, it's confusing, it's frightening. When the pastor or the elder role reverses and starts taking life from you, it's very confusing, it's very frightening. And when it happens, there's absolutely nowhere to go. Feel absolutely helpless. You can't say no. You can't resist. If you're a little child being molested, you can't resist. You can't say no. Why? Not only are they bigger, it's not even about that. It's more of these messages. This is grandpa. This is grandpa. He loves me. This is grandma. This is Daddy, this can't be wrong. This can't be wrong. Little kids don't have what they need at that age to decode everything that's going on here. This must be okay. It's Daddy. Very confusing. This must be okay. It's the pastor. Be a new Christian. It's the pastor. He's the one who led me to the Lord, brought me into the world like my father brought me. They must care about me. They talk about love. They read the Bible. This must be okay. sucking the life out of you the whole time. They know best. They're here to protect me. It's probably for my own good. The Bible says, if I'm a child, the Bible says, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. So God wants me to do this evidently. God says, do this. Obey your leaders, submit to them. Obey your leaders, submit to them. but i'll tell you what let me just meddle here a little bit i'll make a blanket statement that may not absolutely be true but i'll do it just for effect if you're in a system where you're always hearing that verse used on you beware well there later submit to them if you always heard that from me because you weren't shaping up be real careful you know what this is i'll use a jeff van vondrenism that's not my verse that's your verse i'm gonna stay off your verse the first time i heard that he was doing the ephesians 5 passage wives submit your husbands husbands love your wives and what he talked about was in counseling all the men wanted to do the wives verse and all the wives want to do the husband's verse it keeps going stop no uh men stay on your own verse don't do your wife's verse don't be telling her how she ought to submit you do your verse you lay down your life for her. Okay, you do that verse. And wives, you do your verse. Pastors, pastors, do your own verse. Don't lord it over people. There's your verse. Let your people do their verse. Do your own verse. But I think that's a verse, by the way, you're going to hear a lot, especially if they're appealing to what they even in their gut know is a false basis of authority, because you won't obey them unless you give them the law. You won't do what you want unless you begin the law. One of the frightening things that we noticed in our church as more and more we became a church and I'm real happy about this, but I think unusually equipped with people like Jeff Van Varner and some of the counseling things we've got to deal with issues like sexual abuse and things and then all of a sudden, and I think it's because of the message of grace, before we even understood the concept of spiritual abuse, we were dealing with spiritual abuse here before we kind of got a phrase for it. But one of the frightening things was when all of a sudden the characteristics of sexual abuse victims, bam, bam, bam, they have this problem and this problem and this problem, were lining up almost entirely with people who were spiritually abused the same. Let me explain. Some of the emotional symptoms of sexual abuse victims are that they very often go through long periods of denial. Long periods of denial. It's one of the reasons why sometimes you hear someone who, when they're 35 years old, all of a sudden the light goes on and they go, I was abused when I was five. And some of us even hear that and go, right. You ever do that? You know, you hear somebody who finds out later that they just remembered an incident when they were a little kid, and we're kind of suspect of that. That's not, that is a true thing. That is a real thing. That is how it happens. Because this little six-year, five-year, four-year-old girl or boy, Like I said just a moment ago, when Daddy or Uncle Tom or Grandpa is coming at them, they are so confused and so overwhelmed with the messages and whatever else it is they feel that literally the way they survive is to block it out. They literally don't remember. It's not there. And then maybe what helps them is they get into an atmosphere where there's some grace. and maybe there's some openness, or something maybe in their marriage blows up, or their life isn't working, and this issue that's been hidden for years and years and years because they start looking on the inside stuff just comes to the surface. But one of the characteristics very often of abuse victims is long periods of denial. One of the characteristics very often of spiritual abuse victims is long periods of denial. It was really okay, they meant well, da-da-da-da-da. It wasn't that, it wasn't that bad. If it wasn't that bad, that's okay. I'm not trying to talk you into something if your experience wasn't that bad. But if it's denial, then that's another issue. It's one of the characteristics it carries over. Another characteristic of both kinds of victims is they have a tendency to blame themselves. It really was my fault. If I only would have done this, if I would have been a better little girl, if I would have been more obedient, if I would have resisted more, it wouldn't have happened. It's really my fault. Same thing with spiritual abuse people. It's really my fault if I would have been a better Christian, if I would have seen it sooner, on and on and on. Overwhelming amounts of shame. Fear is another characteristic. Another characteristic is that the perpetrator has power and control in their life long after the incident, and sometimes even these people are dead. So sometimes people, when they're starting to get healthy because of their abuse, they write letters to their dad or their grandpa, and some of you have even done that, and they're not even around anymore, But you had to say some things out loud to break some of those bondages. And sometimes in spiritual abuse, the same thing is true. You're not in the system anymore. You haven't talked to the person, the man or the woman, for 10 years. But everything you do, you're wondering what they would think. They still have control. No talk rule is very strong. And it's incredibly hard to trust. It's very, very hard to trust. I think this is a big piece. This is not always one of the characteristics of someone who's been sexually abused, but sometimes it manifests in a marriage where the woman, having been sexually abused, let's just use the woman in this case, gets married and maybe they've denied it and forgotten about it and it's a long, long past deal. And they get into a relationship with their husband. They love their husband and their husband loves them. And then their husband begins to make what I would call appropriate sexual advances toward their wife. And they're in love and they have these expectations and it's okay and fine. But the wife, even though she wants to respond, can't. They can't figure it out. And then maybe even remembers something about this sexual abuse thing and has a terrible time disconnecting any sexual act from this one that took life from her. okay and now between a husband and a wife there can be the potential of mutual giving mutual giving and a wonderful celebration of love but because of the pain and the abuse it's hard to read anything sexual as being anything other than something that's going to take a piece of my life and so there's just this inability to respond that's pretty graphic language here um but the exact same thing happens in spiritual abuse situations and i want you to know that we know about it and hopefully it'll make it a safe place for you. What I mean by that is this. If you're from a spiritually abusive system, one of the things you're going to have trouble doing, especially if there was a real lording it over you kind of authority, you're going to have a real hard time trusting again. And even in a healthy spiritual system where, let's say, like the husband makes appropriate advances, let's say in a healthy spiritual system, the leadership's listening to God and saying, hey, we believe God's telling us to go this way. We're going to go. And it's kind of aggressive. It's hard for somebody out of a spiritually abusive system to respond to any kind of leadership as if it were a healthy leadership because the only kind of authority they ever saw was an abusive one. And so when the leadership gets aggressive at all in leading, which is okay, there's just an inability to respond to that and just kind of pushes it away and sees it as bad every time there's aggressive leadership. in a marriage if that's the situation what happens is they're patient and they're loving and they go through their issues and they deal with their issues and they and they work through it in a church what's going to happen what you need to know is that we understand about that we know about that and i as the pastor i can tell you from me that um that if you come from a system like that and have a heart. See, I think we do have kind of aggressive leadership here. I think we're pretty, let's go! And I think every once in a while if you're from a system where you've been abused, it's going to scare you to death. And it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be scared. And you don't even have to go, you don't even have to agree. You don't have to go, yeah, I'm going to go with them and do what they, no, no, no, no, don't, don't. We're always, what I'm going to promise you as much as I can is we're always going to tell you what we think and we're always going to lead the way we think we're supposed to lead and if you don't think we should, we're going to love you and you don't have to follow. You don't have to. It's okay, wait. Go slow, go slow. Go slow. Take your healing. But one of the marks of somebody who's been abused is it's real hard to respond even to appropriate leadership. By the way, the kicker in this verse it just kind of pushes my button. All of this role reversal and devouring of people, the spiritual rape, if you will, is going on even while for a pretense they make long prayers. It just kind of completes the picture for me. Long flowing robes, oh God, hallelujah, all that's going on and what's really happening is people are having a life sucked right out of them. Now I want to close with this little tidbit on the side. As I'm talking about leaders and parents, parents, we can all relate to that, of taking our, you know, getting our life from our kids or leaders taking, getting their life from their church or their sheep. One of the questions that would come up if I'm a parent or I'm the pastor, well, I do have needs though. I have needs. Parents have needs. Leaders have needs, don't they? Yes, they do. But here's what you need to get. Healthy parents, healthy parents aren't looking to their kids to fill their emptiness. Healthy parents have come to a point, hopefully, where they've realized that the only one who can fill their emptiness is Jesus. Their kids can't fill it, and their husband can't fill it, and their wives can't fill it. And what a wonderful thing to be in a marriage where my wife has figured out that I can't fill her. Because now I'm off the hook. I don't have to be her guy. And what a wonderful thing would be for my wife to be in a relationship with me when I finally figured out, and I didn't know this at the beginning of our marriage, believe me, we didn't, wasn't all wonderful. Well, somewhere along the line, I did figure out that my wife was not my source of life. And my only hope of life was Jesus, and her job was not to make me happy and full. And when I quit making her responsible to make me okay, boy, I took a load off her. And when she figured that out, that I wasn't here on the face of the earth to fill her emptiness, boy, it took a load off me. And you know what set us free to do? Really love each other. Really love each other. Because both of us were getting our life somewhere else and giving the life we got from God to each other. And what a load it took off our kids when we figured out they weren't here to make us look good. We were here to give our life to them and hopefully they'd pick up the cues and get a life of their own. Get a life. Get a life. okay healthy leaders healthy leaders take it out of the parents role healthy leaders aren't looking to their congregations to make them okay healthy leaders have figured out that the only one who can fill them is jesus and what a load it takes off the congregation when the pastor and the leaders finally figure out that their okayness is not dependent on the congregation and the congregations can't make pastors full and that's not your job to make me full or the elders full we got to get our life from God and the congregation has to do the same thing when we all start getting our life from God and we all start pointing each other to Jesus and not to each other all of a sudden we can come together and really do what? love each other and really start storming the gates of hell do you know that it's not your job to make me happy congregation it's not your job now that may sound like a stupid thing even say to some of you, but some of you need to hear that. Some of you have, maybe not directly, but indirectly, been given the message, it's your job to make sure my husband's happy, my daddy's happy, my mommy's happy, my pastor's happy. It's my job. It's not your job to make me happy. If, you know, if I'm a grump, I'm just speaking as the pastor, if I'm a big grump, if I'm a creep, if I'm an idiot, if I'm an angry guy, if I'm hard to live with, you want, here's a flash for you. It's not your fault. It's not your job to do everything you can and say everything you can to make me happy and jump through hoops until I'm okay. It's not. The other side of that door is it's not my job to make you happy. It's not. If you're a grump, if you're a creeping idiot, angry, and hard to live with, I'm not going to say everything I can and do everything I can to make sure you're happy. I'm not going to. What I'm going to do is this. And what we need to do is this. What I'm going to do is this. I'm going to hang on to my Chief Shepherd. And I'm learning how to do that. I don't do that every moment. I'm going to hang on to my Chief Shepherd with everything I have. And in those healthy moments when you might come into contact with me, and if you get me at a healthy moment, I'll be hanging on to my Chief Shepherd and you'll come to me wanting to get life. Maybe even get it from me. But if I'm at a healthy moment, what I'm going to do is point you to the same one I'm hanging on to. That's all I'll be able to give you. That's all I'll be able to give you. I'll point you to the same one I'm hanging on to. And if you do that, there's life there. And that ties me back to that verse 8. Don't let anybody call you rabbi. Don't let anybody call you leader. Don't let anybody call you father. Nobody is the source of authority. Nobody is the source of life. Nobody is the source of knowledge other than God. We're all just hanging on to the shepherd and we're all next week we get to the next characteristic and it's a frightening one as well they reproduce all these things that we've talked about reproduce isn't that good news talk about that next week the week after next we're going to have some time set aside from ministry time now we may not even need it now we'll be fine but we're going to have some time set aside for that just so you know it won't be next week. It'll be the next week. Okay? Let's pray. Father, I pray again as we close this that you would close this for us and that you would come around the information we've gotten, the issues that have been touched and maybe wounds that have been opened. I pray that you bring your healing. I pray that you would bring your life to it. Father, there are some people who need to be angry. There are some people who need to be, to have the denial broken. And I pray that you would give liberty and a safe place to do that. But above all, as we go through our processes with these issues, that you would bring your healing and your grace. In Jesus' name, amen. You're dismissed. Thank you.
