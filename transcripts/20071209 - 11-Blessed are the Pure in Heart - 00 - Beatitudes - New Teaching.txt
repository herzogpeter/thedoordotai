Let's pray. For eyes to see and ears to hear and hearts tender and open and responsive and feet that are eager to follow. I pray. And I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. And so we come again today to sit, as it were, at the feet of our Rabbi Jesus. As he describes for us in the introduction to the Sermon on the Mount, known as the Beatitudes, the kind of people to whom the kingdom comes, through whom its power flows. ironically we've discovered it's broken people who seem to have the easiest access to this kind of life because they seem to know, among other things, that they can't do it themselves and are therefore open to and even desperate for God. So blessed are the poor in spirit, says our Rabbi Jesus, and those who mourn in the meek, it's not the full but the hungry who actually get satisfied and the merciful who get the mercy, which brings us today to the sixth beatitude. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. It's weird in the Greek, it's in the imperative. For they alone, alone shall see God if you have a pure heart. Wow. I don't know. I don't know, interesting to me, because in this beatitude, there is, I think, a notable shift, at least there is for me, in that on the front end of this beatitude and my trying to understand it, I find it quite intimidating, actually, because unlike the other five beatitudes, which on the front end, I struggled with, but my struggle with the other five beatitudes was that on the front end, they felt undesirable to me, because I know of no one who, without some explanation of their value, instinctively aspires to poverty of spirit, to mourning, or to meekness. This beatitude, however, in contrast, doesn't strike me like the others as undesirable, and therefore that's the work I have to do around it. This one strikes me rather as unattainable. I mean, who can say that? Yeah, I get a pure heart. Liar. I mean, you either have to be arrogant or deluded to say that. And I'm not alone in this. Proverbs 20, verse 9, gives voice to the same sentiment when the writer says this. Who can say I've cleansed my heart and purified myself from sin? The implication of the statement is, I can't. Can you? But now to that struggle, add this, that while a pure heart might feel on the front end unattainable, its necessity is undeniable. If you want to see God's pure heart, he alone will see God. Psalm 24, verse 3, who says this, Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord? Who will stand in his holy place? In other words, see God in his kingdom. Here's the answer. he who has clean hands and a pure heart, all of which raises this question. Is God asking us here to do something that we're incapable of doing, of experiencing, of being? Is there any authentic way, authentic way, that ordinary people like you and me can know the reality of a pure heart and not just pretend, but to know it and to feel it, to experience it? Well, the answer to that, I think, is yes. Indeed, I think this pure heart thing is actually a little more accessible than we might think, again, on the front end, but it needs some explanation. And the vehicle I want to use to do that is really quite simple because I've reduced it down to two basic questions that we're going to just walk around this morning. First question is this, what is a pure heart? What is its nature? What is its essence? What am I asking for when I'm asking for a pure heart? What am I desiring if it is what I desire when I'm desiring? A pure heart. Second question is where does it come from? How do I get one of those? How is a pure heart formed in a human being's spirit? Well, I'm beginning to answer the question, the first question, what is a pure heart? There's at least two things I want to talk about and get us to kind of understand that will help us, I think, understand and really get a picture of what it is we're asking for when we're asking for a pure heart. The first is this, that a pure heart is internal in its essence. I'm going to dial into that in a number of ways. And second of all, it's undivided in its nature. Now, the idea that this is speaking of internal realities is kind of obvious. Whenever you mention the heart, I think everybody knows instinctively, without any deep study, that you're talking about stuff that's going on inside. It comes from the word hearts. The Greek word is kardia, which in Scripture always is used to speak of internal things, what's going on on the inside of a man, of a woman, Proverbs 23, verse 7. As a man or a woman thinketh in his or her heart, so is he or her. Prophet Samuel, in explaining why David was chosen to be king instead of his older and more physically impressive brothers, said here's why. Because while man looks on the outward appearance and is very impressed by what they see, God's always looking for something more. God's always looking at the heart. He's looking for something inside. That's where he looks first. So guard your hearts. If that's where God looks first, and if this is what really matters, it becomes imperative that we treat this thing as pretty serious stuff. Guard your heart, says Proverbs 4.23, because the truth is that from the heart, from the inner place of the human being flow all the issues of life. So the heart is literally, you know it's true. Without this teaching, you know this is true. It's the seat of the personality. It's the inner person. It's the real you. So blessed are those who in here have something real. Blessed are those who in here have something that is good and right and real. Pure scares me because it sounds perfect. So we'll get to pure eventually. But let's just start with blessed are those who in here have something real. And genuine, authentic, true. Which actually, when I begin to dial into it that way, is really good news for a number of people. Because if a pure heart is internal in essence, I know some people. I know quite a few people who have some really good stuff in here. It's good news for a number of people. But one group you might not expect it to be good news for would be the poor, particularly in Jesus' day. And we know this because of some of the history we've been doing in this series we've been in. And it's not just the poor in spirit that this word would be good news for. It would be for the physically poor. Let me explain why. Because in Jesus' day, as we've been talking about for several weeks, even months, a significant reason for the abject poverty in the land that we have, again, categorized and cataloged for quite a while was not just Rome, which is the obvious reason for the oppression of the people in Jesus' day, but it was also a corrupt temple system, which had become big business in Jesus' day, such that some people in the land were very, very rich, but most people were very, very poor. And part of the business of the temple was to charge people exorbitant fees in order to participate in the various expressions of worship at the temple, including all the purity codes and all the ceremonial washings, which established you as clean or unclean, pure or impure. So if you were able to participate in the ceremonial washings, you were clean. But if you couldn't, then you were unclean. You were impure. But the poor, quite literally, couldn't afford to participate in that. So regardless of how much they actually did love God, even from the heart, if they didn't do the washings, which cost a lot of money, and if they didn't get the cleansings, which cost a lot of money, they were declared to be unclean, impure. Indeed, you may remember just from studies we've done on this in the past that there were innumerable ways in Jesus' day to be unclean, to be impure. A disease of any kind could make you unclean. It's part of the picture of Jesus touching the leper because the leper, just by virtue of the fact that he had this disease, made him unclean physically, but also spiritually. A disease of any kind could do that. If you touch someone with the disease, you could become unclean. A woman's menstrual cycle made her unclean. Gentiles were unclean, and eating with a Gentile made you unclean. Sin obviously made you unclean, but you didn't even have to actually sin to be unclean. All you had to do was not participate in the temple business to be unclean. All you had to do was not go to church, and that was a sin, and then all of a sudden you're unclean. So here's the deal. So in that context, when Jesus now says, blessed are the pure in heart, to those people hope would begin to rise. Hope would begin to rise if they actually heard it. I think they might have wondered if he was serious, if he had any authority to show how this was true, but hope would begin to rise in the hearts of the lepers, in the hearts of the poor, and those who had been marginalized, people who literally couldn't afford to be made, clean to be made pure, that maybe there's another way. That maybe there's access to God not based on being washed out here, but based on how thoroughly cleansed I am in here, which is precisely what Jesus says in Matthew 23, verse 25, to the very group of people who were running the temple system at the time, the Pharisees and scribes and chief priests, when he said, you know what you guys do, and you do it really well, and you do it all the time. You clean the outside of the cup. You wash the outside of the cup and of the bowl. You do it over and over. You're always washing. But inwardly, you're full of robbery and self-indulgence. Robbery and self-indulgence kind of sounds like a use. You're just full of bad things. This is very specific. He's saying robbery and self-indulgence. You are ripping off the poor. You're all doing your ceremonial church things, but you're ripping off the poor in the name of religion for your own benefits, for your own self-indulgence. are you so blind, he says in verse 26, don't you see, that if you would clean the inside of the cup first, if you would do the heart work first, the outside would take care of itself. It would be clean as well. So start on the inside. Blessed are the pure in heart, which is really good news to some people in this room right now, some of you, who actually might not look that good right now, but on the inside, something's stirring, something's moving, something's beginning to change. That word pure still intimidates me, but if inside, if inside something's moving, something's stirring, something's beginning to change, blessed are you. because the first thing you need to know about a pure heart is that it's an internal in its essence. So here's a question. What's going on in here? I mean, that'd be a good question for some of you to just sit on for the rest of my talk and just ignore me for the rest of the time. What's the temperature in here? You know, when God takes the temperature of a church, I don't know if he ever does it, but I'm gonna tell you, He doesn't measure how big we are, how popular. Somewhere along the line, he puts that thermometer on the inside. When God takes a temperature of a human being, he puts that thing on the inside. What's going on in here? Really. See, I can fool you out here. And you can fool me out here. And if we're washing our hands and praying loud and long, I can't even fool myself sometimes. It's scary how good we can get at fooling each other with how good we look out here. Blessed are the pure in heart. What's going on in here? It's another thing about what Jesus is doing and saying here that I want us to get at this, that as Jesus is bringing this message that accentuates the need for internal reality, while it powerfully is confronting and running counter to the religious system of his day as embodied in the temple system run by the scribes and Pharisees and chief priests. I want you to dial into the fact that he is not confronting authentic Judaism. In fact, he's confronting the loss of authentic Judaism. One of the things we've said in this series where we've been seeing Jesus as our rabbi is this kind of disturbing thing that I like to throw out there, that Jesus wasn't a Christian the way we would define a Christian. He never knew the apostle Paul. He was a Torah observant Jew. He didn't come to abolish the law and the prophets. He came to fulfill the law and the prophets. So it would be really good for us to see Jesus standing in the role almost like an Old Testament prophet. This Rabbi Jesus functioning as an Old Testament prophet, calling his own people back to their roots. Not to a new thing. This is not a new message. It's about the heart. It wasn't like Old Testament. Yeah, it's all about the law, and now it's about grace. And it was all about the ceremony of Washington's end. But no, no, it was always about the inside. Because the message of God to his people has always been this. You shall love the Lord your God with all your what? Hearts. First commandments and the law. But the one thing God wanted and the one thing God still wants is the one thing that they, and quite frankly, we refuse to give, our hearts. And as soon as that happens, we close off our hearts. All that stuff that was meant to be flowing from the inside is now only on the outside. In the form of empty religion, ritual, and ceremony, so we tithe our dill and mint and cumin. But like the Pharisees, if it's not coming from a hot heart, you begin to do this thing that looks good out here, but you end up neglecting the weightier matters of the law, like justice and mercy and faithfulness. So we sing our songs and we pray our prayers, and in those days you would go to the temple, and in these days you would go to church. In fact, it's a great system if you don't have a hot heart because it allows you to look righteous and not be. righteous. Which is precisely why God, through the prophet Isaiah, long before Jesus, this is, I want you to get this, did not start with Jesus, long before Jesus, and Isaiah 29, 13 laments the fact that these people, God's people, honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, in vain do they worship me, and I am tired of their many words, because what I wanted was their hearts. you know I don't know if this is a good analogy or not but I picture being married to someone like being married to a pharisee would be and God being married to us and this way would be being married to somebody who's always doing their duty you know but but you don't have their heart like they're washing and they're going to church and but you you just know they don't have their heart in fact all the good things they're doing are kind of a way to go what do you mean you know am I am. It's like, stay away from me. All he wanted was the heart. Because if I got your heart, that behavior stuff will come. So when Jesus says what he says in Matthew 5 and Matthew 23, I want us to dial into the fact that this is not a new message and it's not a new problem because a pure heart has always been first, Internal in essence, undivided, second now, undivided in nature. Now, it's internal essence we get from the heart word. The undivided in nature we get from this word pure. And as I've been saying here, this is where it starts getting intimidating. I mean, I'm all about the internal thing and wanting to be real, but pure just sounds like sinless perfection without blemish. Sounds like a pure heart is a spotless heart. Well, it does speak of purity in that way, but think also this. Not just a spotless heart, but an undivided heart. Think of a whole heart. Katharizo is the Greek word. Think of a heart that is a single-minded heart. A single-minded heart, as in you cannot serve two masters. You cannot serve God and money. so pick. A pure heart would go, I'm picking God. It's a single-minded heart. Maybe another word that helps. A pure heart is a congruent heart such that the actions on the outside are consistent with and flowing from what's really happening on the inside. The actions and the heart are the same. That's a pure heart. It's a congruent heart. Words like integrity come to mind. Authenticity come to mind. Think of some people in your life that you really trust. Now, maybe I've never connected the dots this way, but if there's someone in your life that you really trust, you feel it's because they have a pure heart. Think of people you don't trust. I don't want to get mean or anything, but part of the reason you don't trust people that you don't trust is because there's this mixed agenda. They It might even be nice to you, but you can just sense there's something that they want. It's not congruent. They're acting loving, but they may not be loving. You trust people when there's this sense. It's the same. What they're saying to me is consistent with what they feel, what they mean. A pure heart is a congruent heart. It's authentic. It has integrity. Because the behavior you see on the outside is coming from someplace real, authentic. it matches. The Pharisees didn't match. Think about it. Think about it. Matthew 6. The Pharisees prayed. That's a good behavior, you know. They prayed loud and long, according to Matthew 6. They even gave alms to the poor. There's different kinds of giving in the Scriptures. One is giving to, you know, to the temple or to the church, but there would be the giving of alms to the poor, which is kind of above and beyond, and it speaks to a merciful heart. So praying and giving are really good things to do. And if I saw you praying or saw you giving, it would lead me to believe that you loved God. That's why people pray. And that you loved people. That's why people give, because those behaviors, that's what those behaviors look like. But in the Pharisees' case, their praying and their giving wasn't their heart. Because they didn't love God, and they didn't give a rip about people. They were using people, quite frankly, because of the temple system, to get rich. They loved themselves. And everything they did came from that place, even their praying and their giving. The only reason they did what they did was to be noticed and admired for how devoted people would think they were and how merciful people would think they were. Jesus says it this way in Matthew 6, verse 1, Beware of practicing your righteousness before men, to be noticed by them. Verse 2, And therefore you give alms. Don't do what these guys do. They blow trumpets. I mean, I don't know if they actually blew trumpets or that's a metaphor. I mean, I am giving money. It's like, have you ever been in a place where every picture in the church or every chair in the church, somebody's name on it. Well, there you go. You got your reward. There's your name right on the chair. That's blowing trumpets. Some of you are offended. That's okay. When you give alms to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand's doing. Well, that sounds a weird thing to say. It would take a pure heart to do that. Take a pure heart to go, boy, I just saw a knee and I gave. And you go home and you go, what'd you give? I don't remember. I just saw that need. It's pure hearts. When you pray, don't do what the hypocrites do who love to stand in the synagogue and they love to stand on street corners to be seen by men for how holy they are. Truly, I say, they have their reward in full. They prayed and they gave, but it wasn't congruent. It wasn't authentic. It didn't match. It wasn't pure. Blessed are the pure. I mean, I love Jesus for so many reasons, but one, it's like there's just no BS. Blowing smoke is what I mean by that. I'm serious. You know that. I've done that before. There just isn't any. It's like, I know, I know. I'm not impressed with your behavior. It doesn't match your heart. People who have a heart for God pray, and people who have a heart for God, for people give. but sometimes people pray and have no heart at all. I don't like that, says God. In fact, it makes me sick. Blessed are the pure in heart. Keep in mind these people who are praying without their hearts, even though their giving wasn't pure, they still did get something out of it. And this is interesting. They did get what they wanted when they prayed and when they gave. So at some level, their praying and giving worked for them because what they wanted was to be seen. It says it right in the text. You heard me read it. To be noticed in verse 1, to be honored in verse 2, to be seen in verse 5. And Jesus says, you have your reward. You want it to be seen? That's what you got. You know what they didn't get? They didn't get to see God. So they got to be seen, but personally, they never got to see God. Ever. I thought about that Think about that with me Imagine Particularly with Pharisees and scribes Imagine being involved in religious stuff Your whole life And never ever Sensing Seeing Discerning Never being overwhelmed With a sense of the transcendent Ever See that kind of stuff Is reserved for the pure in heart, who give because they love God, and people who pray because they deeply desire from the heart to be with and to know and to press into God. People like that get to see God. What? With the eyes of their heart, the pure heart with the eyes of their heart to apprehend God to discern and hear him to notice him sometimes in the simplest and most ordinary ways like in the face of a child sometimes they see God in the eyes of that hungry person they fed or in the eyes of that prisoner that they visited or in the eyes of that thirsty person to whom they gave a glass of water, Matthew 25. All of which leads to the second question. How do we get hurt like that? Where can I get me one of them? How are they formed? Where do they come from? Well, the risk of oversimplifying here, I think that this kind of heart is in the making, and I'm saying it that way on purpose. Almost with everything, there's some sort of process involved in this. This kind of pure heart is in the making when you first begin to recognize the need for this kind of heart. That maybe you don't have this kind of heart. And that you're aware you can't create this kind of heart by yourself. Because the fact is this. If you're really interested in having a pure heart, one of the first things you might need is a new heart. the kind that God provides and this is where it feels almost too simple to say so ask him for one I mean right now right here where you sit as I keep blabbering on get quiet God this I I would need a whole new heart and as you think about that and wonder about that and think I'm a little crazy for saying all that here's this Ezekiel 36 God is speaking through the prophet to his people about a new covenant about a new way of being together God with his people but the whole thing begins Ezekiel 36 says with a new heart verse 26 for I will give you a new heart says the Lord it's all going to start there. The pure heart is going to start with a new heart. And I will put a new spirit within you, and I will remove your heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. Think on that heart of stone thing. Just picture a heart of stone inside a human being. A heart of stone is hard. It's a hard heart. A heart of stone is dead. It's a dead heart. So you could be a human being walking around, but spiritually there's dead. You're dead. A stony heart doesn't feel anything. so I will give you, you got a stony heart? You're going to need a new heart. You can't just renovate that heart. You need a new heart. I will give you a heart of flesh. I will give you a new heart and you will come to life. And then verse 27, I'll put my spirit within you. And by the influence of this new heart and this new spirit, you will begin to be careful to walk in my statutes and obey, observe my ordinances. Why? Why? Because you want to. Why would you want to? Because you got a new heart. Indeed, it's one of the ways you can tell you have a new heart, because now you want different things. Hebrews 10, 16, indeed, this is the covenant I'm going to make with my people in those days, says the Lord. It's not just going to be a tablet of stone. Here's 10 rules. Keep them. I'm going to put my law on their heart. And upon their mind, I will write them Psalm 37, 4. David says, delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart, which doesn't mean he'll give you whatever you want. It means he will affect profoundly what you want. He will change what you want. He will give you new desires. Which is why David in Psalm 27, verse 8, when talking to God said things like this, God, when you said to me, seek my face, my heart said, I will seek your face. Why? Because of his heart. Could have been a rule, seek my face. That's not why he said, I will seek your face. My heart said, I will seek your face. Beloved, this is the mark of the redeemed. This is the gospel that we preach, a new heart that brings with it a new desire. So when you hear, when I hear Titus 2, 11 to 13, it says, The grace of God has appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world. My heart said, yes. that's what I want and when we heard in Ephesians chapter 4 the apostle Paul say listen guys let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech be put away from you be kind to one another tender hearted forgiving one another when you said those things to me my heart said yes which doesn't mean I never struggle with bitterness or anger. And it doesn't mean I'm always kind, but when I do struggle with bitterness and anger, you know the new thing? My bitterness and anger is always going against my heart. It's not my heart. See, this doesn't mean that you always do the perfect thing. It doesn't mean you never blow it, because you do blow it and you will blow it. Indeed, the Apostle Paul in Romans 7 said this, that while I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man, in my heart, sometimes, and I hate it when I do this, but sometimes I do the very thing I hate. But when I do the thing I hate, I hate it. You know why? Because it goes against, I'm not matching. You know the Pharisees didn't match. They had a rotten heart and they did all this good stuff. They didn't match. When we're full of bitterness and God gave you, it doesn't match. Well, the marker of the redeemed, the indicator that you have a new heart, isn't that you always do it right every time. But I will say this. If obedience and submission to God goes against your heart, It's like you go, I ain't going to do that. Then you don't have this heart. You just don't have it. King David was called a man after God's own heart, but he blew it badly, more than once. But when he did blow it, he said things like this, my bones wax old within me, and my spirit became dry like the fever heat of summer. Why? Here's why. Because no matter what David did and no matter where he went, he couldn't get away from his heart. So step number one in a pure heart is a new heart. And some of you need one. So ask. I'm telling you, I'm telling you, it's where it starts. Just simple asking, believing that God is in the give people new hearts business. Ezekiel 36. but that's not what all of you need today because some of you don't need a new heart um i'm betting that quite a few of you might need a renewed heart though david again um psalm 51 says this lord create in me a clean heart and renew there it is not new but renew, renew a steadfast spirit within me. Restore to me the joy of my heart and sustain me with a willing spirit, which is my heart. Why did he want that? Verse 6. Here's why. Because thou dost desire truth, which is congruity, authenticity, purity in the innermost being. Jesus told a parable in Matthew 13 I want to close with this morning. A parable about four soils. Many of you have heard it. The four soils, there was the good soil that was fertile and receptive that when the seed of the truth of God's kingdom was sown into this good soil, a crop of good things began to grow. Living things began to come from this good soil. But there was another kind of soil in the parable, and that was weedy soil where the seed was planted and it began to grow, but weeds kind of choked out the life that had begun to grow. And then there was shallow soil. And I think in the text it talks about rocky soil where rocks were there, and it gives you the impression that there was some good soil and rocks were on the top. But in Palestine, it's a very interesting picture because there were vast areas in Palestine that had a surface of good soil on the top, but there was like these bedrocks of rock right underneath the surface that you couldn't see, but it was like major areas of rock underneath this soil. And so the shallow soil would be where the seed would go and the life would come, but there was a resistance underneath. And then there was just this hard soil where the seed would be sown and it would just bounce off, like it's bouncing off of some of you, I suppose. Today you're hearing this going blah, blah, blah. You know, it's just bouncing off. It has no effect. There's no conviction. There's no sense of of penetration, because the heart is hard, the soil is hard. Now, most of the time I've ever heard that parable taught, and I've heard it all my life, you know, it's a pretty common one in church. It was used to speak of four different kinds of people, four different hearts. There's the good one, the weedy one, and you're weedy, and you're, you know, like that. But the fact is, having thought this through a lot, well, I think that application is fine. What dawns on me is as Jesus is describing these four soils, all four of those soils were in one field. He was looking at one field. And in the one field, all four soils were there. See, what I wonder is that maybe a significant part of developing a pure heart is recognizing that in the chambers of my heart, my one heart, I have all four soils. See, I had in my heart, I have some really good soil. And I'm guessing so do you. Places in my life, and you might even want to think about it, right? Places where the seed of God's word is planted and you have come to life. And it's good fruit and it's living fruit. But there's other places in that same heart. And if you're going to have a pure heart, you're going to have to be honest about this. It's like you're going to have to quit pretending that it's better than it is. And to recognize that in this heart where there's some really good soil, There's also some weedy places. A word about weeds. I'm not a gardener, but I know enough about weeds to know that most people don't go into their garden and plant them. I know. I'm going to ruin my garden. Weeds don't get planted by you. Weeds just get blown in by the wind. You live in the world. You live in the world. You got weeds. They just blow in. So are you willing to pull the weeds? are you willing to look honestly if you're interested in a pure heart then you're going to have to be a weeder and these weeds often need to be pulled up from the roots and that's done best on your knees and some of the soil in my heart and yours has hidden hardness places that if I were to look at you I'd go wow there's some real growth there and if you look at me you'd go wow I really received some things but underneath, I'm aware of this, I have a big no to God, to you. And in other places, maybe even in my heart and in yours, it's just plain hard. What's weird about it, if there is a hard place in my heart that's just a stony place, my guess is I'm not aware of it. Because if it's really hard and dead, seeds bouncing against, I don't feel it. because it's hard. I think that's why David said things like this. Search me and know my heart because sometimes I fool myself. Want a pure heart? Interested in that? This is the work. So here's the question in the key. Would you be willing, even right now, where you sit, right here, to do some work, to say with David, right here, search me. And know my heart. And God, I didn't want to do this kind of work. I just wanted to listen to a talk today. Reveal to me the reality of my heart. and show me the good soil so I can rejoice and show me where the weeds are and the hidden hardness and maybe even the places that are dead. I invite you into all the chambers of my heart. You're moving toward up your heart. We built something into the service. We don't do this very often. We just want you to get quiet. The lights are going to go low. We're not trying to manipulate you. We're trying to give you some space to say to God, search me. Let's look at our hearts. Let's just be quiet. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Amen. Come. We bow our hearts. We bend our knees. Oh, Spirit, come make us humble We turn our eyes from evil things Oh, Lord, we cast down our idols Give us clean hands Give us pure hearts Let us not lift our souls to another Give us clean hands Give us pure hearts Let us not lift our souls to another O God, let us be a generation that seeks, seeks your face. O God of Jacob O God let us be A generation that seeks Seeks your face O God of Jacob So give us clean hands Give us pure hearts Let us not lift our souls to another Give us clean hands Give us pure hearts Let us not lift our souls to another Just stand as we're dismissed. I'm going to ask the prayer team to make themselves available for anyone who needs prayer, especially as things around a word like this would get unearthed in your heart, and you need to be with someone and have someone pray with you. You know, I just can't think of a better thing to be able to say about someone or have someone say about you or me. You know, they're the real deal. That's a pure heart. Father, more and more and more, by the power of your Spirit and our participation with your Spirit, may that be more and more true among us. And all God's people said, amen. Amen. God bless you as you leave. You're dismissed. If you need prayer, don't hesitate to come. Thank you.
