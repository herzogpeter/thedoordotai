I'm going to be talking now in ways that will apply to whatever you do, but I'm primarily concerned with our work as that would commonly be understood if we spoke of ourselves as ministers. And there are a number of major issues that face us today in a way that I think they haven't in the immediate past. And the issue above all that faces us today is developing and presenting a realistic vision of the spiritual life. A realistic vision of the spiritual life. What is spiritual life? And what does it have to do with life? We are coming out of a time when spiritual life has been identified without qualification with religious activities. Religious activities. Activities that have to do with some identifiable religious practice. And we are now in a period where people reject this. It's a question last night from the lady back over here, if you remember, about the various spiritualities. One of the standard bits of language now in American English is, I'm a very spiritual person, but of course I don't have anything to do with the church. In fact, many people are rejecting the church on the basis of what they understand to be spirituality. Shirley MacLaine was raised in a Virginia Baptist church. But she had to go to a hot tub in the Andes to discover she had a soul. Now you may think that's strange. But you won't think that's strange if you understand Virginia Baptist churches when she was a child. I was raised in those kinds of churches. Not in Virginia, but in Missouri. But it's the same story, and basically it's the same story across a whole stretch of what we might today call conservative or evangelical Christianity. It didn't matter about your soul. You probably had one, but God would take care of that. What you did was you followed the accepted faith and practice, and you stuck to that, and you didn't question it, and you were in trouble if you did. And if your real life was going to hell, it didn't matter because you were going to heaven. And we're now in a period where the church is being challenged, as it has not been for centuries, to be clear about the nature and practice of the spiritual life. And if we don't have anything to say to that as ministers of Christ, we don't have much to say. And I began to tell people 10 or 15 years ago that this was the next battle. It was a battle over spirituality and that we were going to lose it if we didn't understand that the heart of the Christian message is life in the kingdom of God. That is spirituality from the Christian point of view. It's life in the kingdom of God. Now, let's go back. What is the kingdom of God? It is the range of God's effective will. It's what Jesus was talking about. When he was talking about the birds and the flowers and all those kinds of things. And inviting people to trust that. To rest in it. To know it. See, that's the major challenge that we face today. Now, the book, The Spirit of the Disciplines, which I wrote back in the 80s, was material I'd been teaching for a long while, and it came out of the realization that I had not been saying things that helped people enter into the spiritual life in a confident way, That I had been getting them to come to church and I was very enthusiastic in what I had to say and preach and people were impressed with my sincerity at least, if not my good looks. But I realized that they were not progressing. That with reference to the basic things that are taught in the Scripture, Old and New Testament, Gospels and letters, they were remaining on the outside they were not becoming spiritually competent people and that they maintained a certain level of confidence in the church and then when the bumps of life would come it would throw them completely off and many times they didn't recover, they disappeared because they felt that they had done their part and God did not do his part. God did not repay them. And the troubles of life came and they prayed and they got no answer and finally many of them would just say there's no point in this. Others would disappear for a while and come back when I was raised on a farm down in southern Missouri. We had an old dog named Roger and he liked to nip at the front wheel of the tractor. And about every ten months, his paw would slip under that front wheel and the back wheel would run over him. And he would yelp and disappear under the house. And in a week or so, he'd come back out. And I saw a lot of people that were like that. They'd get hit with life and they'd disappear and they'd come limping out after a while. And the sense that there is presented in the gospel in the person of Jesus Christ a way of life that is genuinely full of the goodness of God no matter what happens. Jesus' promise for those who hear and do you remember in Matthew 7 is like a man that builds his house on a rock. and when the storms come the house stands and it's the realization there has to be something deeper and I'm sure the Lord was leading me far beyond anything I actually understood but over a period of years the teaching about the disciplines with the spiritual life became things which I could commend to people with assurance they didn't have to be especially bright or anything but if they would just put them into practice solitude and silence study and worship and you have to do some straightening out there because now many people don't think worship is something you can do by yourself you have to have a band and we're actually developing in some parts of our churches what really is worship of worship and worship is not just that it is that and that's a good thing but worship is coming before the Lord and lifting up his greatness in such a way and his goodness and his beauty in such a way that your heart is ravished by it see worship is what happened to Job when he got down to the end of the book you'll remember Job meets God and he didn't get a single one of his questions answered and he didn't seem to care see because he had so worship and fellowship and confession and submission and a lot of things that we can talk about and we will talk about later on today as specific practices those are things that I can recommend people who have heard the gospel of the kingdom with complete faith that if they will put them into practice, they will discover the reality of the kingdom of God flowing around them and through them constantly. And they will know eternal life in its fullness now. Now that's my objective in ministry. My objective in ministry is to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God manifested in my own life and bring it to others in the form not only of that message but of specific practices that they can engage in that will bring them to know the reality of the kingdom in their own lives. So you say, Jesus, seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. Well, but you don't just seek it. You seek it in order to find it. What's it like when you find it, you see? and that's what we aim at I hope in our ministries I aim to make people independent of me, I don't want them to be dependent on me I want them to be dependent on Jesus Christ it's like old George Fox the old Quakers say, taking men taking people off of men and that's me and putting them on to Jesus Christ off of men, put them on to Jesus Christ now I want to suggest that that is a valid goal for our work as ministers that that is something that we can actually do we have the resources for it we can take people off of men including themselves because you see most people are out there running around trying to follow themselves and that's what our culture teaches is you ought to follow yourself no one's supposed to tell you anything well you know after all if you're following yourself you're the one that's got the problem you're probably not going to get very far if you're following yourself and you're lost it's not a very promising outlook is it so then we recommend that you stop running your kingdom and bring your kingdom into the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ and then when you do that and you find that then your little life which is out there perishing struggling dying becomes eternal through its participation in the grace filled life of Jesus Christ so now I don't know how you think about your work as a minister but I suggest that I'm going to use the language of spiritual formation today because that is such a common language now everyone hears about spiritual formation and we need to understand what that is and what I've just described is our approach to spiritual formation We are forming our own spirits by our discipleship to Jesus Christ in his kingdom. And we help others do the same thing. The inner transformation of the self is what we're talking about. And I suggest that everything we do as ministers should be organized around that. Now I want to pause over that and give us a moment just to reflect on it. By the way, I think what I will do is just talk in a conversational way today. And if you have questions that you want to interject as we go along, if you'll let me know. I may have to finish a sentence or a paragraph, but then we'll just sort of carry on conversationally. I think the group is not too large for that today. So don't hesitate to make a comment or ask a question as we go along. Now what I'm challenging you now to do is to think about what is the aim of your ministry. And what are the means of you carrying out that aim. Now your ministry might just be a group of three people you meet with, to pray with. But ministry means that we are bringing the reality of God into the lives of others. That's what ministry is. It's bringing the reality of God into the lives of others. We do that, of course, primarily by speaking the word of the gospel, which is a huge power. It's a huge power. We speak the gospel of Jesus Christ. What I said last evening about Jesus starting a perpetual world revolution, you are now the people who are carrying that forward in what we call the church visible. You are the people who are carrying that revolution forward. The most important thing that is happening in this town is what is happening in the churches. And in some of them, unfortunately, what is not happening in the churches is the most important thing that is not happening in the town. So you have to understand that you're working here with an incredible power when I speak of ministering the reality of God through the word of the gospel. And we have to ask ourselves each individually, what am I trying to do? And what are the means by which I am attempting to do it? That's a searching question I have to ask out of myself. What am I doing here? I'm sure you have plenty of things you could be doing this Friday. So now what am I doing here? I'm trying to bring the reality of God by speaking and being here more fully into your life. That's my objective. now when we think about this whole issue of spiritual formation there are of course some alternatives that are offered in our culture approaches to spiritual formation one of the most familiar and I will mention it just quickly and move on is what we call new age teaching and new age teaching is perhaps the second greatest opposite to Christian teaching in our time. The first greatest is consumerism. That your well-being consists in consuming. And that life is about consuming, getting and spending, and so forth. But the second one is the New Age teaching. And the object of New Age teaching is to bring what they call enlightenment. And actually New Age teaching is the oldest age teaching on earth. It goes back probably 4,000 years before Christ. And enlightenment is the mental shift when you come to realize a number of things that have to do with the illusory nature of your individuality and your difference from others. you come to realize that you are really identical with everything else not separate and that the world of things that are separate is an illusion the veil of Maya it's called it's an illusion that means real life as you live it is an illusion and if you get through this you carry through this it's a very strong line of thinking it's very fortified and if you've ever tried to deal with anyone it's hard to beat it. There's a story in Hindu literature about a young man who went to his guru and the guru told him that material objects are not real and so he left the lesson and went out in the street and an elephant was walking along and he said well material objects not real and so he stepped in front of the elephant and the elephant smashed him. He went back to the guru and said master you said that material objects were not real. An elephant just stepped on me and the master said what elephant? See if you are if the story is true it did not happen that the elephant stepped on the young man. And so if you get into this mode of thinking, many people are very attracted to it in our culture today. And so that's one of the alternatives that we have to recognize. Another is legalism. And legalism is the second form or approach to spiritual formation. And that is just training people to do the right thing. This is the way of the Pharisee. Just do the right thing. Don't do anything wrong. And it always fails because it concentrates on the outer action instead of the inner person. Jesus' way is to change the inner person. The Pharisee's way is to identify the things that are wrong and then don't do any of those things that are wrong. We look at that a little more in a moment when we come to look at Jesus' specific teachings and the kind of heart that he gives to us. Like the Pharisee would say, don't kill. Don't commit adultery. Don't swear falsely. So the Pharisee essentially says, I'm okay because I didn't do anything wrong. And that's their idea of spiritual formation is don't do anything wrong. Well, as you probably know, nobody can do that. And the reason is because their inner self remains unchanged, and that inner self is going to come out. See, in order to succeed with the Pharisees' approach to spiritual formation, you have to be on guard every minute, and you have to understand what is right and wrong in every situation, and don't do anything wrong. And that's why, as Jesus said, the leaven of the Pharisees is hypocrisy. Because if you take that approach to spiritual formation, you will always fail. And if you're that concerned about doing what is right, you will fake it. And you will be a hypocrite. And Jesus' teaching was over and over about hypocrisy. You see, the Pharisees, in order to attain their goal, had actually cut righteousness down and down and down and down. Made it weaker and weaker. I mean, just the fact you haven't killed someone doesn't mean you're right with them, is it? Well, I didn't kill you. Oh, gee, thanks. And just the fact that Jesus pointed out you didn't commit adultery, that doesn't mean you're sexually right. and so on down the line because being right is a matter of who you are inside and the Pharisees unfortunately were not able to see that and then there is we can take the path of spiritual formation that simply recommends regular engagement in church services a lot of people they don't they're not able to go beyond that and this accounts for the fact that there is so much dead religion is because people have not been taught that there is more than just doing the things that have to do with the church and as a culture we're very big on things like revivalism being filled with the spirit experiences of various kinds certainly we're very big on consuming services and many times our churches are competing for consumers of services you know what I mean if you come to my services you really get a kick out of it go to that other place, nah, you don't get much kick out of that so come back next Sunday and we'll give you another kick or now you know church services are very important but not for that purpose see we create a whole consumerist society of Christians who are there to consume services and at the extreme you have what someone calls submarine Christians who come up on Easter and Christmas or you have what sometimes ministers call the hatch, match, and dispatch syndrome. That's what we're here for. We take care of births, weddings, and funerals. Hatch, match, and dispatch. And then out of that, you see, you know the ABCs of church growth? Attendance, buildings, and cash. Attendance, those are the ABCs of church growth. Well, you know, we all feel the same about that, don't we? If that's all there is to it, what are we doing? What are we doing? Because we know in our heart of hearts that consumers of church services do not become filled with the reality of the kingdom of God. We have that on record. We know it because that happens. Now, of course, in the midst of that, very often, You'll have someone who seizes upon a jewel in a church service and comes alive and prays God for that. But see, we always recognize that guy as an exception. So, these are just some... Now, I think if we contrast that with the invitation to live in the kingdom of God and become disciples, of Jesus in the kingdom of God. And then disciplines, spiritual disciplines come in as means to that. Then we have a pattern of spiritual growth that is distinctively Christian that reaches back through the ages and you can certify it if you wish by looking at the history of Christ's people. And we don't need to throw away rules. And I hope you won't because rules are there because they're needed by human beings. And we don't need to throw away genuine enlightenment. We certainly don't need to throw away the services of the church. Now, because let me just say something right here, because you could get the wrong impression from what I've just said. The visible church of the Lord Jesus Christ is God's instrument for the redemption of humanity in your times. And there isn't any other one. There isn't any other one and there isn't going to be any other one. Now Jesus understood the problems of the church and he told his parables, the parable of the tares, the parable of the net to illustrate. See, one of the main problems with the church is its success. in religion nothing fails like success because when you succeed you begin to draw all kinds of people in who are not interested in the message they're not interested in the heart they're interested in the success and may I just tell you there are not many glittering things going in human life it's pretty dreary it's pretty dreary and the church of Jesus shines like a light in the darkness. And it carries the precious word of the kingdom and of Jesus in it. And there is no competition for that word. There's no competition for it. See, in American culture, we're kind of blinded by this because we've been through about 100 years of reaction against the strength of the church as a social institution, which built nearly every one of the recognizable social institutions that we want to frame our lives around as Americans. Nearly every one. Just go to other countries where that is not in the past as a basis for thought and understanding and look at them. And you will say, God bless America. But now we've been through a period of reaction that's trying to throw away that tradition of Christian teaching that has served as the foundation of all of our institutions, except maybe organized crime. Right? All of our institutions served as a basis. We tried to react to basis and keep the institutions. The institutions are now withering. And people are beginning to say, at the highest levels of leadership, what are we going to base it on now? See, it's one thing to say burn baby burn and burn the house down. It's another thing to decide where you're going to live now. And we're now in a phase, and this is one of the most promising things about our current situation, where people in leadership are beginning to have to face the fact that you have to have an idea system and a power that is beyond yourself in order to make human life livable and possible. And that is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the word of the kingdom of God. But it's not just words, it's reality. And spiritual formation as the process, and let me word this carefully, spiritual formation as the process of inner transformation the process of inner transformation spiritual formation in Christ the process of inner transformation to Christ likeness to Christ likeness on the inside see illustrate it this way people look at the Sermon on the Mount I want to talk about that at some length later on in this morning they look at it and they see it talking about things like turning the other cheek and loving your enemies and so on. They say that's impossible. And it is impossible if you're not inwardly transformed. It is impossible. And that's why people systematically misunderstand it and abuse it and do all sorts of weird things. In the history of Christianity, it's full of stuff that's so weird you don't even want to talk about it. And often it is by someone going to some passage in the words of Jesus or elsewhere, turning that into a law and see we're not talking about that we're talking about inward transformation now what's inward transformation? inward transformation is where your thoughts are it's where your feelings are it's where your intentions are it's where your character are in other words that's spiritual if you remember from last night talking about what the spirit is spirit is unbodily personal power that's the inner person now if you transform that by faith in Jesus Christ and interaction with him, then what is possible in terms of outer action is transformed. And you begin to see things like, you know, actually people who hate their enemies have a harder time than those who love them. You know, we hear about Jesus' hard sayings. You ought to pay attention to the devil's hard sayings. Things like pay them back. Get even. The devil's hard sayings are the ones that the world lives by now. When Jesus hung on the cross, he said, Father, forgive them for they don't know what they're doing. You think that was hard for Jesus? Now don't answer quickly. Think about what I'm saying. You think that was hard for Jesus to do? No. Here's what it would have been hard for Jesus to do. my father's going to fry you in hell for this. That would have been hard for Jesus to do. Why? Because of who he was inwardly. See, the man who beat the other man to death at the hockey game a little while ago, you know, jumped on him and beat his head against the concrete until he was dead. he did that because that was the kind of person he was. That did not jump on him out of the blue. The devil did not make him do it. He did that because that was what was in him. When Mike Tyson bit off Holyfield's ear he said, I just blew it. No, he didn't blow it. he did what was in him. Now one of the deepest and most important teachings we can learn from Jesus is that a bad tree does not bring forth good fruit, and a good tree does not bring forth bad fruit. You see, that's where Jesus goes for the inside. That's what he's talking about. When he talks about going beyond the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, he's talking about moving to the area where actions come from. I've got so much to say to you I'm just not going to get it said I'm afraid thank you you see this is the good news we can really change we can be different that's the good news okay I'm going to stop and take a question way back in the corner you have to speak loudly now yes everything you need for your life will be given to you just like the plants and the birds see plants and the birds everything that's needed for their life is given to them now you know birds work hard I don't know if you've ever watched a bird they just don't worry they work hard and they take advantage of what is around them And, you know, your question is really important because this whole issue of needs now has been reprogrammed by our culture. What you need is a Lexus. Why do you need that? Well, you know, it'll help your self-esteem. No, it won't help your self-esteem. It will debauch you more by basing your self-esteem on something as dumb as Alexis. So that's a tremendously important question. Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. Did you notice that's in there many times it's left out? They come together. Obedience and abundance are two sides of the same coin. If you want abundance, go for obedience. And the abundance will come with it. So I'm just saying, all of this is real. And we can bring it to people and we can know it in ourselves, inner transformation. And what I really am urging you is to think that's what ministry is about. Ministry is about inner transformation. Inner transformation of the minister first. I can't help people unless I have been helped. Sorry, I can't do it. What God gets out of my life is the person I become. And incidentally, that's what you're going to get out of your life, is the person you become. You know, we now have these bumper sticker wars. You may have seen the one that says, the one who dies with the most toys wins. Then the reply, the one who dies with the most toys is dead. There's a lot of wisdom, you know. You know that old Simon and Garfunkel song, the words of the prophet are written on the subway walls. Well, where you don't have subway walls, you have to have bumpers. It's pretty good. He's dead. Now, if you take that, then you're going to be, if you take that as the objective of your ministry, then you're going to be tying into the greatest church growth plan that has ever been devised. and I we mustn't move away from this this is the greatest church growth plan that's ever been desired Jesus said I have been given say over everything in heaven and earth so go make apprentices to me among all kinds of people submerge them in the reality and names of the Trinitarian God and lead them into doing whatever I've told you to do now look I'm with you every minute until the job is completely done. So look at the promise that comes with this job. See, there's our resources. Our resources are available. And if we take the mission that Jesus has given to us and just step into it, then we can begin to see this work. But we do take the whole thing now, okay? Take the whole thing. See, the Great Commission, like Scripture generally, tends to be read in terms that will allow us to come out right. And that's a very great danger for me or for anyone. See, when you read the Scripture, you have to be very careful to let it say what it has to say and not say what we want it to say. We have to be very careful about that. There's a saying among the medievals that when a jackass looks into a mirror, he does not see an apostle looking out. This is a profound truth. And they used it to say when you look into a book, the great danger is you will see looking out something that is not in there. So, for example, there's a lovely church in the San Fernando Valley, wonderful people, and it has in the foyer one of these old-fashioned maps, you know, where you have everything is out of shape because they didn't really know what shape North America was or South America was or Europe was or anything was. And around the edge they have these beasts that will get you if you go that far. And it says, go to all nations and make disciples. Now this is a charismatic church, so it has the part in there about baptize them. In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And then what comes next? Dot, dot, dot. And lo, I am with you always. Well now, you know, when something gets into the genre of Christian trinkets, which is what this map is, it's pretty deep in the consciousness of the church. And people walk by that all week and on Sunday, and they never notice the dot, dot, dot. The dot, dot, dot says, teach them to do everything that I've commanded you. And truthfully, that's something that doesn't appear on the mental horizon of many folks who are in ministry is teaching people to do everything that he has commanded you. I'll get you in just a second. Take, for example, a simple statement like, bless those who curse you. Have any of you ever been in a seminar that would teach you how to do that? In a seminary, for example? Why not? See, this is not a part of what we understand. That's why that little ellipsis, dot, dot, dot, can sit there week after week, can be sold in stores and exhibited in churches and offices, and no one be bothered by it. I have never known anyone to walk by that, except myself, and say, here is a horrible omission. And see, if we don't go all the way, then we don't get the low I am with you always. until the job is done. Because the promise is to those who are doing what he said. So now, as a minister, that comes to me first. Am I learning to do everything he said? Now see, don't get worried about perfection. You can get a lot further up the road without having to worry about perfection. we can do a lot better it'll probably be a few months before we need to start worrying about perfection but you know more people in our church circles are frightened of perfection than they are of disobedience and I don't really think that we need to worry about that we'll be working on that for quite a long while in the future but our resources for life-giving ministry lie in this commission. So now I renew my thought. What are our objectives? My objective is to teach people how to bless those who curse them. And I talk to people about how you can learn to do that. I'm not going to stop here and do that unless you just want me to do it and say you must do it. Because I want to come to that a little bit later in terms of details. But you see, I cannot stand as a representative of Jesus unless I am saying, I have learned how to bless those who cursed me. And I can teach you how to bless those who curse you. Not who curse me, you can probably do that easily. But, you know, when everyone drives, and everyone who drives sooner or later gets cursed by someone, wouldn't you say? In California, we shoot one another. But perhaps under the regime of Minnesota nice, you would be a little kinder. I hope so. But, you see, that's where this stuff comes out. and you hear all, now we have all these kinds of rages. You used to just have road rage. Now you have air rage, have sports rage, just rage rage. And how do you deal with that? Okay, this gentleman here had a question. That is actually a long tradition. Many people don't even include prayer. Right? Seriously. I mean, this comes basically out of the Lutheran tradition, which is often said that the word of God is the only sacrament. And the idea was that you were supposed to get what you needed. Now then, actually, that wasn't bad when the sermons were an hour and a half long. And then when you took that home with you and you talked about it the rest of the day, that was a different world. But what we came down to was really this happened in the 50s. It began to be clear that that was not working because we had a lot of people who were in serious trouble under the teaching of the word. And many pastors themselves were in serious trouble. And that was the origin of the Christian psychology movement. It was out of a recognition that it was not enough to take the word in and to be preached and taught. And actually, I don't want to get immersed in my historical analyses here, but the move towards spirituality is a reaction to the failure of the Christian psychology movement, which is a part of the failure of the psychology movement in general. I don't know if you know Jim Hillman, who is one of the leading, whatever that means, psychologists. head of the American Psychological Association at one time he said and his war cry is a hundred years of psychoanalysis and we're worse than when we started one of the problems with Christian psychology is you've got Christian psychologists that is Christians who were practicing psychology but there never has yet developed a Christian psychology and in fact that is what teachings about spirituality are moving toward. And so, for example, I've had any number of doctors and Christians involved in mental health institutions say, how can I introduce spiritual disciplines into my hospital? Because it actually helps people. Carl Menninger says in one of his many sort of take-offs on our situation, he's very good, was very good with it. he said if I could convince the people in the mental hospitals of the reality of sin and forgiveness 75% of them could walk out cured in one week and basically that's right because there are other issues I don't mean to downplay them all but the deep levels of depression and all kinds of disorders that we have to deal with are reflections of the deep fracturing of the human soul that goes with living in a world that's broken from God. So now let me ask you this question and we talked about this some last evening but does the gospel I preach have the natural tendency to produce disciples or only consumers of religious goods and services. And I give you a page reference here on page 58 of the Divine Conspiracy where I developed that at greater length. But now you as a ministering person, okay, now whatever that ministry is, you're preaching a gospel. And you have to ask the question, does the message I bring, does the message I bring have a natural tendency to enlist people as disciples of Jesus. Jesus did not say go to all kinds of people and make Methodists out of them. He didn't even say make Christians out of them. Christian is a word that's used three times in the New Testament one of which is to introduce it as a way of referring to disciples who could no longer be treated as a Jewish sect because they were Gentiles. They had to call them something. They called them Christians. Three times. And it's tied there. But now, of course, we live in a period where, for some of the reasons that I've been going over, we've lost that connection between being a disciple and being a Christian. So now, I have to ask myself wherever I go and whatever, is the gospel, the gospel is the good news. What's the good news that I preach? And does it have a natural tendency to produce disciples or only consumers of religious goods and services? Yes, sir? I'm coming to it. Hang on just a minute. You're absolutely right. And I'm very big on defining it's extremely important to make sure that we know what we're talking about. And that's my next move. Yes, way back here. Like Alcoholics Anonymous and so on. Yes. In fact, I'm coming to that. Thank you so much. These are right on and I'm going to move on quickly now and get to them. This is how I would understand a disciple. Basically, a disciple, as I said last evening, is someone who is with another learning to be like them. So a little child who's learning long division in what? The second or third grade. He's a disciple of the teacher. They're with the teacher learning to be like that teacher in that respect. When Jesus came, he called people to him. They came to him sometimes without being called and became his disciples. That meant in his context that they were literally with him as he went about the countryside. And what were they doing? They were learning to be like him. I prefer the word apprentice to do mathetes, the term that is translated as disciple. Because apprentice has this emphasis on practice. And we're familiar with that structure. You apprentice yourself to someone. You're with them, and what do you first do when you're with them? You watch them, and you listen to them. they act and they talk and you watch and then pretty soon you are invited to perhaps begin to do little things that help them do what they're doing and then what's the next stage? you do it, right? you do it so now before McDonald's children learned to cook by watching their mother. And then mother said, would you help me? At first, I went through this myself, actually. The first thing I got to do was lick the dish. That was not major involvement, but at a certain point, mother says, you fix dinner. And then mother gets to watch. Isn't that right? And same way with fathers working on cars when cars used to be something fathers could work on. You know what I mean. Now they don't even have carburetors. What kind of a car doesn't have a carburetor? But, see, that's the natural process of learning, isn't it? and that's apprenticeship now think about you know the gospels I know you know the bible stories well and that so I can move quickly and just say remember that's what happened with Jesus they came they watched they listened, they asked questions and then one day Jesus said to them what? you go do it he gave them dunamis and ecousia power and authority authority means you have the right now to do it dunamis means you have the power to do it he gave them those two things you read the gospel of Luke and he sent them out and they were to preach the kingdom announce the kingdom and that by the way is still the fundamental issue and then they were to manifest it by doing what he did, casting out demons and healing and so on. And they came back walking on air, just like an apprentice who actually manages to cook dinner without ruining it. They came back walking on air. They said, the demons are subject to us through your name. See, that's the kingdom authority structure of the kingdom. The demons are subject to us through their name. now of course the part that was most important was not demons being subject to the name and Jesus was very clear about that all along in that passage he said don't get all worked up about this just be happy that your name is written in the book of those who are alive in the kingdom and that's the real stuff see that's the big miracle the big miracle is not legs growing or dead raising that's the sort of stuff that you can get channel 7 to come down and photograph you for the big stuff is when you come to actually trust God and begin to take on his character and when you begin to trust him and take on his character then everything begins to shift people talk about spiritual warfare the mightiest blow you can strike in spiritual warfare is to obey Jesus you want to put the devil on the run just do that he'll run, you don't have to encant over him and it might get you in trouble if you did listen to these words from Colossians Paul is saying verse 9 of chapter 1 for this reason also since the day we heard of it we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with all the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God. Now verse 11 is interesting. Strengthened with all power according to his glorious might, that you might raise the dead, and chase the devil, and heal the sick. That isn't what it says. here's what it says strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience that's the big miracle joyously giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light that's Colossians 1 11 and 12 so when Jesus gets down to the end of the Sermon on the Mount. He says, in the last day there are many people going to say, we came, we prophesied, we cast out demons, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he's going to say, I don't know you. Why? Knowing him is a matter of learning how to do all the things he talked about in the Sermon on the Mount from Matthew 5 to the end of chapter 7. All those things, not once did he mention signs and wonders. It takes greater power to become Christ-like and naturally manifest the deeds of Christ than it does to raise the dead. And our failure to understand that is the real lack of understanding of the kingdom of God. So as a disciple of Jesus, I'm learning from him how to lead my life as he would lead my life if he were I. My consciously chosen aim is to learn this and I am constantly arranging and rearranging my affairs to realize this goal. See, it's an ongoing process. When I sign on, I really don't know what it involves. Isn't that true of all of the main decisions of life? I mean, when you had a baby, did you know what it was going to involve? When you got married and said all those wonderful things? Did you know what it was going to involve? Thank God you didn't. Right? I mean if you had you probably wouldn't have done it. But it's a good thing. That's why marriage is a sacrament. That's why family is a sacrament. The only true family is God's family. That's why Paul says in Ephesians that all fatherhood is named with reference to God's fatherhood. life in a family that goes well is a miracle it's a miracle so I'm learning and I'm a slow learner and it has taken me years and years to begin to understand what my relationship should be to my wife and children and I hurt them in many ways because I didn't understand it I was full of my own ideas and rightness and all of that. But I didn't understand simple things. And that failure is the kind of failure that causes our families to fall apart, our ministries to fall apart. Just before I left, I got word that another minister in the neighborhood, something so awful had happened that the person who told me couldn't tell me what it was. so you have so often you have these ministers who are running on fumes and they begin to rationalize themselves you know I suffer so much I'm so tired I try so hard I'm so empty I need something and then they go for the wrong thing so see that's a part of this learning process now. And that's, so, can that begin as a statement about disciples? See, I'm, as a disciple, I'm learning from Jesus how to lead my life as he would lead my life if he were I. I'm not learning how to lead his life. He's already led his life. And he actually doesn't need any help from me on that point. but I need help from him so I'm learning how to lead my life as he would lead my life if he were I the question always comes up at this point could Jesus be a woman? how would he know to lead a woman's life? the two main aspects of disciples yes the two main aspects of discipleship are learning to do as he did and taught now we quickly identify with that that part of it so bless those who curse you he blessed those who cursed you cursed him and he teaches us how to do that we can learn how to do that so I'm learning if you wish these are the things that are in the gospels that are in the letters that are in the New Testament. I'm learning those. So when Paul says that we should put off the old man and his deeds, lie not one to another, put off also all of these anger, malice, blasphemy, wrath, filthy communication out of your mouth, lie not one to another, seeing you put off the old man and his deeds, put on the new man that is renewed in knowledge after the likeness of him that created him in which there's no Greek nor Jew, no circumcision, no uncircumcision in other words lay down all human distinctions before God and know only Christ but only Christ who is in all, fills all therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved put on bowels of mercies kindness, humbleness of mind meekness, long suffering see that's what I'm learning bowels means guts guts is where your stuff comes from that's where the so put on new in Missouri we used to say innards put on new innards now when you put on the new innards then the outards are different so now when you get punched something different comes out blessing instead of cursing kindness instead of anger so here's the great prayer of St. Francis Lord make me an instrument of thy peace where there is hatred let me sow love where there is injury pardon where there is doubt faith where there is despair hope where there is darkness, light, where there is sadness, joy. Divine Master, grant me that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love, for it is in giving that we receive, it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, it is in dying that we're born to eternal life. I see you can read that legalistic reading. I must remember when someone hates me, to love them. That's the legalistic reading of the prayer. God helped me to do that. The Christ-like spiritual transformation reading of the prayer is make me the kind of person who is filled with love so that when hatred punches me there isn't anything to come out but love. That way I don't have to keep a little sign that says, now when they hate you, love them. And then learning to handle the ordinary events of daily life within the principles and power of God's rule. Business, committee meetings, and so forth. Family life. My feelings about my masculinity and my sexuality. My attractiveness or unattractiveness. My success or lack of success. Deciding what I should do with a particular course. that I teach. How would Jesus do that? That's where we have to take him into our full life, and that's where that wording, I'm learning from Jesus how to lead my life as he would lead my life if he were I. How would Jesus do what I do? Be who I am. That's what I have to learn. How would he teach a course in the history of modern philosophy? Now, I often say things like this to Christian faculty and Christian institutions. They look at me like I'm crazy, like he wouldn't be caught dead teaching that course. Listen, if I don't think he could teach that course, and that he would teach it as God wanted him to teach it, then I can't be his disciple as a teacher of philosophy. If I'm going to be his disciple in teaching modern philosophy, I have to believe that he knows how to do it. Isn't that right? So now you see, this brings us really to this old question. Who do people say that the Son of Man is? And all of a sudden, you know, it really begins to grip your heart. This business of trusting Jesus is huge stuff. How would Jesus fix automobiles? How would Jesus be a computer programmer? How would Jesus pastor a church? That's where the second part comes in, okay? Because we can't just think about it as religious stuff. We have to tie it into life. And so the place of discipleship where we really find the kingdom of God is in the all things of daily life. whatsoever you do in word or deed again. I mean, that verse is central, and then you can compare it to a similar passage in Deuteronomy 30. Daily life. This is where I know the kingdom of God. This is where I am a discipleship. What else? This is where I live. Right? What can discipleship possibly mean if it omits most of my life? So it's got to cover my family, my playmates, my job, my neighbors. This is whole life. And now this is not bad news, this is good news. This means I can take my whole life into the kingdom of God. And I can see the hand of God acting in all of these places because I am living, acting with him. I'll give you a verse from Romans 8. His spirit bears witness with our spirits that we are children of God. How does that work? How does his spirit bear witness with our spirit that we are children? You know, many people I think have an image of him sort of whispering in our ear, you're a child of God. You know, you study that passage carefully. His witness bears witness with our spirit that we're children of God because He acts with us. When we act, more is acting than us. And that's really the great challenge, dear friends, for all of our work as ministers, is to do what we do as ministers and as human beings. Ministers are, after all, human beings. To do that with the expectation of seeing the hand of God move with us. so that everything we undertake, we don't undertake on the assumption that we can do it, that we can make it happen. We undertake on the assumption that if God doesn't act with us, we're dead in the water. And that is the place that we come to know. That is how his spirit bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. So the redemptive community, we think of the visible church, is not our life, but fits and maintains us for life. So then you, as a minister in the redemptive community, that's what you're doing. You are enabling people, you're helping people to live in the kingdom of God. And you point them to the resources. And basically that's the idea of pastoring. The pastor is not one who sort of lies down and says to the sheep, now nibble off of me. You know, great to me. the pastor is the one who leads the sheep to the resources and then turns them loose that's pastoring and all of us as ministers are involved in that we're bringing people to the resources and that is what we do when we follow through with the great commission we enable people to be disciples you know Jesus is now in town and he is taking students in the master class of life and you can be one of those students how do you make a disciple? you ravish them with the kingdom of God you help them realize this is the greatest opportunity they will ever have in life and you present the kingdom and you present the king, Jesus in a way that they say I have got to have this yes don't you play? don't you? well because I know that this is a very large part of life and when I chose it really because of that reason and I'm thinking of children is children playmates are very big for children and hopefully we never outgrow that many of us sort of do but the playmates are very important and as ministers one of the most important things about us is do we play and with whom do we play now of course Jesus never played right I mean, he wouldn't be doing things like that. No, never. So you see, if we accept that, then we're going to have a hard time including him in this. So I pretty constantly try to work on our image of Jesus, of what he's like. And playing, I want to conclude today talking more about the personal life of the minister. And this is extremely important to include that. yes, well, let me just put up one more screen and we'll break here there's an old prayer that was inscribed on the walls of Coventry Cathedral, which was built in 1043 destroyed in 1940 and now this, you see begins to bring us into the sort of full life picture that we want to represent in ourselves and in those we minister to. So this says, Hallowed be thy name in industry. God be in my hands and in my making. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of thy glory. Hallowed be thy name in the arts. God be in my sense and in my creating. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of thy glory. See, if heaven and earth are full of his glory, then it ought to be in the arts, which are in heaven and earth, just like industry. Hallowed be thy name in commerce. God be at my desk and in my trading. Obviously in old fashion. Now we'd say God be in my computer, which we might be praying for more reasons than one. hallowed be thy name in government God be in my plans and in my deciding government, the old language of government didn't just refer to what we call government but to all forms of administration God be in education hallowed be thy name in education God be in my mind and in my growing hallowed be thy name in the home okay that's okay that's a sign we should quit thank you God be in my home God be in my heart in my loving I especially like this one it's such a tender statement and what the home should be like so hallowed be thy name hallowed be thy name and the disciplines now come in as ways of bringing this all to pass you know what let me say just in in concluding then this period that our our objectives in ministry are to bring people to Christ and to bring them to the fullness of Christ. And to do this we must tell them about the kingdom of God and about Jesus as the door and as the king and help them to understand how great he is. And then we must be able to give them good instructions on how they can enter the kingdom. and how they can, after they enter it, keep growing in it. So I often say the aim of the church is to save the lost and grow the saved. Save the lost and grow the saved. And these are two parts of one thing, which is the life of God through Christ in our souls. Now, let's take a break. Thank you. Thank you.
