My little definition of redemptive community, a divinely inspired, unexpected fusion of cultures, classes, and circumstances brought together by God's Spirit to mirror and bring God's coming future to the world. And if you want to see our flash animation, let me give you our church website. It's EBCLA, Evergreen Baptist Church Los Angeles, ebcla.org. And as soon as you open it up, it'll load in about 20 seconds. And you'll see this like minute and a half little flash animation that captures our building redemptive community in a metaphoric way. All right. Let's go back to where we started. Genesis 128 is to review God's plan for the human race, is what is called by some the cultural mandate. God blessed them, it says in 128, prosper, reproduce, fill earth, take charge. And I'm now quoting from this book that just came out. This is a great book, The Heart of Racial Justice. The Heart of Racial Justice. This is by Dr. Brenda Salter McNeil and Rick Richardson, John Perkins wrote the foreword, and this really gives a great biblical picture of racial justice and how this is the heart of God. And this is what they say here. To fulfill this cultural mandate, humans had to multiply and form kinship groups. These emerging kinship groupings as they spread created culture in response to many different environments. As human beings spread and diversified, ethnic differences also emerged. Now, I put in ethnic in those brackets. They said racial. And this is where I was telling, I know Brenda. And I was like, see, that language is now cumbersome. These ethnic differences were part of God's intention from the beginning, intended to be a part of the beauty and variety of the image of God on the earth. God has always had a great purpose for our ethnic and cultural diversity, He did not suggest the cultural enterprise. He commanded it. Now, this is kind of a response to some of the earlier questions that we were talking about. Cultural diversity was part of this cultural mandate that God actually commanded us to fill the earth and prosper. And part of that was to form all these groupings and these different places and the cultures would emerge. And so according to this view, the cultural mandate, it was cultures are God's intention. The diversity that we have is God's intention. so I thought I'd kind of sum up God's plan for the human race on the next slide by taking you very quickly through this to see how we end up in redemptive community so first of all the Lord God created one human race that's what we talked about this morning Genesis 2 and then he commanded that race to multiply and diversify we just talked about that then he defeated the rebellion against the cultural mandate which was what that was the Tower of Babel right Genesis 11 so here you have this group of people saying, we're not going to do that. We're actually ethnocentric already. We just, we like being this one people. And God is saying, no, the whole point of the cultural mandate is to point to my own diversity, that I'm not limited to anybody's one culture. I'm bigger than that. So you guys are rebelling against me. So God defeated that rebellion by confusing and scattering everyone. And thus, according to this theory, continuing the cultural mandate. So he's saying, you're not going to thwart me by your own pride and your own disobedience. My will is going to be done. I want to see this cultural mandate take place. And then really fast forward to Pentecost, Acts 2. The Holy Spirit of God affirms people's ethnic and cultural identities while uniting them by giving them a new transcendent identity as members of Christ's redemptive community. Remember that? They heard the gospel in their own language. And it was like Parthians and Medes and all this kind of stuff. And I think that was very symbolic. And they talk about this in this book, how if you're part of majority culture, you miss that, that that's going on at Pentecost. But when you're really, you have the lens to see that, you say, well, that was really cool. Like God enabled these people to hear the gospel in their native language. They didn't all have to be kind of vanilla, that God already was affirming this diversity. And at the same time, giving them a new transcendent identity that still brought them all together. That's another one of those paradoxes where I think if you just take one end or the other, you miss the whole. So you can emphasize just hearing things in your own language, your own culture. You can overemphasize that and never come back together. Or you can overemphasize our unity, and you miss the work that has to be done in hearing God's voice in your own language. One of the comments I used to make when we have board meetings with InterVarsity is, InterVarsity, if you're not familiar with it, InterVarsity has two sub-movements. One is biblical reconciliation. And so on those campuses like UCLA and USC, they don't have ethnic chapters. They have multi-ethnic chapters. And that's a high, high value for them. That's why they end up coming to our church because they hear us talking the same language. Sometimes on the same campus, they also have a black student InterVarsity chapter and an Asian American student InterVarsity chapter and a Hispanic InterVarsity chapter. And the students get all confused. And so the ones going to the multi-ethnic chapter go, well, how come they're doing that? Right? I mean, shouldn't we all be one chapter? Doesn't it sound like what's going on in Northwestern? Right? And then the other students go, well, we don't want to go to that chapter because we disappear at that big multi-ethnic chapter. And in this setting, we actually feel like more comfortable. And I said, you know what? We're actually not helping these students because we don't even have one staff team on UCLA. We have two. There's the ethnic chapters and there's the multi-ethnic chapters. We need to model for the students that this is one team coming from InterVarsity. We have the need for people to break out at times and to hear the gospel in their own language. But it's with the understanding of coming back together. They always promise to do that, but they never do. To come back together. And I said, look, the local church is a great model of this. We have a junior high group. Your church have a junior high group? Thank God they have their own fellowship. right i mean they need to be exercised of all kinds of pre-adolescent demons and all that kind of stuff like that but but never once not once i bet not just in our church but not in your churches never once does a junior high leadership or the junior high students think that they're an entity unto themselves that they understand that they need to be with other junior hires for some of the time because junior hires have particular needs, okay? But they also need to be mainstreamed and say, but you're part of the church, okay? The junior high group is not the church. The junior high group is a portion of this wonderful, diverse family called the church. And so I said, look, the local church already has this model going on. We need to actually carry this model out into other places, okay? And finally, Galatians 2. They're common in Galatians 2. In the kingdom, there is no longer Jew or Greek, male and female, or any other dividing distinctions. Now get this, but not because those aspects of our personhood are erased. Instead, they are deepened and transcended. We become more than male and female, more than our ethnicity, culture, or nationality, nevertheless. Isn't that powerful? Because I think sometimes in the name of Christian unity and even building redemptive community, people are saying, well, you need to leave your culture and your ethnicity at home. Okay? Don't bring it because it's not welcome here. We don't have any culture but Christian. And that only makes sense to people who are in the majority. Because if you're in the minority, you go, no, there's definitely an Asian feel here, you know? Or there's a college-educated feel here. So don't tell me it's just Christian. Help us bring this all together in a new way. That's that fusion thing, okay? All right. Now, previewing God's coming future. Any Star Trek fans here? This is the original Star Trek, when Captain Kirk was skinny. And Scotty could actually fit in the engineering compartment. They sure blimped out over time, didn't they? Boy, I tell you. I love these old shows about the future because one of the things that they always say is it's going to be a diverse future. Our daughter is six years old. She's grown up watching Barney and Dora the Explorer and Bear in the Big Blue House. I mean, every one of these shows, there's a multi-ethnic cast. There's multi-ethnic characters. I mean, for many of the young people growing up, diversity is normal. It starts off normal. And for those of us who are fascinated with Star Wars and Star Trek and all that, I mean, Klingons and all those other people, they're all coming together. So we're surrounded by pictures of the future that are diverse, and yet we don't need to go to science fiction. We can go to God's word and see a picture of his future that is more incredibly diverse than even we see in these fantasy things. Revelation 7, verses 9 to 10, very popular passage. After this, I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count from every nation, tribe, people, and language. standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands, and they cried out in a loud voice, Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb. Amen? Okay, now, here's the point. How do you interpret this passage? Now, if you go to Bible college or seminary, you learn a very fancy Greek-based word called hermeneutics. Seminary was the first Christian school I ever went to, So I didn't know a lot of this language already. I remember when they said hermeneutics, I go, I know Herman Munster. But who's this hermeneutic, you know? I was like, what the heck is that? And it's like, well, hermeneutics is just a fancy way of saying it's how you interpret the Bible, okay? And let me suggest to you that even though most every Christian would look at Revelation 7, 9 through 10 and go, Amen, brother, that's God's future, depending on the hermeneutic you use determines what you do about it today. okay there are two schools of hermeneutics here the first one is called static hermeneutics okay static hermeneutics static is from status quo okay this is how static hermeneutics works you say yep that's coming that's what God's going to do when Jesus comes a second time he's going to change everything he's going to have a new heaven and new earth but between now and when he comes nothing changes okay so if our church started as an ethnically specific church with only one language if our church started with a demographically certain kind of slice of American society, depending on the region we're in, then pretty much that's supposed to stay absolutely the same until Jesus comes again, and then it's all going to be different. So I believe it's all going to change, and it's all going to be diverse and multi-ethnic and multicultural and representative of every person all around the world, but not now. And so I could be cool with just basically status quo until Jesus comes again. So that's static hermeneutic. Redemptive hermeneutic, it's kind of obvious how different it is. It says, now that I know the picture of the future, when Jesus came on earth, what did he announce in the gospel record? The kingdom has begun to come in me. Even in Christian colleges, let alone Christian churches, we don't hear the kingdom of God preached. We don't hear the kingdom of God preached, and yet that was what Jesus was all about. And he says, you don't have to wait for it to start coming. I'm here now. Messiah has arrived. And so the redemptive purpose of God is more obvious because the Savior has actually come to the earth. So guess what, folks? If you use a redemptive hermeneutic, then you say, not only do I believe this is going to happen someday, I believe because God has established his body on the earth, the church, that the church is the preview of coming attractions. Amen? Okay. But when you use a static hermeneutic, you look at the church never changing, being just as segregated, just as prejudiced, just as set apart. And you don't see any problem with that because you say, well, that's God's job, and he's going to do it when Jesus comes again. And I think in this century, what is happening is secular people are starting to pay attention to what's not happening in our churches. And they say, you guys are so busy patting yourselves on the back of all these good things that you're doing, and I just see you as a country club with religious overtones. I mean, if I was you and I wasn't a Christian, those are the people I would choose to hang out with. Why should God get any credit for that? That's just what people do, right? So it goes back to the man bites dog thing, right? So this is really where I say, it's just like when you go see a movie, and now it's getting worse. Before you see the movie, it's like 20 minutes of trailers, right? But why do they show you those things? This movie's not going to come up for a year. It's to get you excited, right? You just see a taste in the movie. You just see highlights of it, and you say, oh, man, yeah, I can't wait for November. My wife is a huge Lord of the Rings fan. You may hear a Lord of the Rings fan. I mean, the holy reason why she approved us getting a THX 7.1 Surround Sound Home Theater put in our remodel is because I told her, oh, Lord of the Rings is going to be awesome on that, man. It's just going to be you. You cannot believe Lord of the Rings. So my wife was in crisis. We not only have the regular DVD, we have the director's cut. I said, can't you just wait? No, I can't wait. So she was in crisis because the third installment was coming out, Return of the King. It was going to come to the theater. And that week, our schedule was just going to be two-packed, and we couldn't go see it. And so sometimes there's an advantage of being in the pulpit. So I happened to share to our congregation, oh, man. I said, you guys getting excited? This is the week. We've been waiting after seeing all these trailers months and months. It's coming out this week, man. But we can't go. And we were so bummed. So afterwards, this guy comes up to me, and I grew up with him in Sacramento. He's on the Academy, and he votes for the Oscars. I forgot that, right? And he comes up and he goes, hey, you want to see it before it hits the theaters? And I'm like, what? He goes, well, I got all these dates here, and you just tell me. I'll go with you. As long as you come with me, you can see it for free. So we went to the Warner Brothers studio lot. in a state-of-the-art reviewing room with only 200 seats, and there's like 30 of us. Three days before it hit the theaters, and we're the only people in there that aren't industry people. So we're the only people making noise in the movie. For three hours and 15 minutes. It's a long movie. You're like, oh, right. We're just making all this noise. We're completely self-conscious, not even self-conscious. Then everyone runs to the bathroom at the end of the thing because you just, it's been hard. So I'm in the men's room and all these industry people who've only been like, well, see, how did they do that? And what are the production values? And I don't know, the cinematography. They're going, do you believe those two people making all those noises? It's like, God, you know, what a good life. And I turn to them and I say, excuse me, we're the reason why you have jobs. Okay. If we didn't get excited, you wouldn't be working, okay? So get off my case. God has, I mean, so many people, not just Christian people, couldn't wait for the last picture to come out, right? And yet we don't get as excited about the picture that's already been drawn for us in Scripture, right? God has told us, this is not a science fiction thing. This is not some imaginative, some human being. This is from the heart and the mind of God. And the church is supposed to get the rest of the world excited about the coming attraction, okay? So I think it's a really huge adjustment in hermeneutics to say, is this something that's already breaking into the reality now, or is it something that everyone just has to wait for? And I say it's happening now. Now, one of the ways to talk about this is the next slide is jazz fusion. Okay? What you see here is a picture of the Hiroshima Jazz Fusion Group. I don't know out here if you even know who these folks are, but the guy in the front with the dark glasses with the big smile, That's Dan Kromoto, and he's part of our church. He grew up going to our church. And he had such a burden for the Asian American community. He was one of those hippies during the 70s that he decided the Asian American community needs something to give us a soul, and we need music. And so even though he was just this hippie in the park kind of playing flute on his own, he decided to form a jazz band. And it's been going ever since, like 35 years. And I actually had him come to my seminary class at Fuller to lecture because I said, here's a guy, he should have known better. What is he doing forming a band? He can't even play an instrument. But he wanted to bring everybody together. This whole thing of community is really huge for him. And now he's been at the Montrose Jazz Festival. He's played with Miles Davis. I mean, all that stuff. And he knows he's still not a good musician, but he can write music and he has a soul, right? He has a soul. So I asked him, I said, how do you do this, man? You took traditional Japanese instruments. You know what koto is? Koto is a Japanese harp. You kind of lay it down like this and you pluck it. And then taiko is that giant drum that you hit with those big sticks. And I mean, you took traditional Japanese instruments and Japanese scales, like pentatonic tone, which is Asian, and you fused it to American jazz instruments and idioms, and now you play it all over the place. And you have multi-ethnic audiences. I said, how did you do that, man? He says, the first thing we learned is you've got to be down with yourself. He talks like that, right? He says, hey, man, first thing you do, you've got to be down with yourself. I said, what does that mean? He says, man, when you show up with that big drum, you can't be apologizing to people that your drum doesn't look like theirs. You've got to be cool with that because all they care about is can you play that thing. Okay? And so I thought, you know, that's really helpful because I think there is a need for an Asian student group at Northwestern College or at Bethel because if they're learning how to play their drum, okay, Because when you come together for this redemptive community, if everyone's still playing just one culture's instrument, it's the same sound. It's just got different faces playing the instruments. And so he says, but what ends up resulting is when you get all these musicians together and they all have worked on their instruments, it's a new sound. It's a sound that has never happened before. And it's kind of like how I was telling my parents. I said, so what do we call ourselves now? We're not a Chinese family. He said, I don't know. I said, I don't know, but it's new. So that's where at our church we talk about jazz fusion. And the other great thing about the example of jazz is when you're in a jazz combo, people improvise. Ever ministry felt like improvising? All the time, right? He says the thing is only one person can solo at a time. And so it's kind of going back to the pseudo community chaos, emptying. I mean, if everyone had a solo all at the same time, there's no emptying going on. It's cacophony, right? So there's this redemptive community when everyone takes a turn. And when the people who are not soloing are playing softer and in the background, they know that they're making the other person who's soloing sound better and that they're all going to get a turn, even the drummer. I still think drum solo is a kind of a way. But, I mean, everyone gets a turn in this whole metaphor, and I think that's a great way of capturing this. All right, now, I paid $15,000 for this next thing with our consults. I'm going to give it to you for free. You are so lucky coming to this. What does it cost you, 10 bucks? Okay. All right. How do you bring God's coming future into today? I was really stuck. For all the theological training I had gotten in seminary, I had not been trained in how to lead and grow an organization, especially strategically. And so we finally admitted defeat and we called in this Christian strategic planner. And this is one of the first things he taught us. He said, okay, let me teach you about how to think strategically. He says, if you think of quadrant one, quadrant one is where you're not thinking about anything happening and something happens anyway, and you just react to it impulsively. Okay? He says, that's not strategic at all. And I would say, you know what? Churches don't even react. Things are changing in the world all the time, and we make a habit of keeping our heads buried in the sand. Amen? It's just like, you know, maybe we should do something about those hippies. that's like you know calvary chapel did that and uh the rest of us those hippies are yuppies now so you know move on okay so for some of our organizations just reacting would be uh an improvement okay but it's not strategic because you just impulsively react quadrant two is where something happens and instead of reacting impulsively you think first what are some possible responses we can do here, and let's pick from the list our best guess, okay? But that's still not strategic, okay? You're picking from a list, but it's not strategic. Quadrant three is the beginning of strategic thinking. He is, this is where you try to look in your crystal ball and say, what does the future bring you? That was that 2025 question. What is the future going to bring us? How is it going to fundamentally change things like the feminist movement, for instance? How is it fundamentally going to change how we do our ministry, but the problem with that is what? Because once you anticipate it and you come up with a strategy, what's the problem with that? What was that? Okay, unexpected changes. We don't see, we still see through a mirror dimly. We can't see perfectly around that corner, and so we may concoct a plan and start worshiping the plan when in fact the reality doesn't match the plan. And we don't notice because we're still worshiping the plan. Doesn't mean don't plan, but it means don't be married to the plan. You always have to be constantly learning, paying attention. But still, quadrant three doesn't get me excited. Quadrant four, man, it was like a bomb went off. He says quadrant four is when you don't assume that the future is already set and you just have to accept it and deal with it. Quadrant four is where you try to imagine the future that you want to live in, and then you make it that way. You create the future. And he said, a sociologist studied self-perpetuating institutions, and her conclusion was, institutions that continue to go on and on in spite of much discouragement and many hardships, they do it because they treat their vision of the future as fact, not hope. Let me say that one more time. They treat their vision of the future as fact, not hope, even if not one iota of that vision comes true in their lifetime. Their priorities, their orientation, their movement is all oriented towards that. They don't just say, gee, someday we wish this will happen. They're saying, someday this is going to happen, so we better get ready to be like that. Well, when he said this, I was saying, oh my goodness, this is how Christians should think. God has already revealed to us the whole culmination of human history. It's all coming together. We just saw a piece of that in Revelation 7, right? And yet, because we have a static hermeneutic, it doesn't change how we live. We treat it as hope, not fact. So it completely energized me when I said, all right, now I don't have to make up this better future. God's already told me. And it's a redemptive community. And so, therefore, how does that affect our churches, my own personal priorities, because I want to start living and create, bring that future more and more and more into this present. And so then my gospel message is not just a, just wait till someday this all gets better. It's like, you know, if you're experiencing oppression and racism and injustice, you know, maybe right now I can't change everything in society. We're trying to work on some of that stuff too. But if you come to our church, you're going to get a taste of heaven, right? You're going to get a taste where you're not just going to be judged on the color of your skin or whether or not you went to the right school or went to school at all or what kind of car you drive, hopefully more and more Jesus is transforming us so that the things that matter most and will matter in all eternity start to matter most to us here. And it's, you know, really imperfect, but this is how we go. Now, last slide here I want you to look at is based on the model that it's in my book, Pursuing the Pearl, because I thought we do need to talk about this just a little bit. Pursuing our portion of the redemptive journey to heaven is more complicated when you realize that, depending on when you come in the immigration stream to America, you have different sets of requirements and needs. And basically what I want to say today is, Jesus wants faithful, vital churches all along the flow of generations with redemptive hearts. So it doesn't mean everyone can reach the exact same kind of people, but he wants us to be faithful and vital and certainly redemptive. And I came up with this model I call the River Bay Sea Model. I was speaking to a bunch of Korean second generation, 1.5 and 2.0 Korean pastors in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, a number of years ago. And we were getting frustrated with each other. I just felt like they were connecting with what I was saying and they were frustrated with me because I wasn't connecting with them. And so I looked over my shoulder and this is where this model came to me. Because there was these rivers coming down into the estuary that is at Chesapeake Bay. and then it flowed out to the horizon. And I said, hey, you know what? According to Korean counting, I'm 3.0. I said, you guys are 1.5 at best. That means born in Korea, came here. I said, my parents are already 2.0. So even though you and I are the same age, or I might even be older than some of you, as far as generationally, on this flow, I'm much further along. And I said, okay, now here's the easy way to understand this. Every group of significant immigrants to America is like a river of dreamers that came here and started flowing. And I said, typically, when you come here, you think, all right, I'm doing this for the betterment of my future generations. We should all speak the same language. We should only marry the people that are just like us. So they start to build dams on this river. And the church, the immigrant church, serves as a dam, and you form this big lake, you think, behind the dam. You say, there, now my great-grandchildren will speak perfect Spanish. And they'll only come home with Spanish, Mexican boyfriends and girlfriends, and we'll continue to, and it's like, but they underestimate the power of acculturation gravity, and the water finds a way to go around the dam, because the kids have to go to public schools, and pretty soon these kids are out in the bay. I call it the Bay of Transitions, okay, and then their kids end up in the Sea of Inevitability, which is, for those of you who are European-American, you're the byproduct of all of that, many generations of immigration, you know, coming here. So I said, and that's deep water for some of our churches. Well, rivers are freshwater. The bay is usually a mix of fresh and saltwater, and the ocean is all saltwater. And I think the mistake we make is if you're a fish, you should be able to swim in any water. And it's like, no. Okay. And so I think freshwater fish tend, I mean, every fish tends to create the water conditions they need to thrive. So if I'm a freshwater person, I hire a freshwater pastor. Okay. And we have a freshwater culture at our church. Oh, we have salmon kids. Born in the river, but they work in the ocean. And when it's time to spawn, they go back up the river. Okay? And it's like, so what do I do? Oh, we'll have a saltwater aquarium. So here we have this big freshwater lake, and we build this saltwater aquarium, and we hire an English-speaking youth worker. And it's really not to reach the other kids in the neighborhood. It's to keep our kids from leaving our church. Okay? It's babysitting. And it's like after a while, the salmon can't thrive in that saltwater tank. If you've ever had an aquarium, it's like they're limited by the size of the tank. And that's where a lot of our immigrant churches are stuck, is they can't culturally think about cutting that loose. And what I'm saying is we need vital, faithful churches that are building redemptive community all along the flow of this river all the way out to the sea. It's not everybody go to saltwater churches. What's shocking me, as I told you earlier, is I didn't expect freshwater fish to come to the church to thy pastor because I'm a saltwater cod. Some people say shark. Okay? I'm completely baffled that there are freshwater fish in our water because I would think that the conditions I need to thrive and people like me makes it hard for them to thrive. And I'm sure there still are things. But in talking to them, they've told me two things. Number one, if they have children and they were going to an immigrant church, they're saying we can already see our kids are getting disenchanted with this whole church and Christianity thing because it's so wrapped up in immigrant identity. And so we made a big sacrifice to come to this country to begin with. We're going to make another sacrifice, leave the church where I'm an elder, where I'm a known entity, where I'm a somebody, and come to your church and speak broken English and have to kind of start all over again. But we're just happy that our kids are excited about going to church. Now, wow, that's huge. and not most parents are willing to do that. The others are, they're single. They don't even have kids. And they tell me, well, the reason why we're coming to this church, even though we could easily go to an Indonesian church or whatever, is they say, because I don't work in like an Asian-specific work setting. I work at IBM. I work at Boeing. You know, I work at this. And so it actually, I think it's good for me to continue to learn how to flourish in a multicultural sort of situation. And then on top of all that, we've got more and more people saying, it's just what God wants, right? So I choose to be uncomfortable because that's what I signed up for, right? So I don't know if this is a helpful model, but I'm not saying everyone should just all speak English. I think God wants to see vital churches with an eye towards the horizon about what's coming and with the idea that someday everyone is gonna meet in heaven all together, but until we get there, we still have this love for one another. Now, the last slide is a picture of my daughter and this cousin I keep telling you about. Okay? And as far as those two are concerned, they're just family. All right? And I was telling Paul, his biological grandfather is from Nigeria. All right? And so he's from Nigeria. And I said, already, you know, it's just kind of these different connections. But the phrase up there in Japanese is, kodomo no tamani. And what that means is for the sake of the children. All right? And I'm sure that's a value in other cultures. That's huge in Asian culture, that parents are willing to make sacrifices in order for the betterment of their own children. And so when I read, you know, those of you who are sinful, when your child asks you for bread, you wouldn't give them a rock, right? Or if they ask you for a fish, you wouldn't give them a snake. How much more then will your Father in Heaven give to you when you ask for them? I read kodomo no tamani in there, right? That parents will give to their children even at the cost to themselves. And so when I talk to these first-generation parents whose hearts are breaking over the consequences of their choice to come to this country and to see what's rolling out, as I say, you know what? You should always be remembered and blessed for having the courage and the faith to cross that ocean and to come here. I said, we need you to still be pioneers. We need you to still be brave because what's at stake now is your children's future in Christ. They really need to see that you're still willing to, even if it means setting up a new church, maybe like Church of All Nations, and to say even if we don't control it and it becomes something that we wouldn't even feel comfortable going to, if that's growing you in Jesus and bringing glory to God and helping you to bring this kingdom in very tangible and fruitful ways, then we bless that. And if we have facilities, if we have money, because we're older than you, then we give that to you. That's a tough one, boy. That's a real tough one. But I think that kodomo notamini, however you want to say that in your own culture setting, I think it speaks to the heart of so many people where they say, at the end of the day, I love my children, and the best gift I can give to my children is Christ. And that they would flourish in Christ, not just be saved, but they would be saved for God's purposes here on the earth. All right, now that's the end of the presentation. I had some other questions here. I actually wanted to, let's just put them all up there because I actually want to get to number three. Oh, that's kind of funky. Ah, okay. This is another part of what the exercise that the consultant, it talks about the five and four things where you have to go through. In order to do the exercise, this is really cool. He says, again, number one, think so far ahead that it's beyond your time. Okay? Whatever that is. For me, it's 15 years, and I'm 65. Okay? That's kind of scary, I don't know. And he says, okay, so.
