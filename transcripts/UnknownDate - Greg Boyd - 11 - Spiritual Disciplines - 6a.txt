drawn to it and it doesn't seem to energize you and it doesn't do much for you. And therefore you kind of avoid it quite a bit. One of the things that's helpful, it's a traditional Christian practice, is to pray the scriptures. To pray the scriptures. The scriptures are given by God to us. They inform us about what we need to know in our life and for salvation and things of that sort. But we can turn them into a conversation back to God. God gives us his thoughts, and those thoughts can become a launching pad to begin to talk back to God. And many have found it very helpful in having the scriptures come alive to do this, especially through the Psalms, which are often written as prayers. Take the Psalms, read them, read a verse or two verses until you feel in your spirit a time to pause, reflect for a little bit, and then maybe pray it back to God. Allow the Holy Spirit to personalize it for you and make the scripture a prayer. So I'd like to do that. I'm just going to choose for tonight Psalms 91. And we'll read that and then turn it into a prayer. And so though this is a personal prayer of mine, let's make it our prayer together. Lord, help your word to come alive to us your word which is your revelation to us, Lord we want to enter into conversation with you, Lord as we do this, as we pray back to you what you've told us show us insights in our life reveal things in our life that need to be confronted or transformed strengthen us, whatever your will is, Lord let it happen through the vehicle of your inspired word He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. Lord, help us to dwell in You. and to rest in You. Help us to see You, Lord, even now as we pray, as a mighty fortress, which is what You are. You've called us to dwell there, to rest there. We don't need to climb up the walls to get on the inside. We're already there. And Lord, when we dwell there, we're in the shadow of the Almighty. We're in Your shadow. you stand before us you go before us Lord strong and powerful impenetrable and we're in your shadow and nothing can get to us unless it goes through you Lord but nothing can go through you so Lord help us to rest there rest in the security that we have dwelling within you you are a mighty fortress I will say to the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my God in whom I trust. Lord, you are our refuge. The place where we can run when it gets scary, when it gets frightening, when it caves in on us, when people or relationships fail us or when we fail, we can run to you, Lord. The house of refuge. The place where there's no indictment. There's just support. And really, Lord, we have no place else to run. You're our refuge, Lord, and our mighty fortress. Verse 3, Surely He will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you will find refuge. His faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. Lord, give us the sense that a little chick would have being under the wings of its mother. If it's cold out, the wings keep us warm, and when it rains, the wings keep us dry. We're safe there, Lord. Give us that security that you cover us, you shadow us with your wings. And your faithfulness, Lord, is our shield. And it's our weaponry. You're true to your word. You're true to your promises, Lord. And God, help us to stand on that. Let that be our strength. Let that be our confidence. That whatever else may fail us, God, in life, whatever we may fail, we've got you as a shield. You as our protector. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday. Lord, your word says here that we won't fear. There's a lot of things in the world that we could fear. the one who stalks at night, the arrows that fly. Lord, your word tells us that the enemy is constantly against us, setting himself up against us, seeking to destroy us, seeking to devour whomever he can. And even now, Lord, right at this minute as we pray, there are perhaps in our life strongholds that the enemy has on us and uses to condemn us, to communicate failure to us, to sabotage our success, to sabotage our relationships, to sabotage our identity. But Lord, you've told us that we don't need to fear that. Not because we're so strong, but because we're very weak. But because we dwell in the shelter of the Almighty, Lord. We dwell in you. And so we don't need to fear, Lord. Help us to see you as our security. Help us to see you as our peace. Help us to see you as our strength, God. That the enemy and all that the enemy might use against us is impotent against that, and we don't need to fear that. Even if our life were to be taken, Lord, we'd have nothing to fear, because even death can't take us out of you, our mighty fortress. A thousand may fall on your right side, ten thousand on your right hand, but it will not come near to you. if you make the most high your dwelling even the Lord who is my refuge then no harm will befall you no disaster will come near your tent Lord I'm not sure how that applied to David but I know how it can apply to us Lord when all around us might be crumbling Lord I suspect there may be someone here tonight for whom that's true financially maybe it's crumbling and the future looks very bleak and there's uncertainty all around them and maybe even those who they look to they looked up to as spiritual guides have fallen on the right side but Lord help them and help me to trust in you and to see you as our strength and our source and our comfort. It can be found in no person. It can be found in no theology. It can be found in no church. It can be found in no institution. It can only be found in you. The kind of security we need is only found in you. Be with us, Lord God, during this time of teaching and apply it to our hearts, God. transform us Lord by your spirit we pray in your name Amen that's one way to just talk through the scriptures to pray them back to God a lot of times it's just like in a conversation when you get in a conversation with somebody you say something and they say something back they respond and you respond to their response and they respond to your response to their response and it goes on and on and as you talk things become clarified maybe what they said the first time Or, you know, it wasn't all that clear. You thought it was clear, but something else about them is revealed. It's a conversation when it's genuine is a self-disclosive process. It's a self-disclosive process. It's really the essence of all relationships. So also our relationship with the Lord is essentially conversation. It's essentially conversation. And that's what prayer is. And so to take God's communication to us and now speak it back. That itself can reveal new things about what he originally said. It can apply it personally to your life. Different things can be highlighted that weren't highlighted before. And God's word comes alive in our life. Okay. I want to cover a variety of things tonight. And we have very little time to do it. Typically, this is not at all unusual for me. We have one class left to go and we're about halfway through. And that's pretty normal. and typically I try to cover the whole last half in the last session. So have your pen ready and your wrists all warmed up. Did we cover intercessory prayer last week? I don't remember. Okay, this is all the farther we got and we have even more to do than I thought. Okay, Bible people, where are some Bible readers? You're a Bible reader. Would you read Exodus 28, verse 12 and verses 29 through 30 and verse 38. Yes, 28-12, 28-29-30, and 28-38. Also, I need another Bible reader. Can I get a witness? Okay, would you read Ezekiel 22, 28-30? I think I'll leave it at that. I'll just abbreviate some verses. Okay, we're going to talk about intercessory prayer, and then we're going to talk about spiritual warfare, which is one form of intercessory prayer. What intercessory prayer is most fundamentally about? It's about bearing another's burden in prayer. It's about standing in the gap for a person, lifting their load by praying for them, and interceding on their behalf. A good model of this is Aaron, who was the priest of Israel. What does the scripture say about Aaron in Exodus 28? Read 11 and 12. okay well what Aaron was supposed to do was to take he had to have these two large stones that he would carry on his shoulders they'd harness them on his shoulders and then they'd inscribe in a filigree setting and now I know what that means the names of the children of Israel and he was to when he went into the holy of holies to pray for Israel to keep these on his shoulders there's the symbolism there of bearing the burden of Israel I mean these things would be heavy but Aaron was to carry those when he went into the Holy of Holies okay what does verse 29-30 say okay some of that applies to us some of it doesn't but the part that applies to us is that these breastplates and I think this is kind of symbolic were to be over his heart and also over his heart was to be the Urim and Thummim which was the means that the Israelites for a certain period of time and we don't know a whole lot about this, but the means by which they would discern the will of the Lord. The point here is that to be an intercessor on behalf of another is a ministry, and it's work. It's entering into their burden. It's empathizing with their situation and taking it upon yourself and praying on their behalf. As you see throughout Scripture, and we're not going to look at a whole lot of Scripture here, but just enough to show this, this is an extremely important, vital, and urgent area of ministry. Ezekiel 22, 28-30 Okay, here's this concept and I really like this concept of standing in the gap it's like standing in the trenches what the Lord was looking for here was somebody to intercede on behalf of Israel someone to pray on behalf of Israel to stand in the gap, to set up the wall and none was found the implication of it is that the course of action that God took might have been different had there been someone to stand in the gap when we pray and when we intercede on behalf of others things are at stake things are at stake i'll say i'll say more about that in a second in first samuel 12 20 through 25 samuel sort of chastises israel for some of its uh doings and its waywardness and unfaithfulness but then in verse 23 samuel says this nevertheless i will not sin by ceasing to intercede for you by ceasing to pray on your behalf. As far as Samuel was concerned, it was the sin of omission to not pray on behalf of Israel. It'd be like seeing someone in need and not helping them out. Someone's going to hit by a car, but you don't warn them about it so they get hit by a car. That's what's sometimes called the sin of omission. Samuel took intercessory prayer so seriously that to not do it, he saw, was sin. The Lord tells us something about the urgency of intercessory prayer. In Luke, chapter 18, 1 through 5. I know all of you can't see that, but that's that. Here's the parable the Lord tells about the woman who needed her case to be heard by this unjust judge who feared neither God nor man. The unjust judge didn't care or rip about her. But she went and she would knock on his door continually, persistently, night and day, Until finally the unjust judge gets sick of her, gets tired of her, and says, okay, fine, have it your way, and then here's her case. The Lord says that's how you ought to pray. That's the kind of persistence we need to have in prayer. Bombard heaven. Knock on the door night and day. There's an urgency to it. Don't give up. Persist in it. He says a similar thing in Luke 11, verses 5 through 13, where he talks about the person who was having friends over and didn't have any bread. I think it was a widow who didn't have any bread. And so she goes over to a friend's house in the middle of the night and says, give me some bread. And Jesus said, the person wouldn't get out of bed. The person would respond by saying, hey, I'm sleeping, and my kids are all asleep. Leave us alone. But he wouldn't do it because she was a friend. But because she was persistent, he would say, good. Take the bread and get out of my hair. It's kind of God's, Jesus isn't saying, the point of the parable isn't to say that this is what God is like. Like you've got to nag him and nag him and nag him to get things done. But he's telling us something about the urgency of intercessory prayer in our life, the role that intercessory prayer can have and should have in our life. The way the Lord set things up, and this is a pattern you see throughout Scripture, the way the Lord set things up is that he wants to have interaction with us. He wants us to be persons with whom he interacts, and that we would grow spiritually by the interaction. And so the Lord, in his wisdom and his counsel, sets things up such that there are certain things that will not get done that perhaps he would like to do, but he won't do unless we intercede for them, unless we talk to him about it. That's one way of encouraging discussion. It's one way of empowering us. We know this at a physical level. We've got free will. We have the power to love one another, and therefore we have the power to inflict pain on one another. God gives us that authority. And right now, if I wanted to, I really think it's in my ontological power to haul off and smack you in the face. And that wouldn't be God's will, but I'm empowered to do that. Because I'm also empowered to love you. And one entails the other. To be a person is to have say-so in the way things go, to be able to influence one another for better or for worse. Prayer is the spiritual side of that principle. Prayer is our say-so. He ordains that there are certain things that will not get done unless we intercede for them, on behalf of them. I sometimes think of it as a bank account. The Lord sets aside, there are certain things He's going to do whether anyone prays or not. He's God. He can decide that. But in His wisdom, He sets aside, this is an analogy now, like a reservoir power. It's like a bank account. And we're the ones who write the check. And prayer is the way we write those checks. So when God says, when God says, you need to pray, you need to intercede, He means it. One of the things that I used to be bothered by and it hindered my prayer life was just the idea of why, it seems like a futile thing, like I'm just going through the motion. It's like being on a rubber stamp committee. What's that called, pro forma or whatever? Well, no matter what you say, it's going to happen a certain way anyways. And I used to have that kind of thinking about God, like what really hangs on prayer? What difference does it really make? What urgency is there to it? Whatever God's going to do, he's going to do anyways. And so the outcome is kind of settled. And so, yeah, I'll pray because I know I'm supposed to pray. But there's no passion to it. There's no fervency to it. There's no urgency to it. The way the Bible talks, though, is that things do hang on prayer. Someone does need to stand in the gap. That's part of our responsibility to one another, and it's part of our growing relationship with the Lord. There is a certain urgency that attaches to prayer. Throughout church history, the church has always taken intercessory prayer very seriously. One of the roles of monasteries in the Middle Ages was to be prayer fortresses. The church knew that there was a warfare going on, that there was an enemy to fight against, that there was a lot of work that needed to get done, and the church knew in the Middle Ages something which we kind of forget today, And that is that prayer accomplishes more in terms of deciding the outcome of the world than anything you could ever do physically. What happens on a spiritual level is far more significant than what happens on a strictly physical level. And so they had professional prayers. Not that that's the way to go, not that we should have monasteries today, but there's a principle there that is really a good one to have. Prayer changes things. One of the things I like to do when I, you know, I sometimes do interim pastorates. One of the first things I like to do is when I go into a church is get all the senior citizens. And they always feel useless in a church. There's nothing I can really do, you know. My ministry is over with. And what I try to do is convince them that that's not at all the case. You're the monks of the modern church. I want to give you a commitment. You've got more time on your hands than the rest of us do. You're retired. You've got some time there. I want to give you the most important ministry of the church. and that is to be interceding on behalf of this church, be praying for the ministry, be praying for the needs of the people. It really is the most vital of all the ministries. Here's a rather cruel thing that the church sometimes did, but there was a good principle behind it, even though the outcome was pretty ludicrous. But when they would build these cathedrals, maybe some of you have seen this over in England, but when they build these large cathedrals, next to the altar, sometimes there's this little room. I forget what it's called. There's a technical name for it. But there's this little room, and it's all boxed in. Has anyone here ever seen that? Okay. Well, what they would do in building the cathedral is they'd build a special room where there'd be a person, usually a young person, 10, 12 years old, that they would box in this room. And their entire life would be spent in that room. This is cruel. In total darkness. and they would just feed them their food through this thing, and I don't know how they took care of other necessities. They must have had something going on. Their whole life was to pray for this church, especially for what went on behind the altar, to intercede and to fight the devil. And there's some wild stories about how they used to fight the devil in these little conclaves that they used to have. I think that's pretty cruel. I don't think that's the way to go. I wouldn't advise that for any church. Yeah, box your kids, wall your kids in with bricks, and then they'll pray. We'll teach them how to pray. but the principle there shows you how seriously it took prayer prayer really changes things it's important it's vital the demise today yeah we've seen this before i've talked about it before and that is this that uh in our culture and with our mentality we live in the in the we're heirs of the scientific revolution we're heirs of a materialistic worldview we're heirs of the enlightenment, which tell us that what's important, what works, is what's physical. Cause and effect. The world operates by material causation. And so what's really important, what's brought us all to change in the world, is what we do physically, our experimentation, what you can test, etc., etc. Now that mentality infiltrates our mind. And to the degree that it infiltrates our mind, we, though we don't think this consciously, we begin to assume that prayer just is not important. Prayer just does not matter that much. What matters is what we do with our physical lives. What changes the world is what we can do with our bodies. And consequently, prayer gets put at the bottom of a priority list. Or what sometimes happens today is intercessory prayer becomes trivialized, where it's a matter of writing down a bunch of names and just reading through them and we pray for susie joe bertha eunice and we go through the whole list um that's what we're up against that's what we're up against and i see that for all the advantages all the wonderful things that the scientific revolution has brought us all the you know nice technological things as a world view it stinks and i see that as a device of the enemy to just get us to not take prayer seriously and just honestly now ask yourself when you pray does it oftentimes or at least sometimes seem like you're wasting your time? It does, doesn't it? It's like, why am I doing this? There's a hundred other things I could be doing during this half hour, and it seems like a waste of time. That's why, you know, even when we're praying, we're thinking about those other things. It's because the mindset that we have, deriving largely from the culture that we're a part of, says that just sitting down by our couch or kneeling by our couch is a waste of time. You're talking to the ceiling. This doesn't really change anything, and if you have a theology on top of it, which says that God's going to do what he's going to do whether or not you pray, and there's no urgency to it, well, that just compounds the problem. And so we get kind of lax about the whole thing. Okay, what can we do to help this situation? To begin to become intercessors. A couple of just helpful hints here. Number one is to remind yourself of the urgency of the situation. Remind yourself of the urgency of the situation. Keep that in your mind. Remember the parables of Jesus. Remember the many, many, many exhortations, excuse me, the exhortations in Scripture to pray, to intercede on behalf of others. There's an urgency that attaches to it. Where I really began to cut loose on this was several years ago when I kept on waking up in the middle of the night. And I just went through this period where I would wake up almost on the dime at like around 2 o'clock, and I couldn't get back to sleep. And I just thought it was like a weird case of insomnia. I couldn't figure it out. And I began to just sort of pray to get back to sleep. I always get tired when I pray, so I'll just pray. Mr. Spirituality here. And what I gradually, ever so gradually got to learn was that maybe the reason why God was waking me up in the first place was to pray. Was because he needed me, he wanted me anyway to intercede. And that's where I began to really work through my whole thinking on this thing. Because my assumption was that nothing is so important to get someone out of bed at 2 in the morning for. especially when you can do it yourself and you're going to do it yourself anyways i mean i really got to the point where i thought why do you pray for people to be saved uh either god's if their hearts open god's going to save them and if it's not god's not going to save them so what could this prayer do or why do you pray for this person that if they're going to die they're going to die god's in control of everything and that just completely undermines the urgency of prayer it was during these these uh we are the morning sessions i'd have with the lord that i really began to see that that no no greg something hangs on this i've orchestrated things such that, in the same way I might need you to rescue someone from a car that's going to hit them, and I really expect you to jump in front of there and save that person, so also I've orchestrated things that I need you to pray. Yeah, I could do it on my own, but I've orchestrated things such that I won't do it on my own unless you stand in the gap. And there's a real urgency to that. I don't know how much could depend on it. You don't know either. Lives, perhaps, it doesn't, that's not beyond the realm of possibility. Our lives depend on what we do with each other. Whether I decide to kill you or not, whether I decide to drive when I'm drunk, your life could depend on that. Our lives depend on moral decisions all the time. So maybe when you get up at 2 in the morning, someone's life depends on it. I don't know. I'm just throwing that out there. There's an urgency that attaches to that. I also had, and this is a little pithy saying or pithy story, but I remember asking the question, I don't know why, this sounds like the kind of question John would have asked, you know, who will be greatest in the kingdom of God? But I ask the question, I at least thought of this, I was pondering it, when we get to heaven, who will we see that has done the most for the kingdom of God? In terms of advancing the kingdom of God, in terms of invading the kingdom of darkness, who will have accomplished the most? Will it be a Billy Graham? Will it be a Billy Sunday or a Jonathan Edwards or a Charles Whitworth? Who will be the trophy case of someone who really advanced the kingdom of God? And the impression I got, and I don't know, this is possible. I don't know if it was right from God, but the impression I got is that it's probably one of those monks in the Middle Ages who spent their whole life praying that no one ever heard about. They were anonymous their whole life. They died in anonymity. But through their prayer, through their intercession, they accomplished more than any of us will ever accomplish by knocking on doors and passing out tracts. Those things are good to do. Do them if you want to do them. But prayer is vital. Charles Stanley said this, and I agree with it, that the enemy would rather have us doing anything rather than praying. If it came down to a cision, I think he'd rather have you reading the Bible, he'd rather have you witnessing, he'd rather have you doing a ton of good works rather than have you praying. Because prayer is what really changes things. Commit to a time of intercession. A lot of times we group prayer together. You know, okay, here's my time of prayer, and that's fine. But what we're seeing is that there's a lot of different kinds of prayer, and you can't do all of them at the same time. It sometimes helps to have a schedule on this stuff. This is part of being disciplined about things. Not that this is the only time that you'll intercede, but to have a time where you're committed to intercede. This is work we're talking about. This is really effort. This is ministry. This is like a Bible study. This is like going to help in a soup line downtown for the poor or whatever. This is a real work. And it's good to have a block of time that you set aside where you are going to now intentionally remember and think of and be open to God telling you other things about those in needs. And you're going to intercede on their behalf. Commit to a time of intercession that's quite distinct from your time of rest, your time of meditation. Be open to the Spirit's promptings. Paul says several places, 1 Corinthians 2 and Romans 8, that frequently when we pray, we don't know how we should pray. We don't know how we should pray. We just feel an urge to pray. Have you felt that sometimes? You just feel kind of a burden to pray, but you don't know how you should pray. That's where Paul says the Spirit intercedes on our behalf. The Spirit knows the mind of God. He is God and can communicate that to us. Sometimes Paul says he intercedes with groanings which are unintelligible, or the Greek phrase there means something like that, groanings which cannot be uttered or something like that. And people debate about what that means. Some think it's speaking in tongues. Some think it's just sort of a sigh, a pain. And that God takes that sigh. You feel the pain of whatever it is you're praying about, but you don't know what it is. But God takes that sigh and translates it to do what he knows needs to be done. Whatever. But we need to pray in the Spirit. The Bible uses that phrase a number of times connected with prayer. To pray in the Spirit. To pray according to the Spirit's promptings. to follow the leadings of the Holy Spirit. And this is very much an intuitive kind of thing, which is why Christians need to cultivate this intuition to listen to God's voice. This is a time to be open to what the Bible calls the word of knowledge or a word of wisdom, to discern what God would have you pray for, what comes to your mind, and just to rest. Say, God, reveal to me what it is I'm to pray for, and to rest and to be open to whatever impressions God gives you. You may not know for certain whether it's from God or not, but intercede on that level. Trust that God will take your prayer if it's misdirected and directed in the right direction. Some people who have the gift of tongues intercede with tongues, and they're the ones who are more inclined to read Romans 8, when Paul says Romans 8, 28, I believe it is, 25 maybe, to that groanings, which cannot be uttered. They interpret that as tongues. But there is a ministry there for those who have that gift to pray in tongues when they don't know how they should pray. Final thing is this. To record the needs that you're praying for, the impressions that you get. This is how faith is built. When you see that it works, faith is really built. But very frequently when we pray, we forget what we pray for, and then when it's fulfilled, we don't see that it's fulfilled, and so God doesn't get glorified for it, and our faith doesn't build. It's good to get into practice of recording what you pray for, recording the needs of people. If you say you're going to pray for a person, write it down. If you make that promise, you should keep it. Record other needs that you want to pray for. Note that you prayed for them. And whatever else comes to you as you're trying to follow the promptings of the Spirit, write those down and pray for them. Be persistent. Be a nagging widow. Be a nagging person who wants to get their case heard by an unjust judge. And then be looking for the answer. James tells us, James chapter 2, that when we pray, we must pray in faith, believing that God hears and answers our prayer. Now sometimes, God does answer our prayer, but there's 10,000 variables out there in the world, so sometimes we can't see that God answers the prayer. But if we're looking for it, maybe we can see it some of the time. to pray believing, knowing that God hears prayer, that God answers prayer, and be looking for it. And when you see it happening, jot that down too. And when you go over a year's worth of that, and you see that half of the things perhaps that you prayed for have actually been answered, man, that energizes your faith. That just really begins to, the stuff actually works. Okay, that's intercessory prayer. Let me turn to spiritual warfare, and then we'll take some questions. Spiritual warfare is simply one aspect of intercessory prayer. It's interceding on behalf of God's people, but intentionally and specifically against the enemy. I don't need to say a whole lot in this context, in this church, about how central this is. It was, of course, central to Jesus' ministry, and it's a central aspect throughout the whole New Testament. The Bible always assumes that we're in a state of war. It assumes that. The Bible always assumes that when you say the word kingdom of God, right around the corner, you can't say that without meaning coming against the kingdom of darkness. There's a warfare going on. Throughout Jesus' ministry, he was confronting demonic forces. In the book of Acts, they frequently confronted demonic forces. And throughout the New Testament, one of the main ways that Paul speaks about believers is that we're soldiers. We're at war. We're an army. In Matthew 16, verses 16 through 19, Jesus says to Peter, Blessed are you, because flesh and blood hasn't revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven, namely about his confession of faith. And then he says, And upon this Petros, upon this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I give unto you the keys to the kingdom of God, so that whatever you bind shall be bound, and whatever you cast out or whatever you loose shall be loosed. The keys to the kingdom of God are about coming against the kingdom of darkness. You can't have one without the other. You just can't make headway with the kingdom of God without confronting the kingdom of darkness. So this is a central aspect of the Christian ministry. This is a central aspect of what we're called to do. It doesn't always, and I don't think it even usually involves Linda Blair type of situations where people are spinning their heads and spitting out green pea soup and things of that sort, though sometimes it entails that. It usually is done in a much more quiet way. It's usually done in the privacy of our own prayer. We're called to be spiritual warriors on our own. I'm going to distinguish between two things here, spiritual warfare in private and then spiritual warfare with a physical confrontation. In private, I forget who it was that said this, but they said prayer isn't preparation for warfare. prayer is spiritual warfare and that's really the truth when we pray at least one form of the prayer can be spiritual warfare couple words here again as I said before learn to listen to the spirit now this is very subjective I know but there just ain't any other way to talk about it in our scientific intellectualistic physical materialistic orientated culture we learn as adults not to trust our intuition. We learn as adults to think that whatever goes on in the mind is our own doing. But to the degree that we believe that, we have just shut down the main way that God talks to his people. And if we're going to hear from God and be directed by God and be moved by God, we need to come against that presupposition which tells us that. It never has been believed by any culture, any people at any time, except in the last 300 years in our culture. that what goes on the mind is simply your own doing it's just just your imagination and any voice you hear any direction you get is just you know something in your own internal being that is as atheistic as saying that everything that happens in the world is the world's own doing you see the two go hand in hand we live this this modern worldview tells us in a closed universe in other words there's no god that breaks in and does miracles no god that breaks in and does anything the mindset of this world is simply another version of that there's nothing that breaks into our mind god doesn't talk to us god doesn't direct us we don't feel things from god we don't get words from god etc etc but that's an atheistic presupposition we'll never be energized as spiritual warriors until we begin to test step out on some of those intuitions we have now i'm not talking about turning into a flake where everything you think has to come from god and everything you feel has to come from God, where you equate your own thought with God's thought. That is flakiness, it's extremism, that's unbiblical, that's as bad as the other extreme. What I'm talking about is cultivating a sensitivity to when God is speaking. And it's not that easy. I haven't perfected this yet, but I find that the more you do it, the better you get at it. You get to be able to discern what's you and what's not you. There's a distinct, my sheep hear my voice, and gradually, we normally can't hear him at all because our own thoughts are, we clutter the frequency with our own thoughts so much. That's a Dave Johnson move, isn't it? I don't want to do anyone. No, no, he does this. That's why he's so cross-eyed. We jam our own frequencies with our own self-talk and we don't hear God. But when we start to be open to it, we begin to be quiet using some of the exercises we talked about before. When it quiet our brain, there's a distinct feel to the directing of the Holy Spirit. When you have a burden in your heart, first of all, discern the burden. And it can happen at any time. If this warfare is going on at any time, we need to walk prepared to pray at any time. Sometimes when we seem like it's the least convenient is when it's needed the most. Learn to discern that prompting. You'll feel stupid at first. You really feel stupid at first when all of a sudden you're in your office and I feel like I should pray. Well, it's just me. It's just me. and I really think I should pray. And you get down and start praying there. It's like, man, I just left everything I was doing to pray. It seems kind of weird, kind of awkward. Or it's even worse if you're kind of in public and all of a sudden you feel this prompting to pray. And you've got to kind of excuse yourself to do it, you know, or make up an excuse to get away. You feel kind of weird. It feels kind of silly. But man, that's what begins to explode your Christian life. When you begin to act on that sort of stuff, your Christianity begins to intersect with your everyday life and that's when it begins to come alive. It's not just a theoretical philosophy that you act on on Sunday morning. it begins to be a real vibrant sort of thing. And sometimes it maybe is just you. So what? Is that a terrible thing to pray a little extra when God wasn't telling you to? The worst you can do is pray more than you thought you were going to pray. But you'll find that God begins to really bless that sort of thing. I may have shared here. I don't remember. But I had a thing two years ago now where I was praying with a student. I talked with a student a number of times about intellectual questions a student have. And one time when she came in, I all of a sudden got the impression that I was really missing the boat by trying to address her question intellectually. I just got that impression. And something in me said, don't get into a conversation with this person now. Just pray for them. We used to always go back and forth. She was a real doubter and always had intellectual questions. And I thought, oh, if I just answer these questions, she'll be a great Christian. But I began to see that the problem wasn't intellectual at all. It was something behind the problem. And so I just said, Eunice, I'd like to pray for you. It wasn't Eunice. I'd like to pray for you. And so we began to pray. And as we began to pray, she began to manifest what I've since come to see were really signs of some strongholds in her life, kind of a twitching, shaking, and all sorts of stuff. And I began to get a little freaked out by the whole thing because I had a class to do in about 15 minutes, and I didn't know what I was getting into here and all sorts of stuff like that. But I didn't know what I was confronting. But I kept on praying and just prayed for God to show me what was going on. and to get help and et cetera, et cetera. Well, things did get rectified. Some resolution was reached with this person. In fact, that was the beginning of what was to turn into an incredible healing in this person's life from incredible scars. It's been one of the most beautiful transformations I've seen. It began there. So far as I can see, that was the beginning of the whole thing. Well, the next day, I looked at my watch at one point and it was 10.35 because I wanted to see what time it was because I knew I had to get a class pretty soon. So the next day, someone comes by my door, this woman whose spiritual intuition I've come to trust. She knocks on my door and she says, Greg, what was going on here at 1035? And I said, you know, I thought, was I praying real loud? Could they hear me? You know, I didn't want to get the reputation of being the ghost buster on campus. Come to Greg's office, he'll cast out demons. But at first I said, well, nothing really. Why do you ask? She goes, well, I was down in the lab, in the science lab, and I was doing some stuff, and all of a sudden at 1035, I just got this real heavy feeling, and you came to my mind. And I looked at my watch because I was wondering if I should just wait until the lab got done and then pray. And it was 1035, but then I thought, no, I really need to pray right now. So she excused herself and went to pray, and she was praying for me. Now, if she hadn't done that, no, I don't know what the repercussions would have been. Maybe, probably, God would have got someone else to intercede because I really needed someone to stand in the gap at that point. But she was sharing some of my burdens. She was being an errand. She was carrying some of my load in spiritual warfare. And thank God she responded to that. You don't know what could be at stake when you respond to some of the promptings of your heart. When you're in private praying, ask God to really lead you, to show you what it is that you're praying for. What is at stake here? Sometimes it's helpful to remind yourself of the reality of principalities and powers. We are continually being influenced by a mindset, by a spirit which says that they're not real, that it's not true, that it's a waste of time. So sometimes it's good to go back to Scripture and remind ourselves of these things so that we take it seriously, so that we really do begin to see the world in terms of spiritual warfare. And again, I'm not talking about flaky demon paranoia because there's no basis to be paranoid. I'm just talking about seeing the world realistically, that there's a spiritual force that we're up against and that we need to be confronting. Ask the Lord for a clear, motivating picture. what i mean from is is what i've already kind of touched on it ask the lord to show you what it is that's going on here when i was praying with this woman i i did that i said lord reveal to me what's going on there and i got a picture i'm not saying that this is a literal thing but it was a picture that motivated me i think it was a at least a symbol of of of what was going on and maybe it was literal i don't know but i got this this this impression of of her having all sorts of uh like uh creatures let's come creatures stuck to her neck the base of her brain okay now weird stuff and i don't i don't think that that like god let you know like this present darkness i gotta i could pull back the curtains and see the reality of the other thing i don't know if this is what demons really look like but that's one way the lord communicated to me that there were demons there this gave me a real ugly picture and showed me the seriousness of it and i think was accurate as to whether it was a snapshot photo i don't know but what's important is that the lord gave me something that i could see what was going on and it motivated me um i have at different times and praying and and maybe some of you have too and i like to take a minute or two to get your experiences on this but when we were playing this church we were praying you know just come against the enemy whatever and there i got the impression of this geographical area and i saw it was like pollution over this whole thing. Pollution over this whole thing with little things dropping down onto different houses and stuff. The impression I got was that this was like a spiritual oppression. I don't think that's what a litter looks like, but it was a picture that I could understand, the Lord talking baby language to me to get me to begin to intercede for it. Ask the Lord for a clear picture. It may come, it may not come, but it helps to pray in a more focused way. Here also a word of knowledge and a word of wisdom is very helpful. The more specific you can pray, and this is a general principle, and I guess this is the way that God just ordained things, but the more specific you can pray, the more effective that prayer can be. That's why Paul says we shouldn't be ignorant of the enemy's devices. Don't be ignorant of these things. Know what you're up against and get as much information about it as you can. If you're shooting a rifle, you want to know where the target is. And so ask the Lord for specifics here. Can you hear a word of knowledge and a word of wisdom can be very powerful. I haven't had a lot of cases like this. In fact, all the cases I've had of demonization almost all occurred within a three-week period of time. It was one hellish three-week period of time, and I mean that very literally. But one case I had, we were dealing with a woman who had a very scary experience being spun around on a chair and pinned against the wall while she was talking to her husband on the phone. There's a lot of weird details like that. We went over to her house, and she was completely beside herself, and we prayed. You know, we began to, Paul Mitten, the senior pastor of the church I'm starting, and I began to intercede and began to pray with her or whatever, and we were getting nowhere. I mean, was this getting nowhere? The Lord gave me a word about what part of the problem was, at least part of the problem was, and it had to do with some kind of sexual violation. Up to this point, we thought it had something to do with this person that she was working with. We only had a little bit of information. about this person who was in the cult, and she'd been working with him, and ever since then, all the indications seemed like it was directed towards this person, and so we were coming against curses left and right and thought, well, there's something like that going on. We didn't know. You don't know in this thing. You know, we're just kind of novices. differences.
