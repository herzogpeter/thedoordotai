Now, this afternoon, I want to spend most of my time in this period talking about specific disciplines, but we're not quite there, and I need to work on the concepts a little bit longer. And let me just start with this. Spiritual growth, and by spiritual growth I mean an increasing immersion of the whole life in the kingdom of God. And spiritual growth really requires these three different things. and one is vision, and we've been talking a great deal about that, and that really has to be in place before we can go anywhere else. One of the reasons why efforts at spiritual growth so often do not yield the result they should is because we don't start with vision, and we don't move from there to intention. We normally will start with means, and that's a great danger. Disciplines themselves fall in the category of means. But means for what? And that's where we have to be very clear about our understanding of the kingdom of God. And just speaking now in the context again of us as ministers of Christ, what is our purpose? If our purpose is to secure heaven in the afterlife, forgiveness of sins and what leads to that, and please don't misunderstand me, that's very important. It's extremely important. So we need to, but there is a real question as to how you do that. And we have had some problems with understanding the gospel. So we need to have a vision of the kingdom of God and our life in it. What is that? What's that like? We'll be talking more about that this evening. But right now we think the spiritual person is the person who draws their life from their companionship with Christ in his kingdom. That's a spiritual person. They take on the character, and as they take on the character, they take on the power that goes with Jesus in his kingdom. So character and power then come together. now these are not individualistic things that's another thing I need to say briefly I don't have time to really talk about it at great length much that I say does sound like I'm just sort of talking about individualistically but this only happens in the context of the community of Christ's people so let me enter that as a statement here because I won't have time to say much about it but this is not individualistic power, character, that all goes with life in a group of people, some of whom may not be redeemed. Because that's where we actually live, maybe in our own family. And then, of course, also there will be individual differences that is caused by the wounds we carry. We have different wounds. Maybe that's coming from our family, the loss of a parent as a child, divorce, past events that have happened to us, all kinds. So that enters in here, but this is not just an individualistic thing. Now, once you have the vision, then you can move the intention. The intention is the next stage, and we really do need to make the intention. and that would be the decision to live as a disciple of Jesus for example I'm a disciple of Jesus I'm learning from him the things that he taught and that's the mark of the disciple if a person says I'm a disciple of so forth but they're not learning anything from so forth they're not his disciples now they may have already mastered what that person has to teach them and they're moving on. That isn't likely to happen in our discipleship to Jesus for obvious reasons. We're going to be learning from him from here on. We will be his disciples, his students. But we have to decide to do that. Now, and I don't know how you think about that in your own particular course of life. I mean, is there a point or is there a point at which you decided to learn to do the things that Jesus said? Or was there a point at which you realized you had decided that? Because sometimes decisions are like that, aren't they? They just sort of happen, and we don't necessarily make them at a time, but later we realize that they have been made. So each of us individually, I think, needs to work through that, not to pick over our guilt or make us feel bad or anything. It's a fruitless sort of activity, but just to know where we are. Do I have the intention? Now then, am I prepared then to lead others into that intention? You can call this, if you wish, discipleship evangelism. The richest field for discipleship evangelism today is the church. We need to give people permission and invitation to become disciples of Jesus Christ. Now in the full sense that we talked about it here, where it involves not just learning what he said, but also learning how he would do what we do that he didn't say anything about. So there's those two areas, you remember, of discipleship. So that would be the intention. And then, of course, the means for realizing the vision. Now, the means for realizing the vision, once we get to this point, is basically disciplines for the spiritual life. And so now we need to think about those again. And I've already given you a description of what a discipline is, and the concept is very important. It's more important to get the concept than it is the list. A discipline is something in my power, something that I can do, that enables me to do what I cannot do by direct effort. now nearly everything that is worth doing in human life can only be done with discipline in other words you have to do things that enabled you to do it and this is still true when we come to the spiritual life American culture has an ideal of spontaneity which means you don't have to train yourself you want to be spontaneous But the highest levels of spontaneity are the result of discipline. And that's true of sports, that's true in art, and that's true in religion. If you want to have genuine spontaneity, you discipline yourself so that you can do it. So you see spontaneity when Pavarotti steps out on the stage and does what he does. Or a Michael Jordan. We're going to have to get someone else. No. People begin to forget about what he could do. But that was the result of incredible discipline. Tiger Woods. And it's always true. See, it looks easy. But the point is that that's what discipline does. It makes hard things look easy. One way of describing a disciplined person is they are the person who is able to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done. What needs to be done when it needs to be done. And the undisciplined person is the person who can't do it then or can't do it at all. But whether it's in conversation or dancing or speaking or whatever it may be, the disciplined person is the one who's able to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done. That's the mark of discipline. And you see it over and over in sports teams. People who lose games and lose titles because when they need to do certain things, they can't do it. The Lakers lost any number of championships to the Celtics years ago because they could not control the ball in the final minutes of the game. They simply couldn't do it. And the Celtics knew how to take advantage of that. They knew they couldn't do it. And so they would play to be within two or three points in the last two minutes and then they'd take the game. The Celtics were disciplined. They could do what needed to be done when it needed to be done. Those are crude illustrations of deep spiritual points. Now, I want to use as an illustration here to just help us, something very familiar with people generally. This is from, this is the famous 12-step program from Alcoholics Anonymous. And this is an absolutely brilliant illustration of discipline. And it is drawn largely, as anyone would tell you who knew about the origins of this program, drawn largely from Christian sources, guided by a wonderful Christian pastor. And Bill W. and others were important, but they basically learned this from the Christian tradition. This organization was called for because the church was not doing what it should have been doing. If the church had been doing what it should have been doing, then it would have met this need. but as is so often with religious institutions they go into denial and they can't cope with what's actually happening in the congregations what was actually happening in the congregations was people were dying of alcoholism so through really wonderful experiences this was developed so now What is it that people couldn't do by direct effort? Answer, stay sober. And they couldn't do that. And we all know how the person who's in addiction just tries. They resolve. And everyone knows also that it is by and large pointless. And there are some people who are capable of just going off. But for most people, especially if they have been struggling with it for a while, direct effort is pointless. That doesn't mean they don't intend. It means that their intentions have nowhere to take hold. And of course, what you need to take hold is something that is in your power that you can do. So now here's just an illustration of a discipline. And this discipline involves a number of different things. Notice the first thing. We admit we're powerless. Now, can you put that in kingdom language? What does that say in kingdom language? My kingdom is shot. I can't do it. See, this is a beautiful illustration of a deep spiritual truth. I can tell anyone what God's address is. God's address is the end of your rope. and when you get all the way down to the end of your rope you will find God and this program will not work unless you are at the end of your rope and that's what that first point illustrates now actually you see we should all be theologically sufficiently informed to know that that's where we are anyway but we're out here busily running our kingdom and here are these few people or quite a large number of people who have gotten hooked on alcohol and their kingdom is out of control so they have to confess it. But everyone should be there, shouldn't they? I am powerless to manage my kingdom. So I have to take my kingdom into God's kingdom. These people, however, are faced with a real issue. They are going to die. They are going to ruin their families. They're going to hurt those who love them. They're going to keep on doing that. So they're faced with a specific issue. And it is important to solve that problem. So you see the steps. Now, these are basically interior or spiritual steps. Now, when you get down here to point eight, you have a set of steps that involve restitution. Start dealing with other persons. So then finally, you have a further step of reaching out to other alcoholics and to practice these principles above in all of our affairs. That's a stunning statement. I mean, look back at those principles. practice them in all of our affairs. Now, of course, this is attached to a practical program of meetings, of being responsible for one another, having people you can call, all those sorts of things. See, that's a part of the same program. But this is illustrative of a discipline. And it's a very powerful discipline. And actually, I don't think there's anything that even comes close to this sort of thing for dealing with addiction. Some of you may know better than that, but at least is the information that I have. But do you see the structure of the discipline? Something I cannot do by direct effort, things I can do by direct effort that enable me to do. See, now that's the concept. So don't worry about the list. I mean, anything could be on the list if it fits the concept. That's a discipline. The discipline for the spiritual life is one which in particular enables me to access the grace of God into my life. And that then enables me to do what I cannot do by direct effort. So what can I do? Well, I can go into solitude. I can go into silence. I can memorize scripture. It's one of my favorite and most relied upon disciplines is Scripture memorization. I don't mean verses. I mean passages. Just memorize whole passages. And what it will do for you is just stunning. So I can do that. That will access to me the reality of God's kingdom and His grace will be interactive with me. It will change my mind. It will change my feelings. It will change my body. it will change my social relations, it will change my soul. And the result of that will be my actions will be different. Now notice on spiritual disciplines something very important. Spiritual disciplines do not focus on changing action. This one focuses on changing actions. Don't drink that stuff. Spiritual disciplines focus on changing your inner self, your soul, your spirit, your mind. They focus on changing that. For example, again, go back to scripture memorization. Scripture memorization is a primary way of modifying the mind. It is a way of determining what is going to be before your mind. And that is going to determine how you feel about things. See, I mean, just take such a simple thing as the 23rd Psalm. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. Get it right here. See, now, if you take that or the Lord's Prayer, and you just let your mind dwell in that, then the thoughts and feelings that are before your mind are going to be very different. And they are going to affect the matrix. They will be the matrix of a different set of actions because the thoughts and the feelings are different. You can't act except on the basis of your thoughts and your feelings. if you decide to go get a donut that depends upon you representing the donut and having a certain feeling about it doesn't it if you don't have any feeling about it you won't go get it will you if you don't have a thought of it you won't go get it you have to have thought and feeling so now when we start talking about spiritual formation you see you're not just talking about your will you're talking about those things that interact with your will. And you may be the sort of person whose thought of the donut is in your muscles and you don't have to think about it. Your body knows where the donut is and you're going for it. Probably not. But you see, what we bring before our mind is in many ways our first freedom. We have more freedom as to where we will put our minds than anything else. And that's the deepest level of our freedom, is where we put our minds. Now, study is a way of structuring our minds, study as a discipline. See, if I memorize Scripture, then the order that is in that Scripture comes into my mind and stabilizes me and directs me. And the Word of God is itself a spiritual reality which comes into me and gives me strength and direction which I wouldn't otherwise have. That's why Jesus said in John 6, the words that I speak to you, they are spirit. They are life. now this is something that you want to work with I won't have time to be thorough in any of these discussions but you will want to experiment with what memorizing passages of scriptures will do for you and when you do you're going to find something glorious I assure you I have never found an exception to it anyone who does this will get the result the same way with fasting, same way with solitude same way with silence. See, when you go into solitude, you change these two areas. And that enables your thought and feeling to change. And so what comes out of that is a different set of attitudes and actions towards the world. See, many people are troubled by hurry, for example. Hurry, you know, H-U-R-R-Y, as in hurricane. Cain, or Hurley Burley. And so how do you, I mean, if you are troubled by hurry, that will affect everything you do. Actually, hurry is a soul affliction. Hurry is an affliction of the soul, closely related to impatience. You find a person in a hurry, you usually find a person who's impatient. Wouldn't you agree with that? And so these are soul afflictions. And you have, now if you're going to change those, you're going to have to go through the body and its social context. And that will affect the mind. So now just to see, rephrase, here's where the spiritual disciplines come in. The spiritual disciplines come in when we're Christians. We're talking Christian, okay? They come in when the word and spirit of Christ has entered. And the faith to Christ has come out now. And we're trusting God. See, we've established the connection God has established. We're born from above. We have a new life in that center. And that's our starting point now. That's where we're moving from. That's the walls of Jericho falling down, to use my metaphor from this morning again. See, the walls of Jericho have fallen down. Now we know about that. Now we're going, the rest of that area there is the promised land. But you now have to do something to take it. And so with that little figure that I had there a moment ago, where you're looking at vision, intention, and means, Now we're at the means. At the means. And having made the intention, we're ready for the means. We put the means to implement the intention, and that realizes the vision. You can't bypass that structure. You have to have it. And that's why I didn't start here this morning. This morning I started with the vision. V-I-M. Vim. As in vim and vigor. then vision, intention, means. And the means, you can be absolutely assured the means will work. This is not a mystery. Certainly there are things we have to learn about how to make the means work. Learning all of the disciplines are themselves somewhat challenging, problematic. it isn't as if you could just say well I'll fast no when you begin to fast it's like taking territory and when you first begin to fast you will be thrown off by things like the food in the refrigerator will call to you and it will say things like you don't want me to go to waste do you? is that good stewardship before the Lord? so your body is very clever and it has a knowledge of its own it really does and then when you start to fast you will be confronted with that you'll have to learn about it and soon you'll learn to say oh there's that old body again saying all those stupid things but it'll take you a while and first you'll take it very seriously you know and so all of the disciplines require some learning but not long learning and you really can make good progress and once you begin to put them into practice then you begin to see remarkable results that are not in your power so now that's the key idea and I want now to just put up a list of disciplines. Now, there's no such thing as a complete list of disciplines. We can say to begin with spiritual disciplines or disciplines for the spiritual life. I like that terminology a little better, frankly. Disciplines for the spiritual life. That's really what they're for. They're not spiritual. Ironically, every one of them is bodily. Every spiritual discipline is a bodily behavior. Isn't that fascinating? See, that's another reflection of the centrality of the body in our nature as human beings. We're not angels yet. We get to have the nature of angels later, but even then we will still be human beings with a human history. And so now disciplines for spiritual life is what we're talking about. These are used by disciples of Jesus throughout the history of his church. They are only systematization and extension, not always wisely done. They can be abused, especially if you fall back into ideas of legalism and earning merit. And oh, aren't I fine? I fasted for 20 days and cornered God. And all that sort of stuff. so that's just ridiculous they're not always wisely done they've been abused but they are practices basically followed by Jesus and his earliest friends in New Testament times see when you look at Jesus in the pages of the Gospels you want to understand that to follow him is not just to try to do what he said but to follow him into his practices his practices we have red letter Bibles for what he said. I've tried to get some Christian entrepreneur to put out a green letter Bible for what he did. Ah, he did that. Maybe I should do that. So, you can have that one. I don't have a patent on it. But we look at Jesus and see what he did. Well, there are so many fascinating things that you learn by observing that. And a good study if you're thinking about teaching these and practicing them and working into your ministry, a good study might be to just go through and study the things that Jesus actually did. Now, most people know that he did spend a lot of time in solitude. A lot of time, especially in his early ministry. If you just take the Gospels and look at the numbers of times where he went out by himself, Sometimes to pray, but not always to pray, I think. And 40 days in the wilderness was a long period of time. And I love the Mark version which says he was there with the wild beast. Yeah, it actually says that. And Satan and angels that ministered to him. See? He was there for 40 days. Now, at least a minor turning point in my life was when I realized that if he needed 40 days, I might need one or two. And began to explore why, what's all of this about? So solitude is something that Jesus did. And then now the general concept I've already given you, a discipline is an activity that enables us to accomplish what we cannot do by direct effort. And I give you the illustration here of Matthew 26, 41. Watch and pray that you may avoid temptation. You are willing in spirit, but your flesh is weak. Now remember, we have flesh as well as spirit. And our actions come out of our whole nature, not just out of our will. See, that's what Peter didn't realize. Jesus knew that, so Jesus told him what he was going to do. And even though he had been told he did it, see, because he didn't understand how the self works. Spiritual formation is a process that requires us to understand how the self works and not to dismiss what is there in our body, in our mind, in our feelings. See, when we have one of these sad situations where we say, Usually, of course, we say a minister fell. Now what's sad about that is not just that they fell, but you know the burden they've been carrying for years. Because what they fell on will be something that has been there for many, many years. And it will be in their mind or in their feelings or in their body or in their social setting or in some part of their soul. You remember that in Hebrews 12, we hear the word lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us. Did you notice that weights, there are weights there that aren't sins? Not everything that troubles us and needs to be laid aside is a sin. Let me tell you one of the greatest weights that we carry, and those are wounds. Wounds. And these may be wounds that we received as children or at some point in our career as we've gone along. Just wounds. I think of a man in another state where he had been going up, sort of up the denominational ladder in the institutions of that group, and at some point someone, he was very close to the top, and someone ahead of him just cut him off and ended his aspirations. And after sort of dithering for a moment or two or a year or two, he finally just left and went and he's pastoring the church, doing a great job at that church. But he's a hurt and disappointed person. And his feeling is that somehow he has failed, and that perhaps God has failed him, or he's failed God, or some combination of the above, or whatever. But see, that man is wounded. Others are wounded in sibling rivalries, or all kinds of ways people get wounded. And those are burdens, you see. And those are located out in these circles. And when you learn how to observe people, you can just almost see where they are. See, that needs to be dealt with. That needs to be healed. And spiritual disciplines can help with that. Now, let me just enter one line here. I can't go into it. Spiritual disciplines are not the answer to every problem. and now you can see that if you look at the clause here in terms of what we cannot do by direct effort see that refers back to an activity which we can do and for example if a person cannot for whatever reason endure solitude then obviously they can't get the benefits of it so then they need ministry at a different level sometimes therapy sometimes deliverance ministry, prayer ministry various kinds go back to what I was talking about healing of the memories there's a real function for that I don't think it's particularly well named but still I mean there's a real point to that and you have people who simply cannot engage in spiritual disciplines and if they can't do that then they need another type of ministry. But many people can, and many people can who think they can't. For example, it's very common for me to meet people who say, I just can't memorize. Everyone can memorize. Memorization is a very simple sort of thing, but if you say I can't, you probably won't. Memorization is a very simple process, and everyone can do it. But if they've been stung, they may have been told that they don't have a good mind. Or something like that. See, those things set there and radiate poison into the system. And they wind up with people being paralyzed. And these are the people who are still sitting on the fallen walls of Jericho. Waiting for God to do something. And where God had said to them, no, now you go, you march on. you step on so now then let's do some thinking about particular disciplines and remember on your triangle now this is your right hand corner these are plans for putting on new bowels new hearts and let's take some time now to talk about a number of these we won't be able to do all of them but some of them are extremely important I think that solitude is the primary discipline for a person who begins to really want to move. Solitude is stepping free for substantial periods of time from the ordinary connections of life, especially work, family, or any relationships which tend to govern our lives. Solitude means that we go alone. Now, it may be that we go alone into the forest. You have forests up here. We have deserts in Los Angeles. And they can equally serve the purpose. Or perhaps to walk by the lake or the beach or wherever. Or sometimes you can have excellent solitude just by going into a quiet room and sitting down in a chair and being quiet or in your backyard. What it means to do is to unhook yourself from the relationships that normally govern your life. It means to withdraw from engagement. Now let's put it in other words, shocking words. It means to do nothing. to do nothing. And for many folks, that's like a death sentence. Who would I be if I wasn't doing something? If I were not busy, would I be important? After all, busy people are important, aren't they? This is not a time to catch up on your reading. do all the undone work that you know you leave that at home because see if you take that with you you're taking your world with you you didn't you didn't make the break you didn't get away if you take it with you leave your boombox at home because you want to practice some silence give the squirrels a break I'm not a friend of the squirrels but you do need silence to go with it we'll talk about that in a moment now solitude is something you have to practice for lengthy periods of time because it will take you several hours or maybe even longer to just stop jerking because you're going to be you'd be like an outfielder catching balls being knocked at you now there are no balls being knocked at you but you're still jerking it will take you time to just be just be and when you do you will begin to discover things like you actually have a soul a self you are not just your relationships to other people. There is a you to you. And this will primarily begin to come as you experience feelings of peace and gratitude. Peace and gratitude will begin to seep into your body. You will begin to feel this. In order to do that, you may see many people say, if I go into solitude, I'll go to sleep. Probably you need to sleep. You want to remember that sleep is a very important part of life. This is what I call Elijah's discipline. He had a very strenuous day, if you recall. It isn't easy to call down fire out of heaven and kill a bunch of prophets of Baal and run all the way down to the city. He was all shot by the time he got there. And this little lady killed you, and he took off like a rocket. And you say, what happened to this guy? He was overworked. He was. He was tired. See, there's, I mean, he's been standing out there doing all this stuff, and this little lady says, I'm going to kill you. And the end of this run, he's down there in the mountain saying, God, why don't you kill me? well if he just stayed where the little lady was he wouldn't have had a problem but you see he's irrational and he's irrational because he's burned out so here he is going and he lies down under a juniper tree and goes to sleep I love this story this poor old prophet all ragged out can't run any further lies down and sleeps listen you need to sleep until you wake up rested some of you don't remember what that feels like I'm privileged to do a two day retreat with Fuller Seminary in a retreat setting usually in a monastery and I always tell the people the first night. Now sleep 10 hours. You should see them when they wake up and come into the meeting. It's like, where have I been? I'm rested. Listen, sleep is one of your main challenges to faith. It's one of your main challenges to faith. Can you lie down at night and let God run the world? the lady said when I lie down at night I turn it over to God because he's going to be up anyway it takes faith it takes faith to turn your day loose and it's a little more advanced stage than we can be talking about at present but I'd encourage you to try to come to the point where every night when you lie down your work is done that's why many people cannot sleep and now that requires that you have a great confidence in God for you to be able to do that because you know there are going to be so many things that you can say I didn't get done about now you want to remember this that God never gives us more than we can get done and have I been faithful to the Lord in my day when I lie down at night I should be able to say my work is done God never gives anyone more to do than they can get done you make your schedule he doesn't and it's a great act of faith to recognize that and live in it.
