Matthew 18 verse 21 is the continuation of our study in this book. We are dealing these last few weeks. In fact, we've been here a couple of months in Matthew chapter 18. I think you're aware of the fact that in Matthew 18, Jesus is painting a picture for us of the childlikeness of the believer. In verse 2, he called the child to himself and set this child before them, the disciples, and thus began the analogy for the entire chapter of us being like children. And in verses 1 through 5, the lesson we heard was that we need to be dependent just like children. In verses 6 to 10, we found out that we needed to be protected like children. In verses 11 to 14, we found out that we were cared for like children, especially lost children who, when we begin to wander away, our shepherd who loves us goes after us and brings us back. And over the last couple of weeks, we found out also that we need to be disciplined like children in verses 15 to 20. And today, the message and the next couple of weeks, as a matter of fact, is this. We need to be forgiven like children. And I think it follows logically that if we are going to be a body of people who in our relationships together are disciplining, meaning we're bringing each other back. Part of our lifestyle is shining the light on things that are being hidden and calling each other back continually, exerting that kind of discipline that if that's going to be effective, right behind that discipline needs to be a free-flowing of forgiveness. It needs to be part of our lifestyle. Peter gets the entire discourse going in verse 21 with a question, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? up to seven times. And Jesus said to him, I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to 70 times. Seven. And in verses 23 through 35, which is the fullness of our section that we're going to be in the next couple of weeks, although we're not going to get past verse 22 today, he begins to tell a parable that illustrates what we're going to talk about today. Let me just give you a piece of the parable without reading the entire text. It's a story of a man who was a slave of a great landowner, and the landowner had entrusted to the slave a piece of land to take care of, to be a steward of. And the stewardship that he had, he ended up embezzling and creating an enormous debt, a debt that no one could pay in ten lifetimes. And in the dealing on the day of accountability with this slave, the Lord said to the slave, I forgive you this debt that you could never pay. And the story goes on to recount that having been forgiven, he then turned around and met a friend, a fellow slave, who also had a debt not to the landowner but to him. It was a very small debt, but he didn't forgive, and he wasn't able to lose this person and extracted an enormous penalty on this person. And the lesson of the parable is this, that people who are in my kingdom have been forgiven a debt they can't pay. And the natural result of that is this, that when you have been forgiven much, you're going to forgive much. And when you aren't able to forgive, it's a contradiction to the fact that you have been forgiven a debt you can't pay. And in the 35th verse, there comes together the fullness of what the intent of this passage is, and that is this, that we as a people begin to experience what he calls forgiveness from the heart. Not just doing it seven times, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I forgive you, I forgive you, but a reality of forgiveness from the heart. We'll be dealing with that over the next couple of weeks. Let's get into it with prayer first. Jesus, I thank you for the sense of your presence already, the Shekinah glory, that you come and you minister to your people and you hold the enemy at bay. I have a sense of that already in our worship time, and as we break open your precious word, we need that same protection from the onslaught of the enemy, from the things that our mind would drift off to, and God, this is important stuff. And so we ask for the energy of your spirit to be at work among us, to be able to clearly listen, to with our minds understand, and then with our hearts, God, to open up to the transforming work of your spirit as it relates to genuine, real forgiveness from the heart. It's something we need to know. It's something we need to receive. It's something we need to give. It's something we know very little about. Do your work among us, in Jesus' name. Amen. Ephesians 4.32 echoes the sentiment of the passage we are in right now when it says this, Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech be put away from you along with all malice. And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you. Forgive one another. How is that? The way God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you. Having been forgiven much, you forgive much. It is an undeniable fact that a necessary ingredient for a healthy family, for that family to stay together, for there to be a healthy church, for there to be healthy relationships between yourself and people at work and your friends, it is an undeniable fact that for those things to be healthy, there needs to be a free-flowing of mercy and grace and forgiveness. The reason that that is an undeniable fact is because forgiveness is needed. Every one of us go astray. We are wandering sheep. We fail, we stumble, and in our relationships, if they're going to survive, there needs to be forgiveness flowing. Every one of us, however, have felt the sting of being in some context, whether it be a family or a church or a relationship, a marriage where forgiveness is not coming. And in contexts where forgiveness doesn't flow, people die. They might physically be living and their heart be beating, but inside there is death. We dry up. Forgiveness is necessary as air for us to live. The indictment lingers. Fear begins to be pervasive and bitterness begins to choke out our ability to enjoy life. Every one of us at one time or another in our lives have felt what I would call the dilemma of forgiveness or unforgiveness. some of us have felt what it feels like to be unforgiven by someone we've all felt what it feels like to be unforgiving to someone we've all felt what it feels like to know that you're supposed to be forgiving towards someone but for some reason even though you're trying very hard you just can't let it go you want to forgive but you don't know how when you are in that position of being unforgiven and someone is just holding this indictment over you the feeling that we have is that of being stuck. We feel helpless. We feel powerless. It's like being a bug pinned to a wall board for display. It's not a good feeling. You know what it feels like. The emotions are heavy. They're fearful. We feel scared. There's a shrinking of our spirits when unforgiveness doesn't come to us. And after you get a little tired of shrinking and feeling timid and having your virility kind of drained because of this indictment. It turns to anger because you get tired of groveling. To be unforgiving is not a good place to be. To be unforgiving and not extended, the reason it happened and the unforgiveness is even there, or the need for it is there, is because you did get hurt. You've been wounded, and the feelings that you've got that attend the wounded are legitimate. And you're angry, and you need to do something with it. But after a while, you begin to realize that this anger that you've got and this wound that you've got has power. There's an ability to control the person, you see, that is needing the forgiveness. And as long as you withhold it, there is a control and it's a little bit enjoyable to see them grovel and see them twitch and know that you have this power. But after a while, that becomes dissatisfying too. Because you realize that the pain you're inflicting with this supposed power that you've got is really a pain that's being inflicted on you, and you're the one losing sleep, and you're the one who is being troubled in your spirit. And then you begin to realize, you know, I really need to forgive, and I'm tired of punishing, and I want to do this. And so you begin to try to forgive the person who has wounded you, and just for the sake of our argument, the wound is a significant one. I think it needs to be significant. The wounds we're going to deal with today as they relate to forgiveness need to be serious wounds. Simple wounds are easy to forgive, and we're going to talk about how hard it is to forgive. The person who offended you or victimized you did deep damage to you, and now you're in a place where you want to forgive, but you know you're still afraid of that person, and if I forgive them and let them off the hook, I feel like I'm going to be vulnerable again, vulnerable again, and they nailed me once, and I don't want them to do it again, so I'm going to keep up the shield. I don't know where to go with these feelings. I heard them say they were sorry, but I still don't feel safe. I don't know if I can forgive them. And then you hear the scripture, as God forgave, you forgive. Don't be an ungrateful slave. Do it 70 times 7. And so you say, okay, I will. I will forgive. I do forgive. There, I said it. I can't forgive. I won't forgive. You don't know what they did to me. And you go back and forth, and you give it, and you take it back and you know what that feels like. But you want to and it's feeling like a cancer and you know you need to. And you've said the words, I forgive you 490 times. I forgive you. Oh yeah, oh yeah. But it's never, the release doesn't come. And you've responded to the commands. if you're a good Christian, you're going to forgive. And in the response to the rule, you've said, okay. But there wasn't a release in your spirit. And this thing in verse 35 intrigues you, this thing called forgiveness from the heart. Forgiveness from the heart. And if you're honest, you begin to go, I wonder what that is. Forgiveness that would really bring release. Forgiveness that would really bring, I can let it go. What would that be? Peter does get the ball rolling by asking a question. The question is in verse 21. Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? That's a good question. The question is simply this. When is enough enough? When do I draw the line and say, okay, now you're getting nailed, pal? He answers the question himself with this answer up to seven times. How about that? That's a good number. Now, let's stop right there and do some background and some teaching. What you need to do in order to catch what's really happening in verse 21 is not only do you need to hear the words of Peter, but you've got to see something about Peter. After he says seven times, you've got to see him beaming. He is very proud of this answer. Seven times? Oh, of course. This is the greatest answer. This is incredible magnanimity, if that is a word. It's a lot of forgiveness. Seven times. Let me tell you how I know that he was very proud of this answer and feeling like if I ever got a pat on the back, it's going to come now. Peter grew up in a system, a Jewish tradition, and also it was a Jewish tradition that was backed by Scripture that had a mentality that said basically this, three strikes and you're out. And again, this tradition was not unfounded. It wasn't as if it came out of the air capriciously, and we're going to be legalistic about this, although it had become legalistic. But out of Amos chapter 1, verse 3, 6, 9, and 11, all five of those verses, God said to his people in dealing with a number of different kinds of situations, he said this, Three strikes, you're out of here. Rabbis used to teach this. He who asks forgiveness of his neighbor must not ask for forgiveness of his neighbor more than three times. After three times, you're out of here. Even in Matthew chapter 18 that we just came off the discipline from, there seems to be a pattern there where you go to them first, and if they don't listen, you go to them again, And if they don't listen, you go to them a third time. And if they don't listen, what? You let them go. Three strikes, you're out. So Peter's going three strikes, you're out. That's what I've grown up in. There even seems to be a pattern in Scripture there. But I am a kingdom guy. I know the deep truths of God. I'm going to double it, a pinch to grow an inch, add one, to really be safe, seven. I know I am going to get the Kingdom Guy of the Week award for this one. Jesus gave one of those every week, just like in football games, you know. The Player of the Week, Peter. There's a sad thing here you need to catch, and you might have already caught it. There's a spirit here we've heard before. Where we heard this before was all the way back to the beginning of the chapter in verse 1, when the disciples came to Jesus feeling real good about their kingdom activity. We are doing great. Our ambitions have changed. We no longer want to be successful in the world. We want to be successful in the kingdom. Our ambition is to be the great ones in the kingdom. Tell us, Jesus, who is the greatest? Expecting to be patted on the back for their incredible desire to do the kingdom stuff, Jesus blew them to smithereens. Expecting to be patted on the back for his magnanimous forgiveness, Jesus blows him to smithereens. I don't say to you seven times. Say to you 70 times, 7. Peter, I'm going to give you a number that even great kingdom guys are going to be overwhelmed by. I'm going to give you a number that is designed to blow up your number. Because forgiveness isn't about numbers. It isn't about how many times you do it. I'm going to give you a number that is going to confront your superficial approach to genuine forgiveness from the heart. Because Peter, you need to know something about forgiveness from the beginning. That the goal of forgiveness is not to do it a lot of times. Seven or 497. The goal of forgiveness is, verse 35, that somewhere we would come to a point in relationships with people that genuine forgiveness from the heart would begin to come. And it's interesting, when you get forgiveness from the heart, you only need one. Because it's done then. but wait a minute back off with me before you know i kind of gave you an insight as to where that's going already but before we do any more digging any more defining any more exegesis i want to i want to get back and get real here for a second i want to ask yourself have you ask yourself a question when you first hear jesus say seven not seven but 70 times seven what is your initial response to that what is your first reaction? How does that hit you? What's your first impression? Well, I think it depends on who you are, because I think we will all react to that kind of statement in this verse in a different way. If you're a legalist, for instance, and you hear Jesus say, not seven, but 70 times seven, if you're a legalist, you know what you're going to do? You're going to start counting. 487, 488, 489, 90. One more, one more. I'll get you. the bible says forgive i did i forgave him for i counted everyone i forgave him did he forgive him kept the law i said i forgive you oh yeah i forgive you sure and you get two more and i really hope you do it so i can nail you in the name of god if you're a legalist you start counting if you are a perpetrator or a victimizer, one who wounds people in whatever way that might happen. You don't count. What you do is you start preaching. You take verses like this and you start preaching. What do you mean you start preaching? Who would you preach them at? Your victims. Follow that? This is the favorite passage, and I hear this more than you want to know, of people who are victimizing other people, abusing their relationship with them, and they're coming to passages like this and reminding the person that they're consistently being or consistently defiling and they're reminding that victim of theirs of their responsibility before the Lord to forgive. They take verses like this and they preach it. It's interesting if you're in a situation like that and you're a victim, you get victimized once by the abuse that you get and then you get victimized again when they say, well, I said it, I'm sorry. And you don't say the magic word, well, I forgive you. now you get abused again because you're not being very spiritual for forgiving. You get victimized twice by the victimizer who makes this their favorite passage and reminds you of how you're supposed to do this. If you're a legalist, you count. If you're a perpetrator, you preach. If you're a victim, you start crying. Because to you, this verse has not meant what I think it's intended to mean. Many times it's fallen on our ears this way. Don't hold the person accountable. just ignore it. 40 times, 490 times, 70 times 7 this verse has come to you meaning this deny the fact that there's a problem stay and be victimized again and again and again and again and the fact that you're staying and letting yourself be terribly defiled proves that you're forgiving so you're stuck. And you wonder what does this verse really mean? But wanting to be obedient you say the words, oh yeah, I forgive you. And as much as you know how to mean them, you mean them, but translated from the Greek when you're saying I forgive you, what it really means is, oh, I'll drop it. Okay, we won't talk about it anymore. Okay, we'll ignore it. Okay, we'll bury it again. And you say the words I forgive you and you wonder why those magic words that are supposed to bring release don't. Those magic words that are supposed to restore a relationship at that point don't if it's happening like this. And even though to your wife you said I forgive you or to your husband you said I forgive you or to someone in the body you said I forgive you, there isn't any juice in your relationship. There isn't any joy. There isn't any life with that kind of forgiveness. If you're a legalist, you count. If you're a perpetrator, you preach it. If you're a victim, you cry over it because you don't understand it. You say the words, but you don't feel any real release. If you're objective, if you can rise somehow above being a victim for a little bit, being a victimizer for just a little bit, being a legalist for just a little bit, if we could somehow for 40 minutes rise above all that and really be objective, I think what this passage makes us start doing is not counting or preaching or crying. It makes us think. It makes us start thinking. It makes us start questioning. And I would like to invite you this morning to start thinking over this. What does this mean? What does he mean, 47 times 70? What does he mean, 400? Is this a divine number that I'm supposed to find? What is forgiveness anyway? When you talk like this, Dave, it makes me aware that I've said I forgive you. I've said I'm sorry, millions of 490 times. But I do know what you mean when you say there's no release. what? So this raises questions. And you need to know that for me, as I began to get into this whole dynamic of real forgiveness from the heart, the questions for me began to come so fast that I couldn't feel them all. See, what Jesus is doing here is he's dropping a bomb. He's dropping a bomb on us, and he's dropping a bomb on Peter. And I'm thankful for Peter's question because it gave Jesus the opportunity to drop the bomb. We've heard Jesus drop bombs before. I think he takes great delight in doing it. In Matthew chapter 5, we heard him come to the Pharisees and drop a bomb. He said it like this, you guys say thou shalt not commit murder and if you commit murder, you're guilty before the law courts. And you're all real satisfied because you don't commit murder. Just like Peter who said, you say forgive seven times and you're real satisfied because you're this great forgiver. And then he went to those who said don't commit murder and he said, but I say to you, if you say raka, if you are angry, if you say these words, you fool, you're not just guilty before the law courts. You are guilty of a fiery hell. You're going to hell. What he did there was drop a bomb on them to blow up their perception of themselves having arrived at this wonderful, magnanimous purity and holiness. You're not holy at all. Let's look inside. You say don't commit adultery. I say to you, if you've ever looked on a woman to lust after her, you've committed adultery already in your heart before you even looked. You committed the adultery. When you looked, you just found the object and you attached it to it. And you say, Peter, seven times. I say 70 times seven. The purpose of making this statement that goes beyond physical adultery to something of the heart, that goes beyond physical murder to anger and rage in the heart, that goes beyond seven times of forgiving and makes it a number you can't reach, is to do just that. Make this holiness beyond their reach. It isn't to get them to try harder to not be angry anymore. It isn't to get them to try harder not to lust anymore. Okay, I won't even lust. Too late. I won't even be angry. I won't even be angry. Too late! I will forgive 490. I can't keep track even. the number he's giving here is to blow up his number it's to reveal how shallow Peter's view of forgiveness really is to frustrate his efforts to be a great kingdom forgiver to break up his self-righteousness and to get him to look again at what is real forgiveness I gotta let go of this number stuff that's the purpose of 70 times 7 and now I'm left with no number and now I'm left with trying to figure out what is real forgiveness a bomb has dropped the picture that, I don't know if God gave it to me or not it's just a picture I have it is like a bomb and when a bomb goes off, you know what you got left after the bomb? a lot of debris, there's bricks everywhere there's metal that's turned and I love bringing sermons that are neat I love three point sermons, I love them I get this idea that you like them I don't think, it doesn't matter to you I like them neat, here's three things it's wonderful this one isn't so neat because a bomb just went off and even as I was preparing I was going there's just a bunch of rubble I don't even know where to start it's just like a bomb just went off so what we're going to do this morning is just start picking up the pieces I'm not even sure the first piece I'm going to pick up is the one we ought to pick up first it's just the one I saw first and maybe you can go through your own pilgrimage on this I'm going to share with you mine the first piece I want to pick up is simply the picture or the piece of this number thing again I've already given you some insight on it but I don't think I'm done with it yet. Is this number 490? It says here, up to 70 times 7. It kind of sounds like maybe that is the limit. Think about it this way. I think it'll sell it for you. It does for me. Let's say Peter came in verse 21 with that number, okay, with 490. And he says in verse 21, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Oh, I don't know. Say up to 490 times. What do you think Jesus would have said? He would have looked at Peter and gone, how did you know that was the number? I mean, you know, Peter, this is incredible. You might have at least, most people would have at least rounded it out to 500. You knew it was 490. Did you look at the book? You know, I got a Messiah manual here, and the answers are in the back, and you looked, right? Scripture would have been rewritten, maybe. He would have said 490 times, and Jesus would have said what he said when Peter said, you are a Christ. He would have said, Peter, blessed be you, Peter, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. Either that or you looked at the book. What do you think? No, no, that doesn't work at all. If he had come and says 490 times, Jesus would have said, no, Peter, you say 490. I say 490 times 490. I'm going to blow your circuits, Peter. You think you're real magnanimous. You really got forgiveness down. You're very ready to do it. You don't know the first thing about it. It isn't about 490. I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you. We can blow those off so fast. It's like a machine gun and forgiveness from the heart never comes. You're going to have to go deeper to forgiveness of the heart. And all of a sudden, when I say that word, I've dropped the number piece and I've picked up another piece of debris. It's the piece that says forgiveness of the heart. Forgiveness from the heart. Let's look at that piece for a minute. What is this? You know, I know a lot about forgiveness that goes, oh yeah, I forgive you. Oh sure, yeah. Yeah, I forgive you. See, it's ironic. I know about forgiving 490 times. Quick, easy. But this forgiveness from the heart that really releases, that really restores relationship, I'm not sure I know much about that. In fact, the longer I looked at that piece, even this last week, the more I became aware is that I'm not even ready to look at this piece yet. It's out there somewhere. it's the goal we need to get to but what I want to do with this piece right now in my pilgrimage and picking up the debris is take the piece and let's put it down for a minute now we're going to pick it up again we may not pick it up completely today we'll pick it up next time but just put it over there I'm going to get to you because that's where we want to be but I'm going to pick up another piece of debris right now and just work with this for a little bit that will help me even get better light on this by looking at something I know a little bit better and you know what that is? false forgiveness I kind of have experience with false forgiveness this forgiveness that says the words but there isn't any release let's look at that for a while what is false forgiveness? well simply it's forgiveness that isn't real it's words that come out of my mouth that say I forgive you but there isn't any real release in my spirit it's forgiveness that says the words but in reality what it is is denial I don't have any pain I don't know, it didn't bother me it's minimizing the pain, oh it's no big deal didn't bother me anyway it's spiritualizing the whole thing it's ignoring the pain it's an I forgive, it's an ephiomi that's the Greek word, ephiomi, which means to release but there isn't any restoration, there isn't any relationship and even though I said the words, I still get tied up in knots when you're around me, I still can't be in the same room with you I still lose sleep over the thing. And I could say the words 490 times and I still don't get it. That's false forgiveness. That's why you don't get it. Why have we so often experienced that kind of forgiveness? Either coming to us or extending from us. Well, I don't have a definitive answer for you. What I can share with you is some of my thoughts on that matter. As I just search my own heart and try to deal with this whole thing. But why are my attempts, why are your attempts so often, the attempts to forgive, so often void of reality? Some insight. Number one, I think one of the reasons they're so void of reality is we have not always made a distinction between extended forgiveness and realized forgiveness. We haven't always made a distinction between extended forgiveness and realized or completed or restoration type of forgiveness. What do you mean by that? What I mean by that is this. It is one thing to come to you and extend to you forgiveness. It is another thing, and genuine. Let's say the forgiveness is, I really have a desire to forgive and get this off and release you from this thing. There is another dynamic, however, of having that forgiveness that I'm extending be received on this end with repentance and an owning up to the behavior and in saying that I'm sorry that allows this relationship to genuinely be restored and for there to be a release. You maybe don't know what I'm talking about yet. Let me attack it from a theological perspective. Picture it this way. Jesus is hanging on the cross, and he says some words on the cross. Among other words that he said on the cross, he says these words, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. Now, has that passage ever troubled you? Like, just what does that mean? I wonder, what was the extent to which they got forgiven of their sin? I mean, does that mean the guys who nailed them, and the pilots, and all these people who Peter later indicts in Acts chapter 2 as saying that the blood of Jesus is on their hands and they murdered him, Jesus here is forgiving them. Does that mean that they're forgiven and they're off the hook and no problem? It's no big deal. What Jesus is doing there is giving what I call extended forgiveness. Jesus, God, I extend forgiveness to all of these because they don't know what they do. Let me ask you a question. Was that forgiveness that he extended something that they all received right there? That there was a transaction that took place and restoration of relationship between God and men took place? Was it among all of them? I don't think so. I know one who got the extended forgiveness applied to them, and that was this, applied to him, and that was a thief right next to him, who said this, Jesus, remember me. Remember me because I see myself as one who desperately needs to be forgiven. I see my sin. I see my incapacity to do anything about my sin, and I repent of my sin, and I want to receive the forgiveness that you offer. I desperately want it. The forgiveness that he extended was received and it was applied and it was enjoyed by the person who said, I want that. I recognize my need for that. My point is this, that sometimes we are coming and extending forgiveness and wanting to embrace and pretend that the transaction has been completed when there is no repentance on this side. When there is no repentance on this side, The person to whom we're going to, the transaction is impossible to complete. And if you try to wrap your arms around that person and go, oh, I feel so much better because I forgave you, and they're going, I didn't do nothing, I don't care, yeah, I said I was sorry, you're going to wonder, why doesn't this feel full? God's grace is extended to the world. The Bible says God so loved the world. How many people experience the transaction of that grace? The grace comes to them and they are washed clean by it. How many? I don't know a number. I can tell you who gets it. Blessed are the what? Broken. For they alone shall inherit the kingdom. They are the only ones who receive the grace, experience the fullness of restoration in terms of relationship. Blessed are those who mourn over their sin, who repent of their sin and say, I am sorry and I don't have a prayer unless you do forgive me. In that context, there is a transaction. There is a fullness of restoration. Jesus extends forgiveness. We need to be in a position where we are extending forgiveness. But if there is not repentance on the other side, this warm sense of relationship restored that you desperately want with your father, with your mother, with your husband, or with your wife, or with your children, cannot happen unless there is repentance. And some of you are kind of extending it anyway and saying, oh, it's okay now. I said it. He said he was sorry. She said he was sorry. But the sorry is empty. There was no repentance. And you're hoping to get this hug and you feel so empty and shallow. You need to understand there's a difference between extended forgiveness that you need to give and a forgiveness that is full where we have a restored relationship because of repentance on the other side. Matthew 18 is even a picture of it, the discipline picture. picture when i go to one who has fallen into sin and i shine the light and i say you need to come back and they choose to ignore the exhortation to come back what do i do i go oh it's okay i forgive you let's have a hug it's all better now i forgive you anyway and then you wonder why it feels so empty because nothing's really changed it doesn't say to forgive them and have this wonderful hug now it says no you recognize they're still in their sin and then you bring two and then after two or three mediate this whole thing and he's still in his sin and he still wants to do what he's going to do and he's still got the same attitude you go okay it's no big deal let's just love each other and have a big hug no they're still in their sin and then you tell the whole church and we all go get him and we try to bring him back and he goes forget it i'm doing what i'm doing i'm keeping my attitude and we all go, let's just let bygones be bygones and give them a big hug. No, you let them what? Go. I don't even, somehow the Spirit's going to have to generate this because this concept's real big to me. I want to come to people and I want to come to you and you to me with extended forgiveness. I extend it and I'm coming like Jesus. We want to be coming like Jesus, we extend it. But when you're going to your dad or your mom or you're dealing with an abuse situation and the response on the other end is, there is no repentance. I've got some bad news and some bad news is you will not enjoy the fullness of all. There's relationship. Somewhere along the line, you're going to have to realize that your forgiveness is an extended forgiveness that was not received with repentance. And I'm going to have a relationship with this person like Jesus had with Jerusalem. I would that you would come, but you would not. And you know what Jesus did? He wept, and he went over here, and he grieved the fact that he didn't have a relationship with the ones he loved. He wasn't going to be able to have a relationship with her dad, his dad, his mom, the kids. There wasn't any repentance. I can't pretend. Extended forgiveness is still there, but wonderful, warm, and gooey feelings that we want to have, you can't pretend it's there if it's not, and it's contingent on a brokenness on the other part. Let me illustrate it like this. And again, I'm going to be using extreme cases just for the effect. A son goes to a father. And by the way, I noticed in my notes this morning, I'm using a lot of son and male issues and it's because a lot of this is a reflection of my own pilgrimage on this thing and imagining myself in certain positions. It could be a daughter with a mother, a daughter with a father or a grandfather anyway. The son and the father are standing there and the son says, Dad, I need to talk to you. I'm 35 years old and I've been running into some trouble in my life. And as I did, I began to reflect on why it is that my life isn't working and my marriage is a mess and I don't know how to relate to people and I hurt my kids. I don't want to do that and I don't think you did either. I never told you that you did, but you did. You know, Dad, we went to church every Sunday and we learned the verses and we sang the hymns and I have tape recordings in my mind of sunny Sunday afternoons where we would leave the church and Bibles were underhand and everybody looked fresh and scrubbed and isn't this glorious? But Dad, I need you to know that you damaged my soul in very significant ways. And Dad, I need you also to know that when I tell you that I'm not here to blame you. I'm here because I'm tired of carrying the bitterness and I'm here to forgive you. I'm tired of just saying, I forgive you. Oh yeah, it wasn't any big deal. I can't live with that anymore. I need to come to you and somehow experience forgiveness from the heart that I can extend to you and say, Dad, I've looked fully at some of the ways in which you wounded me and I want to just share the wound with you so that you know what you need to apologize for if you're ready to do that so I can forgive you. I'm not here to blame you. But Dad, and now in this particular picture I see maybe a gal, because this is a picture of sexual abuse, a gal talking to a grandfather or a friend or an uncle or a dad or a mom, saying you need to know that you touched me in a way when I was little that robbed from me my ability to enjoy my sexuality as a woman, as a man, and a terrible time relating to my wife. And you might not even remember it, Dad, but I think you do. You touched me that way. and I need to tell you that. You need to know, Dad, that you hit me in a way when I was little that robbed my dignity. You need to know that you talked to me in a way that altogether made me feel insignificant. Some of you have had conversations like that with significant people in your life. How they respond to you makes a difference. How would it make you feel if having come in fear and trembling to a significant person in your life to bring that kind of wound. And honestly, we've got to play this one way. You genuinely desire to forgive. I want to come clean. I want it to come from the heart. I want a restored relationship. I want to be able to sit in a room with you and love you genuinely. I want to forgive you. And the response from the dad or the mom or the significant person, as they heard of the wound, that they began to weep. And they began to just say, I am so sorry. I didn't know that the way I talked to you affected you that way I didn't know that the way I disciplined you was affecting you that way on the sexual touch I knew I did that we never talked about it we never said anything you kind of grew up and I saw you flower and get married and have some children and I guess I just thought it was okay but now you bring it and I am undone. I can only ask your forgiveness. How would that affect you? If you came with a spirit to forgive, I have a feeling that from your cause there would come, I forgive. Restoration, extended forgiveness, received by repentance, blessed are the morning, that's where the extended forgiveness becomes a contract, a relationship. How would it sound, or how would it feel if you heard this? Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm sorry I heard I'm sorry. The words inside I'm sorry were in there. How come that doesn't feel rich? Relationship restored? I'm sorry you feel that way. No, you don't have relationship restored. Extended forgiveness? Yes. Restored relationship? No. And you might have to go home and grieve the fact that you're not going to have a relationship with your dad. And maybe someone you love will be there and hold you while you sob. But then you have to let it go. How about this? Well, I said I was sorry. What's the matter with you? What do I want? Transaction complete? Blessed are those who mourn. They get the grace. That works with us on relational levels as well. How about this one? Why are you bringing that up now? That happened years ago. Wait, I hear that all the time, by the way. that is a real common one especially with a sexual abuse kind of thing or a physical abuse because the kids aren't able to process it until later here dad here's why we're bringing it up now because I want to forgive you from my heart and in order to do that I cannot just ignore the wound and pretend that it's not and I am tired of just saying I forgive you because I've said it 490 times and I want to be able to really let it go and for you to say you're sorry you're going to have to see what the wound is we need to make a distinction between extended forgiveness and relationally complete forgiveness and get ourselves off the hook of feeling like something's wrong with us if after we extend our forgiveness we don't always feel warm and gooey because if there wasn't repentance you're not going to be able to it would indeed be inappropriate in Matthew 18 when they stayed in their sin hang on to their sin there was a letting go of them not a going oh let's have a hug no hug Go hug somewhere else where you can grieve the loss of your friend. And then continue to extend the forgiveness and hope that one day God will bring brokenness there so we can have a heart and a relationship. I don't know if that sounds like good news or bad news to you. I think it's real. I need to make a distinction as well between I'm sorry and I'm sorry. Do you know what I mean? I got little kids and whenever we discipline them, it's like we keep going for it. I hear always, one time in the discipline process, we hear this, I know, it's all right. What do you want from me? Brokenness. Just a glimmer of it. I know how to get brokenness. And then they end up in therapy in 30 years. That's the thing. I'll tell you, lots of our amsare's, you've heard them and you've said them. We are all in this together, okay? Every one of us have been unforgiven. Every one of us have been unforgiving. Every one of us have been repentant. Every one of us have been unrepentant. But an awful lot of our amsare's really come out this way. Again, we've got to translate them from the Greek as it were. I'm sorry means really I don't want to talk about this anymore. I'm sorry means drop it. I don't want to look at the wound I inflicted on you, honey. What's the matter with you? Yeah, I committed adultery. Big deal. Now, nobody says it like that. We're going to be a little slicker than that. I don't want to listen to your pain anymore because I don't want to look at the wound I inflicted. I don't want to have to grieve over what I did. I'm sorry. That's the magic word. And now it's up to you to do what God says. Forgive me. Do it. you've heard I'm sorry's like that you've said them like that they are empty just like a lot of I forgive you's are empty and then there is an I'm sorry that comes from a broken heart that comes from a mourning heart that says I did or didn't know that I did that but as you share that with me what I see is that I inflicted a wound and I need you to know that I am sorry I am so sorry coming from a broken... I'm sorry's that come from a broken heart that realized the wound that was inflicted was real, those I'm sorry's have power to heal. They have power to give life and love and restore passion to a relationship and to a marriage and to restore joy. Again, in an extreme example, I think of an adulterous situation where either the woman was unfaithful or the man was unfaithful. Again, for my picture, I've got to use a man because that's me and I picture myself a man. and I would say something like this to my wife had I been unfaithful I said I was sorry how many times we're going to go over this one of the facts that I would have to realize is this if I really want my wife's forgiveness what I'm going to have to do is be willing to hear her pain did you hear what I just said if I really want my wife's forgiveness I'm going to have to be willing to really hear her pain honey, I don't want to do this but I need you to tell me about the wound that you have not just the physical act that I did but then you'll begin to hear things about how it robbed her of dignity of how it robbed her of respect of how it made her wonder if she's loved if it robbed her of her value as a woman to hear all that to look at the wound having seen the wound, now I know what I'm repenting of. Do you understand that? And now my sorry might mean something. Might actually have to sit and listen for longer than 30 seconds without interrupting and defending and correcting. Before I can even say I'm sorry, I need to know what I'm sorry for. And then having shared the wound, there comes repentance, a groaning of the soul that says, I'm so sorry. and all of a sudden you experience what you never thought you could, forgiveness from the heart and it's not just a word anymore. We need to make a distinction between intent and impact. I had an opportunity this week when I'm in something like this, I want to talk to people, especially in counseling situations, who are dealing with people and one of the main counseling issues in counseling is people who are having trouble with forgiveness. How do I do this? How can I receive it? How can I give it? I talked to Jeff a lot this week. I talked to a guy named Keith Hankinson that many of you know. He gave me this piece right here, knowing the distinction between intent and impact. I'll explain it this way. A lot of us don't ever intend to wound a person, but the fact is that by our behavior, even behavior we're ignorant of, we damage incredibly. And we need to understand that we need to receive the fact that we have an impact that's negative. I'm going to use a current illustration for this first and then make one more close to home. sexual harassment in the workplace is something we're hearing a lot about in the media and the response very often on the part of the men who are sexually harassing is this i don't get it i don't see how a couple of dirty jokes and a picture of naked woman in my office how that's bugging anybody i didn't mean to hurt nobody if i make them sound stupid it's because i think it's Stupid. And the rationales, I didn't mean to do nothing. You need to know there is a distinction between what you intended and what you did. It's time to grow up. Because what you intended was whatever it was. I don't even know that. But the impact was this. Your impact on the women around you was one of degradation, lack of respect, a robbing of their dignity and womanhood, and that is the wound you inflicted. And when you're willing to look at that and confess that and repent of that, you might even be able to get off the hook. There's a distinction, and we need to make it, between what you intended to do and what you really did. Let me make it a little closer to home. I can relate to this one even better. I'm a parent. I have four kids. And as I view myself as a parent, I think I'm doing a pretty good job. I love my kids. I know I love them. I think to the best of my ability, along with my wife, we are creating a home that is safe for them and happy. that discipline is as even-handed as we can make it, which may not be even-handed enough, but it's as even-handed as we can make it. Okay, you can relate to that. We're doing as good as we can. My intent is to create a wonderful place where kids grow up and big flowers come out of their lives, you know. Oh. But as a father and as I deal with concepts like this, I'm aware of the fact that there may be a day when my wife and I both, and I just got to put it with me right now though, are sitting in a room with one of our sons or one of our daughters and I hear one of them say to me, Dad, you know, I love you. And they're coming to me with a spirit of forgiveness. But you need to know something, Dad. You know, when I was little and you used to do da-da-da-da-da-da-da, whatever it was, it doesn't matter. Just the way we live together. you know, when you did this and such, you made me feel really small sometimes. Didn't mean to. But the impact was real small. See, I read our family life through my eyes. And I wonder someday what I'm going to hear about what our family was like through their eyes. It's different. It will be different for you too. Dad, you made me feel really small when you did that. Dad, when you did this and such and you joked around and you're really a funny guy and you make me laugh, but sometimes when you laughed and you made jokes, you made me feel real insignificant. And sometimes, Dad, when I was around you and you disciplined me, and sometimes I understood it and sometimes I didn't, but I was really afraid of you sometimes. You have no idea how big you were when I was five. Me? and I can respond to that by saying what are you talking about I didn't mean it it doesn't matter what I meant there was a wound inflicted and hopefully at a time like that we can come to our children and to our friends and just say I just need to hear that son, daughter and I need to tell you that I received that I'm willing to look at the wound and I'm going to grieve that and I'm sorry I am so sorry so that forgiveness from the heart can flow. And we don't have to sit in rooms and talk about football all day long because we're scared to talk about what's real. Another piece of forgiveness is one of the reasons I don't forgive quickly. I got to close. It's because I don't want to look at the wound myself. And so I just say I'm sorry, or I forgive you right away because I don't want to look at it either. Last piece, last piece. I think we need to recognize that forgiveness from the heart is not always quick this is very important and even though I want to go faster I don't want you to miss this we've got these ideas that when Jesus says 4 70 times 7 that we're supposed to say I'm sorry do it I forgive you yes right now I believe that forgiveness that comes from the heart is a process sometimes forgiveness from the heart is easy because the wound was not significant you bumped into me fine I'll forgive you sure no problem but sometimes the wound is far deeper. It's a lifelong wound. And like a physical wound, physical wounds take cleansing. They take medicating. Somebody's going to come at me with a bottle of iodine. I might need to stitch it up. I might need to change the bandages, remove the stitches, and even give time for the scar to heal. But something I know about me physically is when I have a wound and there's a cut here and it's bleeding, the last place I want to go is to the doctor. I would rather bleed to death sometimes and let it die and just die. In fact, if I were to make that relational, I would rather let the relationship I have with you die and not be anymore than go through the pain of making it healed. Can any of you relate to that? I would rather let the marriage go right down the tube than go through the pain it's going to be to do the healing on this wound because to heal the wound, we're going to have to clean it out. That's going to hurt. We're going to have to medicate it with iodine. That's going to hurt. We're going to have to stitch it up. That's going to hurt. And it's going to take time. It might not happen overnight, folks. And as we go through this together, we begin to come to a realization of verse 35. Genuine, real, rich forgiveness from the heart. What do we have this morning? Just as we close. First of all, I think there's probably lots of questions. I hope there are. I hope that some of your perceptions of forgiveness, that what Jesus did to Peter, it happened to you. Ba-boom! I hope some of your shallow, along with my shallow, ideas of forgiveness are blown up. I hope that you walk out of this place this morning with an eternal dissatisfaction with false forgiveness. I hope you walk out of this place this morning with a sense of wonder about what forgiveness of the heart is. A sense of wonder, on one hand, that you don't really know what it is and that's okay. Just stay there for a week, okay? But also a sense of wonder that that is a possible thing. That I could really know forgiveness from the heart and extend that. I hope you even walk out of here with a deeper level of repentance because you've said a lot of cheap I'm sorry and you said a lot of cheap, I forgive you. Verse 22, when he says 70 times 7, is designed to mess things up, and I hope it did, so that we're driven deeper to Jesus as our only hope to experience what real forgiveness is. Stand with me. We're hurting for time, and I apologize for that because I really feel like there's time for ministry here, and Jesus is going to have to do what he does, maybe in some silent ways. But I want to pray for you. for two things I want to ask that the Spirit of God come with a spirit of repentance upon us some of us have said a lot of cheap I'm sorry and you've not been willing to look at the wound you inflicted and that the Spirit of God come upon us and just bring a spirit of repentance and some of us have been in forgiveness modes where we've been using the lack of forgiveness as a power tool to punish and God just needs to move here for forgiveness some of you, I'm going to pray for the whole body and just receive what God gives you some of you can receive what you get just sitting in your seat some of you might need prayer we will have people meet you as we're dismissed so let's pray Jesus I pray right now that the power of your spirit would be released among us and he already has been as this word has come but God that you would move among us for a spirit of repentance right now I pray that you would put on people's minds and hearts so it's cheap I'm sorry that we're really and I'm sorry to say I don't want to deal with this anymore. I don't want to look at this anymore. Be quiet and bury it. God, bring repentance. Those who need it, I just pray you receive it right now. Just let God come at you. It hurts. There's healing here. God, at the same time, I pray you move among us with a spirit of forgiveness generated by your spirit. We understand things in this text from the mind. but I pray that generated by your spirit there would be a spirit of forgiveness here. Bring restoration between people. Some of you are getting names and dates and people that you need to go to and talk to and maybe that's even the appropriate thing not coming forward but going to a brother going to a sister giving an I'm sorry that comes from the heart giving an I forgive you that comes from the heart. God this is a word that needs to go far deeper than just sitting in the seat or coming forward, but it needs to permeate our living and go out the door with us. We feel it that way. In Jesus' name, Amen. Thank you.
