Open your Bibles with me to the book of Exodus, the 20th chapter. As we continue our series this morning in the Ten Commandments, we've been calling them the Ten Great Words for Life, and we've come to understand them as having been delivered, and this is important, to already redeemed people, not as a means by which they could be saved, but rather as a way for them to live out and flourish in the freedom and the redemption that God had already secured for them. They'd already been delivered from Egypt. Nowhere is that fact, the fact being that these commandments were given for their ability to flourish and ours, nowhere is that fact more practically evident than in the fourth commandment. We pick it up in verse 8 with these words, Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. And while that word might sound intimidating, at the base level, all it means is to set it apart. Put a boundary around this day. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall not do any work. You are your son or daughter, your male or female servant, or your cattle, or a stranger who's visiting with you. Why? For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that is in them and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath and made it holy. He blessed the day. In effect, saying, this is designed by me for you to be a happy day. It's supposed to be for you in my heart for you to be a look forward to day. It's a gift day. Now, I don't want to presume that you grew up in the same tradition I did, but when I was growing up in the early 60s, late 50s, Sabbath day in church, we kind of knew it was Saturday, but we kind of told everybody why it was actually Sunday, and we called it the Lord's Day. And the way you rested, it was very important to rest on the Lord's Day. What it really meant, in terms of my kind of 10-year-old understanding, was that you couldn't do anything fun. And so rather than the Lord's Day being this happy, blessed, look-forward-to day, the Lord's Day for me became that day I could get in more trouble than any other day. Same is true for many of you if you grew up in church. The fact is this is an incredible gift from God with wonderfully practical application, revealing that, among other things, God really knows how we've been made and what we need. He gives us a Sabbath day. We need to do some teaching for us to enter into the reality of this gift. So let's do the word. The word Sabbath in Hebrew is rendered Shabbat. It means simply to cease. In Greek, that same word is rendered sabbatan, and the double beta or the two Bs in the middle of the word in the Greek brings emphasis, so it completely cease. It's as if at its most rudimentary level, what God is saying, if you can get rid of all your own personal baggage around whatever the Lord's Day or Sabbath Day means, what he's saying is, I want you to take a day off. Why? Because I do know how you're built, and I do know what you need, and my desire for you is, in fact, to flourish and to thrive, to stay healthy physically, emotionally, and spiritually, to remain free from those things that used to enslave you. Therefore, I want to give you one day a week as a gift. And I want you to put some boundaries around this day. I want you to protect it. I want you to make it holy, which means set it apart. Keep some boundaries around it. Now the specific day that this Sabbath rest needs to be observed, we're going to deal with next week. As I already mentioned, Sabbath is the seventh day. It's in the text. Seventh day is Saturday. So some questions come out of that. Well, if the Sabbath is Saturday, why do we call the Lord's Day Sunday? And there are some reasons for that. Can I put a boundary around another day and exercise the discipline that you're going to talk about here on another day? All of that, again, is going to be dealt with next week. where we deal with what I'm going to call the procedure of Sabbath. Today what I want to talk about is the purpose of Sabbath. For many of us, again, I think lost on us is this. I've identified three from the heart of God. First purpose is physical restoration. The second purpose is spiritual realignment. And the third is redemptive reminder. And what Sabbath day will remind you of, indeed, What Sabbath day is a picture and a symbol of and stands for the same today is that our redemption out of slavery was not a result of our working but of God's delivering. For hundreds of years, for the original hearers of this commandment, these Israelites were slaves in Egypt. They worked to earn their right even to live. It was scratching and clawing and striving. And this commandment, this gift of Sabbath day rest, is a constant reminder of this truth. I have come down. I have already delivered you out of slavery. And for you to get out of the slavery that I redeemed you from, you didn't have to scratch. You didn't have to claw. You didn't have to strive. I gave it to you as a gift. And one day a week, I want you to sit down in and remember that you can relax. It's not all up to you. Sabbath day rest is a weekly reminder that redemption is not a result of our striving but of God delivering grace. Sabbath day rest is an incredible prefiguring. In fact, this very day commanded here to the Israelites is for them a prefiguring of the gospel of grace. Before you and I came to Christ, we had to scratch and claw and strive to come up with some sense of our own value and identity. some sense of our standing with God. If we tried hard enough, maybe God would like us. But now in Christ, you've been set free. And it's not because of your striving. It's because of his completed work on the cross. And because of that, you can rest. And that's what Sabbath rest is. Now, let's go back to the beginning, to the elementary entry level understanding of Sabbath day's purpose. Before we know anything about its spiritual implications, I want to talk about, first of all, its impact relative to physical restoration. For this was part of what was in the heart of God for us around this day off. By elementary, by the way, I do not mean unimportant or insignificant. Indeed, this Sabbath day rest in the physical arena is absolutely critical to your health, freedom, and thriving. It's as simple as this. I've already said it. I want you to take a day off. Now, get away from all the religious background baggage you might have around whatever Sabbath or Lord's Day means to you. And just let this in. That sounds like a good idea to me. I mean, it kind of struck me that God is behind the whole idea of taking a weekend. Taking Saturday off. That's God's idea. What struck me odd, however, about this taking the day off is that he makes it a command. Again, especially when I kind of just was dealing with the physical dimension of this, a physical day. I mean, I command you to stop. I command you to relax, go home, take the load off, and lay down. God gives us a lot of commands. Here he says, I command you to do nothing. When I was in college, I spent my summers working construction, pouring concrete. It was a hard, hot job, and the hours were very long. But every Friday around noon, the crew I worked with began to prepare incredibly for the Sabbath. No, they didn't prepare for the Sabbath. They didn't even know what the Sabbath was. But the truth is, right around noon on Friday, this crew I worked with, not just them but me as well, became pretty much useless. We started winding down, preparing not for Sabbath but for Saturday. I do not remember ever the foreman of our construction crew, as we were about to leave on Friday afternoon at 5 o'clock, needing to command us, you guys, I told you this last week, I'm telling you again, don't come back tomorrow. Never did that one time. We couldn't wait for Saturday. So on the front end, this command to rest might seem unnecessary, but think a little further, and you probably don't have to think much further, For while some might find ludicrous the notion that you would have to command rest, others, if honest, would have to admit that nothing short of divine decree could get you to rest. We call them workaholics. They are addicted to and get their life from work. It's not something that the guy who flips hamburgers at McDonald's often struggles with. But his boss might. or her boss might, businessmen and women, executives and managers who sometimes respond addictively to power and more power, money and more money, prestige and more prestige, and the possibility of advancement, not that there is anything wrong in and of itself with money, power, prestige, or the possibility of advancement. What happens, though, is we cross this line and begin to expect that from those things we can procure a sense of value and identity. And if that is what we're trying to get from those things, they will have an incredibly addictive power. We'll never be able to get enough. And before we know it, we can't break that cycle. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in a recent study of work patterns in the United States found that most executives did not want a shorter work week. In fact, nearly two-thirds indicated that if there were a change, it would be for more hours recently there was a story in the USA Today told of a guy named Robert Highland Vice President General Manager of a radio station in the St. Louis area who shows up every day at a station at 1 o'clock in the morning he goes home at 5 o'clock in the afternoon that's a 16 hour day think about being his wife or his kids he did that for 20 years until one day he got very, very sick, almost died, was able to recover, adjusted his schedule in response to that so that now he comes in at 2 o'clock in the morning. Learned his lesson. Dick Vermeule, presently as the head coach of the St. Louis Rams in the NFL, when he was with the Philadelphia Eagles, went through a much publicized burnout experience in his life. Of it, he said this. I was like most coaches at this level, I'm utterly consumed with my job. It's never done. There's always something more to do. While some might have more talent as a coach, I reasoned, I determined early on that no one would work harder than I. The result of that for me, though maybe a noble sentiment, was this, I never slept in my own bed the entire season. My normal routine, he says, was scary. Eventually, it made me sick. This Thursday morning, I was reading a paper, and I saw this advertisement for a show on Channel 2 that night by Dr. Laura Schlesinger, presenting material from her new book called The Ten Commandments, What's in It for Me? I mean, I'm doing a series on The Ten Commandments, and I'm always looking for material, and it was hardly something I could pass up. I've never read Dr. Laura specifically, but I've heard a lot about her and figured this could be good. So I watched it. In fact, I taped it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. About the Sabbath, she said this. When God created us, among the things he gave to us was dominion. And I'm thinking there, yeah, you got that right. That's in Chapter 3 of Genesis. What God said was this. I want you to rule, subdue, and multiply the earth. Now, what that requires is work. and it's a good thing for you to have dominion and to work to get is a good thing that is a god ordained thing and so it is she says we went to work as a people as a species and now it's a culture and we got dominion and we have dominion all week long and you think about your work and you have dominion and some of you think oh i'm gonna tell us that we shouldn't no you should that's a God ordained thing have dominion in your family have control of your life God gave you that it's not a bad thing dinner inside I thought was wonderful when she said this in doing that however getting dominion we lost dominion or we lost control over something else that was very important you know what it was? time so how do you get back control of time? Well, here's a suggestion from God who knows how we're wired. Remember the Sabbath to keep it set apart. I would like you, I'm calling you, my people, if you want to stay sane, I want you to build a boundary around a day every week for you to come apart, for you to cease, for you to stop. And sometimes the value of the stopping won't be much more than making you aware of how hard it is for you to stop. Does that make any sense to you? Are you tracking with me at all on that one? If you're like me and you're a little wired and you have a little excess energy. One of the realities of a Sabbath, you build a discipline around a day or even a period of time in the day and one of the most unpleasant realities of that time will be that the first thing that dawns on you is how incapable you are of being quiet, of being restful. Very few things will help you become more aware of your obsessive behavior than not being able to obsess. I was talking to somebody between services, and they told me they were going to go home. They loved the sermon, and it really hit them right where they were. They needed desperately to put some boundaries around some things in their lives, and she said she was going to go home to obsess about not obsessing. I have a gift for you. I have a gift for you. Once a week, have a discipline. Put a boundary around some time for you to come apart so that you don't come apart. Part of the gift of this is for physical restoration. It leads me to the second dimension of this Sabbath gift from God. It's this. It's also for spiritual realignment. When the Bible says in Exodus 20, verse 11, and in Genesis chapter 2, verses 1 through 3, that God rested on the seventh day, the question I had to ask myself as I was trying to kind of exegete this and understand it was, why did he rest? Maybe he was tired. That would make sense. To me, I wouldn't blame him if he was six days, creating the world would tend to fatigue the strongest among us. So there's God I kind of pictured in my mind. In Genesis 2, hands, you know, kind of on his knees here, bent over, really pooped. I'm just, I'm just worn out. Man, if I'm God and I get tired, my people, you know, the people I created, they must get tired too. So I'll tell you what, I'm going to give you a break. You do what I did. I took the day off. Okay, you can too. And then he even got a little mad about it. What do you, what do you think? I need a break and you don't. You're not going to show me if I command you. Take a day off. And so that's what this is all about. Well, okay, thank you. I'm glad you laughed. It's not at all what this is about. The fact is this, in Genesis chapter 2, after six days of creation, God did not stop because he was tired. He stopped, and I think this is beautiful because it is, again, a prefiguring of redemption. He stopped because he was done. It is complete. Look at this in verse 1 of chapter 2 in the book of Genesis. It says this, Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. In fact, God said two things of his creation. He said, number one, he said it's good, verse 31 of chapter 1. And God saw all that he had made, and behold, it was very good. The second thing he said was, it is finished. Which, by the way, again, prefiguring is exactly what Jesus spoke on the cross. When he died, it is finished. which, again, ultimately is what Sabbath day rest is all about, reminding us of. Verse 2 of chapter 2 in Genesis, And by the seventh day God completed his work. He wasn't tired. He was done, which he had done. And he rested on the seventh day from all his work, which he had done. Then God blessed it in the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it he rested from all his work, which God had created and made. and basically said to us, I want you to enjoy it. I want you to enjoy two things. I want you to enjoy the day off, but in the day off, what I want you to enjoy is the completeness of my work in your life. You see that? That's why he's telling them about the completeness of creation. I want you to enjoy the day, but what I want you to enjoy about it is that I have completed the work. Again, are you going anywhere with redemption on that one? That's a prefiguring of redemption. I want you to sit in that. pull it together the Sabbath day is not just a day of rest it is a day of remembering it is a day of spiritually realigning your heart to this eternal truth there is a God in heaven and it's not you he is the one who has done the work he is the creator, provider, sustainer, deliverer healer, redeemer and sanctifier he is the re-creator not you yes you need to share your faith but you're not the one who's going to bring that person to life. So lighten up. He is the convictor of men's hearts, not you. He is the heart softener. He is the eye opener. He is the life giver. And here, I spent my whole week acting as if all that stuff was up to me. Anybody here at all relate to that? See, nobody here, nobody here, I'm going to go out on this. I don't think anybody here believes that they are the creator, provider, sustainer, deliverer, and healer. We just act like it. See, if I don't do it, and if I don't hold it, and if I don't fix it, lead it, change it, heal it, correct it, who will? Every single thing and every single person in my whole life is going to absolutely fall apart if I sit down. So I'm just going to keep on going. Everybody else can get rest, but not me. Oh, thank God we have you for our God. You're holding it all together for all of us. Thank you. You're not God. See, the fact is nobody here believes that way. We just act that way. Sabbath day, beloved, is a gift from God designed by God what a wonderful gift he just knows how we're wired and how we're built, what we're prone to it is designed to interrupt that joy-stealing, life-destroying cycle that I just described by saying, beloved once a week I want you to cease not only to rest physically but to use the day to realign yourself spiritually to this eternal truth I am God and you are not. I am creator, sustainer, provider, deliverer, healer, and not you. But to do that, says the Lord, you need some intentionality around this, especially if you're really busy, especially if you're really obsessive, quite frankly. You need to purposely stop. You're going to have to, I want you to put a boundary around a day. That's why I gave you a day for that. It's called Shabbat. It's called Sabbath. Put a boundary around it, set it apart, make it holy, meaning set it apart. It's my gift to keep you spiritually aligned on a regular basis. Now, just a little side note, I maybe don't even need to say this, but to clarify what you may be thinking, I hear myself sounding as if the only day you're going to come apart and kind of rest and focus and realign on God is this day that will be your Sabbath. Every other day, be obsessed. Every other day, act like you're God. No, no, no, no, no. The purpose, ultimately, of this discipline that we would build into our lives is so as we would even feel the discomfort of Sabbath day rest, that that, as it becomes, quite frankly, easier to do, would bleed into every day. on a very practical level I want to talk about the reality of this spiritual alignment realignment rather and how it ministers to and guards against three things that I think speak again to the wisdom of Sabbath and how it is that God had this for us as a gift See, the first thing I think this Sabbath day rest that allows spiritual realignment to produce in us is humility. It guards against pride. I just kind of play it out like this. Let's say you're doing really well right now. Things are going marvelously in your life. You have wonderful gifts, let's say, to create. Remember I said God is creator. You need to remember that. Well, let's just say you are among us as one who has incredible gifts of creativity. I'm serious. Like, from out of nothing, where a song ten minutes ago did not exist, a song now exists. Because from you comes the ability to create music. Somebody else here might have an incredible ability creatively around poetry or writing. There are some, I'm sure, among us who are builders. And there was a vacant lot three months ago, and now there's a house sitting there. You created that. You built that thing all by yourself. Maybe with a crew, but it was with your hands. Some of you are able to provide resources for your family. In fact, you are so adept at providing resources that your ability to do that goes beyond your family to friends. In fact, some may have such an ability to not only make but reproduce and multiply resources, money I'm talking about, that you even have an effect, a positive effect on the society at large. You are a provider. That's a good thing. Still others move easily in gifts of healing and deliverance and evangelism so that wherever you go, people get saved. Wherever you go, churches get built. Why would a person like this need a Sabbath rest? Here's why. To remind you again, As you built just a parameter around some time in your week, and I think importantly to come together with God's people, and as you in worship and enter around the Word, gaze at the glory of the Lord, by that you are reminded, you know what? I am not the creator. God gave me an incredible gift of creativity, but I am not the creator. I am not the sustainer. I am not the deliverer. I am not the builder, the saver, or the healer. There is a God in heaven, and guess what? It's not me. and in that reality there is not a put down in that it is not a confrontier just an idiot what that is is a developer of humility with that realignment spiritually I have a friend who goes here to open door who's a heart surgeon I have incredible respect not only for what he does but who he is I love to hear him talk about operations and the amazing, just the thought of going into someone's chest and three, four times a day, he literally has a person's heart in his hand. And what's amazing about that is that after this guy's heart is in his hand, he's not dead. I mean, I just kind of contrast to what would happen if this guy's heart was in, like, I don't, my hand. Not only is he still alive after he's in Bill's hand, he's actually better. Well, let that in. I mean, you know, even to him, because he does it so often, there can come kind of a routine to that whole thing. And you might think, oh, heart surgery, pretty much even take that for granted. But think about that. Putting your hand in someone's physical chest and bringing to them life. Pretty heady stuff, don't you think? Do you know any doctors who are arrogant? Nah. Do you know any people who are providers who make a lot of money who are arrogant? Nah. You know any creative people who out of nothing create music and poetry and books who are arrogant? Let me tell you something. Nothing wrong at all with being creative. Writing books, poetry, music. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with making a lot of money at all. Nothing wrong at all with being gifted by God to bring healing through your hands to people. Where does the arrogance come from? Here's where the arrogance came from. Somewhere along the line, I'm going to make it simple, connect it to the text, they didn't take a Sabbath. And you know what they started thinking? That they really were the creator. That they really were the builder. That they really were the provider. That they really were the healer. I'm the healer. But how beautiful and sweet it is when men and women with gifts like that say in response to a word like this, you know what, I need to set some boundaries in my life around today where with intentionality, with the people of God, I realign my heart to this eternal truth. You are God and I am not. You are the creator, sustainer, provider, and healer, and not me. And from that comes a genuine humility. you know what God knew how we were wired God knew what we were prone to I want you to build a bond around the day and remember who God is and then I want you to let your reminder of that day bleed into Monday and Tuesday and then find Sabbaths every day as you draw on that day of Sabbath something else on a practical level that this guards against it's despair this is for one for whom things are not going well and you feel responsible for it all be the same doctor rather than three hearts in your hand and all of them were healed let's say you have a time where three hearts in your hand and all of them got worse or all of them died I don't know if that ever happens but it certainly could I would think and now rather than feeling on top of the world you're carrying the weight of the world you know what you need among other things you need a sabbath day you know what you need to realign your spirit to this eternal truth it's this there is a god in heaven and it's not you he is the creator he is the healer he is the sustainer he is the provider so cease striving and cease acting as if it's all up to you and know that I am God. It's amazing. The Sabbath day rest guards against pride. It guards against despair. It also guards against obsession. Pick a task. Whatever it is you're working on, it's not working. Whatever it is you're trying to get, respond isn't responding. Whatever it is or whatever it is you're trying to get to grow, it isn't growing. I know. I know. I can do it. I'll just try harder. I'll go along. I just won't give up. The problem is, the more you push and the more you force, the worse it gets. Can any of you relate to that? I'll just make it happen. How desperately you need a Sabbath. Or beyond physical restoration, you spiritually realign your heart to this eternal truth. There is a God in heaven, and I got news for you, it's not you. So cease striving and know that I am God. you can't fix everybody. So it is that Sabbath day rest speaks to in pictures. Physical restoration, spiritual realignment, and third, and finally, redemptive reminder. And a reminder is this. I've already told you. I'm going to fill it out a little bit more. The reminder is this, that our redemption is not a result of our working, striving, scratching, and earning, but of Christ's delivering grace. Hebrews chapter 4 verse 9 says this. There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God. And in Hebrews 4 verse 9, the Sabbath rest that is being spoken of is no longer a day where you put a bracket around it. The Sabbath rest of Hebrews 4 verse 9 is a person. Indeed, it is Christ himself, Yeshua Messiah, who in Genesis chapter 2, with the Father in the Trinity, said of the creation two things. It is good and it is finished. The work is complete. That same Jesus later said this, not of creation, but of redemption. As he hung from the cross, in effect, it is good. But right from his mouth he said this, it is what? Finished. It is complete. And because it is complete, the work of Christ, because it is finished, We, who enter into that relationship with Christ, by faith, can find rest. Not just for our bodies. Not just for our realignment, but for our eternal destiny. For it is not by works and striving for righteousness, which we might do, but according to his mercy he saved us. My biggest question this morning, relative to Sabbath rest, is not whether or not you take a day off once a week. I think that's a really good idea. In fact, it's a God idea, and I hope you find some new boundaries around your life if you're living out of control. And my biggest question this morning is not even whether you consistently observe Sabbath for spiritual realignment, as important as I believe that is for your spiritual development. My biggest question is this, whether you have entered by faith into his rest, By faith, believing that he is creator, sustainer, provider, and redeemer. There remains, therefore, a Sabbath rest for you. It's still available. It's here. It's for you. It's now. It's entered into not by striving, not by working, but by believing and receiving and resting. It's the craziest thing. But to him who does not work but believes in him, who justifies the ungodly, that's you, his faith is counted for righteousness and gives you rest. Let me close with Hebrews 4, verse 7. Today, if you hear his voice, don't harden your heart. Don't turn away. Come all the way into faith. Come all the way into rest and find there your true Shabbat, the fullness of Sabbath rest in Christ. Next week, we're going to come back to this, and I want to talk about how legalistic religion destroys the joy of Sabbath, this incredible gift that God has given us. And then I want to talk about how our overreaction to legalistic religion has blinded us to the benefit of Sabbath rest or Sabbath day rest. And then, as I said earlier, we're going to answer some questions. Why do we do Sabbath on Sunday? Is it supposed to do it on Saturday? Is it Sunday? How do I mark off a day? Real practical. How do you mark off a day and put a boundary around a day when my schedule is so nuts? How do I do that? I believe that Sabbath, this thing we're talking about, that I think we don't know much about, I think it's a gift from God who knows how we're built, who knows what we need to thrive and not be bound again to slavery. My prayer is that through these two weeks, we will rediscover as a church and as individuals this gift of Shabbat and to fully enjoy its benefits. I'd like you to stand as we close and pray. Father, I thank you that over and over again your word confirms to us, among other things, this, that you really do know us. You know how we're built and what we need, and what we need is Shabbat. We need it for our physical well-being. We need it for our spiritual realignment. But, Father, when I think of the restlessness of the human soul, especially as we just see it plastered on the 10 o'clock news and see it in our culture, There is a Sabbath rest that remains for anybody who wants it, that they can cease striving and come into right relationship with you. I thank you, God, for Sabbath. I thank you, God, for grace. Pray in Jesus' name that you would empower us, your people, to walk in this rest. In Jesus' name, amen.
