And what we've been referring to for the last several months is a journey of the heart. The latest stop on that journey has been to examine what it looks like and what it means to have a generous heart as embodied in David, whose generosity of heart was manifested in a variety of ways throughout his life that we've been looking at for several weeks, actually. But his generosity kind of culminated in 1 Chronicles 29 with the generous giving of his resources. his silver and his gold to the building of the temple near the end of his life and the the generosity of David and the giving of his stuff as it were at the end of his life kind of was the capstone of a life of generosity not just with money but with every aspect of his life he was generous with mercy he was generous with grace he was generous with his time and he was generous in a culminating way with his finances his his stuff but by this time in his story in his journey near the end of his life, the generous heart of David had infected the hearts of his people as well, who themselves had begun to give generously as well, the same way David did, resulting in two responses that we've been examining over the last couple of weeks. The first response when they got infected with this generous heart of David was joy. 1 Chronicles 29 verse 9, then the people rejoiced because they had given so willingly, for they made their offering to the Lord with a whole heart. The second response was worship. Same chapter, 10th verse, and 13th verse. So David blessed the Lord in the sight of all the assembly. And David said, blessed art thou, O Lord, God of Israel. We thank thee and praise thy glorious name. For what? What were they praising God's glorious name for? Well, it turns out that they were praising him for the capacity that he had given to them to generously give. Same chapter, 1 Chronicles 29 verse 14. For who am I, said David, and who are my people that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything we gave to you came from you. That's my slight paraphrase of that verse. In verse 16, all this abundance that we have provided to build thee a house for thy holy name is from thy hand and all of it is yours. Perspective we needed to notice there as marking this kind of generosity was this. God, it's not my stuff. All of this is thine. That was David's perspective. The experience we noted as marking this generosity was this. Just joy. Joy. Which raised for us a question that kind of defined for us our work for the last couple of weeks. and we've been examining, therefore, it's this. What kind of things can hinder us? What kind of heart conditions in particular can hinder us from embracing this perspective that David had that said it's not my stuff, from experiencing this kind of joy that David experienced and the people as well in giving with a whole heart? Well, we've dealt with four hindrances so far. Among them are these, an unbelieving and religious heart, Big hindrance or a forgetful or divided heart, big hindrance as well. Today, three more. The first is this, an already encumbered heart. An already encumbered heart can be an incredible hindrance from embracing this perspective, from experiencing this joy. Now, we've spoken of this encumbered heart thing before, but if the research is right, it has not gotten any better. at least not in the culture. Let me define what I mean for you just real briefly what I mean by an encumbered heart. Plainly stated, this is the person who at heart is generous, who desires to be generous, would really like to be more generous, but can't, literally can't be generous because every financial resource that they have is spoken for, and then some. And the then some is debt. In other words, they are encumbered. Their finances, the things that they would generously give are already tied up. But it's really not a they. They are encumbered. This is really more a we. According to the latest figures from the Federal Reserve, says William Brannigan of the Washington Post in an article this January 12, 2004. He says this, America's consumer debt has topped two trillion for the first time in history. Two trillion. Continuing what debt experts view as an alarming surge in recent years. I guess two trillion's alarming, but it's also a term I can't relate to. Two trillion, I just kind of shut down. That's just kind of a numb thing to me. So we need to make it a little closer to home where we can feel it a little more, really, According to cardfacts.com, the average family's credit card debt right now is $9,000. That's a lot of money. Robert Manning, in his book Credit Card Nation, puts it closer to $13,000 when the roughly 40% of households that pay their balances each month are taken out of that equation. In other words, 40% of the people who use credit cards pay their credit cards off every month. The 60% who are left, when you take those people out, Those people average $13,000 on their credit card. And if they're not paying it off, they're paying 18%. These people are in trouble, a lot of trouble. They are encumbered, as it were. Last year, the average American family saved less than 3% of their annual income. 80% of Americans will retire with less than $250 in savings. Personal bankruptcies and foreclosures set records every single year. A recent article in Money Magazine by Howard Dvorkin says, the number one source of tension in the average American family and the number one cause for divorce today is finances, particularly out-of-control finances. None of which, by the way, is news to you. We know this stuff. Some of us, quite frankly, don't have to go any further than our own living rooms to know that these things are true, thus begging this question, what should we do? I have some suggestions. The first is this, we need desperately to find someone or find something to blame. I mean, we're good at that. And there's lots of blame to go around. It's just not hard to do to find someone to blame. First thing we can do is blame the economy. It's a real easy target. A few years ago, it was interesting because I have done this kind of thing on debt several years ago, and the reasons that people were going in debt several years ago was because we were going through a financial boom, and everybody was getting a little frisky, and they were real confident that we would never go bust. So the reason people were getting in over their heads was because things were so good. Guess why people are in trouble now? Because things are so bad. because the economy did go bust, and now people who are near the edge have been pushed over the edge. Joshua Lahart, Justin, rather, Justin Lahart, senior writer at CNN Money Magazine, says people are now taking home equity lines of credit to pay for everyday expenses like gas and groceries and clothes. People doing that are in trouble. They are encumbered. So it's the economy. It's hard to blame in the economy. It's the industry. The industry itself could certainly shoulder some of the blame here. It's a pretty easy target to blame. I mean the credit card industry. Last year alone, banks stuffed in our mailboxes, banks stuffed our mailboxes with 2.9 billion credit card offers. Now, they didn't all come to my house. That's a lot of credit card offers. That's like nationwide. You knew that, didn't you? It's about 28 per household, And often twice that for what they identify as prime targets. Who do you think a prime target is? Might not be who you think. I kind of would have the impression that prime targets for credit cards are people who really had a lot of money. Well, we'll give them credit cards because they'll be faithful and pay them off. According to the industry itself, the three fastest growing prime target groups are these. Number one, low-income and credit-blemished consumers who never would have qualified for credit a generation ago. That's number one. Number two, prime target group, is people who've just lost their job. And the pitch to people who've just lost their job is this. We're here to help. No, they aren't. And the assumption is this. On people who just lost their job who maybe get a credit card, it's this. You know, if they're sending me a card, they must think I can afford it, so maybe I can. They didn't just give you a life preserver. They gave you an anchor. Right down to the bottom. Third prime target for the credit card industry, identified by them, is college campuses. Paul Winski, in an article he wrote for the Kansas City Star, tells the story of a girl named Michelle Hayes, a student at the University of Kansas, who got up to three credit cards in her mail a week. They all said the same thing. Michelle says. You deserve this, Michelle. You've worked hard. It's time for you. You can have whatever you want, and you can have it. Now it was like feeding an addict, she said. By the time Michelle graduated, she had $15,000 in credit card debt to say nothing of her college loans, so it's the credit card industry that's to blame, except that none of what the credit card industry does to get us to go into debt way in over our heads would work if we didn't have a disease that I talked about a couple of years ago called affluenza. Remember that? Now, I first heard about this through an article in a magazine called Experience Life. It was also a PBS documentary, and actually this thing runs every once in a while on Channel 2 or the PBS network. In the article, identified affluenza, and I'm quoting here, as one of the most virulent social diseases of our time. Affluenza has many symptoms. Among them are these, bulging closets, cupboards, shelves, and drawers, particularly if they're stuffed with unworn clothes, unread books, unheard CDs, unused toys, gadgets, electronics, etc., and bloated credit cards. More people go to shopping malls than go to church. We spend more money on jewelry and watches than we do on higher education. We give lip service. This is a secular magazine. We give lip service to family values and spiritual growth, but we spend more hours accumulating material goods than we do at virtually anything else. Like any other disease, the article goes on to say, affluenza takes hold of us by finding weak spots in our immune system. In this case, it's a psychological immune system. To get through and wear down that system, affluenza needs an in. And two of the most powerful agents to get that in are these. Number one, dissatisfaction. And number two, easy money. Credit cards. Here's how it works. The less happy you are with yourself or your life, the more stuff one tends to buy to try to feel better. The more compulsively you spend, the more likely you are to accumulate debt. The more debt you accumulate, the worse you feel, stirring you to maybe spend some more money to buy some more stuff to try to feel better, or at least for a while until you feel bad again. Now you're in what is obviously an addictive cycle. At the end of that article, by the way, there's a test you could take to diagnose yourself to see if you had this. My favorite was this. If you have more credit cards than friends. You might have affluenza. But after we're done figuring out who to blame, it's the economy, it's the industry, it's us, beat ourselves up for a while. The question we must answer is this, what kind of steps must we take? What kind of things must we do to break this cycle that so powerfully mitigates against the possibility of us experiencing the freedom and joy of a generous heart, the possibility of ever embracing the perspective of David that says, it's not my stuff, or experiencing the joy of David in this generous kind of giving, how do you break that cycle? Well, I'm not going to give you a big long list on this. Partly because of how convinced I am that hearing a sermon about being encumbered with debt will not get anybody out of debt. I'm just going to give you a couple really good pieces of advice. Number one, get past feeling bad about this. If you're encumbered by this, you feel bad about this. It doesn't do you any good. Get past just feeling bad about this. Number two, openly and honestly acknowledge this. Number three, get some concrete help to change this, to remedy this, to do something about this. You need to know. You need to know that if you're encumbered like this, you are not alone. You are not the only person. This is an us, not a you. Many of us are struggling with this. Number two, you need to know that there is help. It's one of the reasons in the bulletin, actually, today, we put near the end of the bulletin, I'm not sure exactly what page it is, but there's an invitation to come to, to get involved in Good Sense Ministry. We put that there just as one illustration of a concrete thing that you can do that we would make available to you. I would encourage you to call the church office if you're struggling with this, and we have resources, we have places that we can invite you into to help you with some of these things in concrete ways. We have people that we can refer. This is, I'm going to quit preaching about this. You need to do something about this. Because one of the primary hindrances, beloved, to embracing David's perspective on his stuff, to experiencing his joy in generously giving, is an already encumbered heart. And many of you know exactly what I'm talking about. Another hindrance is this, a fearful heart. It's interesting, in the course of this study, as I've been identifying certain hindrances, A number of you have come to me and said, you know, Dave, that really was a big one that you mentioned, and those are really important relative to hindrances that relate, but you know, the biggest one for me is fear. Fear. That if I give, that if I release resources, I will not have. So, out of fear. And it looks like greed, but in a lot of ways, it's just out of fear. I grasp and I clutch because I'm afraid. Into that fear, I want to speak a word, and it's not a big word. It's not a long word. I'm not going to complicate you. I'm going to give you real simple things this morning. Into that fear, I will only say this, what God said in Malachi 3. You try me now in this, says the Lord. you put me to the test and see if when you bring into the storehouse the whole tithe, I don't open for you the windows of heaven and pour out on you a blessing until it overflows. Feel the energy of what God's saying here. You try me now in this. I'm not kidding you. I'm not preaching to you. I'm pushing you here a little bit. I dare you. It's almost as if God says, here the picture I get as it relates to what it takes to break sometimes the power of fear in our lives is that it takes the very same kind of thing that we talked about a few weeks ago as it needing to take to break the power of mammon. And breaking the power of mammon comes when you begin to release. Sometimes the only thing that breaks the power of fear relative to giving is to look that fear right in the face and give right in its face. You try me now on this. You try me now on this, says the Lord. You put me to the test. But you know, all of this stuff about pressing through our fear to move into a generous heart really comes down to something very, very basic. It really comes down to believing God, to trusting God. The question, you see, is this. If I give, will I have? If I release, will he supply? Those are very real questions. Those are scary questions. And until I'm positive, I just keep hanging on. Into those questions and into that fear, hear the word of the Lord through Paul. Say this in 2 Corinthians 9, 10, that he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, I promise you, will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness, you will be enriched in everything which through us is producing thanksgiving to God. Now, I could exegete that, and I could break down the Greek words, and I could expound and go round and round that thing, but the bottom line on that verse relative to breaking the power of fear in terms of giving is this. Do you believe that? Or don't you? Do you believe what Paul says in Philippians 4.19, when he says, and this is my paraphrase, of the verses preceding Philippians 4.19, you don't have to worry about, you don't have to worry now that you've given to meet my needs. The verses just preceding verse 19 are dealing with the fact that the Macedonians, the Philippians, out of their poverty, had financially supported Paul in his ministry. And Paul says, I have received everything in full, and I have now in abundance. And because you've done that, Philippians 4, 19, because you've released, pressed through your fear and given, here's the deal for you. My God shall supply all your needs according to his riches and glory in Christ Jesus. But here's the question. Do you believe that or don't you? And we can dance all we want around that. It really comes down to that. See, this breaking the grip of fear, which is such a hindrance to the experiencing of a generous heart really comes down to believing God, to trusting God, to obeying God. Which leads to the third and final hindrance, to embracing David's perspective on his stuff, to experiencing his joy, and that is this. The last hindrance is this. An immature, irresponsible, even disobedient heart is an incredible hindrance to embracing this perspective, experiencing this joy. It couldn't have been much fun to have been the pastor of the Corinthian church. It actually couldn't have been much fun to have been part of the Corinthian church because the Corinthian church was made up of people. I mean, imagine going to a church like this. Some of you have, and it's not any fun. the Corinthian church was made up of people who by and large were immature irresponsible and disobedient to God and people like that and this is what's weird though redeemed they were redeemed everything we hear from first Corinthians is continually confirming that these are people in Christ but they were immature irresponsible disobedient and people who are like that even though they're redeemed they hardly ever embraced David's perspective on stuff, and they hardly ever experienced the joy. Hardly ever. We get a sense of their condition in 1 Corinthians 3, when Paul laments their condition, saying this, I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but as to people of flesh, as to babes in Christ. That's the only language you understood. Very fundamental baby stuff. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not able to bear it. What would it be? It would be the deep things of God, the exciting places of God, and the things he wants you to experience. We couldn't go there. Indeed, even now, and what's implied there is this, after all this time, even now, you're still not able to bear the deep things of God, the exciting places of God, And the profound calls of God on your life to move into a community and bring the kingdom of God. You can't do that. You can't even walk yet. The picture I have of them is this, that the Corinthian church was the spiritual equivalent of a 21-year-old kid who still acts like a 12-year-old. Now, is that a hard image for you to imagine? You ever meet anybody who was 21 years old but still acted like a 12-year-old? Some of you are going, that's my kid. That's what my kid is. Well, I think I have some 21-year-olds, and our youngest right now is 21, and I mean, I think he's wonderful, and he's mature sometimes. But that is the truth. I mean, he does. He goes, our kids all at that age were kind of in this place where they were as mature as they could possibly be, and they were as mature as a 21-year-old ought to be, and then they would kind of act like a 12-year-old. Can I tell you what it's like? And you already know what it's like to be around or live with a 21-year-old who acts like a 12-year-old. Whatever the experience is, it's not fun. It's not fun. For a number of reasons. But among them are these. The problem with a 21-year-old who still acts like a 12-year-old is that 21-year-olds, because they're 21, are expecting some things. A 21-year-old is expecting to be able to revel in new grown-up freedoms. Because I'm 21, so I can do whatever I want. It's good. And 21-year-olds, because they're 21, are expecting to take advantage of some new grown-up opportunities. I'm going to be able to do some things and accomplish some things and go some places that I could never go when I was 12. But how many of you as parents know this? Without a corresponding embracing of responsibility, this 21-year-old relative to freedom, their freedom is going to become chaos, and their opportunities are going to be lost. Making their immaturity not so much an evil thing as a disappointing thing and a horribly limiting thing. think about somebody who's 21 acts like they're 12 what I would in my mind envision of someone like that is this that while I may really love this guy or this girl 21 year old who acts like they're 12 I might have great affection for this person but if I'm their parent or if I'm their boss. I'm not going to trust a 21-year-old who acts like a 12-year-old with anything really important. Tracking with me on that? You need to know that there's something about our God who deals with us very much the same way. He loves us like crazy. We're his son. We're his daughter. Couldn't love us more. But you know what? Till you grow up, Corinthian church, I can't, I'm not given you the important stuff in the kingdom of God. There are things you're not going to be able to do. There are places you will never go. Things you will never see. Again, making immaturity, irresponsibility in the kingdom of God, the kind that the Corinthians manifested, not so much an evil thing. They weren't evil as it is a disappointing, severely limiting things. See, there are just certain things that steadfastly immature people will never enjoy. There are certain places they will never go. There are certain realities of life in the kingdom of God that they will never know. Certain heights they will never reach. Certain potentials and possibilities in the kingdom of God that they will never realize. Redeemed, sure. But the fulfillment of destiny, no. doesn't make him evil it's just incredibly sad I couldn't speak to you as spiritual men and women how sad we just we couldn't talk about anything but baby stuff there are certain places deep places exciting places change the world places that you will never go unless you grow up we have referred to it often here at Open Door it's actually now after all these years it has become in my mind a kind of sacred place in our corporate journey when 12 years ago and this is something that new people wouldn't know about, but if you've been with us on the journey, 12 years ago, we hit what we called the wall, where in a number of arenas, there were some things about our immaturity as a church that God just said, ready to look at this? And we said, yeah, we are. Remember the word that God gave to us during that season in our life? And we embraced it, and I think it was one of the keys to God's bringing us to some new places and new opportunities, the word God gave us was this. Remember, grow up or what? Die. Were we evil 12 years ago? No. No. Did God love us? Yes. Were we limited? Unbelievably so. In a variety of places, among them financially. The idea of a building was just like, are you kidding me? If you were here 12 years ago, we know. We even said in this pulpit, we're putting that whole thing on hold. We, you know, this is weird. Remember? We even referred to ourselves as an adolescent church and people like that don't buy houses. You know why we were limited financially in those days? Here's why. Because immature, irresponsible hearts aren't generous hearts. Immature, an immature, irresponsible heart is an incredible hindrance to generosity. It's an incredible hindrance to embracing David's perspective about his stuff or experiencing his joy about his giving because immature, irresponsible people just don't go there. Which doesn't make them evil. It's just sad, incredibly limiting. All of which was abundantly apparent in this Corinthian church. It's interesting to note, and you can do a study of your own on this if you want, and I'm pretty sure this will be borne out in your study, that in both 1 and 2 Corinthians, there's a lot of stuff on giving and finances. In fact, what I think would be borne out is that I'm pretty sure that there is more teaching on giving and finances in 1 and 2 Corinthians than just about any other place. specific instruction relative to people's responsibility there than any other place. But if you read 1 and 2 Corinthians, you're going to pick it up pretty quick if you pick up the drama, the context of it. It's not like Paul's doing a seminar, like saying, you know, Saturday afternoon we're going to have Good Sense Ministry, and we're just going to invite you to come in and we'll talk about, you know, kind of where we're at and just some of what God says about our money and how we can handle it and, you know, just need this teaching. That's not the temperature of 1 and 2 Corinthians because almost all the teaching comes in the context of a very big confrontation. In 2 Corinthians 8, for example, the whole point of that chapter was that the Corinthians, consistent with their immaturity, had promised to give to a certain thing and even had begun to give, but they didn't follow through, which is what adolescents do. I mean, if you're a parent of adolescence, I mean, you're always saying that to your kids. You know, you gotta finish. Adolescents don't. That's why they need parents. Verse 10 of chapter 8, 2 Corinthians, Paul says this, you guys were, you were the first to give a year ago. You got all emotional. Oh, yeah, we will. You were the first one. You signed on. There was a readiness and a desire, and that's good. Verse 11, but now finish doing it also. that just as there was the readiness and desire to do it, so there may also be the completion of it. What I want you to hear there is this. He's not talking to mature adults. You don't have to say that to mature adults. Adults follow through. Like many adolescents, the Corinthians were what I would call emotional givers. When the appeal is made, the heart is stirred, a tear is shed, a promise is made, I really want to do it. And that even reflects at some level a good heart. I want to do that. But they don't follow through. Again, not because they're evil, but if they're immature, the reason they don't follow through is because by this time in their life, emotionally developed, spiritually developed, they do not have the structure of discipline in life to follow through. to, in kind of a phrase, pay their bills. Adults pay their bills because they understand something of responsibility. Adolescents have a hard time with that. It's about growing up. It doesn't make them bad. They just need to grow up. It's why Paul in 1 Corinthians 16, 2 says this, to these same people, okay, you guys, on the first day of every week, Let each one of you put aside and save. Now, I'm not making fun of that teaching. That's a very important teaching, but you don't have to say that to adults. Adults will figure it out. No, okay, you haven't figured it out. Okay, here's one way. On the first day of every week, put aside and save so you can do what in your heart you desire to do so you can follow through. A couple of weeks ago, Here at Open Door, in our desire to deal strongly and tangibly with the grip of mammon that I had described in the sermon that Sunday, we did an amazing thing. And if you were here, you know that was an amazing Sunday that we had together. Where at the end of the service, we decided to do two things. To redirect our gaze from the gold to the glory. To remember the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. And the way we did that was to enter at the end of the service into worship. And we redirected. Turn your eyes on Jesus. Look full in his wonderful face. The things of earth grow strangely dim in the light of something brighter and better, his glory, his grace. But then we said we need to do something tangible. We're going to release our resources and symbolically and really break the grip of mammon. You walked out the door. We put buckets at the door, and you released $60,000 that day. Just as the Spirit of God moved. And then we made the promise to you because this was a discipline everybody needed to enter into that whatever you released, we would release as well. and that money's gone. Exciting. That was profoundly spiritual response. That was an emotional response. I do not by that mean immature, but it was an emotional, spontaneous response. 60,000 bucks. Incredible. But for me, the most encouraging thing about that day, when everything was said and done relative to what it spoke to me to us about our maturity as a people, is that on that day that we did something as a church that was very spontaneous, on that very same day, we as a church did something that was very responsible as well. Because in the taking of the general offering, we didn't make a comment, we didn't make an appeal, we just took the offering the way we always do, before we made the emotional response for the big release at the end. And on that Sunday, with no special appeal, the general offering was $150,000. About $40,000, $50,000 more than what we normally need for a weekend on that Sunday. Which means, as I just kind of look at what happened there, that something really exciting in terms of spontaneous, emotional, spirit-directed giving happened, but something very responsible happened as well. It's not as exciting, but we paid our bills. That's what grown-ups do. and it stands in my mind as a symbol beloved of what a rightly ordered generous heart looks like because a rightly ordered generous heart marked by maturity will give first of all responsibly to provide for family in a family context to provide for family to take care of home then give spontaneously to the promptings of the Spirit, to the needs you see around you, to initiatives that you believe in. But the problem around that is this. For many of us, spontaneous and emotional giving is way more exciting than responsible giving. In fact, I know some people, and you can kind of just tell that some people get the feeling that the spontaneous giving, where you're just listening to God and you give and you don't, your right hand doesn't know what you're like, is more spiritual than responsible giving. Partly because a lot of us don't even know what our responsibility is relative to giving. In fact, a lot of people who have gone here to open door for many, many years don't know what their responsibility is. relative to giving. And I need to stand here and tell you that if that's the truth, I haven't taught this well. And I need to come to you with the spirit of a father who says, you know what? My kids, I'm glad we can be buddies, but every once in a while we have to have a talk that calls you to some things. Every once in a while, I actually do hear this. Not very often. And it's not just in our church. I hear this from people in our church sometimes, but I hear it from other people as well. And I'll hear something like this. You know, I give a lot of money. This stuff I'm giving is really good. But I don't give to our church. I don't give to open doors. I don't give to the church I go to. I don't give there. I need to, without sounding in any way condescending, to come with the spirit of a father who would say to the kids once in a while, we need to talk here. listen to what the apostle paul says about the responsibility we have to financially support the ministry endeavor that directly cares for and feeds your soul now let me say that last phrase so i can bring a clarification to it the ministry endeavor that directly cares for and feeds your soul. The responsibility you have to support that. The clarification is this. I'm not talking right now to visitors. I'm not talking right now to seekers. I am not talking right now to people who don't believe in what this ministry is doing, who are not receiving care for their souls, who are not receiving food for them. I'm not talking to anybody like that. In fact, let me get it away from open door. If you are going to a church, and if you're going to this church, and you're going to a church that doesn't care for your soul and isn't feeding your soul, get out of there. And if this church isn't caring for your soul and feeding your soul, get out of here for your soul's sake. So I'm not talking to any of those people when I bring what Paul says when he says to these Corinthians who didn't know some things. And by the way, that puts another category in here that needs to be interjected. It's not always an immature, irresponsible heart. Sometimes it's an uninformed heart. Here's what Paul says to that chapter 9, verse 13. Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the food of the temple, and those who attend regularly to the altar have their share with the altar? Verse 14. So also the Lord directed those. This is a command of the Lord that those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel. The Lord directed those. Where did he do that? In the word direct, he commanded this. A couple of places. One is Matthew 10.10. Another is Luke 10.7. They both say the same thing where Jesus says this. The worker is worthy of his support. And further on in both of those gospels, Jesus goes on to say, and if they don't receive you and if they don't support you, bless them and move on. In fact, it says, shake the dust off your sandals and go. if they don't want to accept that responsibility 1st Corinthians 9 9 says Paul says for it is written in the law of Moses you shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing God is not concerned about the oxen is he or is he speaking altogether for our sake yes for our sake it was written because the plow man ought to plow in hope and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops And this actually, the 11th verse, is the key verse. It says it all to me. It kind of culminates things. It says this, Paul saying, If we sowed spiritual life into your soul, is it too much if we, that is Paul and his ministry team, if you will, if we should reap material things from you? It's a rhetorical question. The answer is no, it's not too much. Now, I back up off that thing, and I kind of get into the drama of what's really going on in there and I wonder things. Like I wonder if Paul was embarrassed to have to say this stuff. Well, actually, I think he was. In fact, there is some evidence from places like 2 Corinthians 11 and 12, if you read it, that he's speaking of this very thing of financial support and he uses words like feeling foolish and embarrassed and even humiliated. So I think there was an element of needing to say things that felt awkward to say, but mostly I think it just made him sad. Why? Because their lack of formation in this area of life wasn't so much evil. He loved these people. They weren't evil people. But he knew that their lack of formation in this arena wasn't so much evil. It was just disappointing and severely limiting. He knew, he knew because he understood how the kingdom of God worked, that there were just some places in the kingdom of God that these beloved people would never go. There were some things that they would never see, never hear, never do, never experience. So he spoke to them like a father and said, come on, come on. But there are many things that hinder us from developing a generous heart. There are many things that hinder us from embracing David's perspective that's not my stuff. From experiencing his joy of generous giving, we've dealt with seven over the last few weeks. From an unbelieving religious heart to a forgetful, divided heart to an already encumbered, fearful, immature, maybe uninformed heart. none of which are evil things as much as they are limiting things to what God can do to and through people like you and me. With all of that in mind, I want to close with this word. In just a few weeks, actually it's going to be the Sunday after Easter. I'd like you to mark your calendars on this. we are going to begin to roll out our vision to you. We've already been doing this to some degree, well, to a pretty significant degree, to some small group meetings and some membership meetings and people that we kind of have identified as what we would call the owners, the people that are really carrying the ministry here. But the week after Easter, I'm going to preach it. And I don't know if it's going to be a week or two or whatever. You know how those things go. But we want to talk about where it is we believe that God is calling us to go as a church and the invitations he is extending to us and this vision, you just need to know, it comes out of our journey. It's very consistent with who we have been, it's consistent with who we are, and it is consistent with where we believe God's calling us to go and who God is calling us to be and who God is calling us to reach. Without going into the details, I can tell you this, I absolutely believe that even in the context of the journey, how long we've been here, the dark things we've gone through, the deep places we've gone, the maturing we've gone through, I believe that we really are in ways that are substantial and not just rah-rah-sis-boom-bah, in ways that are substantial and deeply felt by many among us. We are coming into some of the most significant, impacting days that this church has ever known in this community and in this city for the sake of the kingdom of God. But we are not going to go where God is calling us to go. We are not going to see what God would like us to see with unbelieving hearts. It doesn't happen with religious hearts. It doesn't happen with forgetful, divided hearts. We won't go there with already encumbered hearts or fearful hearts or immature or even uninformed hearts. For I believe that the future God is calling us as a church to in this community and in this city is going to require full of faith hearts, full of grace hearts. It's going to require undivided hearts, unencumbered hearts, bold hearts, fearless hearts, mature, responsible, obedient hearts. It's going to require generous hearts just like David's. And just like Christ's, Christ who gave everything he had. Let's pray as we close. To see what we have never seen. To do what we have never done. To go where we, as a people, as a church, have never gone. is my request, is our desire and request. God, prepare our hearts for this great work. I pray in Jesus' name and all God's people said, Amen, Amen. Amen.
