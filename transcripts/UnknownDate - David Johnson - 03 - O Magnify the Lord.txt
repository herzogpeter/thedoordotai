to reverence the name of God. Oh, magnify the Lord with me, says the psalmist in Psalm 34, verse 3, and let us exalt his name together. It's a community thing. Together we put God's name up high. And when I think of that psalm, it makes me wonder. If in some small way in the heart of the psalmist that was a response to the third commandment in the law. The third commandment in the law that we dealt with last week, which says this, you shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. To bring God's name down into a place of vanity. You might remember from last week, the word vain means worthlessness, uselessness, emptiness. Don't reduce the name of God to nothingness, to a place where it is void of meaning and value, primarily because, and there's many reasons, but one is this in a practical level, if the name of God is reduced by whatever means, either by triviality, which we talked about quite extensively last week, or profanity, or even manipulation, using God's name to get other people to do what you want. If who God really is and what he really does is drained of meaning, that it makes it very difficult to take the name seriously. It's trivialized over and over again to believe that in that name there just might be some hope, that in that name there just might be some wisdom and power and healing. Because if you don't take God seriously, then why on earth would you follow him? Why on earth would you obey him, submit to him, worship him? You wouldn't. Most people don't. which is at least part of why, I think, the psalmist says, O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together, recognizing ways that we may even subconsciously have reduced his name. Let's kind of do some work, even corporately, to put his name up back where it belongs. Jesus said it this way in Matthew 6 and Luke 11, in the context of teaching his disciples how to pray. Pray then this way, our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. The term hallowed, it's not one that we commonly use, but instinctively I think we know that it speaks to something uniquely treasured, uniquely valued and revered. We might speak of the hallowed halls of some institution and some revered or renowned university. And what we mean when we say that is that the walls, that within the walls of that place, that some wonderful things have taken place, making that place a treasure, valued, revered kind of place. So to hallow something is to attach to it value. It's to give to it honor, to, in a phrase, recognize its worth. I love the story of the antique collector who is an expert in his field. I mean, he really knows antiques quite well. He's browsing through this antique store, and most of what he's looking at is junk, and he knows that because he's an expert. When he noticed on the floor a cat drinking from a large saucer-like bowl that he immediately identified, not the cat but the saucer, as being from the Ming Dynasty in China, therefore priceless, worth a fortune. Assuming the owner has no idea what it's worth, he assumes that because he's letting the cat drink milk out of it, he sees this as an opportunity to pull a fast one, make a fortune, so he devises a little scheme in his mind where he expresses interest in the cats. I noticed your cat. It's a beautiful cat. I love cats. And my kids, my kids have been bugging me about wanting a cat. And I was just wondering, you know, this is crazy. If you're not too attached, would you consider selling your cat? I mean, I'd give you $100. Well, said the owner, I don't know. I'm actually not sure that cat is worth $100. But I mean, if it would mean that much to you, and especially if it would mean that much to your kids, sure, sure, the cat's yours, you can buy it. Great, I'm so happy, said the antique collector, but the wheels are still turning because then he says, oh, by the way, you know, I think I'm going to need something to feed him out of, and I just noticed that bowl. How about that bowl? I'll give you a couple extra bucks for that. No, I can never do that. See, that bowl is actually a piece from the Ming Dynasty in China. It's worth a fortune, but it's the strangest thing, he said, Because ever since I started putting milk in it, I've sold 17 cats. See, all of us are used to attaching value to things. We hallow things. Sometimes things not worthy of it. Like cats. Yeah, boo. But sometimes we do just the opposite. Where things of great value. and infinite worths do not get by us highly valued at all, often because we don't know what they are. We don't know what we have. In fact, most of us wouldn't recognize a bull from the Ming dynasty if it was staring us in the face, which is at least part of why the psalmist says in Psalm 34, you need a discipline in your life of figuring out ways to, and figuring out what it means to magnify the Lord with me, to exalt His name together so that who He really is, what He really does might be made visible, might be made known, so let us exalt His name. But it raises a question. And it may sound like a weird question at first, but here's the question. Well, what is His name? I mean, to exalt His name, we just say God really loud or say it very reverently. What is his name? Actually, one of the reasons I bring that up is because it's a question that Moses asked of God in Exodus chapter 3, verse 13. So it's in the kind of proximity of the story we've been dwelling in for the last several weeks. The context of the question is significant because it's coming at a time when God is calling Moses out. God has been with Moses, and Moses has been with and known God for quite a while by the time this happens. But now God is calling him to kind of a scary place where he's calling him to do something extraordinary that is clearly beyond his capacity to do. And that is to be the person that God uses to bring the people out of Egypt. Chapter 3, verse 7, it's kind of where the story or the drama, the call begins when God explains it this way. Moses, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt. I have given heed to their cry. I am aware of their sufferings. so I have come down to deliver them from, and if you just stop there, you get this feeling that it's just God kind of magically going, wow, I'm going to call you out some way. He's just going to wave a magic wand, but it doesn't stop there. I am coming down to deliver them from, but I am not going to do this with a magic wand. Indeed, I'm going to use you, Moses, and your obedience to me, and if you don't obey me, it probably isn't going to happen, but I'm going to use you and through you I am going to accomplish my purpose in the world, to which Moses, understandably, I think, says in Exodus 3.11, Oh, but who am I to be entrusted to this kind of responsibility, to which God says, in effect, in verse 12, Moses, you need to understand it's not about who you are, it's about who I am, and I am with you, to which Moses says, Who are you? what is your name? Now, again, I just told you that God had been with Moses, Moses with God for quite a while when this happened, so in some ways it's kind of a weird question. What you need to understand, however, is this. When Moses is asking for God's name, he is not asking God, what do I call you? It's not his question. The question is, what are you like? God, you're calling me to this scary place of obedience, and so I need to know that if I obey you, what can I expect from you? Will you be with me? Or am I on my own? What is your name? What are you like? In biblical times, we've talked about this before. Names were very, very significant. We give names to our children. And I'm sure many, many think deeply about the name and it has significance. But some just kind of, I like that name. And so, whatever. But in biblical times, names had significance beyond what I would call you. A person's name spoke to their heart, to character. Even their mission in life. For example, Eve was named Eve because she was the mother of all creation. Abraham was called Abraham because he was the father of many nations. It's what Abraham means. It's what Abraham does. He fathers. So if your name is Killer, for instance, it's not just what I call you. It's what I would expect of you to kill. It's also why I would stay away from you. So when Moses asks, what is your name? He's not asking, what do I call you? He's asking, what can I expect? What's the truth about your heart, your character, your mission, particularly as he's being called into this scary place of risky obedience? What can I expect of you? Will I have access to you as I step into this place of obedience, or will you be distant? Are you involved in our lives, or am I, are we on our own? What shall I tell the people, actually, about your heart? What is your name? Now, God's answer to Moses came in Exodus 14, the very next verse, where this cryptic thing he says is this. God says, I am who I am, which is a very unsatisfying answer. I mean, there's all sorts of theology around this thing, and I'm not going to go into all of that. But if God says, I am who I am, I think, well, so am I. That's a bit funnier than you think. It just doesn't seem helpful. I am who I am. Well, what do you need to dial into? To understand what he's meaning, what he's saying when he says, I am who I am, is that God has already been telling Moses who he is. For what God had already been revealing to him and saying to him, in fact, just a few verses previous to this interaction about who he was, was this, Exodus 3, verses 6 through 8. I am Moses, the God of your father. That's who I am. I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This speaks to eternality. This speaks to some being with you for some time. And I am the God who saw your affliction when you thought I wasn't looking. That's who I am. I am the God who heard your cries when you thought I wasn't listening. That's who I am. And Moses, just between you and me, I am the God who saw you as a little baby in the reeds when you were abandoned as a child who was with you in the desert when you fled like a fugitive and lived like a failure. And Moses, I am with you now. As you step into this scary place of risky obedience, which is precisely what Moses needed to know about God's name, will I be alone? Not necessarily. Will I be successful? There were going to be many, many trials, and many times when it felt like they were making no progress after they got out of Egypt. If you got into the day-to-day experience, It wasn't this happy, everything, magic wand happens. Well, I need to know that if I step into this long experience of following you this way, that you are with me. God, in a variety of ways, says, that's my name. Interesting, because a few chapters later, Moses and the people of God would need to know something else about his name. Exodus 33, the deliverance out of Egypt has happened. They've crossed the Red Sea. but the people of God, having already been redeemed, had begun to wander away. They broke their vows with God playing the harlot in a spiritual sense, had they. So now the question came again, what is your name? And the reason they needed to know his name, again, not what do we call you, but what are you like, is because their hearts had been broken and they saw their sin and they were wondering, having wandered away from the groom, will he want us back? so here's the quote what's your name we need to know your name not what do we call you but what kind of god are you are you vengeful do you pay back in kind how do you respond to people like us who are broken over their sin and are wondering can we come back home or not reveal to us your character moses said it this way show to us your glory which is another way of saying show to us your character. So God says in Exodus 33, I will reveal to you my glory. I will reveal to you my character by proclaiming to you my name. My name is, Exodus 34, verse 6, my name is, I will be gracious. My name is, I will show compassion, for I am eternally the Lord, The Lord, your God. I am compassionate, gracious, slow to anger. That is my name. That's what I do. Abounding in loving kindness and truth. Who keeps loving kindness for thousands. Who forgives iniquity, transgression, and sin. That is my name. That's who I am. It's what I do, and it's what you can expect. If you desire to return in repentance to me, what you can expect from me is forgiveness. It's my name. and as the story progresses beloved of God with his people the revelation of God's name goes on like that in Exodus 15 they come to a place called Merah and God says I am Jehovah Rapha the God who heals because that's what they needed to know and healing at Merah was not a magic wand the question is when you need healing physically when you need healing spiritually emotionally the question is, God, if I step in, if I begin to follow you into healing, if I begin to follow your way, will there be healing for you? God says, you need to know that's my name. Start coming home. To Gideon, he said, I am Jehovah Shalom, the God of peace. That's who I am. It's what I do. In the book of Numbers, he tells the people that they want to know my name, here's my name. I am the cloud by day. I'm the pillar of fire by night. In Deuteronomy, his name is Refuge. He is the city of refuge. In 1 and 2 Samuel, he's the trusted prophet. In 1 Kings and 1 Chronicles, he's the reigning king. In Ezra, he's the faithful scribe. In Nehemiah, he's the rebuilder of everything that's broken. Hear that again. God is the rebuilder of everything that's broken, and it gets manifested in the story of Nehemiah. You read that story, you see the faithfulness of Nehemiah and the rebuilding, that's who I am as well. That is my name in Job, he's our redeemer who forever stands with us even through pain and psalms. He is our shepherd. In Proverbs, he is wisdom. In the Song of Solomon, he's the beautiful bridegroom. In Daniel, he's the fourth man in the fiery furnace. In Amos, he's the bearer of the burden. In Haggai, he's the restorer of the lost heritage. He's the restorer of the lost heritage. That's about family and legacy. In Zechariah, he is our fountain of life. In Malachi, he is the son of righteousness with healing in his wings. That is my name. And in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, he is the Christ, the son of the living God. In Romans, he is the justifier. In 1 Corinthians, he is the resurrection. In 2 Corinthians, he is the sin bearer. In Galatians, he is amazing grace. He is amazing grace. It's what he does. It's who he is. In Ephesians, he is the unsearchable riches of God. In Philippians, he is the slave, obedient unto death. In Colossians, he is the fullness of the Godhead in a bodily form. In 1 and 2 Thessalonians, he is the coming king. In Titus, he is the blessed hope. In Philemon, he is the friend who sticks closer than a brother, who sticks closer than a brother. And in Hebrews, he is the blood of the everlasting covenant. In 1 and 2 Peter, he is the chief shepherd. In Jude, he is the lover coming for his bride. And in Revelation, he is the king of kings, and he is the Lord of lords. Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. But wait a minute, wait a minute. Because I think that magnifying the Lord involves more than saying great things about him. It does involve that, and to use language and prose to describe God is very important, but it involves more than saying great things about him or singing great things about him. Remember God's dream. We've been talking about this for several weeks in the context of following the rabbi. God's great dream for his creation was that in partnership with him, his people, would actually not only receive from him who he is, receive forgiveness and grace, but that his people actually would become like him, the light of the world, and then partnering with him to bring, to Kunalam, to bring a new kind of life, a new kind of world. His dream was that we ourselves would not just receive his forgiveness, because that's his name, but that we would become like him, meaning we would become forgivers ourselves. That we, his dream, was that we would become healers ourselves, shalom bringers ourselves, that we would be cities of refuge, faithful scribes, that we would be rebuilders of everything that's broken, good shepherds, burden bearers, amazing grace bringers, servants, that we would become servants, obedient unto death. And that kind of spin on this makes me wonder, If more than anything we say or anything we sing, that that is what it means to magnify the Lord with me, to make God visible in the world, and that that's what it means to exalt his name together. It brings us to the table. And as we come this morning, I want you to come with two things, two wonderings, maybe. First thing I want you to wonder about and bring to the table is wonder about what you need to receive from who he is. What do you need to know today relative to your actual life? What do you need to know about his name? Because, see, some of you really need to know that his name is, I am compassionate and gracious. And some of you need to know that his name is, I forgive sin. That's my name. That's what I do. Some of you are being called by God to face some horrible things. some addictions in your life. And you need to know, God, if I begin to enter into this process, is there healing? And you need to know God saying, that is my name. So come and follow me and walk away from that and come toward me. There's another thing to wonder about, not just what you need from him, but what do you need to become? Because as he forgives, some of you really need to know he's calling you to be a forgiver. And as he heals, he's calling some of you to be a healer. oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together oh praise the fire in Jesus Let angels sing and fall Sing out the howled sweet refrain Crown him Lord of all Oh sing the mighty power of God That made the mountains rise That spread the flowing seas abroad and build the lofty skies. Magnify the Lord, exalt His name and sing with me. Magnify the Lord, exalt His name, the King of kings. Ye chosen ones of Israel's race Delivered from the fall Praise Him who saves you by His grace Crown the Lord of all Let every person ever try All creatures great and small To Him, O Majesty, scribe Crown the Lord of all Magnify the Lord Taught His name and sing with me Magnify the Lord, exalt His name, the King of kings Cloud by day, fire by night, holy prophet, faithful scribe. He's beginning and the end He our strength, our faithful friend Son of God, Word of God Sent by God, loved by God He rebuilds, restores, redeems He our hope, our coming King Magnify the Lord, exalt His name and sing with me Magnify the Lord, exalt His name, the King of kings. Magnify the Lord, exalt His name, sing with me. Magnify the Lord, exalt His name, the King of kings. Magnify the Lord, exalt His name, sing with me.
