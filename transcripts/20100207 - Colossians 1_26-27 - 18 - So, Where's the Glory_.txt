Amen. Alexander McLaren, who was a pastor, teacher, expositor of the Word of God back in the 1940s, in his exposition of the book of Acts, particularly the book of Acts 18, where he was reflecting on what Paul was going through in Acts 18, some difficult things actually, said this, reflecting on Paul, but it kind of applies to all of us, that it's the prerogative of God to be immutable, that is unchanging. We humans, however, have no such choice. We have our moods, our fluctuations. No human hand has ever drawn an absolutely straight line in life. That is the ideal of the mathematician. But all our lines are crooked. All of them are crooked. No human life has ever been a continuous, unbroken series of equally holy and devoted thoughts and acts. We shall have our times of brightness and then less brilliance. Times of vigor and then the consequent reaction to and exhaustion from that very vigor. The sun has power to steadily burn. But kindled flames, unlike the sun, do flicker and fade. Brethren, he then concludes, it is no small part of Christian wisdom and prudence to recognize this fact, that kindled flames, unlike the sun, do flicker and fade. If you have your Bibles this morning, I'd like you to open them to Colossians chapter 1, picking it up in the 26th verse, which is where we were last week as we continue our study of this great epistle, Colossians, using this text today as a way to prepare our minds and our hearts for our gathering around the table. That is the Lord's, this communion table. And it begins with these words in verse 26, where Paul is effectively articulating what I think is the core of the gospel, the euangelion, the good news, and he calls it the mystery. Verse 26, that is the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifest or revealed to his saints, to whom God wills, to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery, even among the Gentiles. And the glory of the mystery is this, Christ in you, the hope of glory, or the hope of living in a glorious way, or the hope, Christ in you, is our hope of ever experiencing glory in an authentic way in our real life. Quick question. How do you picture glory? Do you have a picture of glory in your mind? What does it look like? How does it feel? Is glory in your mind bright and shiny? Does it feel good? Well, I suppose it is bright and shiny, and it does feel good, but however it is you picture glory or think that it should feel, Your hope, according to Colossians 1, verse 27, for actually experiencing glory is Christ in you. Your hope of glory. The actual presence of God by His Spirit embodied in Christ, living inside ordinary people like you and me is the core of the gospel. Paul calls it the mystery, hidden from past ages and generations, But now it's being revealed so we can see it and know it, not only to the saints, but also to those who've been far away from anything you would call a saint, the Gentiles, which actually means the whole world is being revealed to them. And this is the mystery, Christ in you, the actual presence of God, living inside ordinary, very ordinary people just like you and just like me and a whole lot of people who aren't just like you or just like me, which, as Steve last week made clear in his dealing with this text, was a mind-boggling concept to the people in Paul's day, and particularly to the people who lived in Colossae, to whom Paul was writing this book, obviously. Because to most people in those days, in Paul's day, their understanding of God, regardless of their cultural or religious background, be they Jews or Greeks or even Gentiles, they all kind of saw God, they all have perceptions of God or God, as being up there or out there or in there, some place, some holy place. That's where God would be, like a temple of some kind. But we talked about, or Steve did last week, the temple, that one being in Jerusalem, with which most Jews associated themselves. And Gentiles were very aware of it, whose physical structures, Steve explained last week, communicated some things. some of them intentional, but some of them kind of intentional. But the message came through loud and clear about the character of God, the nature of God, at least how people kind of perceived God. And among the messages that the structure of the temple itself communicated was this, that God is real, and he is very powerful, and he is very holy. But it's almost as if those three things, his reality, his power, and his holiness, also make him inaccessible, really hard to get to to see. And the temple kind of communicated that. The temple, as Steve explained last week, was a massive structure, beginning as it did with the courtyard of the Gentiles. Called that because it was the only place in the temple structure where Gentiles were allowed to enter, thus the name Courtyard of the Gentiles. Picture it in your mind because everybody mingled there. There were men there and women as well. slave and free. Those people didn't always mingle together. Jews and Gentiles were often apart, but in the courtyard of the Gentiles, they were together. Even animals were there. The picture I have in my mind is that the world was there. Everybody was there. But inside that courtyard, where everybody could go, this courtyard of the Gentiles, there was another courtyard. Inside that courtyard was what was called the courtyard of the Jews. And into that courtyard of the temple, only Jews could go, which sent a pretty strong message, actually. It wasn't with words, but it was pretty clear to them about access to God. And the message of this inner court where only Jews could go, the message to the Gentiles that they heard loud and clear is this, you don't have any access to God. You can't go there into that place that would get you, in some sense, closer to God in kind of a symbolic way. God is not with you. He is not for you. You're on your own. Just stay out there. But it didn't stop there. This structure thing that continued to communicate in the temple, because just inside the courtyard of the Jews, there was the courtyard of the men, into which only Jewish men could go, which sent, intentionally or not, a pretty strong message to women and children about access to God. And the message, among others, was this. Well, you have more access to God than Gentiles, which is good, but less than most men, which is weird. I guess we just have to live with that. But it didn't stop there, this communication of the structure of the temple. Because just inside the courtyard of the men, there was the courtyard of the priests, into which only priests could go, only certain priests actually could go, which sent another pretty strong message, intentionally or not, to devout Jewish men about access to God. And the message was this. Well, you have more access to God than Gentiles, for sure. and women and children, you're still pretty good there, but you have less than most priests, but it didn't stop there. Because just inside the courtyard of the priests was this place, very small place, in the center of the temple called the Holy of Holies. And that was discerned to be and believed to be the very dwelling place of Holy God. The presence of God was there. But into this place, this holy presence of God place, only one person once a year, the high priest, one time a year could go. And if he did it wrong, if he went in some wrong way, he could be struck dead from the power of this presence. Which again, has some real positive symbolism, but it also sends, intentionally or not, a pretty strong message to the whole world, quite frankly, about access to God and the message, intentional or not, was this. You don't have any. You can't go there. God is not with you. He is not for you. Now, into the teeth of that perception of God comes the euangelion that we've been talking about since the beginning of Colossians, the good news of the gospel of the kingdom, that Jesus came preaching first, and the message and the mission of Jesus from beginning to end was fundamentally this. I have come to break down the dividing walls. He says in Ephesians 2, verse 17, it says of Jesus that he came to preach peace to those of you who are far away. Who would that be? In a symbol, but in reality, Gentiles. To the whole world, those of you who think you have no access to God, I have come to preach access to God, peace. but I've also come to give that message to those who were near for through him. Ephesians 2, 17 or 18 now, we have now access in one spirit to the Father, no longer strangers and aliens, but fellow citizens with all the saints, and are now of God's household. In verse 21, he speaks of that household being God's household as being a holy temple, the very dwelling place of God in the spirit. We are now the temple, a temple not made with stone, a temple not made with hands. And that is what Paul is calling in Colossians 1.26, the mystery which was hidden from past ages and generations but now has been revealed that God no longer dwells in a temple made with hands but dwells in you and in me and in us. We are the temple of the living God, Christ in you, the hope of glory. Now, as I was sitting in the service last week, right over here in the 9 o'clock service, and was listening to Steve proclaim that mystery, preach what I just talked about in a little different way, this question, as I was sitting listening to Steve, flickered through my mind. And the question was a personal question. It wasn't a question that I thought at all I would bring to you, because it's not a theological or textual question. It was my question. And the question was this. so where's the glory um i mean in the church i mean we have a good church i love our church but but paul paul talked about when i think of glory he he talked about joy inexpressible and full of glory and as i was sitting over there feeling what i was feeling for a variety of reasons i i said that question so where is the glory of christ is in me in me where is it See, if it's true that we really are the dwelling place of God by his Spirit, that the real presence of God is in us, the very same way it was in the temple, in that holy of holy place, Christ in you, the hope of glory, then where's the glory? Because part of my struggle there was thinking of Exodus 33. In Exodus 33, great story. Moses is contending with God, and he's struggling with even his leadership with the people, and it didn't quite go down this way, but it's almost as if he said to God, God, if you're going to give me responsibility to lead these people, I need to know your ways, and I need to see your glory. So Moses asked for the most audacious thing, because no one has seen God at any time. Moses said, show me your glory. And if you remember the story, there is this place in Exodus 33 where Moses was put in the cleft of the rock because he couldn't even physically handle the full bore expression of God's glory, but God pulled back the veil in a sense and revealed to him his glory. And when the glory was revealed to Moses, there was no doubt about what he saw. I mean, it was amazing. So strong was the glory that it kind of got on Moses. And it says that he began to glow with the glory of God, the presence of God himself. It says in Exodus 33, 35, that his face began to shine with the glory of God. And the picture I have there is that it was amazing. It was obvious. When Jesus in Matthew 17, Paul brought Peter, James, and John up to the mountain, it says that there was this amazing experience. And he gave this gift, as it were, to Peter, James, and John. And what he did was he pulled back the veil of his flesh and he revealed to Peter, James, and John his glory. And it was bright and it was shining. And it says his face and his garment shone like the sun. And the point is this. When there's glory, you can see it. It's unbelievable. It's amazing. So back to my question, where is that? I mean, if we really are the dwelling place of God, if the real presence of God is in us, the way he was in the temple, the Holy of Holies, where is the glow? Well, Dave, I said to myself, which is, I do have, it's bizarre in here. It's very bizarre. You don't want to know. Here is what I said to myself. I mean, my mind is just going on with this, and it kind of continued through the week, obviously. The voice was this, you're expecting too much. You're kind of unrealistic. And that is true. Because if you think of even the events, the experience of Moses with the glory, though he experienced glory, he didn't get that every day. This was not an everyday experience. And even when he got it, it didn't last. Eventually, that glory began to fade. And he needed to learn how to do what we all need to learn how to do. And that is to live our lives in everyday realities. And most of his days, like your days, were spent living one foot in front of the other, obeying God. Sometimes when the glory was there, but sometimes when it wasn't. or it wasn't perceived or seen. And that thing on the mountain, revealing the glory of God to Peter, James, and John, happened once. One time that happened. The disciples did not see the glory that way every day. That was not a normative experience. And I think we can get in trouble if we expect those experiences of glory to be normative, and we start chasing after them in sometimes some really unhealthy ways, though it's a very good thing to desire this thing. The disciples didn't see it every day, yet they followed in the context of real life on dusty roads. They lived their life the way you have to live yours and I have to live mine, one foot in front of the other obedient. So when it comes to joy inexpressible and full of glory, there needs to be some kind of growing up, some adjusting to expectations, of expectations, to realistic levels, because that kind of glory, though real, and you get glimpses of it from time to time, it isn't every day. You just need to know that. But, but, what if, for some of you, this thing of experiencing the presence of God and the glory of God is not just about adjusting your expectations to realistic levels. What if for some of you, and this actually is where my talk is going right now, I'm concerned most for those of you among us for whom there is no sense of glory or no sense of presence at all. Indeed, if you were to be on the stage to tell us your story and how you're experiencing God and all of that stuff right now, the reality of God's presence for some of you in this room feels every bit as far away and inaccessible as it must have felt to those first century Gentiles living in the courtyard of the Gentiles staring at the temple mount which seemed to say to them there's just no way you're ever going to see that glory you're going to experience that presence other people will you never will just kind of get used to it still others of you and my heart is kind of dialing into you as well, might be thinking as I talk about this sense of God's presence and sense of God's glory that I used to sense that stuff. I used to experience that stuff, but oh, not anymore. Not since that failure. Not since that sin. Not since that disappointment. Not since that deep tiredness. I just don't sense glory. Well, for you, I have a few words. And then we'll go to the table. The first is this. It's normal. It's normal. To feel what you feel from time to time is normal. Because while it is the prerogative of God to be immutable, to be unchanging. We humans have no such choice. We have our moods, our fluctuations. No human hand has ever drawn an absolutely straight line. That is the ideal of the mathematician. But all of our lines are crooked. No human life has ever been a continuous, unbroken series of equally holy and devoted thoughts and acts. We shall have our times of brightness, of glory, and then less brilliance. times of vigor and then the consequent reaction to an exhaustion from that very vigor the sun has power to steadily burn but kindled flames unlike the sun do flicker and fade which leads to the second thing I have for you indeed this one is a promise comes from Jesus himself in Matthew 12 verse 20 and he's quoting Isaiah 42 which I like because this is God, and then it's Jesus who is God, and he's quoting Isaiah 42, and what he says is this, that a flickering flame, a smoldering wick I will not put out, and a bruised reed I will not cast off. I love this picture of the bruised reed. A little kind of background of how those things were even used. Maybe they had many purposes, but often a bruised reed, a reed was they would go into marshes, pull out these reeds, let them dry, and they would hollow out the middle, unless they were already hollowed out, and put holes in them, and they would turn these reeds into flutes, and they would make music. The symbolism of a reed that's making music is quite profound, because there is a life that maybe at one time you felt like, I was making music, and I was singing, and it pointed to God, and then in the very use of the flute, it was a reed, and you'd have saliva on it, or it would get bumped on the ground and maybe dropped or someone was careless with it or just, again, in the very use of it, it would kind of get mushy and soft and bruised. And now it doesn't make the music quite as well. And if, man, these things are pretty easy to find, so you just throw it away. And people feel like that. Used to make music. Not anymore. But God and Isaiah, this is really intentional on God's part. Isaiah 42, and Jesus in Matthew 12 says, here's the deal about Bruce Reeds, who used to make music and now you're convinced you never will again. Bruce Reeds, I will not cast off, even though you're convinced you'll never make music again. David was convinced of that. And Psalm 42 says this, I used to lead the throne and lead them in a procession to the house of the Lord with a voice of joy and thanksgiving. It was glory, but it's gone. To which God says, no, it's not. And I believe, and I hope anyway, by the power of the Spirit, some of you bruiseries who came in looking real shiny and just fine, just great, but inside there's a bruise and you just feel like no music anymore for me. God says that is not true. because bruised reeds I will not cast off and smoldering wicks I will not snuff out. My function and my job in your life by the Spirit will be to fan that flickering flame back to life, not to blow it out, partly because you are the light of the world. And just because the light has grown a little dim doesn't mean I'm done with you. Third thing is this. that the glory that I'm talking about today, that's the result of Christ in you and in me and in us, doesn't always manifest the way we might expect or where we might expect. And if we don't know that, we might actually miss the glory. Because here's the deal about glory, experiencing the presence. Sometimes our experience of it is bright and shining, it glows. And sometimes it's loud and obvious it thunders. But sometimes the glory of God and the presence of God is not thunder or lightning. It's a whisper. Elisha, 1 Kings 19, says this. He was kind of looking for God and the presence of God. And what was weird, there was an earthquake and there was fire and he was looking for God in there. And the Bible says in this particular incident that God wasn't in the earthquake and he wasn't in the wind. And that's where I expected him to be. And he wasn't in the fire. But he was in the whisper, the gentle, blowing breeze. And if you don't know that sometimes that's where the glory is, you might miss it. Whisper. And we're going to go to the table in just a few moments. Fact is, some of you might hear that whisper. If you listen real close when we go to the table, when some of you come and kneel at the cross or just sit in your seats and pray because it doesn't always manifest the way we might expect or where we might expect. And if we don't know that, we might miss it. I love the way Steve last week painted this picture of Jesus in the temple. Remember that? Matthew 21, it was the scene where he was cleansing the temple because what strikes me about that picture, among others, relative to what we're talking about, among others, is where he was in the temple. Remember the courtyard of the Gentiles, where everybody was? Because the whole point of the temple structure was to communicate that the presence of God, the glory of God, was in this very exclusive place, in the Holy of Holies. The glory of God was in this tiny place, this holy, inaccessible place. But Jesus, in this scene where he's cleansing the temple, Jesus, who we believe is God, was where in this scene of Matthew 21? He was in the courtyard of the Gentiles, which means God is where? Well, it means he's where our life is. He's where real life is. Let that in. This is very important because that's where he moves, and that's where he reveals, right in the middle of the mess, that we're sometimes convinced is keeping us from the glory of God, what if the presence was right in the mess? Right in the middle of dirty diapers and deadlines and traffic jams and hospital rooms and nursing homes. But if we don't know that, that God is present in the ordinary places, we might end up missing the glory of God in you, in life, in the disturbances of life because the glory is not just in the holy place. The glory of God, the presence of God, is also in the ordinary place where the song is sung off key and the baby won't stop crying. Think of this a lot. We have grandkids and a lot of our people have just, our church is crawling with little kids and just think of how do we make these things real to moms and parents. They just won't stop crying and it's keeping me from the glory. What if that little kid that you're spending all this time on and it's keeping you from the... What if that little kid, I mean, that's where the glory is. What if that's where it is? In the messy place. In the body gathered. The body gathered. A bunch of ordinary people. When we have communion and people move to the stations and come to, do you ever watch them? I know you're doing it, so you're being watched maybe, but I do that sometimes. I'm in three services, and sometimes I go to the table, and sometimes I've already done that, and so I don't, but I watch. And as people come to the table and come to the cross, or come for prayer, it's the whole body gathered. And one of the things you'll notice, and I think it's good to notice, You're tall and short. You're just big and small, young and old. You're all here, rich and poor. Men and women, children too. And some of you are the picture of health. And when we serve community, it's interesting. That's another experience where people just come through and you just see everybody. Some are the picture of health, and others come through the line and they're walking with a limp. But sometimes their limp is one you can't see because their wound wasn't in their body. It was somewhere else in their spirits. so inside they walk with a limp. Some come weeping to the table and come weeping to the cross. Have you seen that? And some are full of joy. See, when Jesus took the bread, the communion table, he said, among other things, this is my body. But if a piece of bread is all you see, you may miss the glory. because this is my body. You and me and we are the body of Christ. Christ in you and in me and in us. In this place is glory. And if we don't know that, we may miss the glory. From time to time, it will be bright and shiny. From time to time it will be loud and unmistakable, but other times their glory is revealed in ordinary people, in ordinary places, right in the mess of life. And so we pray as we go to the table. Would you pray with me? Just enter into this with me. Lord, help us to see what we so often can't see. Help us, by your Spirit, to pay attention, to become present to the presence of your Spirit at the table, through the elements, the bread and the cup, to become present to your presence at the cross, where some will come to kneel and pray, to become present to your presence in this very room and in one another. Christ in you, the hope of glory. Lord, we pray right now what Moses prayed. Show us your glory as we come to the table. Amen. *music*
