Open your Bibles with me, James chapter 3, verses 2 through 12. We are entering this morning, our fourth week, in a series of sermons born of this section in James that I have entitled, The Taming of the Tongue. And in this section of Scripture, we have begun to examine and marvel, quite frankly, at the power of the tongue to do, among other things, three things. Number one, to set the course of a life, verses 3 through 5. Like a bit in a horse's mouth, like a rudder on a ship, so also the tongue, though it is small, boasts great things. And among the great things it boasts is the power to speak into people's lives life and death, blessing and cursing. And by that, speaking life and death, set the course of a life into life and into death, into blessing and into cursing. Following that point number two, this outline stretched over several weeks, we began to marvel also at the power of the tongue to damage people. He likened it, did James, to a fire. Verse 6, for the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity. The tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body and sets on fire the course of our life and is set on fire by hell. Hell, we discovered last week, does not have the power to move our mouth, does not have the power by itself to burn down the forest. What it does have the power to do, and what it does incessantly do, is light matches. Indeed, last week we imagined a not-too-bright, remember him, lower-level, hyperactive little demon among us, all during the service, probably here today, just lighting matches like a maniac, and it was accomplishing nothing. No fires lit, just little matches all over the place. didn't have any power to do anything, which is precisely what happens, I said last week, 90% of the time, unless one of those tiny little matches, powerless in their ability to really do anything significant, unless one of those tiny little matches finds your fuel. For when that tiny little match finds the leaking, built-up fuel of our selfishness or arrogance or insecurity, when it finds that pool of bitterness that has been building up for years or jealousy, unresolved conflict, undealt with sin, something then is ignited in that tiny little match. It does have some power then. And sometimes the ignition is explosive and it does a lot of damage at ground zero like a little bomb, but it doesn't necessarily spread real far. Likened it to the possibility of last night. I could have, with my mouth, blown up my wife, done tremendous damage to her soul, but my kids, it might not have spread to the next room in terms of effects. Sometimes, however, when that pool of whatever it is that's flammable in me is ignited, it's not explosive, it's a slow burn, you might never in your whole life explode. I liken that to the burner on a stove, where it's ignited and it's there, never explodes, but everyone who comes close to you gets heated up by that which you are burning about and your flame finds their gas and all of a sudden the fire is even bigger in you than it was in the person it started with and that is how the fire spreads and that is how the forest is burnt down. From there, last week, we began to examine and marvel at the power of the tongue to do three things. To reveal that we all leak flammable fuel, and also to reveal that it has power to reveal where we leak flammable fuel. All of that came out of verses 9 through 12. Let's read it again and begin to dig in with the new stuff. With it, that is the tongue, we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who have been made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not be this way. Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water? Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives or a vine tree produce figs? The way I framed that last week was this. The match is lit. That's hell's job. It finds our fuel. A fire is ignited. Just because the fire is ignited does not mean the tongue is engaged. But if by the fire my tongue is engaged, damage will be done. Might be explosive, might be a slow burn, but if my tongue is engaged, damage will be done. Now, let's say you're in a place where the damage you did by your tongue, either explosive or slow burn, you see it. Not everybody does. Some of you have done damage with your mouth for years and years and years, and you are absolutely oblivious to the damage you've done. Some of you live with someone who, with their mouth, has done damage over and over, and they are oblivious, and nothing seems to be breaking through. But if you do see it, you generally come up sorry and saying so profusely over and over and over, and often then, to try and minimize the damage, try indeed to get off the hook, we find ourselves saying things like this, I didn't mean it. I really didn't mean it. To which James, I believe in this section, says essentially this. Dave, you, I'm really glad you're sorry. In fact, I believe that you are sorry, but I would like to press you past this sorry, sorry, sorry thing that seems to happen every six weeks or every six months. And please don't say again, I didn't mean it. I really didn't mean it. Because the fact is this, born out of the text, that word you said, that rage, that rumor you spread, that slander in you endo, that embellishment of the truth to make you look better, that lie you told, that gossip you spread, that inability to speak directly to the person you have the issue with, all of that came from somewhere inside you. Verse 11, he is saying that for a fountain cannot send forth bitter water unless there's something bitter there. Verse 12, a fig tree cannot produce an olive. It's incapable of doing it unless in the fig tree there is the root of an olive. And one of the things I tried to press last week was the fact that you may produce a lot of sweet water. You may indeed be a genuine fig tree. A kingdom person, born again, love God from your toes. But if you are damaging people with your tongue, you're going to have to move past denying that there is a root of something there. It's coming from some place. And so the question we've been dealing with has been this. Are you willing to wonder about what's going on in your heart? Are you willing to wonder where that bitterness is coming from? Are you willing to wonder what's fueling the fire? Where it is you leak flammable fuel. We began to answer that last week by acknowledging that quite possibly the most common among us cause for leaky fuel is hurt. Specifically the kind of hurt that is incurred when quite frankly we just don't get our way. When someone has the gall to say to us one very flammable word, no. you don't get the raise no we're not going with your idea no i don't want to go out with you anymore no no no we love that word the truth is very few things have more power to release flammable fuel into your spirit and into mine than when we don't get what we want it was amazing to me last week i preached that sunday morning monday morning i'm in my living room reading the paper Star Tribune business section, Dick Youngblood's column, entitled Uncivil Skies. And as I read it, it became clear he was citing an alarming increase in violent, abusive responses from passengers when Northwest Airline employees have the gall to say to them, no. Well, listen to this. Early last month at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, a man approached the pilot who was standing near a Northwest ticket counter, apparently mistook him for a ticket agent and asked to be checked in for his flight. When the pilot indicated that he was not an agent and that he would have to wait for one, the man punched him several times in the face. Well, you can understand that, can't you? It was not an isolated incident, said Bruce Retram, president of Teamster's Local 2000, which represents Northwest's 10,000 flight attendants. He has his own tally of worrisome examples. There was, for example, the 90-pound female flight attendant who was shoved to the floor by an angry passenger. Her offense, telling him that there was no, there's the operative word, that's the bad word, that there was no room left to hang his oversized garment bag and politely suggesting that he stored in his overhead bin. Or the man who demanded that a busy attendant list the beverages available then punched a crew member for suggesting that there was a complete drink list in the companies in flight magazine. None of us would act like that. We shake our heads, what is world coming to? But the flammable fuel that we all share is simply this, that we are relentlessly, all of us, obsessively committed to ourselves. And very few things on earth have more power to reveal that than when someone like my boss or my spouse or my coach or my teacher or the agent at the ticket counter has the gall to say to me, no. James said it this way in verses 1 and 2 of chapter 4. What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is it not your pleasures that wage war in your members? You lust. Lust is not just sexual. You really want to have this thing your way? You do not get so. You commit murder. Oh, I would never commit murder. The murder's in your heart. The murder comes off your tongue. Because why? Because you didn't get what you wanted. You are envious and you cannot obtain. Nothing has more power on earth to reveal our incredible commitment to ourselves than when someone says no to us, to me. Second place from which I believe we commonly leak, deal with today, is what I will call historic hurt. much deeper than the frustration of some plan I had, some rage I feel because someone said no, this particular source of the leak might help us understand, indeed, why it is when someone says no, we do explode or do a slow burn. Indeed, it might have something to do with something else entirely. What I want to talk about now has to do with deep wounds of the soul. Deep, very real wounds in your spirit that are yet unhealed. For the fact I believe is this, that unhealed, unforgiven, undealt with hurt poisons the heart. And a poisoned heart will poison the tongue. You may be a wonderful person, in many respects. Lots of sweet water comes out of your life, but if you have unhealed wounds, unforgiven hurts, you will, here's the deal, you will from that wound leak flammable fuel. I don't know if I can give you this picture or if you can even see it. It's a rather disgusting one. If I have in me an unhealed wound, an unforgiven, somebody who I have not been able to forget. That from that wound leaks noxious fumes. They are flammable fumes. Untreated, undealt with, could be 40 years old. It will continue to leak these fuels. The fact is this. From our wounds, we wound. From our hurts, we hurt. And from those places that we have been sinned against, we sin against other people. The question is this, are you willing to wonder? Are you willing to consider the possibility that what's fueling your gossip, what's fueling your slander, what's fueling your embellishment of the truth, your inability to deal directly with who you have to deal with, your lying, your inability to hear no without being ignited beyond what seems reasonable. Are you willing to wonder? Consider the possibility that at the core of that, what's fueling that is an unhealed hurt, unforgiven sin, undealt with wounds. Some of you are, some of you aren't. Before I proceed, let me just note this. I believe that in one way or another, every one of us in this room have been wounded. Some of us to greater and lesser degrees, but every one of us in this room have been wounded. It's part of the human condition. You cannot avoid it. And the truth also is this. Out of that woundedness, we have wounded and are indeed maybe now even now wounding. For some among us, the wound is obvious. There's no mystery about it. You don't have to do any kind of searching or wondering or ask God for some revelation about what this forgotten thing might be. It's clear to you. The dysfunctional family that you grew up in, dysfunctional sounds like an awfully nice word, quite frankly. An abusive parent, a broken relationship, not just a divorce, it was a bitter divorce. the kind of dynamic that at least sometime every single day you spend significant amounts of emotional energy just kind of hold that thing at bay so you can go on with your life. Some sort of awful betrayal. Some of you have wounds in your spirit and your soul that have nothing to do with anything that anybody did directly to you. You really were the victim of this. When you were a child, your parent died. Your spouse died. If you were a parent and one of your children died and it leaves, then you're a hole. Here's the deal around that kind of thing. While the healing for those damaging realities in our spirits, in our souls, are not easy. Those healing processes take time. Where you need to heal is clear. You're not spending anything, Lord, what's the issue? No, you know what the issue is. What you need to forgive if that's the issue for you. What it is you need to forgive. Who it is you need to forgive. There's no mystery about it. The work you have now is like the second part. How do I forgive? We're going to talk about that more next week. How do I get to a place where I can forgive even him, her, that? But there's no mystery about that you need to. In order to really seal this thing over and not just pretend to get free from it. But what about some of you who were raised in a perfect home and you really haven't had any of these deep wounds? And we do laugh about that because there's no such thing as a perfect home and we all know that, but let's just make it a normal home, a healthy home, a healthy context of life. You've never had any big major things and there are considerable numbers of you like that where you really have been surrounded with truly wonderful people. I'm not being facetious. wonderful people who love God from their toes, who love you from their toes, and they made it very clear that they did. And you even hear sermons like this, and you find in your spirit a real gratitude. I'm glad we're talking about this stuff. There really are so many people in our church and in our world. I'm glad our church addresses these things, and you're grateful, but it's kind of, you're waiting for next time or some other series where it's going to affect you. So here you are, 23 years old. and you're a responsible adult and you're making your own way and you're doing pretty good and you had wonderful parents and there's nothing to look at and you even get a little tired of the fact that they kind of hammer away like I'm supposed to find something and I don't have anything and just shut up and get on with your life while you guys have this pain. I don't mean that. It's fine. And then you're 33 years old and you've had 10 years to just kind of experience yourself and you're experiencing in 33 some success in your life and you're kind of making a way in a career and your marriage is stable. You're not fighting all the time, but it's there and your kids are cute. They're cute. You don't have quite as much energy as you had about no problems at all. I'm really sliding through. You've stumbled just enough to know, I don't know, I don't know. And I'll add 10 more years of that. Add 20 more years. You're 43. You're 53, and now your kids are kind of sliding out of the house, and they're going off to school, or they're getting married, and they're making their own way, and this thing you just didn't ever think would actually happen is your kids have turned into actual human beings. Oh, you know, it's not embarrassing to be with them. Great family. Not any big pain. Reasonably successful. nobody's perfect everybody's got pain kind of get a grip the rest of you what's that but and then and by the way it usually it sometimes takes 33 years to smell this sometimes 43 53 63 after a while you notice even with all the success there are certain areas of your life where given certain circumstances with this amount of pressure applied by that particular kind of person you really do leak flammable fuel and you know what over 23 years it didn't show up people kind of cut you some slack I'm a 23 year old buck I just got lots of energy I'm an idiot Give me some room. We gave you room. But then 33 years and 40 through 53, all of a sudden, I can't just write this pattern off as a blip on the screen anymore. And you know what? It has showed up in my marriage. And it showed up at work more than once. I've had this particular conflict, and it was this one, and then I had it again, and then I had it again, and it wasn't always them. The first time it was. But then it came up again. And again. You know what? You're a great guy. And you are a wonderful woman. But it's come up enough times in your life and you know you have to live to 33, maybe 43. You have to be living long enough to realize that I'm noticing something. It is affecting my marriage. It has touched my career. It has shown up in my kids. Maybe if you haven't even seen it, you haven't ever noticed it. But God gave you a gift, and that was this, and maybe you didn't get this gift, but maybe you did. You got kids. And by the time you're 43 or 53, your kids have grown, and you never saw the flammable fuel that you continually leaked that was always getting ignited in your family. You never noticed it, but guess who did? Your kids did. And guess who felt it? Your wife did, or your husband did. and now you're 43 or 53 and they would like to talk to you because they went to counseling. Here's the question that is driving everything we're doing here and it's stimulated by everything James is saying in verses 9 to 12. Are you willing to wonder what's been fueling that fire? That you can't blow off anymore as a blip on the screen. Are you willing to go past? Sorry, sorry, sorry. For the umpteenth time to your kids or to your husband or wife or to your boss or to the people you are employing. Fact is, maybe some of you have gone past. Sorry, sorry, sorry. And what I mean by that is you just don't say you're sorry anymore. Your basic posture at the workplace or at church or in the home is this. It's just the way I am. Adjust. and people do they've tippy toed around you all your married life are you willing to consider the possibility that even from the perfect family you've got some wounds that need healing some people that need forgiving that you need to let off the hook some sin that you need repenting the fact is beloved we can choose to band-aid these wounds with bible verses and self-help books we can choose to medicate them with big houses fast cars successful careers and maybe a new wife will do it or a new husband that old one the new one has been you know what it'll work for a while or maybe we can just decide as some of you have and even as i say this you will remember indeed when you did it and I even want to bring my volume down because this is such a hard thing for some of you because at the time you did it it was the only way you knew how to survive by an act of your will to take that wound and seal it off into a hidden place in your heart to board it up with signs that make it very clear that grave consequences await anyone who comes close to trying to open up that concealed place of your heart. Your husband knows where it is. Your wife knows about it. Your kids know. They don't know what may be behind it, but they all know to stay away. And one of the ways we keep people away from those concealed areas is with that. It's boarded up, big signs, danger, attack dog. It's me. Another way we keep people away from those sealed things as we kind of divert them with just how nice we are. We're just so nice. We're just always so nice that you'd never, they're so nice. You'd never suspect that they've got any flammable fuel that's getting ignited. They're just so nice. It just keeps you totally away from what's going on. And for a while, those places, those things that we seal off do indeed work. And sometimes it does indeed take 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, and many of you could give testimony to that very thing. It took that long. You were reasonably successful, marriage stable, career on track, kids are fine. Everybody's got problems, get a grip, but here's the truth. That flammable fuel that you thought you sealed up tight, the whole time was leaking out from under the door, and on a relatively consistent basis. Every six weeks, maybe not even that much. Every six months, every six months. Every year, once a year, it'd come up. Every two years, it takes 40 years to see it. It's a pattern. It's not a blip. It shows up in your marriage and your workplace. Sometimes this fuel that's been leaking out from that hidden place, and by the way, sometimes we seal these things off so well, and sometimes they've been sealed off so long ago, we don't even remember where we put it. It's like, you honestly don't remember that. And sometimes that fuel that is leaking out from under the door gets ignited mysteriously by circumstances and people that you would never consciously connect with that unhealed hurt, that unforgiven sin. Never would connect it. But when your boss came in the conference room that day and addressed all of the different teams and told your team that we weren't going to go with your idea, we were going to go with the other team's idea, something ignited in you. And you knew that the other members of your team didn't agree with the decision. But something, you could tell even by body posture that there was something ignited in you that was bigger than the other people you were hanging with. And you waited for a time where you could get out of there and talk to your confidants, and you got away, and you found yourself saying something like this. You know, when he does that, or when she does that, and he just walks in and he says no, you know, kind of character, and he just says no, and he says, oh, and hi, and mighty, yeah, and he said, you're valuable, but we don't like your idea. It just drives me nuts. You know what? Just between you and me. I want to get away from everybody else. Just between you and me. It reminds me of my father. Oh. Rarely is it that obvious. Yeah, yeah, I was dating Sally for a while. We were going out for a little bit. It was nice. Yeah, no, yeah, we broke up. they're all the same let's get away let's just you and me talk they're all the same they drive me nuts manipulative controlling started out real nice real romantic normal person manipulative controlling just took three months it's like claustrophobic she reminds me of my ex oh like are you like willing to wonder about the gas you got about Sally, worst person on earth, might not be so much about Sally. No. Female boss? Yeah, I've had female boss. No problem. I tried to make it work. You don't believe me, do you? It's between you and me. Nobody else is here. It's just us. I can tell you the truth of total confidence here. She is threatened by me. I know you'd deny it. You wouldn't believe me. But she was. I have a lot of creativity. I got a lot of ideas. I'm kind of forceful of my personality, and she really is insecure. In fact, she reminds me of my mother. You know, those are so obvious. You don't have to be the therapeutic equivalent of a rocket scientist to know that the gas you got over here about your girlfriend or about your female boss or about somebody else, What's the other illustration? It isn't just about them. It's about something else over here that's leaking fuel that gets ignited every time you run into something that even looks similar. You've totally lost the connection. It's called transference. It's one undealt with, unhealed hurts of the past, undealt with sin of the past against you, and now coming from you is transferred to another person in a very unfair, hurtful way. It's common as the rain. It's very hurtful, sometimes frightening if you're the recipient of it. And by the way, this is some teaching that will help some of you who are in positions where this kind of thing happens. It happens if you are a coach or a teacher or a boss or a supervisor or a friend. I mean, I have very few places where it doesn't happen. And its venom is quite often released through the tongue. For when the anger is ignited by the fuel that's been released through this unhealed thing over here and the anger is released over here, it is often released through slander and gossip and false accusations. Let me give you some case studies that came out of Leanne Payne. One. Just I'll give you two. A young boy's father dies when he's eight years old. In later years, he craves for more affirmation from older men than anyone can reasonably give. So he constantly runs into these relationships where he absolutely adores this older guy. And don't make that weird or anything. That can just be like a relationship you have with a teacher. You find this teacher. You find this coach. And there's this incredible connection. Man, he's like the Messiah. But the need you have is bigger than anybody can fill. And when he doesn't get that affirmation he needs, he goes beyond disappointment into intense anger, vilifying the coach, boss, teacher that he once adored as now being the worst of all possible creatures. And from that fuel that gets ignited, that's really about something that wasn't his fault at all, but has not yet been touched by amazing grace, or the healing power of God, hasn't even maybe lived long enough to do that. Gets ignited over here by something totally separate, and from there comes false accusations, gossip and slander, reputations are ruined, careers are ended. The pattern of transference, if it's happening to you or if you're doing it, is this. Once they deify, after they're disappointed, they vilify. Are you willing to wonder? Are you willing to wonder when that happens several times? This guy you thought was so wonderful, and he wasn't, and this guy was so wonderful, and they weren't, that maybe there's something way over here. Another illustration, a young woman suffers rejection from the love of her life. She meets another man who reminds her of this man of her dreams and thus is attracted to him. While she recognizes that the relationship will not develop into more than a friendship, she knows that going in when the relationship does inevitably end after only two months of dating. Inordinate amounts of rejection, grief, and anger flood her soul and poison her tongue. And this guy she went out with for two months is now the object of incredible slander. To gently pull this person aside and say, no, no, this guy she went out with for two months is not the Antichrist. Maybe it's something else. Are you willing to wonder about what it is that's causing the gas to leak out from underneath that proverbial door that you've sealed off? Scared to death to touch. Maybe have even come to believe. By the way, this is not about evil people doing this. It's about hurt people doing this. This is about being alive. Maybe you've sealed it off not because you just want to be a phony person and hide it all. You just really have come to believe a lie that nobody could heal this. This couldn't be healed. The best I can do is put a Band-Aid on it, shut it off over there. The question that's been driving this, are you willing to wonder about where this stuff's coming from? Well, let's say you are. say you've pressed through this stuff with me even in your mind and heart and you are willing to wonder about that and you have seen some patterns and you've lived long enough to notice that this is not just a blip on the screen that I consistently find myself ignited around this particular thing or that what do we do then? is there a way to turn off the source of our flammable fuel to even discover where it is that we might leak well at this point I must say out loud that we need to tread very softly here for there is to the healing of the soul some real mystery but given that acknowledgement I'm going to suggest four things don't freak because I know we're ready to go I'm just going to touch on these this morning and then dress these out next week but I want to give you enough to get you started even in a process if you're willing to wonder the first thing you need to do is ask God into it ask God into that place that you may not even be aware of that you can't even see right now from which your flammable fuel comes ask the spirit of God to come and reveal those things to you I gave you that assignment last week in asking God into that do it believing that he is good do it believing that there is grace for you for all of the places where from your wound you have wounded. And also do it believing that he is able, even though you may not believe it right now, if you open up that door within which you've sealed off that wound, that he is able to heal. Ask him for the ability to see what you don't see right now, for the ability to see the unhealed wound, the unforgiven sin, the undealt with wound that leaks in you flammable fuel. And when you see it, having asked God into it, Number two, admit it. What I mean by that is simply this. What you see, say out loud. Please note this. When we say out loud what it is we've discovered, where it is we've discovered this original wound may be coming from, when we finally see that, the purpose of saying it is not to blame. In fact, the purpose of this whole process that we're moving through these weeks is to stop the blaming. Some of us, when we discover the woundedness of our past, have wrongly come to believe that in discovering where the wound came from, we've in that been healed. Because quite frankly, it does feel really good to find out that it wasn't all you. Some things happened to you. The purpose of saying it out loud is not, however, to blame. You need to move one step past that. From ask God into it to admit it. To repent it. Repent it? I got wounded. And you need to see it. And you need to face it. And you need to fully see it and feel it. So that you can repent it. Repent what? Repent all the ways that from that wound you have wounded. Repent. All the ways that from that hurt you have hurt. And repent all the ways where from that place you have been sinned against, you have sinned against. And know that in your repentance there is for you amazing grace. Know also this, that in this whole process it's never too late. Last night I was speaking with a friend in the hall about a mutual friend whose 76-year-old dad, for the first time in his life, told his 56-year-old son, I love you, son. First time. The guy's 56 years old hearing the first time. And he put his arms around his 56-year-old son and hugged him. And both of them sobbed. Repentance for that 76-year-old man involved some hard things, like seeing and saying the wounds that he had inflicted on his children the deficiencies that he had created in their spirit repentance for that old man meant renouncing at least beginning to renounce some of the ways that from his 76 year old wounds that he decided to seal off in a room somewhere gas had leaked out from there ignited all over the place and from his wounds he had wounded and from his hurt he had hurt and from the places he had been sinned against he had sinned against you know in that scene of a 67 year old 76 year old man hugging his 56 year old son most of our sympathy I think goes to the 56 year old man and it's like why didn't you get a hug sooner and I almost get mad at the 76 year old guy I go what took you so long get into that 76 year old guy's skin just for a second and wonder about wonder about his woundedness that caused him to seal it off and say now to the 76-year-old man, I really wish you could have done it sooner. For everybody's sake, I really wish you could have. But I want to tell you this, good for you, that finally at 76 years old, you had the courage to start opening up that door you sealed off 40 years ago. And in the opening of those doors that we seal off, where those wounds, like it or not, continue to leak, and you think you're controlling it and you aren't because the gas is leaking out all over everybody. When we open those doors, amazing grace can flood in. And bondages, generations long, can be broken. Fourth thing, develop it more next week, forgive it. Forgive it. Forgive it. What if my father never repents? What if I don't have a father who ever comes and gives me that hug? And some of you never will. I want to talk about that next week. Well, if you never have the proverbial father who comes and says they're sorry, maybe you're the father. You're the proverbial father. Who breaks the cycle so the wound can heal. And as wounds of the heart, beloved, are healed, the tongue from a healed heart begins to bless, not curse. See, let's give everybody a rule. bless don't curse okay no no no we got to take some steps back begin to open up our wounded hearts to God and say oh God come heal your people forgive our sin and from healed hearts come healed tongues that bless not curse I'm going to tell you what we're doing next week I'm going to resurrect all the stuff again about repenting it and forgiving it and I'm going to preach it and I have so much more in there. But we're going to end 10 minutes early for ministry time around this very thing and wonder if the Spirit of God could come and move among us to forgive. You know how I want to focus in? I'll tell you right now. What do you forgive if they're not sorry? What do you forgive if the person who I need to forgive and want to forgive is dead? What do we do there? The unforgivable person. I want to talk about that and ask the Spirit to come and minister to us around some of that stuff. Come next week if you can. I'd like you to stand as we close. Altar team will be here for people who need prayer. I would like to pray over all of us just before we leave. Let's do that. Altar team, come even as I pray, would you? Spirit of God, I thank you for your word. Thank you for what you're speaking to us these days. I pray in your name for courage among your people now, not just in the service now, but as we leave, to open up our hearts to you and allow you to come into those places that we maybe have sealed off, maybe have even forgotten about, don't even know they're there. The courage to even just say, God, reveal to us. Give us the wisdom that we lack. Give us insight into. Give us wisdom into those areas of our lives that we don't know the source of it, but we continually get ignited. And then, Father, bring your amazing grace and courage to repent and gifts of repentance and gifts of forgiveness and vehicles to do that very thing. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
