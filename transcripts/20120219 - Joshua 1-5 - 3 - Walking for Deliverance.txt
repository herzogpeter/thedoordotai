Well, it's actually a little strange because I didn't mean to do a talk about deliverance in spiritual warfare when two weeks ago I was just trying to do a talk about baptism because that was kind of the assignment for the week, but there it was. And if you were here, I'm sure you remember that we found ourselves in the book of Exodus, the 14th chapter, with the people of God on the shores of the Red Sea, about to go through those waters, which does indeed speak to and symbolize, on one hand, a baptism of sorts. because as they passed through the sea, the Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 10, verse 2, speaking of this incident, they were being baptized into the sea, but it's also, it turns out, a story, this Red Sea story that speaks to and symbolizes not just baptism, but deliverance and spiritual warfare with Pharaoh, kind of being the embodiment in the context of spiritual warfare, being the embodiment of our adversary, the devil, bearing down on the people of God, not wanting to kill them necessarily. He just wanted to re-enslave them because the enemy does not want to kill you necessarily. He just wants to re-enslave you. Sure, you've been redeemed, but you will always be a slave. And his strategy, in this graphic picture, we discovered a couple of weeks ago, this graphic picture of spiritual warfare and deliverance, his strategy, Pharaoh's and the enemy's, is always the same, to, among other things, intimidate and to taunt. The intimidation is designed to stir up fear, because Pharaoh came in the story with all of his horses and all of his chariots and all of his army designed to intimidate, and the taunting of the enemy and Pharaoh is the same as the intimidation in terms of its intent being to stir up fear, because you'll always be a slave. That's the taunt. You will never be free, at least not from that. So why don't you just give up and don't even enter into or try to enter into a different kind of life? And if you're here that week, just two weeks ago, I'm pretty sure that you remember that it stirred some things up for us just a bit in some ways that we could see relative to ministry. You might remember it was a communion service, and there was a powerful sense of God's presence and healing and ministry was intense and profound, but also things got stirred up in ways we couldn't see. We could only sense that something's going on right now in our body. It's kind of what Vicki alluded to a little bit, relative to the life of God among us, but also relative to this thing of deliverance, of being set free in new ways in spiritual warfare, the things that would resist our being set free that we maybe need to notice. And all of that is at least part of why Steve last week talked about what he talked about when he talked about this theme of spiritual warfare and deliverance. Again, it wasn't planned. It's not part of Colossians. Not sure we should. What do you think? I think we should, was our conversation in the middle of last week, and so he did. by following my talk of two weeks ago entitled Waters for Deliverance with his talk entitled Waiting for Deliverance because sometimes, was Steve's point last week, to experience the deliverance God has for us, we have to wait. We have to wait for God to do what only God could do because only God could part those waters. And sometimes we have to wait in what feels like the middle of the night when the wind is blowing, but we don't know what's happening. Exodus 14, 13 was his primary text, kind of sticking with the whole story when God to the people says, stand still and see. In other words, right now, I want you to wait. But on Monday morning, when I kind of open up my computer to watch the talk, and we kind of do this, Steve and I back and forth, wondering, is there something Dave's gonna say that will inform what I'm gonna say? And is something Steve going to say inform what I'm going to say? I was planning to move back to Colossians. But as he spoke, something kind of rose up in me that ultimately I couldn't ignore. Steve's unpacking all that stuff last week. And it was this, the two verses after Exodus 14, verse 13, where God tells the people to stand still two verses later in verse 15 of Exodus 14, God says to Moses, tell the sons of Israel now to go forward. Tell the sons of Israel now to stop waiting and move and act, to step into their deliverance, because while sometimes we need to wait for deliverance, plug in Steve's talk now, and for 40 minutes listen to that. Now come back to me. Sometimes we need to walk for deliverance. And all of that is why today I want to talk about that. but to do that I actually need to bring you in your mind's eye to another body of water that the people of God in the story of God revealed to us in the word of God needed to cross indeed I find it quite fascinating that there are two great stories recorded for us in scripture that deal with and involve this crossing of water which kind of means it means something by the people of God, both of which speak to a kind of deliverance. But while both of them are a kind of deliverance, there's a different tone to each of them. Let me try to make that clear. The first crossing of water is the one we dealt with for the last couple of weeks in Exodus 14, crossing of the Red Sea, which speaks symbolically to deliverance, particularly from Pharaoh who doesn't want to kill you. He just wants to enslave you all over again. And the second crossing is the crossing of the people of God across the Jordan River, which also speaks to a kind of deliverance, but it's subtly and importantly different because the crossing of the Jordan River is not a deliverance from something, like from Pharaoh. It's a deliverance to something like destiny. It's not a deliverance from Pharaoh. It's a deliverance to destiny, which brings with it, and I hope you can kind of capture this, a different kind of energy. There's still anxiety in this crossing. Will we make it? There's still some element of fear involved. Will we drown? But there is a different energy. There's a different motivation. Maybe the best word is there's a different kind of direction that I want us to see and understand because at the Red Sea, going back to Pharaoh, chasing the people. The energy and the motivation, the direction, the motivation was pretty much fear from something back there. So the hope and desire at the Red Sea is to escape. Could I ever possibly escape to really be free, to be delivered from something, which is precisely what we sometimes need. And you know it's true. And it's precisely where sometimes we are at on our journey of faith. And sometimes, quite frankly, we loop back to that place from time to time where you're at a Red Sea in your life of sorts again and again and again. And you need to know that's pretty normal. But at the Jordan River, in terms of the symbolism, just really, you need to get this. There is no Pharaoh chasing. There is no intimidation or fear, no threat of death. So the energy and the direction isn't to escape from something old back there like Pharaoh and old habits and addictions and enslavements that I don't want to get me anymore. The energy and direction at Jordan is to enter into something new out there, across the river. It's not looking back, which is what you're doing at the Red Sea. It's looking forward. It's not to escape, which is what you're doing at the Red Sea. It's to enter in, which is what you're doing at the Jordan. It's not living in fear that Satan might get me again, which is where we sometimes are and need to say that out loud. But at the Jordan, it's living in hope that God can deliver me, not just from, but to a good and spacious land, a different kind of life, not just life, but abundant life. Jesus said, I am come that you might have life and have it to the full, to be fully alive, is what we talk about here at Open Door all the time. But this Jordan River experience and crossing is not without its dramatic tension. Even though Pharaoh isn't breathing down our necks, that's not the dynamic, there is still a lot at stake at this Jordan River crossing. So let me pick up the story with the people of God on the shores of the Jordan River. A story familiar to many of you. It's recorded for us in the book of Joshua. If you have your Bibles, you can open to that or you can just follow along on the screen. Joshua chapter 1, beginning in verse 3, says this. It brings in this incredible promise that every place, Joshua, on which the sole of your feet treads, I have given it to you. Just as I have spoken to Moses from the wilderness in this Lebanon, even as far as the great river Euphrates, all of the land of the Hittites, as far as the great sea toward the setting of the sun will be your territory. This is destiny calling, okay? This is potential. This is new life. No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Forget about Pharaoh. He's not the issue anymore. I'm calling you to something bigger. Just as I have been with Moses, I will also be with you. I will not fail you or forsake you. So, verse 6, be strong and courageous. Verse 7, only be strong and very courageous. Verse 9, have I not commanded you be strong and courageous? Which kind of gives you the idea that this move, again, is not without some dramatic tension. You're going to need to be strong and courageous because there's things about this that are scary. But even with that promise and this call to courage and strength, one question remains. It's a very practical question, standing on the shores of the Jordan River, how do we actually get across? The answer comes in chapter 3, verse 12. Now then, says God, through Joshua to the people, take for yourselves 12 men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe, and that shall come about, and this is very significant, when the souls of their feet, when the souls of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the Lord, the Lord of the whole earth, when their feet rest in the waters of the Jordan, when they actually touch the water, then the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, and the waters which are flowing down from above shall stand in one heap, which is a very different instruction at the Jordan than it was at the Red Sea. The Red Sea, I want you to wait. When they waited all night long, the wind of God blew, the waters parted, and then they moved. Here he's saying, something else. And what he's saying is this, while sometimes you do need to wait, stand still and see, sometimes you need to walk. Because sometimes, indeed, it's not until you step into the river, if you will, into the deep water, that the waters actually begin to part. Indeed, And sometimes if you wait for the waters to be parted before you make your move, you can sit on that shore for the rest of your life. And Pharaoh's not going to get you. That's not the picture here. You just won't get across. You won't enter in. You'll never be delivered. You'll never taste your destiny. Which doesn't mean you're going to die. But you're going to miss something very significant. Notice still the energy here is not running from something. There's no threat of death. It's running to something. The question is, will you? Because you could just sit on that shore, camp out and live in that place. Many people do their whole life wondering, is there more? Is this all there is? Well, there is more. but you're going to have to step into some deep water to enter in now to really understand the scene and the drama I think that's involved indeed the risk that is involved because even though they're not running from Pharaoh there is some risk involved in this I need to tell you a little bit more about the Jordan River and what it meant to these people both in symbol and in reality because in the ancient world water was very scarce so rivers were highly valued Indeed, in many cultures, rivers were seen as sacred. They were seen as a source of life. In Egypt, it was the Nile River. In India, it was the Ganges River. But to Israel, the Jordan River wasn't seen as sacred. It wasn't seen so much as a source of life. It was, in fact, dial into this, a source of frustration for them. For the Jordan River that they're standing on the shores of and looking at stood symbolically as a kind of barrier to them, standing between the people of God and the land that God had promised, the land of Canaan, flowing with milk and honey. It was a barrier standing between the people of God and the life. He had called them to their destiny. He had prepared for them. So keep in mind something that I'm quite sure was in their mind as they stood on the shores of the Jordan, that they were about to do something or maybe not do something, but they were about to do something if they did it. that the previous generation had never done, cross the Jordan River. And the previous generation were God's people. They were the ones who we've been talking about for the last couple of weeks, who left Egypt, who crossed the Red Sea, belonging now to God, not to Pharaoh, no longer slaves, they are free, not just redeemed, they've been delivered. That's all the symbolism of the Red Sea. But for a variety of reasons, including their own sin, They wandered in the desert after that Red Sea experience for 40 years, grumbling and complaining that God's promises were true, that his power wasn't real. Sure, sure, they had followed God out of Egypt. They were indeed redeemed, the people of God, and even had experienced some deliverance, no longer slaves. But they never crossed over into the life, into abundance, into their, what I would call, destiny. Now, all by itself, that information I just gave you gives to this scene tremendous significance, bringing with it, I think, a tremendous amount of dramatic tension because they're not on the shores, they're not just on the shores of some river. They are on the verge, symbolically, this is the story, they're on the verge of entering into something with God that their fathers and their mothers had spoken of in Sunday school. They maybe heard the stories and yearned for, but never actually saw. So what this is on the shores of the Jordan River, even thinking maybe there's a way to get across into this different kind of life, this is dream come true kind of stuff. Maybe even stuff they quit believing could actually be. But here it is, they're on the shore. God is about to do a new thing. And if you've ever been part of something where God was beginning to do a new thing, that is the energy, the anxiety, the tension, the fear, the hope that's all wrapped into what you feel like when you're on the shores of the Jordan River. Now, to that dramatic reality, add this. While the Jordan River for the people of Israel was a barrier, an obstacle, keeping them from the land of Canaan, to the people of Canaan, who lived on the other side, symbolically, just kind of try to enter into this, the people of Canaan being the inhabitants of the land, the Jordan was to them protection from the people of Israel. Incredible picture, again, to me, because what it pictures is this, that as long as the people of God wandered in the desert, as long as they refused to obey God, grumbled amongst themselves, never crossed the Jordan. What that meant to the people of Canaan was that they were safe. What it meant was the fortified cities of Canaan and the worship of Baal, which I don't have time to go into, but we've done a considerable amount of teaching on that. All of that stuff, as long as God's people never enter into this kind of destiny, all that stuff is safe. They could function unopposed because the people of God couldn't or wouldn't cross over into their destiny. Creating a fascinating, actually disturbing picture in my mind of a present day picture in my mind of an impotent church. Churches on all corners. right in the middle of a lost and dying culture. Sure, we're saved from Egypt. We're all going to heaven when we die. But very little impact in the culture for good or for God. Consider now also, as I try to pull this picture together, the river itself. Because beyond the spiritual symbolism of the river is this physical reality that brings some more spiritual symbolism to it, because under normal circumstances, the Jordan River really wasn't difficult to cross. Archaeologists indicate that there were as many as 60 spots that were actually pretty easy. You could just walk right across. But Joshua chapter 3, verse 15 reveals, in this verse you could maybe easily skip over, but you got to get to get the whole picture, was that Jordan was at flood stage at this particular time, which means the water was deep and rapidly flowing, which changes the prospect of crossing dramatically because the water was deep and rapidly flowing. So it wasn't a gradual thing. The way you would kind of picture stepping into a river or a lake where you're ankle deep and knee deep and then waist deep and then eventually you're in over your head but the promise as soon as the feet touch the water the waters will part which sounds okay here we go they're parted. It didn't go like that because when these priests who we had opened door because we've talked about this story before have since referred to as first stepper step into the water it's deep deep water so the one when they stepped into the water they stepped into the water they immediately that's a little sign settle down settle down um we're in over their heads um they immediately thought they were going to die. And the kind of faith it took, I mean, you can imagine, the kind of faith, carrying an ark, you're in the water, we're going down to step into that water, believing that God would make a way and that they wouldn't die, but they would come to life. The amount of faith in that is incredible. And fear would be palpable. All of which ups the ante of this scene, particularly for those 12 priests who went first. We talked about this before. It's a thing that I kind of live with a lot and think about a lot. Because what I think about is this, how different the experience of those first steppers was, those first 12 priests was, compared to someone in the middle of the pack who crossed when the water was already piled up. Because if you're in the middle of the pack, you still have to cross over, And it's still going to be scary, and it's still going to require faith. But those first steppers had a much different experience, paid a much higher price, faced much more fear than those who came after. But what they accomplished by their willingness to face that fear, that deep water, was to create dry ground for those who came behind. So what we have here on the shores of the Jordan River is an incredible picture of actually two things. the first thing is this picture of generational sin because the very fact that the people of God in Joshua 3 had to face this obstacle called the Jordan River at all was precisely because the previous generation never did face it never did walk through it so the Jordan River and the barrier it presented is a symbol of among other things a generational thing generational sin. And most of you actually know more about that than you think you do. In fact, most of you, we've talked about this, do know a lot about this. For example, how many of you know, most of you probably do, that some of the struggles in your life right now, some of the barriers that you face in your life right now, are at least in part because of past generations of undealt with sin and dysfunction. Psychologists called this stuff family system stuff, where patterns of abuse and neglect, dysfunction, divorce, addiction, abandonment, rejection have gone on in your family, maybe, or it happens in churches for generations. It's not your fault that you're living with this same thing. It isn't fair, but you got it. We call it baggage. I married someone. They got a lot of baggage. Okay. If you stick with this story, you might just call it Jordan. You got a Jordan. And until you get across it, you'll never know freedom in that arena of your life. And every single one of us have a Jordan in our life. Most of us have several. Because the truth is, God keeps calling us deeper and deeper and deeper. And some of you, I'm quite convinced, may be on the shores of some Jordan right now. And if you are, keep in mind the energy, the direction, the motivation in this story is not just to escape this thing back there. It's to enter into something out there. It's not just from, it's to a good and spacious land. Whenever I think of this generational sin thing, and whenever I think of the first steppers, as is embodied in these 12 priests who paid a higher price than those that went before, three things come up in my mind. One is gratitude. As I think of the men and women who were first steppers in my life, who, because they were willing to step into the deep water of a risky obedience, created dry ground for me. I've told you stories countless times of my father, who in ways that I don't have time to go into, but I've told you of ways that he, and I watched him as a little kid step into deep water that I didn't even sometimes know he was doing. And in his willingness to go into scary places and face down some of his own generational sin and move into repentance and admit and repent created dry ground for me. So on one hand, it helped him step into a new and spacious land, and maybe he didn't even know that the work he was doing to set himself free was actually bringing freedoms to me. So I could walk on dry ground that I don't even know the price he paid, but also it stirs up incentive because when I know that story, it makes me want to be that kind of person too, to be willing to step into deep water and scary places and to go there believing that God will make a way if we go into those scary places, and he will bring healing. And it's not just fighting for my freedom. We're creating dry ground for generations. And the other thing it stirs up again is gratitude. I come back to gratitude because I've been here long enough, not just in life, but in this church long enough to watch my sons and my daughters, physically my sons and my daughters, and my daughters-in-law and my sons-in-law and my spiritual father, sons and daughters, come to these places in their lives and to watch them step into their deep water. And when you do, beloved, when you do, you are not just fighting for your own freedom. You are creating dry ground for generations. We talk about our next-gen ministry. This is all about that. Word about generational sin. Just another kind of a biblical paradigm for you, designed to give you hope, I think, to call you out and into freedom and to life. Deuteronomy 5, verse 8, actually kind of a bizarre, disturbing, actually, scripture about this thing. It says this. God, through the prophet, says, you shall not make for yourself an idol or any likeness of what is in heaven or on the earth or under it. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. And this is what sounds weird, sounds really mean. Visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children. Not fair to the third and fourth generation. of those who hate me, but showing loving kindness to thousands of generations, to those who love me and keep my commandments, which again, at first glance, is a text that sounds bizarre and quite unfair. It's like saying to my kids, your great grandpa, who you never know, was a jerk, so you're grounded. Man. So you realize that this passage is actually one that instills hope, if you understand it, and it's utilizing a Hebrew literary technique called poetic parallelism. I'm going to explain that, because sometimes the purpose of parallelism, and particularly you see this in the Old Testament, was for emphasis. Example, Psalm 19.1 says this, that the heavens declare the glory of God, and skies proclaim the work of his hand, which is the same thing said a different way for emphasis relative to the glory of God. Proverbs says this, there are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say enough. There are six things that God hates, seven which are an abomination to him. Now, the idea there is not that the writer suddenly thinks of one more thing. Instead, the purpose of the parallelism there is to give poetic influence or or poetic emphasis to a single point. But sometimes the purpose of this parallelism is for contrast, and that's what we see in Deuteronomy. Not to emphasize a single point, but to contrast two very different things. Example, Genesis 4.24. Lamax says, If Cain was avenged seven times, I will be avenged 77 times. Means that if you think it was dangerous to go after Cain, That's nothing compared to the danger involved in coming after me. 1 Samuel 18, 8 says this, that Saul has killed his thousands, but David, his tens of thousands. The fact is, nobody was counting there. The point is, Saul was a great warrior. But that's nothing compared to David. Bring that understanding back to this bizarre passage in Deuteronomy. Because when it says, I will punish sin to the third and fourth generation, the writer isn't counting. Three, four, okay, now you're free. That's not the point. What he's saying is this. Very pointedly, generational sin is real. You can deny it if you want, but it is real. And if it is not dealt with, it can hang around for a very, very long time and do a lot of damage, but that's nothing compared to what happens when people in any generation, in their marriage, in their church, stand up and say, enough. The cycle of sin that we are captured in is going to stop. And the way the cycle is broken is by one way or another. Walking into the deep water of a risky obedience, saying, I will trust him and obey him. I will follow him right into my fear and my pain and sometimes even my anger. Even though in doing that you think you're going to die, you think you're going to drown, but that is when the waters part, providing dry ground to walk on, and not only for you, but for generations. If you don't do it for yourself, do it for your kids and for your grandkids and for generations to follow. So the priests do what God says. They step into the deep water, the waters part, the people cross, but it didn't stop there, which speaks to this kind of ongoing rhythm of life in the kingdom of God. Indeed, for most of the rest of the book of Joshua, you have a series of battle stories centering around this singular pattern, theme, and question. And the question is this. Every time, will the people of God trust God enough again today to do what he says? To wait when he says wait. To walk when he says walk. And every time they do, in the book of Joshua, walk when he says walk and wait when he says wait. Every time they do that, another piece of the land is theirs. Another level of freedom is entered. Another dimension of life is experience. Chapter 5 of Joshua. For example, they've crossed over the Jordan River. They've entered the land. So now it's time to kind of spread out. You're in the land. Let's possess the land. And Jericho is right there, the fortified city of Jericho. Let's possess that. Let's do great things for God today. When God says in Joshua 5, verse 2, what he said last week through Steve's message, wait. Joshua 5, verse 2, because before you win the world for God, I want you to first make flint knives for yourself and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time. And when that word was given, all the people of God, particularly the sons of Israel, said, anyway, I love telling that story. Anyway, there's a couple of reasons why it was needed to be done. It wasn't actually being done a second time. If we read down a couple of verses later, it indicates that the men, the circumcision was a sign of covenant, and they had all been circumcised before they left Egypt. But in the wilderness, none of the men had been circumcised. So this was time to kind of reestablish the covenant kind of thing. But it actually speaks to several things. It does speak to covenant and remembering them, that kind of stuff. But in real time, if it's actually happening to you, it says some things like this. This is going to hurt in real time. And in this prospect of taking Jericho and kind of winning the world for God, this could slow us down. This could take some time. And it bumps up against expectations we have of what it's going to feel like when we step into destiny or into the life. Because see, I thought coming into the promised land would be painless. Milk and honey is what I heard about. I heard it would be easy. At least I thought it would be easy. But here God says that first, I want you to allow me, and I'm not going to make you, but if you want to step into this, I want you to first allow me to cut you. And symbolism of circumcision here is powerful here because among things, among the many things, it means this. I want you to allow me to cut you at the point kind of indelicate here of your power. I want you to allow me to cut you at the point of your pride, at the point of your productivity, at the point of your pleasure. I want you to give those to me. And while this feels like a singularly masculine endeavor, it isn't. Paul later in the New Testament talks about a circumcision not made with hands. circumcision of the heart, where God says to you and me, I want you to allow me to cut you at the point of your power and productivity and pleasure and pride and give it to me. And I hear echoes in that of Colossians 3 where Paul is saying that in order to become fully alive, remember this? Spent months in the first few verses of Colossians 3. There are some things that need to die to be cut off, put to death, therefore, Paul said. Immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which raises this question for us individually, but also us as a church. Would you allow that, church? Would you enter into that? Because this is not escaping from an old thing. It's about entering into a new thing. But do you want that? Well, Joshua and the people of God did. It says in Joshua 5, verse 8, Now it came about, when they had finished circumcising all the nation, that they remained in their places in the camp until they were all healed. And then the Lord said to Joshua, Today, amazing thing, I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt. That's a pretty big healing right there. Rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you, so the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day. So what is the reproach of Egypt? I think it speaks symbolically to many things, but among many other things, it's this, that taunting voice that says, among other things, this, you will always be a slave. You will never be free, at least not from that. Sure, you're redeemed, but you will never stand up straight into the fullness of who God called you to be. You will never become fully alive. You're saved, going to heaven, but enter fully into life. And not you. That's the taunting voice because you're a slave. Always have been, always will be. That's the reproach of Egypt rolls away today. Now let me close with this. Everybody has a Jordan River of some kind to face, possibly born of someone else's sin. Wasn't your fault. It was given to you, generational sin, and it's been there forever. The promise of God to you is this, Joshua 1 verse 3. You can cross that river. You can break this cycle and enter into a whole new way of living. Indeed, I promise you, every place you actually put your feet, I will give you. But you have to take the first step into what looks like deep water, and that first step is almost always a scary step, and I feel like I'm going to die step, but you won't die. Indeed, you will come to life And you will enter in Because God will make a way So here's the final word Church of the open door Joshua 1 verse 6 Be strong and courageous Verse 7 Be strong and very courageous Verse 9 Have I not commanded you Be strong and very courageous Do not tremble or be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go and he is calling you and me and us to more, to life, to freedom, to destiny. I want you to stand as we're dismissed. I just want to pray real briefly over you, but I also want to ask the altar team, the prayer ministry people, to come and take their place along with whatever elders we might have among us. Our elders a couple of weeks ago began to get involved in this prayer ministry. I think it's a very important and powerful thing. So as I pray, you just come in. If you need prayer, you come for that. Father, I pray as we just wrap this up for, again, the activation of your Spirit in us, particularly for courage, particularly for those who are at the shores of some Jordan. it isn't Pharaoh who's coming after them they would maybe be able to sit on these shores forever but never step into the fullness of who you called them to be and so I pray for a rising of courage and strength born of your spirit I pray as we your people seek to follow you wherever you call when you say wait we will wait when you say walk we will walk in all God's people said Amen Thank you.
