My name is Mary Martin Weins. I have the great privilege of offering a blessing for Mother's Day. And as I reflect on it, I realize that whether we are women or men, whether we mother children or mother in other ways, Mother's Day can actually be one of those days that highlights our needs. You may come to this day with the need to remember, to forget, to be remembered, to be honored, to be comforted, to be forgiven, to be given hope, To be given an A, I am more convinced than ever that we are to take our needs and run to our home. Our home is within the one who made us and loves us. And in that place, we are tenderly, intimately cared for, like the best of parents would care for a child. But, oh, so much better. So today, I want you to imagine with me that in the midst of a long journey, perhaps the journey of parenting, of infertility, of grieving, whatever your long journey is today, that suddenly you arrive at the place where the heart of God dwells. And God, like a mother, but the kind of mother God would be, meets you at the door with a look of unabashed welcome and draws you in. I want you to hold that picture in your mind as I read this blessing over you. When you come to the house of God with the mud of trying dripping from your sleeves, covered in cruelties, your own and others, obscured by false agreements, love washes, washes, washes you like water lapping on a rock, saying, let me get that off of you. And there you are. And now do you remember? So let us run to the house of God. When you come wounded to the house of God, your healer builds a circle around you, stands guard, and houses your pain. Gently, methodically tends each hurt saying, all is well. You will be well. At all times, I am working to make all things well. So let us run to the house of God. When you come undone in the house of God, compassion gathers you up, remembers who you are, and breathes vitality back into you saying, here, here is your body. Here again are your hands, are your feet, is your mouth. Here is your mind. Here is your spirit. Here I am. Here you are. So let us run to the house of God. When you are hungry in the house of God, the one who holds your life sets out to nourish you entirely, to satisfy and delight your whole being, to hearten you with substance, saying, take your time. Listen to me. I have all you need. And it is free. Free. Free. So let us run to the house of God. When you are naked in the house of God, when you stand exposed by the limits of being human, what you can't make happen what you can't stop from happening what you can't know your maker covers you sees you and clothes you saying here is safety here is grace I know how you are made and I call you good good good so let us run to the house of God And when the time is right, in the house of God, love doesn't dance, opens wide the doors, and presents you to the world, saying, this is my beloved, with whom I am pleased, so pleased, so very pleased. Amen. Wow. And God, like a mother, she said But the kind of mother God would be if God were a mother Meet you at the door With a look of unabashed welcome and draws you in To wash you when you're muddy To heal you when you're wounded To feed you when you're hungry To restore you and to clothe you breathing vitality back into you, then covering you and clothing you, saying, here's safety, and here's grace. Things that a mother does. Things that a mother says. So run to the house of God, Mary said. Like a child would do when they've fallen or gotten dirty or became hungry or hurt. I'm going home. I want my mom. Thank you, Mary. This is the third year that Mary has done this Mother's Day blessing. But it's the first year that she gave to me and a group of us, actually, the script a week or so ahead of time because she was kind of looking for some advice about tweaking it. Should I say it this way or should I say it that way? And what that means is a little over a week ago, I had what she read in my hands and was able to really get into it and think about it. And it affected what I wanted to talk about today. And so let's pray as we go to the word of the morning. God, all of who you are is who we want to know. What dawns on me about that is that there is more and more and more to know. So help us by your Spirit to know more about who you are. I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. All my life I've had a pretty clear picture in my mind of God as a father. He's a good father. The kind of father God would be if God were a father. The kind of father that Jesus actually called Abba, which is a term of endearment. He called God his father. He called God Abba, which in Jesus' day, we've talked about this before, was kind of scandalous. bringing God a little too close, a little too intimate, this language of Jesus calling the father Abba was. This language is not detached or distant, untouchable. So God as father, as I've kind of seen him through the eyes even of Jesus, I understand. But God as mother sounds odd to me, even wrong to me, stirs up anxiety actually in me for a number of reasons. Among them is this, that when Jesus taught us to pray, he said, pray then this way, our father, the one who is in heaven, hallowed be thy name. He didn't say our mother. I mean, even just to say that sounds odd to me, even wrong to me, somehow dangerous to me. Is this a slippery slope to even talk this way? Well, I don't know, but I do know this, and I know this from the scriptures, that God is fundamentally spirit, which is actually exactly what Jesus said in John 4, 24, which means that God is neither male or female. He is neither masculine or feminine. God is neither father or mother, But in some sense, God is both male and female, masculine and feminine, father and mother, which we are, in fact, given a glimpse of in many places. But maybe the most profound, because it's in the beginning, is in Genesis chapter 127. In the context of creation, when it says that God created man, that is humankind, In his own image, he created humans. Male and female, he created them, and they were the image of God, the imago Dei, which we've talked about a lot around here at Open Door, that the image of God is not just revealed in the masculine or in the feminine, but when you see both masculine and feminine coming fully together in rightly ordered ways, you see in that union, in that fullness of expression of masculine and feminine. You see something in that thing together of the image of God. You see something of the glory and the fullness of God. So maybe the best way to say it is this, that God is not genderless, neither male nor female, which everybody is trying to do. I mean, to kind of counteract this whole thing, we have a genderless Bible, which is fine. But more accurate, I think, is this, that God is not genderless. God is genderful, male and female, masculine and feminine, father and mother. So God our Father, to think in those kinds of terms, is right and true. And God our Mother, to think in those terms, is right and true. But one without the other, though right and true, is incomplete. All of which means this. That when, like a child, I decide I want to go home because I got muddy and I need to be washed, because I got wounded and I need to be healed, because I got hungry and I need to be fed, because I unraveled, I became undone and need to be restored because I'm naked and I need to be clothed, that I run to the house of God. Again, borrowing Mary's words, because I want to go home. And when I get there, to home, there is God. Because God is our home, and God is our Father. He's a good Father. The kind of Father God would be if God were Father. But God is also our Mother. Which still sounds so odd, even wrong. somehow dangerous to me. Is this a slippery slope? And all of that, you guys, is at least part of why in the context of this Mother's Day, in the context of Mary's words, and even in the context of this sermon series we're in, in Colossians 3, verses 18 to 25, dealing with women and men, submission and love, marriage and family and ministry as well, particularly in the last few weeks around women in ministry. In the context of all that, I want to talk this morning about the feminine face of God. Indeed, I want to introduce you to God, who's not just our father, but God who is our mother too, which still just sounds so odd and even wrong, but I don't think it is. And while there are any number of places in the scriptures that I could bring you to begin this introduction to the feminine face of God, I'd like to begin with something kind of simple, something that will give us a taste, something that I think is kind of familiar to many of us, actually. Proverbs 8, verse 1, where wisdom is spoken of. In fact, the Proverbs are entitled, they're called wisdom literature, a whole body of ancient literature in the scriptures. But wisdom in Proverbs 8 is personified in the feminine voice as a woman, interestingly, says this. Proverbs 8, verse 1, does not wisdom call out? An understanding raise her voice. In the heights along the way where the paths meet, she takes her stand. Beside the gates leading into the city at the entrances, she cries aloud, To you, O men, I call out. I raise my voice to all mankind. You who are simple, gain prudence. You who are foolish, gain understanding. Listen, for I have worthy things to say. I open my lips to speak what is right. My mouth speaks what is true. For my lips detest wickedness. All the words of my mouth are just. None of them is crooked or perverse. To the discerning, all of them are right. They are faultless to those who have knowledge. So choose my instruction instead of silver. Knowledge rather than choice scolds. For wisdom is more precious than rubies. And nothing you desire can compare with her. which in light of the series we've been in on women in ministry strikes me as kind of odd because when this reverence for the feminine that is rooted in the sacred text indeed the ancient text it's it's odd to me I mean I just I just kind of noticed that when I read this kind of having the series we've been in in mind it's it's odd to me that in Jesus day women themselves, while the Proverbs personifies wisdom as a woman, women themselves in Jesus, they weren't seen as wise at all. Remember we talked about this. Not allowed to study the Torah? They couldn't handle that. Not allowed in the temple where only the men could go? Couldn't handle, in fact, I even thought, why wouldn't they let women come in there if they're personified by wisdom? Wouldn't want any wisdom where the men are. Okay, anyway. Not a viable witness. Women in Jesus' day, remember this? We're not considered a viable witness in a court of law, which makes me wonder what happened. Because from the beginning, it wasn't that way. Just kind of keep that in your hopper and move back to the text, because I want you to notice in Proverbs how far the writer of this proverb takes this feminine dimension, verse 22. It shifts gears from wisdom personified as a woman to this, verse 22. The Lord possessed me. It's in the first person now. Or brought me forth is another way to say it. At the beginning of his work, before his deeds of old, I was appointed from eternity, from the beginning, before the world began. When there were no oceans, I was given birth. when there were no springs abounding with water, before the mountains were settled in their place, before the hills I was given birth. I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep. Verse 30, then I was the craftsman at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence, rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind. And this idea of what the ancients used to refer to as the sacred feminine kind of floats all throughout the scriptures, beginning in the beginning with a God in Genesis 1 that says that the masculine and the feminine together are the reflection of his image. Psalm 143 verse 10 says this, Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. May your good spirit, significant rendering there, may your good spirit lead me on level ground. That word spirit is one familiar to us. In the Hebrew, we've talked about this before. The Hebrew word there is ruach, and it means breath. It appears 387 times in the scriptures, but most of the time, it's in the feminine voice. I don't think in the times we've taught this, we've brought attention to that. So when the ancients read this word ruach in the Hebrew, They thought breath of God. They thought spirit of God, the good spirit who was leading us and guiding us, comforting, hovering, and brooding over us. But it was in the feminine voice. So it was a feminine essence, which doesn't mean that God is a woman. There is a feminine essence, however, to this. Indeed, there was an ancient Jewish phrase that sometimes referred to the ruach of God as she. In fact, they would say literally the she who dwells within, which makes some nervous. Genesis 1, verse 12, again, verse 2, rather. Fascinating to me. Second verse in the Bible. Kind of, I don't know, significant. It's the spirit of God, it says. The end of verse 2, the ruach of God that is brooding, moving, hovering over the surface of the waters. And in that picture, it's in the feminine. In the picture of brooding, it's not a woman. It's a spirit. It's a feminine spirit brooding over the waters, hovering over the waters, before creation, about to give what? Birth to creation. Genesis 17. One of the many places where a name is given to God to describe what he's like. You're familiar with these, like God is Jehovah Rapha, which means God is the God who heals. Rapha means to heal. So what he does is who he is, and who he is is what he does. He is Jehovah Rapha. He is the God who heals. It's his name, but it's what he does as, well, God is provider. God is our shield. God is our strength. Genesis 17 verse 1 says this, when Abram was 99 years old, the Lord appeared to him and said, I am God Almighty. Now, in most of your Bibles, and I think in all of your Bibles, there's a little letter. If you see that word, there's a little letter, which means you got to look down at the bottom of the Bible and kind of see what the notation there is. And that word almighty is the Hebrew word, El Shaddai. And most of your Bibles will actually tell you that. And El Shaddai is a word that many of you know, not because of the scripture, but because of Amy Grant. Remember that? She wrote a song, El Shaddai, El Shaddai, Actually, the Hebrew language, you know, Steve has been getting into this more and more and kind of helping me actually get into it more and more and see it's a multi-layered language. And it's a lot like Greek. We've experienced the same kind of things when we've studied words in the Greek, but the Hebrew is fascinatingly picturesque. But one of the things that's interesting about the Hebrew language is that there's only 8,000 words. You're kidding. It doesn't mean anything. In English, by contrast, we have hundreds of thousands of words, which means, among other things, this. That Hebrew words, because there's actually so few of them, are multi-layered. They have shades of meaning and nuance of meaning. And so you can sit on a word and it means this, but it also means that. And it also means that. And it just gets bigger and bigger. And it paints these pictures. And then you think about language. It's so hard to understand. But actually, when you get into the Hebrew, it paints pictures and describes things in such a way that are very easy to understand. Because the spear is like the wind. It's a metaphor. It's not wind. It's like the wind. And you get a sense of something. But these words, these Hebrew words, have more than one meaning. El Shaddai is a word like that. It has shades of meaning. And in some ways, El Shaddai, especially if you just look at it on the surface, it's a very masculine word, almighty. In fact, in my Bible at the bottom, it says, almighty God standing on a mountain, all powerful. That's very masculine. But the word itself, this is weird, is actually in the feminine. It's a compound word, meaning it has, meaning it's a compound word. El Shaddai. Dai literally means day or of the day. Shad literally means she. Whoa, didn't know that. Meaning El Shaddai, she who is enough for the day. El Shaddai, that is God. She who provides, takes care of you. She who nourishes and nurtures you. Indeed, in some Jewish traditions, the word was translated because they kind of got caught up in the feminine nature of this. It's literally translated in some Jewish traditions as the double-breasted one. Yeah, yeah. Are you kidding? I'm thinking Sunday school teachers, flannel graph that. You know, good luck with that. Grandpa? I can hear that one. Actually, Ray Vanderlyn. This is a guy I really trust. Ray Vanderlyn is a name that might be familiar to some of us here at Open Door because Steve and I used him a lot as a resource person when we were going through the Way of the Rabbi series. and he's a New Testament scholar, specializes in Middle East studies but as it comes to this word El Shaddai, he said this, he actually said that he was in a Torah class with a group of 12 year old Jewish boys and they were going through Deuteronomy or they were going through this text and when they came to this name El Shaddai, these 12 year old boys started to giggle. Anyway. So God is like a father but he's the kind of father God would be if God were a father, but God is like a mother too, but the kind of mother God would be. Psalm 131. My heart is not proud, my eyes are not haughty, nor do I involve myself in great things or things too difficult for me. Surely I have composed and quieted my soul like a weaned child. Rest against his mother, so my soul is like a weaned child within me. O Israel, hope in God. Isaiah 66, fascinating picture here. Isaiah, the people, Israel, is in exile. Exile dials me right back into Mary's words, having wandered far from home. And if you've wandered far from home like a little child, whether you're an Israelite in exile or you're a person sitting here who've wandered far from home, what happens in exile is you get muddy and you need to be washed. You got hurt and you need to be healed. You got hungry and you need to be fed. You got undone and you need to be restored. You became naked and you need to be clothed. So God in Isaiah 66 is saying, okay, you can come back home. And if you do, Isaiah 66, 12 says this, I will extend peace to you. I know you're kind of scared to come home, but I'm telling you you can come because I will extend peace to you like a river. And you shall be nursed. You shall be carried on the hip. The NIV says you shall be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees. The word dandled means I have no idea. But it's her knees. As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you and you will be comforted. Last text. Deuteronomy 30. Once again, the picture is exile, which fits in with what we're talking about here, having wandered far from home. So now they're muddy and need to be washed and healed, hurt and need to be healed. So God in Deuteronomy 33, verse 3, says this, that I, the Lord, your God, you can come home and you can come home and I will restore you from captivity. And I will have compassion on you and will gather you back again from all the peoples where you were scattered. So I will bring you home. But the critical word there that I want us to catch that has this kind of feminine picture again is the word compassion, which comes from the Hebrew word raham. Say that, raham, and then spit someplace. Raham, which has as its root the womb. The word raham means literally womb. So ancient rabbis would come to this word raham in the text, and we have the word compassion. And it works, that's right, but it's one of the nuances of the word raham. The Hebrew, the ancient rabbis would come to this raham word in the text and say God is raham. God is compassion. What is compassion? Well, one way to picture compassion is it's womb-like, Which is weird. So when the text says God will have raham, compassion, it means, among other things, this, that God will womb you. Whatever. I feel strange. Keep thinking. In fact, if you stay with some other texts, it's not just something God will do. God will womb you. It's something, actually, that God is. It's something God is, does, but it's also part of who God is. Exodus 33 verse 19 says this. When God says to Moses, in fact, Moses has come to God and says, I want to see your glory. I want to see you. And God, in effect, says, you can't see me, but if you hide yourself in the clubs of the rock, I'm going to pass by. And if you look where I left, you'll kind of see my essence. But in the text, it says, Exodus 33, 19, I'm going to show you, says God to Moses, who I am. Indeed, I myself will make all my goodness to pass before you, and I will proclaim to you my name. And then he says, my name is gracious. In fact, he said, I will be gracious to who I will be gracious. And my name is compassion. I will have compassion on who I will have compassion. My name is gracious. My name is Raham. In other words, I am Raham. I am womb-like, which means what? A couple things. And if I was a Hebrew teacher and we would be kind of sitting here together and I'd go, what do you think of when you think of a womb? And I don't know what you would come up with, but it's, well, it's safe and it's dark and it's warm and it's nourishing. So God is safe and warm and nourishing. Okay, in the womb, you're protected, if it's a safe womb. In the womb, you are fed, and it's all for free, which for some of you, as I describe that place, that sometimes you can experience in God the safety, the warmth, even maybe a kind of darkness that makes you feel, okay, I don't gotta worry about anything. For some of you, this womb metaphor is powerful. And you're sitting there thinking, oh, this is so beautiful. But others, I know this. I know this. Others of you are sitting here thinking, you. Womb. Okay. Get me out of here. In more ways than one. When you think about a womb, you go, I want to get out of that. When you're thinking maybe about our church right now, I want to get out of this room right now. Let me tell you why. indeed if you're like me um and this really is me you kind of bristle at all this warm and gooey woomy stuff uh like literally get me out of here and i think there's some reasons for that and actually there may be a number but these or this would be my reason and this is personal um because womb energy, I kind of refer to it as there's a womb energy, because femininity, which is a very good, wonderful thing. I think I'm making that clear in this talk. When it becomes disordered, womb energy, femininity, when it becomes disordered, is not a nurturing thing. It is a consuming thing, a controlling thing, a devouring thing, a smothering thing. Some of you didn't get mothered. You got smothered. And if you did, you know, you're not connecting all the dots when I'm talking about women. You wonder, why when he's talking about this wound there, I just go, all this woomy gooey stuff. I want to get out of here. Because in every conceivable way, both literally and figuratively, you have spent your life trying to get away from that feminine smothering thing. Get me out of here. Get me away from that. I've spent a good portion of my life trying to get away from that. Let me ask you a question. Anything I'm saying here resonate with anyone? Like, do you know what I'm talking about? Can any of you feel this? Because I can. You know, we talk a lot about the father wound, and guys talk a lot about the father wound. I'm sure women do as well. In fact, when we went, whenever we go through anything like this, but I remember a few years ago we went through a series on the Lord's Prayer where Jesus is our Father. We spent several months, obviously, on the Lord's Prayer, but we spent several weeks on the front end trying to deal with all the ways it was hard to see God as a father. Because of all the father wounds we've got, it's hard to see God as a father who is approachable. So God is a father. but he's the kind of father God would be. It takes a lot of clarifying and separating from my perceptions of what my physical father is like. But there's a mother wound, too. It's harder to talk about. Guys, oh, man. You know, we're supposed to have a father wound. And even deal with the father wound. You look at your dad straight in the face, you punch him in the face, you can't hit your mom. You know what I did with my mom? I did this. Stay away. I gotta get out of here. But I didn't do that to just my mom. I started doing that to my wife. And I don't wanna do that. Something here needs to be healed. Oh my goodness, I'm telling you too much. See, if you're gonna use this womb picture, you gotta get the whole picture. Because while the womb is safe and warm, and nourishing if it's rightly ordered, if it's a healthy feminine energy that you're around. Even if it's a healthy feminine energy, it doesn't stop with safe and warm and nourishing. You can't get stuck there because ultimately the purpose of the womb, both literally and figuratively, is to be a place from which life comes. And you will come to life. So when God describes himself as womb-like, I will womb you. It does create a picture of safety, warmth, nurture. But the point of it all is to bring you to life, to be fully alive. Puts a fascinating spin on the interaction between Jesus and Nicodemus. Remember that? John chapter 3. Where Jesus says this thing that some of us think we know what it means. You must be what? Born again. Hmm. How would an ancient Jew have heard that? You must go to a Billy Graham crusade. Well, okay. It means that. I wonder if it means more than that. Because that is a phrase that has come to mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but at its roots, to be born again, at its root, it's speaking of the raham of God, the womb of God. So he's saying something maybe even weirder than we thought. You must be wombed again, which sounds more than a little strange. But it's really good news. You know why? Because it means we can be rewombed. Because it means we can be born again. Say it this way. Because it means the places in you and in me that have died, and maybe there's more than one place in you and me that have died, can come to life again. And while this language might still sound foreign to some of you, In truth, I think we know this better than we think we do. Now, the language may be foreign. Wombing and, well, it's weird language. But I know that if you can just get into this, you can maybe even be thinking of times when you were in the womb of God. There was a season of time where you, in fact, someone suggested to me this last week, and just a picture grew in my mind. They reminded me of years ago. And I see this wombing thing is actually part of our story. And it happens today. In fact, I think it happens in this room from time to time. It might be happening to some of you even right now. But how many of you remember Robinsdale High School? Any of you there? Well, Robinsdale High School, for those of you who weren't, was a dark and dingy, smelly, hot place. But there's a story that continually comes out of that season. And people kind of tell their testimony. In fact, many people still have this kind of testimony, not connected to that gym, but to their experience at Open Door. But people would say this. I came to Open Door, and I kind of slid in the side door, and it was kind of dark in there, so I would climb up into the bleachers and sit way up top where no one would see me in the dark, and I would kind of sit, and I picture people like this, and I kind of get in this fetal position and weep for six months. and we hear that over and over again and we just go, what is that? Oh, that's God. I just, I don't know. There's some anointing on what God was doing in those days and I love it when I keep hearing those services, talks or testimonies because I hear those things from you even now and now what I think is, oh my goodness, God, in that place for some of you was wooming you. In fact, another one of the stories we often hear is people say, I wept for six months. It was me. I just sat there and weep. You didn't even hear the talk. I mean, I just wept. But then six months later, I quit. I wasn't weeping anymore because they sang different songs. It wasn't the songs. It never was the songs. You were in the womb of God. And then when you came out alive, you were alive. You don't get stuck in weeping for the rest of your life. You might go back there. I hope you get this picture. Because again, I think you know it better than you think you do. So run to the house of God. Because like children who've wandered far from home, we're muddy and need to be washed, wounded, need to be healed, undone, and need to be restored, naked, and need to be clothed. And some of you need that right here, right now. It's part of why I've asked Mary to come back up and read these words one more time in a slightly different way. Words that reveal to us the feminine face of God. Because while God is like a father, God is also like a mother. But God's the kind of mother God would be. When you come to the house of God with the mud of trying dripping from your sleeves, covered in cruelties, your own and others, obscured by false agreements, she cleans your clothes, shakes them out, and hangs them up to dry. And you, she washes, washes, washes, like water lapping on a rock, saying, let me get that off of you. And there you are. And now do you remember? So let us run to the house of God. When you come wounded to the house of God, she builds a circle around you. She stands guard and houses your pain. She holds your weeping head in her lap and whispers I know Gently, methodically she tends each hurt Saying, all is well You will be well At all times I work to make all things well So let us run to the house of God When you come undone in the house of God She gathers you up. She brings back all your scattered parts. She remembers who you are. She breathes vitality back into you, saying, Here, here is your body. Here again are your hands. Are your feet, is your mouth. Here is your mind. Here is your spirit. Here I am. Here you are. So let us run to the house of God. When you are hungry in the house of God, she sets out to nourish you entirely. She satisfies and delights your whole being. She heartens you with substance, saying, take your time. Listen to me. I have all you need. It is free, free, free. So let us run to the house of God. When you are naked in the house of God, when you stand exposed by the limits of being human, what you can't make happen, what you can't stop from happening, what you can't know, she covers you, she sees you, and clothes you saying, here is safety, here is grace. I know how you were made, and I call you good, good, good. So let us run to the house of God. And when the time is right in the house of God, she does a dance. She opens wide the doors. She presents you to the world saying, this is my beloved, with whom I am pleased, so pleased, so very pleased. I want you to stand with me. And I'm going to ask the ministry team people to come and take their place. Because if it's like last night, there's things in a talk like this that stir things up that need to be touched and maybe healed and need a human face to be with you in this. But I want to speak something over you as I close. God is everything you need. If you need a father, God is father. If you need a mother, God is mother. If you need strength, God is strength. If you need healing, God is Jehovah Rapha, the God who heals. So run to the house of God. Because like children who've wandered far from home, we get muddy and need to be washed. We get wounded and need to be healed. We get hungry and need to be fed. We become undone and need to be restored. We wind up naked and need to be clothed. And some of you need that. right now. So come. I'm gonna pray. It even occurs to me that some of you, if you wanna pray with some people around you, I've sensed the presence of God in this room since worship began. God is here. And so hang around for whatever ministry there might be. You will be dismissed. I just wanna pray. Father, whatever gifts you've got for us that need to be received in prayer time and huddling up and walking out to our cars and the gathering place and just continuing discussions around this. I pray that you mediate it. I pray that you give it. I pray that you help us enter into it and receive everything you've got for us. And I pray these things in Jesus' name and all God's people said, amen. Amen.
