Music On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem. And all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. But Saul began destroying the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison. Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there. When the crowds heard Philip, they saw the signs he performed, and they all paid close attention to what he said. For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. So there was great joy in that city. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. So this is the church gathered, and we gather because God is here. And that is a good thing to remember. and where we're at in the story what we do around here is just slowly walk our way through a book of the bible what we're doing lately is the book of the acts we're on chapter 8 and acts is the story of the little first community of followers of jesus who gathered around him jesus the one who died the one who rose again and this little community of people that numbered somewhere between three and five thousand people at the point in which in our story that we're at had been experiencing joy and presence and favor from all the people, but now we're in a time where they're experiencing great hardship, great suffering, and great pain. Stephen, one of their brightest and best, was killed. He was stoned in chapter 7. And Saul, we read, is ravaging the church, and everyone is scattered. You just heard Sarah read. And at the front, that sounds like a really scary thing. And it is a scary thing to be scattered. What does it mean to have a little community that you're with, that you share meals with and worship with, and then one day you're forced to flee? And they went all over Judea and all over Samaria. But in the last few weeks, we've looked at what they intended, What Saul intended for evil, God intended for good. And the scattering wasn't just this painful experience. It was a scattering of seed like a farmer might do. Like God might say, my love is so great that it can't stay in Jerusalem. It has to radiate outward. And in fact, the story of the book of the Acts is a story of God's continual outpouring on God's people And the direction that continually that love flows is it radiates from a pulsating center of life outward. It can't not do that. That's where it goes. And so these people that were scattered, a metaphor that Dave added to the picture, which I loved, was it was like a fire, a grass fire that people tried to stomp out. Saul tried to stomp out, but you can't stomp out a grass fire. In fact, it shoots out little sparks everywhere, and pretty soon the whole thing is ablaze. these people gossiped in the streets about they proclaimed good news in the kitchens and in their fields they good news they euangelion to everywhere they went which raised the question what in the world were they good newsing about because their relatives were in prison they'd been driven from their homes Saul was ravaging their community and yet when they visited communities like Philip did in Samaria, and when he cast out demons and healed people, the result in those cities were great joy, as Sarah just read. They were good-newsing. But they were going through a painful time at the same time. And so Dave asked last week, is it worth it when you do that? What do you need to know when you're good-newsing in the face of incredible pain. So we read John's revelation. John, as an older man, was lying, languishing on the island of Patmos, and he sees this in Revelation 5. Revelation 5, verses 4 and 5. I wept. You ever been there? I wept. And I wept. Because the field of need was so great. And I couldn't do anything about it. And we couldn't do anything about it. No one was found worthy to open the scroll, the inheritance that God has for God's people, or even to look inside. Then one of the elders in this vision that John had said to me, Do not weep, John. See, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has triumphed. That is euangelion. That is good news. In the face of darkness and death, he has triumphed because he is able to open the scroll and its seven seals. So stop weeping, John. There is someone who can open the seals. There is someone in whom there exists a multitude of good news for all people at all times. For behold, there has come unto you a child. And that child will be great life and light. Worthy is the lamb to restore what has been lost, to rebuild what has been broken. There is one. That one is worthy. And that's why the people had something to have good news about. Amen. And so this week, the question I want to sit with is, what does good newsing look like in the midst of so much brokenness in this world? What does good newsing look like? And is it more than just a thing that we think about in our minds and try to explain with our mouths so that other people can hear with their ears? Is it maybe more than that? I was in the hospital this last Friday, visiting someone, not because of myself. But I was visiting this little couple, and this young couple, first child, and the child, two days old, was fighting for his life. He had bleeding on the brain, which led to some seizures, which led to his breathing stopping, which led to his heart beating way too fast. And as I sat with this young couple, They were just telling me the story the last couple days, and this is not, you know, when you're in the hospital, you're ready to have your baby born, this is not the news you want to get. And so I sat with them, I prayed with them. But, you know, when you're in those moments, even as a pastor, you're thinking, okay, God, I mean, you really need to show up here because there's no words I can say that'll bring the kind of comfort that this couple needs. And then pretty soon this older woman walks in, and then the wife's face just brightens. And she goes, oh, that's my mom. She's been here ever since the trouble started. She hasn't left my side. When I can't be with my little baby, she's with them. And she just went, oh, I don't know what I'd do without her. And then this older gentleman walked in. And, of course, it was her dad. And he came in and checked in on them and said, you know, do I need anything? And she said, that's my dad. I don't know what I'd do without him. And I talked to this mom and dad afterwards, these grandparents of this little baby who's fighting for his life. And I just said, you need to know you're bringing good news. You're good newsing right here in the hospital. And it's like they were like, we are? Yes. Because you have something in you that cannot be put out. And then I walked away and prayed and here's the deal. The question when it comes to good newsing is, what is inside of you? What fire exists inside of you that other people might actually get warm around? I think when we think about good newsing we think about this thing that's out here that we have to sort of this theological argument that we have to tie up and put in a bow and then get into our minds and it has to come out of our mouth in a way that's compelling in a way that makes people believe in something that previously they didn't believe in but what I wonder is is if it's something that just exists so purely and really inside of you because of what you have tasted and experienced of the living God because of what you went from death to life so that what's inside of you is a seed of life that will sprout up into more life without you even knowing it, without you even trying. You just show up at the hospital and do what you do in your light. You just show up at your work and do what you do in your light. You just show up in your home For some of you, you don't need to walk any farther than from your bed to downstairs. And the little people that surround you. Your light, loving them, is euangelion. So the question is, what's inside of you? The art of good newsing is what I've titled this sermon. And what it is, is this. you must have some actual good news in you in order to be good news to others. It's not something that you grab out here, wrestle down into a theological statement that you say with your mouth after having thought about with your head so people hear it with their ears. It's something that exists inside of you. You can't give what you don't have. I remember a couple years ago, Joel and I, we were invited down to the Minnesota Teen Challenge place down in Minneapolis. And there's a few hundred people in there. And the deal is he leads some worship. I do a talk. And these 200 or 300 people that have been incarcerated, that maybe have been on drugs, that their lives have been wrecked, and they're trying to build it back together. And there's a little tension in me when I come and speak to places like that. Because it's like, you know, you better not bring any fake, pious cliches to that room. And it doesn't even really work that well in this room, right? But it really doesn't work in that room. And so Joel leads some worship. But then at the end of the worship set, he sends the rest of the worship team down to sit by me down here. And he goes, yeah, I want to play this song. And it's based out of my own experiences. And the song is called Dangerous Man. the song that Joel wrote. And yeah, some of you have heard it. And it's just the story of how he became a dangerous man when what was worst about him got made public. And then he received grace and forgiveness. And so now I'm a dangerous man because I got nothing to hide and nothing to lose. And as he was playing that, it was this conversation that started between him and these guys in Minnesota Teen Challenge. And they were like, that's right. Amen. Uh-huh. Woo! yeah. And it was like, wow. And it was like, because Joel was speaking truth. The reality, the fire that was inside of Joel was lighting a fire inside of them. And it wasn't just a theological belief that Joel had thought about up here and shared with his mouth and went into their ears. It was something that went from his heart to their heart. And you know what it was? Good news. To dying people, you better have a message that says, I was blind. And you know what? In some crazy way, because of the grace of God and power of Jesus, I can now see. So I just want to tell you about it. That's good news. a couple weeks ago after I preached one of my friends here sometimes after I preach he takes the message note section of the bulletin tears it off and then he writes a note to me and you know it's usually something real cool and it shows me that he was actually listening to the talk which was amazing I'm like wow you actually heard it and you know it's not like the music was too loud I don't like your boots or something like that So after two weeks ago, he said, so where am I scattered? Winona. So I'm going to Winona to work these next couple weeks. And who will I good news with? Question mark. And he lists three people's names. The first person's name, I won't, and I'm sharing this story with permission, but I won't share the stories of the names. He said, this guy's going through a divorce. So I imagine we're probably going to talk. second name this guy's about ready to retire but he just recently found out that he has terminal cancer so he has six months to a year to live then he writes is this guy scared or what third guy he's just a guy I'm probably going to have dinner with most nights and so I just wonder what's going to come up in our conversation what is it like to good news with people who are in pain with people that have experienced life-changing, life-altering illness or the kind of news that wrecks their world? What does it mean to good news with them in ways that are more than just things you think in your head that come out of your mouth that goes into their ears? What does it mean to go from your heart to their heart? What does it mean to have a life inside of you that might bring good news. Colossians 1.27, we read this. Remember Colossians? I think we spent about seven years there. So this was like 100 years ago that we did this verse. To them, the Gentiles, God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery. We don't really like the word mystery when it comes to God or Christianity, do we? We like to kind of nail things down, make sure it's three things that we can all understand with our minds, say with our mouths so we can hear with our ears. But right in the scriptures, it's called a mystery. And the mystery is this, Christ in you. That's the hope of glory. Amen. That's the hope of glory. Christ radiating out of the cracks in your life. you know we like to I like to spackle up the cracks you know let's let's let's make spackle sand spackle sand you ever you ever around those people that they spackle in sand about 19 times even when they fill in a little that's me actually that's spackle sand spackle sand so when I paint you can't even tell there was any crack there in the first place that's how I like it but not according to the mystery of Christ in you means I'm looking for followers who are willing to let their cracks show so that the light of Christ may come out. That's the hope of glory. Broken, desperate people who show up in hospital rooms and say, my only hope is Jesus. My only hope to help you is the fact that there's someone that exists inside of me that's bigger than me because I don't have what you need. I don't have what you need. Christ in you, showing through your cracks. the hope of glory. We have these, in our living room, we have these two little dents on one of our walls that happen in a fit of anger in our household. Something was thrown, two little dents, and we haven't spackled those over. That's our little reminder. You know, we need you, God. We also haven't spackled them over because we just haven't taken the time to do that. we have three kids what does it look like to bring good news in ways that really is good news in your life in your actual life what does it look like to bring euangelion to bring good news to people in ways that's bigger than just things you think about in your head so that you can say them with your mouth so they can go into other people's ears what does it look like to good news from your heart in a way that connects with other people's heart in a world that frankly is really, really sick right now. Well, in my studying this week, I went to John chapter 11, the story of Jesus and Lazarus. And you know the story, I think, but Mary and Martha and Lazarus, they're brothers and sisters, and we read early in chapter 11 of John that they're dear friends of Jesus. Jesus loves these three. He spent a lot of time around them. They live in this little suburb of Jerusalem called Bethany, two miles away. And Lazarus is really sick. He's dying. Mary sends word to Jesus, Jesus, come. If you come, then he won't die. But Jesus doesn't come, and Lazarus does die. And then we read later on that Martha goes out and meets Jesus, but Mary stays behind. And have you been there? Or you've asked God for something? And God doesn't answer that question, and then that hope dies. And then when God does show up, what do you do? You stay behind. And I don't blame Mary. I love that that is in the Scriptures for us to read. Mary stayed behind because she was upset. Isn't that great? Right in the Scriptures. John 11. But then Martha went and met Jesus, and then Martha went back and said, Jesus is there waiting outside the village, and we read right there in the Scriptures, and he asked about you. He asked about you. So Mary goes right out to Jesus. Let's pick up the story in verse 32 of John 11. Some of you need to just read John 11 this week. Write that down. Verse 32, when Mary reached the place that Jesus was, and she saw him, she fell at his feet. She said, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. and when Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping he was deeply moved in spirit and he was troubled where have you laid him he asked come and see Lord they replied and so Jesus wept Jesus wept there's some things I notice about this story about what it means to bring good news. First thing is this. Jesus saw Mary weeping. He saw her weeping. The Greek word for see, to see here is aido. It means to perceive with the eyes. So that's pretty obvious. That's what he did. But it's layered. It gets a little deeper. It means to discern or to notice, to discover, to pay attention, to observe. It means to know or to get knowledge of, to understand and perceive with more than your mind. To perceive with your heart what's happening. When I was in that little hospital room, my eyes saw two parents. My mind understood what they must be going through. but when I saw their parents walk in to the room, my heart understood what was happening. When you're out among people who are in pain and who are frankly dying even though they don't look like it, what do you see? What do you see in your workplace? What do you see in your home with your kids? What do you see in your parents? What do you see in that person with whom you're in conflict with? What do you see? And what would it look like to ask God to see a little more? God, I can only see what I can see, and it's colored by my filters. It's colored by my experience. It's colored by the fact that I'm maybe angry about something. But what do you see? God, help me to see more. When you start asking those questions, you start bringing good news. That's more than just things you think about in your mind and say with your mouth so that other people can hear with their ears. Then you start making what's inside of you starts connecting with what's inside of them. Amen? You've done this. You've done it a hundred times. Second thing I notice about this story is that Jesus goes where they were. Where have you laid him, he asked. Come and see, Lord, they replied. And so Jesus went. And so good newsing, euangelion, is about meeting people where they're at, not trying to bring them to your table. Do you know what I mean by that? I mean, it's so easy for us as Christians to expect people who maybe don't believe in Jesus to come to our table, to come to our church, to come to our deal, to make sure, hey, and I think it's great, we should invite, in fact, more people to come to our deal. We should. But what does it mean for us to go, you know, you may not want to come here for a number of reasons. You may feel too much shame to step foot in a church, but I'm going to go to your deal. I'm going to go to your place. I'm going to get out of my comfort zone and take a few steps toward you. For God so loved the world that what? God gave and God went. Tomorrow starts the season of Advent where we celebrate and wait for and long for the arrival of light in darkness. So we spent four weeks. Did you know that Advent is four weeks long. It's actually five weeks. And it's a week, these are weeks to remember that into darkness came light. And it wasn't because of something we did. It's because of how good God is. God goes. I was with a couple of guys this week, guys in their 60s, that spent a lot of their time going to where people are. Far from Jesus. and we were talking about the need for us all around other cultures especially to get to know the culture. It seems obvious, right? Get to know the culture before you say something with your mouth that you've thought about in your mind because they'll never hear with their ears. But then I thought, you know what? Every single human being is a culture. What does it mean to get to know the culture when you're around someone else over the water cooler in an office building? What does it mean to go where they are? If you're going to be good-newsing, you have to go where they are, and that's going to require some sacrifices on your part. It just will. Last thing I noticed that around Jesus in this story, when he went about good-newsing, is that he set Lazarus free. He raised Lazarus from the dead. So this is the situation. I don't know what happened. Hey, take me up to the tomb. All right, that's normal. People would want to visit a grave site. And then Jesus goes, yeah, roll away the tomb. Roll away the stone. And I imagine the people walking around going, dude, he's dead. I know, I know. It's a whole different kingdom. Jesus is saying, roll away the stone. And then when he said this, John 11, 43 and 44, when he said this, roll away the stone, Jesus called out in a loud voice, Hey, Lazarus, come out! And the dead man, we read, came out! Now, of course, you know, we read this, and of course he came out. I mean, that's when it's in my Bible. I mean, you know, John 12 happened, and John 13 happened, and then the rest of the story happened. But in this story, they didn't have any idea what was about to happen. So when the dead man came out, his hands and feet were wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth was around his face. Why did they share that? I mean, obviously he was going to be dressed in burial clothes. It's so inconsequential. Why did they share that in the story? And then Jesus said to them, these are details that don't matter, right? He raised them from the dead. That's all that matters. Woo! Then we read 20 words about grave clothes and linen. Jesus said to them, take off the grave clothes and let him go. And when I read those, I couldn't stop thinking about what it looks like or what it feels like to be covered in grave clothes. You know what this feels like, to be covered in shame, to be covered in regret, to be covered in the failures of the past, to be covered in death. And what does it look like to be around a community of people that have something inside of them that's so explosive and so vibrant that at the command of Jesus, they might take it off of you? What if we as a community of people believed that we had the power of Jesus in us enough to say, hey, let's take those grave clothes off of you? And then, you know, Lazarus, he didn't have a pair of 501s on underneath those grave clothes. You realize that, right? That's a little indelicate. You shouldn't talk about that in church. But there, Lazarus is naked and unashamed, and now we're back in the garden. The way we were supposed to be. I wonder what interacting with Lazarus was like after that story. I bet he had a lot more than theological ideas that he thought about in his mind to share with his mouth so that other people could hear with their ears. I bet he had something to share from his heart. What would it look like to wake up in the morning and say, oh God, I've got some grave clothes on and I need to take them off. To stop at lunch when you've had a hard day and instead of just motoring your way through it, to stop and say, Lord, have mercy on me. I put the grave clothes back on and I need help taking them off. What would it be like even to say to a friend, I've prayed about it. I can't hear God. I'm like Mary who's waiting for Jesus, but Jesus didn't come, so I'm a little ticked off about it. I have grave clothes on and I need someone to take them off for me. Would you please tell me who I am again? What would it be like to make that kind of phone call at 1207 on a Wednesday? Naked and unashamed. What if we, as people of God, could say, here we are, desperate and dependent on the power of Jesus, cracks all over the place. But the light of God is radiating out from us. What would it be like to say yes to God, to be scattered, you know? What would it be like to say, okay, God, have your way. As Dave said, that is a dangerous song. Have your way. What about if that was really true? God, have your way. and give me what I need. I believe this community of people, that's our heart's desire. We don't know how to do it, right? Have your way. No, I want it back. Okay, have your way. No, I want it back. Okay, have your way. That's the story. That's the journey, is it not? So let's take off the grave clothes and let's run in the commands of God because he has set our heart free. Amen. Let's pray. So God, here we are. A group of broken people that have cracks that maybe we've spackled over, but the spackle is now breaking and showing. So God, give us the courage to let it show so that your light that's in us might shine. Give us the courage to say yes to you so that you would send us out into those places that need you. They don't need theological arguments about you. They need you. Turn us into gracious, life-giving people that know how to tap into the life that is in us so that other people might get warmed. That begin to understand the mystery of the gospel is Jesus in us. so that this world that is dying could come to life. So that we would join in your work of restoring the broken places in our lives and all around the world. God, transform us into people that really care about others, that really, really are submitted to you, and that get our needs from you. In your name, amen. Would you stand for the benediction? I remind you about this from time to time, but the benediction, a benediction, is not a thing that you do. It's not a thing that you pledge to do. It's a thing that you receive from God. This is what God longs to do for you. So in whatever posture you need to get in, receive this benediction, receive this blessing for you as you are scattered out into the world to be the light of the world. And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things, at all times, you can abound in every good work. Amen? Amen.
