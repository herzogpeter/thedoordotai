Matthew chapter 8, verse 28, in our continuing study in the book of Matthew. Interesting passage of Scripture, one that you have heard probably, especially if you've been in church for any length of time, the healing of the demoniac. We are dealing, as you know, in Matthew right now, in chapters 8 and chapter 9, in a section that we're calling the healing ministry of Christ, or the miracles of Jesus. And we have seen miracles unfold. We have seen Him heal the leper and the paralytic, and then the woman with the fever. And we have seen Him move miraculously in calming a storm, and then see Him raise people from the dead. And we're going to see the miracle of forgiveness of sin. But one of the things that I want to put in your mind is Jesus is a picture of Jesus doing more than just walking through these situations and walking through history, kind of doing tricks to impress people. There are many images that I think people get of Jesus, and we as believers, one of the images you might get is of Jesus, the little baby, the soft and cuddly little thing, who was the Messiah, and isn't it nice? and Christmas is coming and we get real warm and gooey feelings about him. And we think of Jesus, meek and mild and gentle, and that's wonderful. And we think of Jesus, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. And I think of one who is laying himself down and in tremendous love, submissively to the Father's will, paying a penalty for sin. The Lamb of God, holy and clean. And I can conjure up images of Jesus, who is the Lamb, and Jesus, who is gentle. But in this passage of Scripture, I think one of the things you need to hold in your mind and picture relative to Jesus is that of the warrior king, who is doing warfare literally against the enemy of men's souls, as he is coming and literally before our eyes reversing and destroying the works of Satan. In 1 John 3, verse 8, it says these words, The Son of God has made himself manifest to us. He has come for this purpose, that he might destroy the works of the devil. And when we in our mind's eye these weeks see Jesus reaching out his hand and touching a leper and seeing him get clean, that is a destruction of the works of the devil. And when he reaches out his hand or with a word says, that person is healed and the paralytic gets healed, that is destroying the works of the devil. And when a storm is raging, it is threatening the lives of people. And he with a word says, be still. That is destroying the works of the enemy. And when someone, a little girl in the next passage, is risen from the dead, that is destroying the works of Satan. And when he comes into people's lives and says, your sins are forgiven, that is destroying the works of the devil. And now today, when he comes face to face with the best that Satan can do, with a tormenting, controlling spirit in a human being's body, and says, be gone, and it is, he is destroying the works of the enemy. We have got a picture moving through this of our king who is a warrior, destroying the works of the enemy. And I want that in your mind as we go through this. And as we talk about a subject that I don't particularly enjoy talking about this morning, demonization, demonology, if you will, you need to have fixed in your mind the whole time as we talk about these things that Jesus is the king over them. And I want you to know that even before I read the text. And let that into your spirit before you let anything about what demons can do into your spirit. Jesus is the king and at the feet of Jesus, every knee bows, including theirs. With that in mind, now we can read the text. And when he had come, verse 28, to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes. By the way, this is just picking up with the story. You know, he left the shore. He's on the Sea of Galilee. They had the big storm, and now they're on the other side, about six miles away. Two men who were demon-possessed met him as they were coming out of the tombs. And they were so exceedingly violent that no one could pass by that road. And behold, they cried out, saying, What do we have to do with you, son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time? Now there was at a distance from them a herd of many swine feeding. And the demons began to entreat him, saying, If you are going to cast us out, send us into the herd of swine. And he said to them, Be gone. And they came out and went into the swine, and behold, a whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters. And the herdsmen ran away and went to the city and reported everything, including the incident of the demoniacs. I would think that would be all they talked about. And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they entreated him to depart. from their country. Let's pray as we begin. Father, in the name of Jesus, in the strong name of Jesus, I ask that you would speak. I have been impressed all week and am even now as I stand here that Satan, the enemy, does not like it when we talk about him because the truth about him reveals him, it unmasks him and it reveals that he is impotent in the face of your power and your name. And I pray in Jesus' name, in his strong name, that God there would be freedom to speak and to hear so that indeed the works of Satan would be destroyed in this place. And God, the works of Satan would be destroyed in individual people's lives here today. That they leave different today. Because the works of Satan are destroyed by the power of your name and the reality of your kingdom here. I pray you do that in Jesus' name. Amen. We are entering into an arena that is for many people confusing and confused. It's an area that as an evangelical that I am having grown up in the church, I have to admit I haven't heard a lot of sermons on demonization. I haven't heard a lot of sermons on that kind of thing not a lot of teaching I didn't hear a lot of stuff on possession and what that meant and deliverance and how that could happen and those kinds of things for some people I'm afraid that this subject is frightening we bring it up and we kind of want to avoid it and stay away from it and don't bring it up so we stay away and we avoid and I even remember about two years ago before the spirit of God began to move on me and some of our staff people in becoming aware of the authority we had in Christ in this arena, I remember Jeff Van Vonderen and I coming in contact with somebody who would come in for help for ministry, and it became very apparent that they had a demonic issue. It wasn't just a spiritual struggle. It was a demonic issue. And see, we knew enough to believe in demons, but I remember saying from my mouth, we're going to have to find somebody who knows how to do this because we don't do demons. I mean, we do a lot of things, but we don't do demons. somebody with a little sign in their door, we do demons, you know. It was frightening. It was frightening. We didn't understand, didn't know. There's another problem when it comes to this issue, however, and that is this. For some people, it's frightening. For other people, it's fascinating. And I think it's just as dangerous to be fascinated by it. And what I mean by that is it's kind of titillating. If you've had any experience with this and you've seen the power of God come upon somebody who is clearly in the bondage and in the grip of Satan and to see that person delivered, it is an amazing thing to be a part of. And some people get real fascinated by it, and it's great. And all of a sudden, you start seeing demons behind every bush, and every problem you've got, oh, it's the spirit of this, it's the spirit of that. You got the spirit of fat, you know, you're too fat, you got the spirit of overweightness, oh, whatever. And it's a little game that they start to play, and it's very scary to me when I see people like that. And so it is that we approach this issue and this text the way we want to approach every area of kingdom living, and that is this, that we need to fight for the balance and find out what is healthy and what is right. And the way we find that is by getting into the Word of God. The truth of God reveals what is true. I'm going to break this text into three parts. First of all, I want to talk about the fact of the matter. The fact of the matter, verse 28. And the fact of the matter is this, that demons are real and that they do indeed influence and affect people's lives. The second thing I want to talk about, however, is the presence of Jesus, the strong name of Jesus. And then the third thing we're going to deal with in verse 34 is going to be the reaction of people, the reaction of people. First of all, the fact of the matter, the fact of the matter. And when he had come to the other side of the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were demon-possessed met him. Stop right there. They were demon-possessed. What does it mean to be demon-possessed? Well, I'm sure you have all sorts of images in your mind of somebody flopping on the floor like a fish with stuff flowing out of his mouth. His eyes turn green, his head spins around, rooms shake. I don't have any doubt in my mind that demon-possessed people at an extreme level can have manifestations. I have seen manifestations that are like that. They're scary. They're visible. But it isn't always like that. Sometimes it's far more subtle, the way Satan affects people's lives. But first of all, I need to do some teaching. The whole word demon-possessed is not a scriptural term. You maybe didn't know that. We have all sorts of little phrases that we use to try to describe the kinds of things that demons and Satan can do in people's lives, but the word possession is not one that's found in the text. Now, it's in the English text, but it's not in the Greek. The Greek word is diamanizomoi. Diamanizomoi. And all that means is this, to be demonized. To be demonized. It is a general term. It is a broad term. Now, again, we have language to describe what it means to be demonized, but I would prefer that in this church, just for sake of clarity, we don't talk about possession as much as we say demonized. That is the correct word. Now, there are words to describe levels of demonization. We say things like this. He is under demonic influence. Well, if you're under demonic influence, you've been demonized. You're under demonic assault. You've been demonized. You're under demonic attack, demonic oppression, demonic obsession, and then the ultimate in our minds is demonic possession. Now, I need to define what possession means, too. What possession would mean, or at least what we mean by that, is this. That would entail someone who is indwelt by a spirit, A demonic spirit. It is more, however, than even being indwelt. For me to say someone is possessed, I am saying he is indwelt by the spirit, not only by an evil spirit, he is also controlled by that spirit. Meaning this, at certain times, his very personality is circumvented by that presence. But the third thing is this, and this is the key in a possession. That is this, that they are possessed. They are owned by the enemy. The enemy owns them. Question rises out of that. David, is it possible for someone to be possessed by a demon? And what I mean by that is owned. Owned by the enemy. The answer to that is yes, absolutely. In fact, we have an example right here in verse 28 of two Gadarenes who were possessed. They were Satan's property, if you will. Next question. Is it possible for a believer to be possessed? Absolutely no. Why? Because you are owned by somebody else. You have been bought with a price. the blood of Jesus, you are owned by Christ. No one else has right to you, but it is possible to be demonized and be a believer. Not possessed. Get that out of your mind. But the other thing is this. One lie, I suppose, Satan could tell would be this, and create all sorts of fear that believers could be possessed. The other lie, I think, that Satan can perpetrate on the church is that believers can't be demonized in any way. They can't be assaulted. They can't be influenced, affected, oppressed, or obsessed. Yes, they can. I think we need to know that, not to generate fear, but to make you realize that if there are issues in your life in which Satan has set up a stronghold in your life, the reason I want you to know that is because the strong name of Jesus can come against that and set you free from something you've been in bondage to all your life. But Satan doesn't do that to Christians. Yes, he does. He doesn't possess them, never can. In Acts chapter 5, Ananias and Sapphira, it was said of them this, Satan filled their heart to lie. They were Christians. Now, they asked for it, and what I mean by that, that they opened and gave Satan an opportunity to move into their lives and affect their lives. But the fact is, he filled their heart to lie. In the Old Testament, King Saul, it was said of him he had a tormenting spirit. And again, it was because of his own disobedience, and he opened the door and he gave Satan access to his life. Paul even talked about this. He said this, I have a thorn in my flesh, and he described that thorn as a messenger from Satan to buffet me. He was being assaulted by the enemy. I believe a real serious misconception is that believers can't be demonized in any way. They can't. They can find themselves under the influence. They can find themselves sometimes terrorized by. They can find themselves sometimes in bondage to the work of the evil one in their lives. That manifests itself by, well, how would I know? Well, sometimes if you've got a life issue that never, ever, ever is victorious, you never find victory over it. There's just this life issue that's always there. I think if I was counseling you, one of the things we would clearly move into and talk about is whether or not Satan has set up a stronghold in your life in that thing. And then bring the name of Jesus against that to break it. And you can go to counseling forever and never find victory over that, if that's what it is. Sometimes it's a sin that you never, ever, ever get victory over. And you've been down here 20 million times, but you never, ever thought of the possibility that there was a satanic stronghold in your life that needed to become against with the power of God and nothing else would break it up. Family traits. There are things that are passed down in families, almost like genetic characteristics that go on for generations and generations and generations. And you're totally blind to it until someone begins to pray for you and it begins to evidence itself. And some of you sitting in this room have had that kind of ministry happen to you. And you get set free. In fact, one of the interesting things for me, I'll tell you what, you're talking to the most conservative theological person you'll ever meet. I mean, my background, the Baptist dispensational thing, we believed in demons. If you didn't believe in demons, you were a heretic, but we never, ever ministered that, ever, except for the last two years we have. And the irony for me is that in the last two years, with all of the ministry of seeing people set free from demonic influence in their life, I've never done it with an unbeliever. It's always been with a believer. Two things. I want you to know who they are, who demons are, and what they can do. First of all, who they are. The way I want to start with this is, first of all, talk about Satan himself. Who is he? Wouldn't it be wonderful if he really was like they show on the can with a little pitchfork and he's a little red guy and little horns and that'd be great. You know, the first time I ever ran into this, it was really amazing to me because I think Satan would like us to think he's ugly and he's vile. Truth is, in Isaiah 14, 12 and 13, we find out he was called the angel of light. He was called the morning star. He was one of the most beautiful creatures ever created. Ever created. Most beautiful. And by the way, that's even a subtle thing. Isn't it great? If Satan could get us to think he's ugly, every time he'd come and go, we'd all go, I don't want to be by that. But he comes in beauty. What he offers looks good. See? Think about the way temptations come. They're always looking good on this end. They come beautiful. They look good. his ambition is to be God his problem is pride his job is to steal and kill and destroy his method of stealing and killing and destroying is to lie it is to disguise the truth it is to make evil look good and by the way that's the thing in temptation I've got this picture in my mind think about first of all a sexual seduction on this end of the sexual seduction, okay? On this end, it looks good. Can you see one bad thing? When you are being enticed by the enemy and he's hooking your flesh, you can't see one bad thing about this sexual involvement. Apply it to drugs. Apply it to lying. Apply it to cheating. Apply it to stealing. Anything you want. On this end, it looks great. I am going to get better. I'll feel good. That's the way temptation comes. It disguises. On this end, it is death and pain. he disguises he lies he accuses all the time he accuses it's his job, that's his method of bringing people down you ever feel like people are talking about you behind your back doesn't it drive you crazy well you know the truth is you are being talked about behind your back all the time Satan is accusing you to God the Father all the time, the good news is this Jesus, the son is standing there going he's a liar, he's a liar he's a liar, covered with the blood, covered with the blood, he's okay, don't pay attention to him, he's a liar. I don't think he even can spend too much time in God's presence accusing him because he never pays attention to him, but that's what he does. He also accuses you to you about who you are, about what you've done, about your past, on and on and on. He's an accuser, he's a liar, he's a deceiver. And he infiltrates the heart and the mind and the body if he can. Demons are his angels. Demons are his angels. And they fell with him in the rebellion. They are living entities, according to 2 Peter 2.4. They have levels of power and rank. I don't know if you've ever thought of it that way, but they do. They are just like an army. We have spoken so much about being in a war, what we really are. And the enemy is well-armed itself. In Ephesians chapter 6, We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against what? Against principalities and against powers and against rulers of the forces of this world. Rulers, principalities, powers. Do you know that that is a reference to ranks? Principalities, powers, rulers, ranks. Let me explain them just a little bit. Principalities are archetypes. They are archetypes. And basically what it means is they have a sphere of influence. in the Old Testament there was reference of principalities being a principality over a city there would be a ruling ability over a particular kind of city sounds kind of weird doesn't it sounds like the Twilight Zone or something that Stephen King would write well I think people like Stephen King know demons I think that's why they're so scary that's so realistic principalities over things I want to throw something out at you and have you just consider it I think those principalities are at work today in cities. Have you ever noticed how cities have different personalities? Just kind of a different thing. I'm from Chicago, and I've always noticed Chicago has this weird personality. I don't know how I would. It's like me. It's just weird. And when I came to Minnesota, thank you, when I came to Minnesota, I noticed that it was different here. I liked it here, but it was different here. Let me give you an extreme case. If you would go to New York City, I think some of us would have a real hard time with that place for a while. It is run by greed and money. Everything is for sale. If you were to go to New York City and come back, I wouldn't be surprised to hear people say things like this. Dave, you go to New York City and you can just feel the oppression in that city. You can feel it. I mean, I believe in demonic activity because I could feel it when I went there. And I was so glad to get back to Minneapolis. Minneapolis. Why did it feel so good here? Well, it's because there are no principalities here, right? No, it's because we're used to them here. We like them here. What are you talking about? Let me tell you what I'm talking about. I did notice something when I came here, and I think it's even affected my ministry. When I was in Chicago, the lines were always drawn real clear, and anybody from Chicago, from that area, would know that. You were either a pagan or you were a believer. There was no gray area anywhere. When I came here, the first thing I noticed was what? Everybody was religious. If I were to guess, if you were to pin me down and say you believe there are principalities, what would be the one here? I would say this, it's the spirit of religion in this community. Everybody's moral. But nobody's godly. That's a real thing. Those are real things. Now, I may not be right in my assessment of what is what, but the fact that there are principalities is a true thing. It is a real thing. There are rulers over areas of behavior. Rulers over areas of behavior. You've never thought of it this way. But I really believe with all my life, with all my might, that there are minions of Satan over areas of behavior like homosexuality. I believe that for sure. Over areas like pornography, I believe there are principalities that function in that realm. And that when you get involved with that stuff, you get involved with more than perverted behavior. You get involved with the demonic activity that is orchestrating that behavior. I was at a conference on spiritual warfare not long ago, and it was amazing. They talked about the fact that among homosexuals, it is incredible how they can find each other. They can just find each other. It's incredible. How do they do that? I'll tell you how they do that. There are demonic influences involved in bringing people together. You want to know something? This is going to sound scary. But if there are people like that in this church here, you've already found each other. Drug addiction, the same kind of thing. Okay, that's what they are. They're living entities. There are ranks of them. What do they do? What kinds of things can they do? First of all, I'll give you three things they can do. First of all, they physically afflict. According to Matthew 9, it was demonic oppression or demonic infiltration, whatever, that resulted in dumbness. He couldn't talk. In chapter 12 of Matthew, blindness was the result of a demonic work. In Luke chapter 13, there was a deformity that was the result of a demonic work. And in Matthew 17, it was the cause of epilepsy in someone. Some sickness, by the way, that gives us some ministry keys. Some sickness that people have requires the binding of Satan. Because sometimes sickness is caused by a direct work of Satan in someone's life. Not only do they physically afflict, but they mentally deceive. They mentally deceive. I said this earlier, but one of the primary functions of demonic activity is to lie. They lie to you about God, about who he is, about whether he loves you and cares about you, and whether he's forgiven you or not. He lies to you about you, who you are, or whether you're forgiven, whether you have any value. It could be that it's happening right now. I mean, you've got little things in your mind that are just going on like crazy. He lies to you about what sin is. It really isn't that bad. He lies to you about holiness. It really isn't that good. He lies to you about who he is. I'm not real. This is all a bunch of baloney, this stuff Dave's saying. This isn't real. Everything he does, he does in the dark. I don't think Satan likes us to talk about him. That's one of the tensions I feel in this sermon. Because the problem is, he fundamentally has very little power once he is unmasked. When we do not know his devices, we allow him to run rampant in our church. We allow him to run rampant in our families and in our lives. But when we understand what he does, when we understand the power in the name of Jesus that can be applied to what he does, we are set free from that. He hates that, so he lies. It isn't real. It isn't real. Be afraid. Be fascinated. we have an enemy of our souls who is at war for our minds he is at war to get our minds to control the mind, the thinking he is called the prince in the power of the air and that has to do with the world's way of thinking what is truth what is eternal what has value what is right, what is wrong in James chapter 3 it talks about the wisdom of the world in Ephesians chapter 2 it says before you knew Christ you were walking according to the course of this world the mentality you had the grid through which you discerned truth was the world's mentality and the enemy of your souls is the one who controls the world's mentality it's hard to even say this It's hard to put it into words. But the very fact that over time, as people's consciences get seared more and more and more, sin that looked yucky some time ago is starting to look more and more and more palatable. Do you see what's happening? The mind is getting affected by the evil one. That's what's happening. And what is wrong starts looking right. All of a sudden, verses like Romans 12, 2, it says, Be transformed by the renewing of your mind. The renewing of your mind, all of a sudden, that sounds like a spiritual warfare verse. Do you understand? I'll say it's a war to have my mind renewed, to have truth invaded, to counteract the lies I hear every single day. Let me give you this. Jesus came into this world and he did all this teaching. And one of the things he kept saying was this. Truly, truly, I say to you. Truly, truly. What did he say truly, truly for? I think he said it because of this. I'm going to say it twice, and I want you to know that this is a true thing, but it is going to counteract the world system. Truly, truly, I say to you, blessed are the broken. Anybody believe that? Blessed are those who mourn. Do you really believe that? Blessed are the hungry. I believe it's blessed are the full. I am going to counteract the lies you have heard all your life about what is spiritual, about what is right, about what is wrong. Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who loses his life will find it. That's the truth that counteracts everything you've ever heard before. Tell you what, this passage of Scripture, this concept of him vying for my mind and yours, began to get me to think about ways in which I give Satan access to my mind that I don't even think about. I don't even pay attention to the way I just kind of open the door and go, Okay, Satan, pour in the garbage. We love to go to movies. I love to go. I enjoy that. And one of the things for me, and maybe it is for you, it's like relaxing, and we're real careful what we choose. You know, it's a good thing. But as I was thinking about this, I was beginning to think of how I do that. I go and turn my brain off. I do. I like it like that. I am constantly under pressure of some sort, and so are you. So I like to go somewhere I can turn it off. And all of a sudden, something scary hit me. I turn my brain off, and I go, okay, give me all sorts of messages. Just pour it in. And I began to sit down and think about the messages that we hear from the media all the time. And we turn our brain off. Think about the messages you hear. Jeff Van Vanden was telling me just a few weeks ago about a film. He was exhausted. He was tired. He says, let's go to a movie. So they went to see Dragnet. Sounds pretty innocent to me, Dan Aykroyd. He's just an idiot. He's going to act like an idiot. We're all going to laugh. Joe Friday, it's going to be good stuff. You know, it's like a cartoon. Ten minutes into the thing, he starts telling me there's all sorts of occult things. People are wearing goat suits. They're sacrificing somebody to Satan. And he's spending the whole movie rebuking Satan the whole time. In the name of Jesus, I'm rebuking. And he got up and left. All of a sudden, this thing that was designed for recreation becomes more work than he ever imagined. Think about that in terms of what you let into your mind. This is all for recreation. I'll tell you what, I like to have fun. I sound like an old buddy to you. Don't go to movies. But one of the things you better understand is that when you give Satan access to your mind, that thing that's designed to be so fun is going to create so much work for you, you can't even believe it. For a month, you'll be dealing with the lust and the lies that you heard. Think about it. The music we listen to, it's the same kind of thing. There are elements of rock and roll that are young people listening to, and blatantly, drugs, sex, and the occult, just flat out. And they even make their agenda clear. And that's exactly where Satan wants to work, is the mind. You know, there are secular people who understand the dynamic of the mind and how you feed your mind with things and there's going to be distorted thinking just on a physical level. And if on a physical level, just a psychological level, these are true things that if you keep filling your mind with things, you have an incredible capacity to remember. If not the very word you heard, the concept is planted there add to that physical explanation the fact that in the demonic realm there are principalities and powers that are governing that whole thing and bringing more power to that than just the physical mind concept. Beware. Just beware. You see, when we think of demonic control, it seems like the most extreme weird thing you can think of, doesn't it? I mean, it's like to have demonic control of someone's life or to have some sort of demonical oppression would require me making a pact with Satan. You know, you think of the rock and roll singer. There's a contract there and he signs it, you know. I heard Ozzy Osbourne not long ago, blatantly satanic. Symbols that are satanic, anti-Christ kinds of symbols. He's not the only one. But just blatant, out loud, I love the devil kind of stuff. No, I don't, by the way. Okay. Oh, I don't love Satan. I don't worship Satan. I don't make a pact with Satan. What do you think? You sign on a contract or what? All you got to do is give him your mind. Just give him your mind. Open up your mind. Let him pour it in. You've been affected right now. Just leave your mind unguarded. Beware, beware, beware, beware all through scripture by the way what's the weapon we're going to get to the strong name of Jesus before I even give you that I'll tell you what the weapon to lies are the truth the weapon that defeats the lies of the enemy is the truth to hear the truth specifically this book last week we came together and I confronted some issues in our church relative to even the preaching and why people come and maybe that there's some wrong reasons. And if all of a sudden the excitement about hearing the word of God becomes so exclusive that we can't hear from anybody else, we confronted that. But let me tell you something else. Sometimes the reason people come is because there's a party going on. And there's a bandwagon effect and I don't care much for that. But I'll tell you another reason why people come when the truth is being delivered. Do you know why? Because in ways that they don't even understand, when people come under the hearing of the truth, the work of the enemy is bound. I believe with all my heart that in ways we don't understand, people get delivered every Sunday in churches all across America and all across the world wherever the truth is spoken. Because when the truth comes, it counteracts the lie and the lie is bondage and when the bondage is released, truth comes and they're set free. Just like you don't have to make a pact with Satan to get in bondage, you don't have to flop on the floor to get delivered. sometimes people do though you will know the truth and the truth will set you free some of you have been set free by God's grace in this church some of you have when we were worshipping and I was thinking of songs that were just directed to Jesus I was thinking of people who've come here really wounded and beat up and they've told me and you have told some of you have told me that for four months at Open Door, you just spent the first four months at Open Door weeping through the worship and weeping through the sermons. And maybe you kind of got it in your mind that what was really going on was I was just wounded and I'm being healed and that's part of it. I have a feeling that in ways you don't understand, you are getting delivered. The truth comes in, it counteracts the lie, the lie is bound and you're set free. I'll tell you another thing, that's why we need to be in the Word. That's why we need to be in the Word of God. Because the truth sets you free. And you hear lies every single day. And this is the truth. And it counteracts what you hear and what you see and what you experience. They also emotionally disturb people. They emotionally disturb. Luke 6.18 speaks of demons who come and troubled. They troubled them. In 1 Samuel 16, it talks about how they torment. 1 Timothy 1.7, Paul says, God didn't give you a spirit of timidity, Timothy. God didn't give you that. You know, you're walking around, Timothy, and you've got this incredible responsibility with all these people in Ephesus, and that timidity you've got, you're kind of reading that as humility. I'm so humble, I just don't know if I can. Timothy, God did not give that. That is not from God. God gives power and love and a sound mind. That's from God. You know what he did? He just brought the truth into a lie and it set Timothy free. emotionally disturbed he brings oppression you know about that that would be in the arena of paralyzing fear underlying anxiety that doesn't have any explanation depression all depression is not caused by demons okay in fact all of these things these things i'm giving every time you feel fear it isn't a demon okay but one of the things they do is fear. Another is anxiety, depression, masochism, murder, suicide. Doctrinally, they distort. Doctrinally, they distort. I'm giving you more than three. The Word of God talks about doctrines of demons that draw us into idolatry and error. Just real quickly, we are talking about the grace message that turns to mush, and obedience calls to obedience to turn to legalism, the fight to get to balance, to understand it's grace and obedience going together. And if grace turns to mush, it's wrong. And if obedience turns to legalism, it's evil. That fighting is a warfare against the enemy to bring the balance, to keep the balance. Do you ever think about the fact that Bible study is spiritual warfare? You know, we sit in the office with people on staff and we'll be dealing with concepts here on Sunday morning and it's a fight sometimes. You take notes and you're trying to understand and you're going to go a little too far over here and it doesn't really mean that. means this over here, and getting to where the truth is, that fight is spiritual warfare, because one of the works of the enemy is to take doctrine and distort it, so you live in impotence and not victory. You will externally tempt. I've already talked about that. Odds and ends. Just give you a few. Familial spirits that come from the family. Families that have been afflicted with the same kind of issues for years and years and years and years. Patterns that are never broken emotionally. Alcoholism sometimes is connected with that type of thing. I remember hearing a story of a family where for seven straight generations, the firstborn child for seven straight generations died before they were 21. And the way that pattern was broken, everybody just goes, oh, this is so weird and so unfortunate and I wonder if there's a pattern or something. And then what happened was, as the story goes, in the eighth generation, firstborn son got saved, got changed. And he began to share with the people in ministry around him this pattern that he was approaching 21 and he was a little bit nervous because everyone. And they brought the power of the kingdom against that and he went through that. But that's a real thing. And now you can look back and find all sorts of other explanations and that's a bunch of hooey. But that's how demons work. And now we come back to the Gadarene in our text and what we have with him is the quintessential demoniac, I believe. He had it all physical, mental, emotional, suicidal. He was murderous. He was a masochist in other texts. It talks about him cutting in synoptics. It talks about him cutting himself with rocks. And people were afraid to go there. But I think that's exciting. Because after I've given you all of these things that Satan does, and it might have even generated some fear, and that's unfortunate. It might have even generated fear. I think it's exciting that in this text, in verse 28, you've got the worst that it gets. All of the things are there. He is physically oppressed. He is emotionally disturbed. He is mentally messed up. Doctrinally, I suppose he's messed up. And against the worst that Satan can do, verse 29, the very presence of Jesus drives them to their knees. He does not say a word in verse 29. They said to him, crying out, What do we have to do with you? Why do you torment us? All of a sudden, we've got the presence of Christ coming into the demonic work. he doesn't say a word his very presence gets the reaction by the way one of the things I love about worship I was thinking about it again this morning I love worship the Bible says that he inhabits the praises of his people he comes to that and he blesses that there's a sense in which and I know we feel it sometimes where the spirit of God just fills this place with his presence I know you feel that sometimes and that's a real thing and when that happens you know what happens? the presence of Jesus drives the enemy out it's like fingernails on a chalkboard to him he's like I hate this you know I was kind of joking around with myself I do that when I'm by myself and there's nobody to joke around with I do it with myself I just I was thinking it'd be kind of just play praise songs in my house all the time Any kind of demonic activity that's in my house, these living entities that might come there to oppress me or you, just play praise songs. When I leave, I'm going to play them. You can't even hate it. They won't even go in. I'm a little weird, though. But the point is this, that in the midst of this incredible demonic activity, the presence of Christ turns the tormentors into the tormented. These scary, vile, destructive, powerful beings are all of a sudden whining. Why are you bothering us? Matthew, Mark, chapter 5, verse 6, says this, when Jesus came, didn't say a word, they fell down on their face, bowed down and worshipped him. And the word is proskuneo. And we know that word because we've dealt with that before. It means to fall on your face and worship. Remember the magi? They proskuneo. We've talked so many times about the sign of the truly redeemed is that they proskuneo, God. And here the demons are doing it. The passage of Scripture I think of is Philippians 2 where it says, At the feet of Jesus, every knee will bow. In heaven they will bow. On earth they will bow. And under the earth they will bow. But there's a difference between the way they will proskuneo and the way we will proskuneo. I proskuneo not because God has put himself over me but because I have put myself under him and said, You are my king and You are my God and I bow the knee before you because I love and adore you but you need to know something else that while some people will bow the knee because they place themselves under some people will bow the knee because he places himself over and says I am the king and in the presence of Christ demons buckle at the knees boom right down the strong name of Jesus causes demons to buckle at the knees and they fall down and they whine and they have no authority. That doesn't mean they don't have strength. But in the name of Jesus, you can't fight against the work of the devil in the flesh. You can't do it. But the strong name of Jesus causes their knees to buckle right now. They have no authority in this place. The way they get it is by lying. They're not real. The way they get it is by lying. You don't have authority. And if we don't believe in the strong name of Jesus, then they get to just run amok. You know any Christians, real Christians, where Satan is just running amok? You know any? One, because they don't know their authority. Two, because maybe they really have given Satan access and they don't want to change. I was thinking about Ozzy Osbourne. I don't know why. The epitome of satanic worship, those kind of people, you know what I'm going to go down to my knees before Jesus in that day every knee will bow but you know what so is he he's going down so are all the demons and even right now today at the name of Jesus they go down no authority it says here why have you come to torment us before the time before the time do you know the demons even have the right eschatology before the time what is the time it's their time of judgment at the end of the world they're going to be bound up and sent into eternal hell forever and they knew that time was coming. Is this the time? Is this before the time? Why are you bothering us now? Thought you were going to leave us alone for a while. Except they didn't know the kingdom would come, see. When I begin to think that demons understand the power and authority of the strong name of Jesus and when I understand that demons have a theology that is absolutely correct, their eschatology is right, what begins to dawn on me is this, that sometimes in ways that we may not like to look at, Satan and his demons have more awareness of the plan of God and the power of God than we do. The strong name of Jesus, in some ways, is more impressive to them than it is to us. And I think Satan would like to leave it that way. See, because if we begin to understand that in the name of Jesus, we have authority in this area, people who are now bound are going to get set free. And pastors won't be sitting around like I did two years ago saying, I don't do demons. Demons are damned for eternity. They loathe, despise, attack the word of Jesus and the work of Jesus, and they attack his children as well. They do it in destructive, powerful, subtle, and sometimes scary ways. But you need to know that in the presence of Christ, and at the strong name of Jesus, they buckle at the knees. so he sent them into pigs big debate about the pigs why did he do that those poor little pigs some things you just need to know real quickly about the pigs first of all they weren't poor little pigs to a Jew and in that country pigs were absolutely unclean if Jews were hurting them it was illegal because it was illegal to raise pigs they were unclean they were illegal so you need to get the picture that this was not this wasn't a litter of kittens okay meow go into there meow no no no pigs unclean okay that would I had a harder time explaining that one but just because of time I don't even have time to get into all of the whys and wherefores of this but I do think there are three things that it illustrates that he sent them into pigs number one it serves as living proof that when these guys who were absolutely out of their mind and by the way Luke 8 says they were naked on top of everything else and then it says that when they were delivered from the demonic influence they sat in their right mind saying coherent things and fully clothed that one of the things that Jesus wanted to demonstrate was this they didn't just have an attitude change okay? that was a demon, let me show you what happens leave there, go there, they died demons are real he wanted to illustrate that the second thing is this going into those pigs and seeing them going over the cliff and dying reveals the true intent of Satan again the temptation doesn't it look good? doesn't it feel good? feels good the true intent of Satan in your life what he offers you is not to make you feel good it's to bring you down destroy your life ultimately kill you forever hold you in his grip the other thing is this I think it illustrates sending the pigs over the cliff that it is a preview of the ultimate end of those demons those demons will one day be absolutely totally annihilated destroyed forever in a burning hell that's their end look at it see it? that's it that's where they're going last thing is the reaction of people verse 33 the herdsmen ran away by the way the herdsmen probably weren't the owners they were just watching them went into the city, reported everything, including the incident of the demoniacs. And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they entreated him to depart from their region. The question you have to ask there is why. This text doesn't tell us. So you go to the synoptics. You go to the other parallel passages. Interesting, because in both Luke 8 and Mark 5, it says they came and they saw the demoniac. They didn't even respond to the pigs. They heard about the pigs dying, so they were real mad and came out. What it says in Luke 8 and Mark 5, They saw the demoniac in his right mind, and the response was they were terribly afraid. Of what? The fact that this demoniac, who used to be flopping on the floor, is sitting there in his right mind. Why would that make him frightened? Think about it for a minute. Remember, do you remember when, in the very last passage of Scripture, the disciples were in the storm, and they were about to die, and then they got Jesus, and Jesus says, Be still! And the result of that in the parallel passages was this. They were what? Terrified. Why? They were in the very presence of God. And they knew it. And you want to know something? Sometimes when God manifests his power and his presence, people go, I am unclean. Woe is me, I am undone. Isaiah fell on his face in worship. God said, I'm going to clean your lips. Stand up and speak for me. But they like it. I mean, it's terrifying, but it's terrifying in a way that says, I want it. This is real. This is the right thing. But there are other people, when they see the manifestation of God in their midst, they go, give me religion back. Give me what's safe again. I've got to tell you, I had the ministry team all week praying for church this morning, knowing that what I was going to be speaking of was a real thing. And it wouldn't surprise me at all that there is demonic activity in people's lives being brought into this place. I think about that every Sunday. I pray against the forces of the enemy here every Sunday. And I thought about the fact, I said, in a way that isn't what I normally do, we're going to talk about demonization. And what if, having confronted those things the whole morning, some very weird things happen Sunday morning? And what if somebody got set free? But what if it was a little weird and it was a little scary? Do you think anybody would say, get out of town, don't do that anymore. Yeah, sure they would. I think they were reacting to the fact that the supernatural God that invades a natural experience that we've become satisfied with scares the willies out of us. You know what people say from time to time? You know, if we could just see the miracles they saw in those days, we'd believe. well that's true some would but you need to know an awful lot wouldn't and they didn't then and they don't now and so he left by the way according to one of the synoptics however just to let you know this in a gracious way Jesus said to the demoniac the demoniac by the way wanted to come with in Luke 8 it talks about how he wanted to come with and follow Jesus and Jesus said wait a minute I'm going to be leaving here so I want you to stay and I want you to tell everyone of the great things that the Lord has done for you how he set you free from the ultimate work of the enemy and now you're clean I want you to tell everybody so he became a witness in that town and maybe some believed I don't know there's two things I want to leave you with as I close the fact of the matter is this the demons are real that they attack, assault, oppress physically, mentally and emotionally they can be seen in your life when for a reason that you don't want, sin is just absolutely controlling. There is no victory at all. Family traits that are never, ever, ever broken. We could go on and on with that. They're real. The second thing is this, that you have to remember, and this needs to even be paramount in our minds, not the work of the demon, but at the strong name of Jesus and in the presence of Christ, they buckle at the knees and they have no authority. There is no reason to be afraid. there is also no reason to be fascinated like this is some little game we are in a war and Satan and his minions would love nothing more than to bring this work down but in the strong name of Jesus and when the presence of Christ is here they have no authority in this place but that needs to be constantly brought to bear on your life and on my life and on our church forever and ever and ever and ever I think it's important that as we close I don't like talking about what I talked about. One of the things that's scary to me is that for believers sometimes maybe it's because we talk so little about the enemy and his work that when we do we start getting preoccupied with it. And it's extremely important that when we talk about things like this that the real focus you leave with is not the work of the enemy but the strong name of Jesus. Get it? The glory of his power and the wonder of his grace and the fact that the enemy has no authority. Do not be unaware of his devices, but let's focus on Jesus. And I think it's real important that we end with just a time of worship, singing of Jesus, his wonderful name. His name is wonderful. His name is wonderful, Jesus my Lord. It could also be you've become aware through a prompting of the Spirit that there may be some things in your life that you need to get set free from. And you need to know that the strong name of Jesus is here to deliver you today from bondages and afflictions that are affecting your life, your thinking, your feeling, your emotions, your marriages. The Spirit is prompting you to come. to come.
