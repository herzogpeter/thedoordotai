As most of you know, our study of late has been driven by a question. Born of Moses' desire in Exodus chapter 33 to number one, know the ways of God, and number two, see the glory of God. The question has been this. What are the ways of God that reveal the glory of God to and through the people of God so that we can consistently experience the manifested presence of God? Well, we've identified several of those ways so far, ten in all. The one we've been dealing with of late has been this, that when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God, especially to people who don't know God, you have there touched on what may be the most effective way of God in revealing the glory of God. Jesus' prayer, John 17, just before his death, was this, that these who follow me would be perfected in love in order that they would know, that the world would know, that you really sent me. Therefore, says Paul, Philippians 4, 5, let your forebearing spirit be the presenting issue of your life. Let that be the first thing people see about you. Why? Because one of the primary ways of God that reveals the glory of God, especially to people who don't know God, is when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God. Now, originally it was my intent to move on this week to the next way of God, except for a nagging question. Indeed, it was a question that a number of you asked me last week, and several more reported being in spirited conversations around this question. And the question was this, but what is love? I mean, Dave, you've kind of spent two weeks calling us to this, and we're convinced that it really is one of the primary ways of God, that reveals the glory of God, and we are authentically motivated now to do it. The question still remains, what is it? Particularly, what does love look like? How does love react in different situations? For the fact is this, that love is not a one-size-fit-all proposition that can be uniformly expressed as a warm and gooey feeling for the whole wide world. There are different kinds of love expressed in different ways at different times, and sometimes warm and gooey love is not only impossible, Sometimes it's inappropriate. The wrong kind of love for this situation. Different kinds of love. Instinctively, I think we know that. For instance, I love my wife. I love my kids. I love my friends. But I love all of them differently. I also love vanilla ice cream, particularly Haagen-Dazs. I love coffee, particularly Starbucks. One of the great loves of my life is the Chicago Cubs. Here's the deal. I love the Cubs. I'm angry at them right now because they stunk up the month of July. But I love them. And as a truly devoted follower of the Chicago Cubs, I will make my yearly pilgrimage again this summer along with my family to that close to sacred place, Wrigley Field, particularly Centerfield. bleachers, Wrigley Field. Why? Because that's just what love looks like. I love lots of things that way. I love fast cars, nice meals, vacations in Tahiti. I've never been to Tahiti. But I love even thinking about it. I love getting stuff for free. I love that. I really love getting my way. I especially love people who do what I want and agree with what I think. I abound in love for people who do what I think. But what about people who don't? What does love look like then? That's where it gets sticky. Jesus in Matthew 5 pressed this issue past people who don't agree with you and do everything you want to this. He said, you've heard it said love your neighbor. That's the kind that we understand and pretty much get. But I say love your enemies. Enemies. An enemy is not just someone who disagrees with me while I still embrace him. An enemy opposes me, may seek to harm me. So what does love look like then? What does love feel like then? In loving an enemy, even if I were to authentically do it, would it feel warm and gooey? Am I failing at love if I don't feel syrupy sentimentality for an enemy? Or is there a different kind of love required here? You see, if you have a one-size-fits-all definition of love, you're really going to stumble here. You're going to really get confused. In fact, if you have a one-size-fits-all definition of love, I hope to confuse you in these next two weeks. I hope to disturb you just enough to spare you some needless pain, to call you to a deeper love, to a clearer understanding of what love really looks like in a variety of situations. So for the sake of clarity about what love really looks like this morning, I'd like to confuse you just a bit. I'd like to spin your head around just for a little while. Come with me on this think journey. You ever get a love letter? You ever write a love letter? Probably have. What do they look like? Well, I mean, they all look the same. I know what a love letter looks like. It's a one-size-fits-all proposition, usually light blue or pink paper, a little flower, and they always smell a little nice. What a love letter looks like? One-size-fits-all, full of intimate secrets, romantic mush, warm and wonderful, things you can't believe you're saying and pray your friends never see, and if they do, you have to move. If I found a love letter and read it, I would have no doubt what it was. It's a love letter. Why? One size fits all. It's a love letter. Think with me. What about a letter from an adult child written to an estranged parent? And what's in the letter? It's not warm and gooey, but painful issues never talked about, unresolved, that stand in the way of any authentic relationship at all. Hard to write and hard to read. What kind of letter is that? What about a letter from a friend to a friend? About directions that are dangerous, behaviors that are hurtful, warnings that are strong. And no, we just can't go out and play until these issues are resolved. What kind of letter is that? I'd like you to consider the possibility that those are love letters too. But it's a different kind of love. One size does not fit all. So the question remains, what does love look like? There is romantic love, I know about that, intoxicating and powerful. There is committed love that sticks around when the bloom is off the rows of romance. There is intimate love that knows and is fully known. There is courageous love that opposes evil, that stands against, that brings a judgment, and then is willing to bear the backlash of reproach for having done the right and loving thing. what does love look like? One of the most loving things I ever saw a parent do was intervene on the behavior of their teenage child and bring them into treatment. Your direction is dangerous. I love you desperately, but your behavior is unacceptable. And how would you like to say this? To the child of your love, you can't live here anymore. the last words those parents heard from their child as they dropped her off at treatment was this I know you hate me I hate you on the way home mom throws up three times you know whatever happened to Barney you know I used to sit and watch Barney I love you, you love me, we're happy Now I hate you, you hate me. What does love look like now? See, these parents loved their child so much that they were willing to let her hate them for a while so that one day maybe she could come to life. So that maybe one day she could live again. See, sometimes that's what love looks like. But if you have a one-size-fits-all, saccharine, sweet definition of love, you may be seen by some people as the sweetest person, so agreeable. But in some instances, you may in fact be the enemy of love. Because sometimes love says stop. Sometimes love says no. You can't do that anymore. Sometimes love brings judgment. Sometimes love imposes consequences. You see, one size fits all. Saccharine sweet definitions of love can be the enemy of love because it drains off the resolve that is necessary to sometimes do the most loving thing. Dan Allender, in a book that I highly recommend on this particular issue, called Bold Love, I've made reference to it in the past, tells the story of a man named John. John, whose father, a violent and cruel alcoholic, tore his son to shreds for three decades. When John was married, his father then turned his rage on his new daughter-in-law. Every family occasion involved an undermining of her cooking, housekeeping, and parenting. John chose to do with his father's rage what he always did, ignore it and call that love, berating even his wife for being so sensitive. Sadly, it took John years, but eventually he came to see that what he was calling long-suffering love was really cowardliness. he had tuned out his father's abusive words. He had not anguished and wrestled with what it meant to protect his wife and truly love his father. Key words at the end of that phrase. He had not anguished and wrestled with what love really looked like. And as if you respond to this message today and enter into this reality and complexity of love, there will be about it some anguish. Not a lot of easy answers. John's one-size-fits-all definition of love was an enemy of love. In the situation I just read you. So what is love? What does it look like? Keep thinking. Let's think about the Bible. What does love look like in the Bible? Jesus called a child to himself, picked him up, put him on his lap, and then declared, let the children come to me. I like that picture. That's what love looks like. And I would like to just say that's always, it always looks like that. There's another time there was a woman caught in adultery by the Pharisees. They were about to stone her. Jesus intervened. Let him who was without sin cast the first stone. No one did. None of them could judge her. He turned to her and said, neither do I condemn you. I like that picture too. That's what love looks like. It always looks like that. That's how you always deal with that kind of situation. Another time, Jesus, face to face with Peter, after his cowardly betrayal as a friend and denying that he ever knew him, Jesus said to Peter, feed my sheep. With those words, he was reconciling with him and forgiving him. And I like that picture. That looks like love, too. but the same Jesus who said and did all that said and did this as well to the disciples oh ye of little faith oh perverted and unbelieving generation how long shall I put up with you how long shall I put up with you Matthew 5 says that that doesn't sound warm and gooey well it isn't warm and gooey The question isn't, is it warm and gooey? The question is, but is it love? Well, that depends on how you define love. That depends on what love looks like to you. I believe that quite possibly, two of the most loving things Jesus ever did are recorded in Matthew 21 and Matthew 23. Matthew 21, Jesus picked up a whip, drove the religious charlatans who were making it hard to get to God in the temple, and he drove them right out of the temple. And though his action was aggressive and violent, the blind and the lame came to him, and he healed them all. Isn't it amazing that this aggressive, violent behavior to the blind and the lame looked like love? So what does love look like? Matthew 23. Back in the temple, the courtyard of the Gentiles, you know the story well. He confronted there and exposed the sin of the Pharisees, their religious pretense. They looked really good on the outside, but on the inside they had spiritual death. The confrontation he knew would result in a backlash from them. In fact, he knew that they would kill him for it, and they did. Three days after he confronted the Pharisees, he was hanging from a cross. It was also a confrontation, however, he knew. Was the Pharisees' only hope to see their sin because no one else was confronting them? It was their only hope of repenting and coming to life. So in those harsh words of Matthew 23, the question is, did he love them? I believe his love for them was the primary reason he confronted them. If he hadn't loved them, he would have ignored them. so what does love look like keep working with me here sometimes the reason we don't confront sin like Jesus did in the courtyard of the Gentiles is because we don't love enough we just can't risk losing them as a friend or experiencing their rejection sometimes the reason we don't confront sin is because we just don't have the emotional energy to love that way. And I promise you, it takes a lot of emotional energy to love that way. One of the places you might be able to kind of walk into that and understand it is in dealing with sometimes your kids. And I think the kids sometimes get the short end of this kind of love. They get our discipline often when we've sat there and not lovingly brought parameters to their life, but finally in our exhaustion we're sick of what they're doing, and then we just explode in doing all sorts of damage. It takes energy to enter in to say this behavior is not okay and here's the consequence. One of our favorite disciplines, and our kids are getting older, So, you know, less and less, but grounding. I mean, you know, you might as well put them in prison because their friends are their whole life, and so grounding them is this enormous thing, and truly it punishes us way more, you know, about that. It takes emotional energy to enter into the life of people you care about. And when we're tired, we look away. It's just not that bad. It's not that big. But our friend, child, parent, or spouse is headed for destruction. Sometimes the reason we don't confront sin is because we don't love enough. Now become a Pharisee. Just flip this thing around. Did Pharisees confront sin? Oh, they sure did. They lovely confront sin. Most notably, other people's sin. Most viciously, the sin of people they didn't like. Problem. It had nothing to do with love. Pharisees didn't confront people's sin because they cared about the person, because they could see the big picture and they could see the direction they were going. And so they walked into that person's life and tried to bring them back to health and wholeness. They confronted sin because in exposing someone else, they felt better about themselves. It was an evil, vile thing they did. They took great delight in laying people bare and exposing their frailties to everyone who could see. The reason people do this kind of thing is multifaceted. Among the reasons are these, pointing out someone else's sin always diverts attention away from mine. I don't ever need to consider the condition of my own heart if I'm preoccupied with yours. What does love look like? Put it together, what I just gave you. Sometimes the reason we don't confront sin is because we don't love enough. But sometimes the reason we so boldly confront sin is because we don't love enough. So which, Dave, which is it? Which is true. Both are true. Now I'm confused. So what does love look like now? Is it this or is it that? That's what I want. I want love to be this. I want it to look this way. one size does not fit all. Now, I'm aware that I'm doing something this morning that is a bit strange because more than providing answers for you, what I'm doing is raising questions. Indeed, if I have a point at all this morning, it's this. To invite you to participate in the mystery of what love really looks like and how it looks in different situations. My point is to invite you to do what John, in the story I told you from Dan Ellender's book, refused to do for so long, and that is this. I invite you to anguish and wrestle with what it means to protect, what it meant to protect his wife and truly love his father. I invite you to anguish and wrestle with what love looks like for you. now while I invite you into the mystery of this and the struggle of it I think it's only fair and helpful if I give you some structure within which to enter into this struggle the bulk of the framework I want to give you is going to be provided next week as we look at 1 Corinthians 13 a little bit but the foundation for that I want to give to you this morning in the moments that we have left And the foundation will be provided by telling you that even biblical language affirms that there are different kinds of love. For many of you, this will be nothing new. There are four Greek words for our understanding of love. Eros, storge, phileo, and agape. First is eros. And like it sounds, eros is erotic. It's sexual love. It is a legitimate God-created and blessed kind of love. but the thing about eros that I want to point out while you've all probably heard teaching on this the thing I want to point out for our purposes is this there's nothing particularly mysterious about eros. What I mean by that is I understand eros. I mean I don't wonder about eros I don't think about eros, erotic sexual love and go, what is the attraction? I don't get it at all. How can they do that? Unless I'm talking about my parents, you know. Then I get kind of freaked out. But other than that I get erotic love. I understand that. God even knew that erotic love was so powerful and natural that some incredibly significant boundaries needed to be placed around that. The thing about erotic love is it's natural. There's nothing mysterious about it. Storge is the second kind of love. And as I understand it, and there are many nuances of this, it comes down to, as I understand it, a familial kind of love, family love. It's that of a mother or a father for a child. Few things are stronger than that, but again, this kind of love is a natural love. If a parent would be void of love for their child, we would maybe acknowledge that that happens, but we would all agree that's unnatural. What is wrong there? I was talking to a friend not long ago, and actually what we were talking about was the culture and ways in which it's kind of frightening to live when we live. And this particular person had three little kids, and the youngest was a four-year-old boy, the cutest thing you ever saw. All four-year-old boys and girls are just the cutest thing you ever saw. And he was telling me how this week, earlier this week, his son had kind of wandered away about a half a block with a friend, and he was playing in his yard. And he could still see him, but he was just far enough away that he couldn't, you know, just kind of reach out right now and grab him and make sure he was safe. And there was something in his heart that began to race. Somebody in this culture, the way things are, could grab him, and I couldn't get to him, and I frightened him. And then he just said, as calm as could be, he says, if somebody ever hurt my kid, I'd rip out their throat. Now, this is a very, you need to understand, this is a very nice, calm, normal, next-door neighbor person. He's not a throat-ripper-outer person at all. And he was speaking, obviously, in graphic terms, exaggeration. There's the deal, though. I get that. You get that? No, it's natural. I understand that kind of love. It wasn't this last communion, but the one before Bonnie and I were serving communion. And in the flow of people suddenly appeared in front of us our son, Caleb, along with some of his buddies. And we had the wonderful privilege of serving our son the elements. And we blessed him and finally began to cry. And I did too. But I stopped and she kept crying. And people kept coming and she kept crying. And she was starting to drip into the crackers. And she was just messing. And the line kind of dissipated and she continued to wipe away tears. And I said, I thought maybe something else was going on. And I said, what's up? What's up? What's going on? And she just looked at me and she says, I just love that boy. I just love him. That's store game. I get that. So that was the third kind of love. This is another love I understand. It's just plain good old-fashioned friendship, affection, love. The key to this kind of love is mutuality, commonality. We like the same things. We laugh at the same jokes. We just click. Think of somebody with whom you click. That's phileo. It's a wonderful, God-given thing. This is, I like how I feel when I'm with you, love. This is a love you feel for your best, most trusted garden friend. Now, I've heard some teaching on phileo love that has led me to believe that phileo love is kind of shallow and superficial. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a profound love. In fact, the Bible says that John was the disciple that Jesus loved. Guess what word is used there for love? It's the Greek word philel. Jesus loves the world. Jesus loved intimately his disciples. Of the 12, there was one. There was one. There was a special thing that clicked in his humanity for John. And guess what? That's a good thing. There's nothing about that that's bad or superficial or shallow. But once again, like the other two loves, there's not a lot of mystery here. I could tell you why the people who are my friends are my friends. I could tell you why. There are reasons. I do this for them. They do this for me. There is mutuality. There is commonality. Things just click. It doesn't mean we don't have conflict, but we are really willing to go through the conflict. It even makes our relationship stronger. But there are things that reciprocate back and forth. And if they don't reciprocate, we have a different kind of friendship. Mutuality, commoner. It's a picture that you need to get as it relates to the body around phileo love as well. And by the way, I think one of the things that illustrates it, and we can enter into it in a very visual way, is when we have communion and the body comes to the table and we serve one another and we move together. See, we have mutuality as well and we have commonality as well. And it's not that we all laugh at the same jokes or like the same things. In fact, the beauty of our phileo is that we don't have to laugh at the same jokes. We don't have to live in the same neighborhood. We don't have to be the same. What is mutual for us is that we serve and love the same Christ. And that makes us one. And that's the basis of our phileo. Brotherly love. Paul talks about fervent love for the brethren. He's speaking there of phileo love. It's the fourth kind of love. It plunges us into mystery. It calls for something I don't get. it's unnatural. Agape. Agape is defined at its core as sacrificial love. Agape is a love that acts in the best interest of the person being loved without the promise of affection or receptivity. I don't get that. I know how to do. I know how to do. I know how to do. I like you. You like me too. I like you. Like is a word that you can get out of there. I will act in your best interest. You don't give a rip about the other way. I'm getting nothing back from you. I don't get that one. This kind of love is a love extended without the promise of reciprocity or relationship. This is the kind of love that is required for loving an enemy. Luke 6, 27, Jesus said, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who use you. Pray for those. I'm not ready to do good for them. I don't know what it would mean to bless them. Pray for them. Okay, okay, I'll start. There, and maybe that's where you start. I'm going to pray for them. Okay, Lord? Remember what that guy did to me. I just want to bring him to you. Oh, judge him. Would you please judge him? Nail him. Oh, thank you, God. Anyway, pray for those who use you. God, bring him to life. God, move on him with kingdom life. Move on her with amazing grace. Bring your kingdom there. you start to pray for your enemy I promise you the first time it comes out of your mouth it will not feel natural you'll even feel like a hypocrite enter into a spiritual discipline try it love your enemies, do good to those who hate you okay, let me just spin your head around what does it mean to do good? what does it mean? I'm going to go, okay, okay, I'll do it I'll use me and they hurt me. I'll do good. It wasn't mean to do good. Bake him a cake. Is that what it means? Bake him a cake? Maybe, maybe, maybe not. Maybe not. Dan Elner, the book I recommended a while ago about bold love, he does three things in there, three chapters that are very helpful. He talks about loving an evil person, loving a fool, and loving a normal sinner. And one of the things that he talks about when he talks about what it takes to love an evil person, someone who's doing evil, is this. If you're dealing with an evil person, one of the things you need to know is that evil can't be allowed to win. Evil needs to be stopped. So, for instance, if abuse is happening in your home, good, doing good to the person who's doing the abuse isn't making them a cake. It's stopping the cake. Don't make any more cakes. Stop the sin. Thwart the behavior. The best gift you can give to someone who is doing evil is for the evil to no longer work. Boy, love could be tough, couldn't it? Maybe it almost means in some instances a willingness to move into conflict. Man, this is just short-circuiting my brain. This is love I don't understand. It doesn't come naturally. It perplexes and confuses me. and when I'm really honest I think about this love the truth is it frightens me because I don't I don't have any protection with this love it acts in the best interest of that person regardless of appreciation or receptivity I'm not protected in that at all I may not win maybe nothing I say would even compel you to consider asking God to help you move into this kind of love save one thing there is one thing that calls me to it it's this that this kind of love is embodied in the one we say we love so much it's embodied in Christ Romans 5, 7 and 8 Paul says this one would hardly die for a righteous man Though for a good man, one might dare to die. In other words, I understand. I mean, I get the kind of love that would maybe lay down a life for somebody who was really good, who I really liked. I get that kind of love. But God demonstrated his love toward us in that while we were still his enemies, he baked us a cake. No, he laid down his life. While we were still his enemies, he made the first move. It's not natural. But to that kind of love, I invite you. But know this. With that kind of love will come mystery. Perplexing questions. Along with perplexing questions, pain. Not only because I'm unprotected, but because as you open your heart to the possibility of this kind of love, I'm pretty sure that you will soon taste the bitter sting of this reality. I don't do this kind of love very well. And you know what? You know when you will be overwhelmed with how you don't do this love very well? As soon as you try to do it. As soon as you try, okay, as soon as you just walk into it. You know, if some of you, God's moving on some of you about this, and you might even have somebody in your mind right now, and you're thinking about some things to do. But I just need to warn you, you're not crazy if this happens. As you begin to take a step, maybe this afternoon or tomorrow, about doing something about this, You might spend a week feeling like the total failure is we don't do this very well. It's unnatural. See, I get heiress down very well, pretty well. I got that down. I think I've built some real healthy boundaries around that and done my work around that. Storge and Phileo, man, Storge. I read books on family love, and I've tried to get that really good. philatel of friendships. I'll read a book on friendship. I'll do that. I abound in that. But this agape thing is an entirely different animal. We were talking about this at staff meeting on Wednesday, discussing we were having our heads spun around about this whole deal about how love looks this way here and it looks this way there. And Bob Gook, one of our staff members, said something that I thought was profound that I'd like to kind of pull our thoughts together with. He said, you know, I can't do this kind of love any better than I do the law. And they both drive me to the same place, right on my face before God, where I say, oh God, I don't know a thing about this. I can pacify myself because I do some other loves really well and look really good, but when it comes to loving an enemy and people who use me. I don't walk very deep there. I need your life and power. Abide in me, says the Father. The only way you can live this kind of life is as we find ourselves drinking from the vine of life, which is the life of God. Oh, God, oh, God, if you don't feed me and if you don't fill me with this, There is no arrogance to think I can do this. I don't do this very often, but I'm going to give you an assignment. I would just invite you to this. Some of you instinctively may already be doing this, but I want you to pick a person in your mind, a relationship that right now is maybe a bit perplexing for you. Not necessarily an enemy. It doesn't have to be that big. Just one of those relationships that is confusing to you. You have that in your mind. Not just now, but the rest of the day and maybe into the week. Journal around this. Bring to God this question. God, what does love look like in this situation? With this perplexing friend? Maybe the answer will come to you real quickly. Maybe the answer for some of you really is as simple as baking a cake, a gesture of kindness, doing a favor. Maybe it's not clear at all. Maybe it's as difficult as needing to confront a sin or stopping an evil. Sometimes it's as simple, again, as giving a hug, saying I'm sorry, forgiving a wrong, making a phone call. Sometimes it means taking a trip, getting on a plane and going. In the middle of the week, my wife got a phone call from her parents' home. They live in Arkansas. It was her sister who happened to be visiting my wife's parents. And the word was that my wife's mom had fallen several times in the week. And she couldn't get up, and they had to bring her to the hospital. And they checked her out, and she was seemingly okay, but she still couldn't walk. and now she was home and she was bedridden and couldn't move. And Friday we heard that her sister was having to leave, and her mom was worse, couldn't move, couldn't get to the bathroom, and every time she tried she'd fall. They had to call paramedics several times. So what does love look like? Well, it wasn't easy, but it was clear that in our situation at this time, what love looked like was that Bonnie gets on a plane, And so Bonnie got on a plane yesterday and flew to Arkansas. And for the next couple of days, love for Bonnie won't necessarily be easy, but it'll be real clear what love looks like. What love will look like is holding her mom and carrying her mom, and if her mom doesn't make it, cleaning up after her mom. That's what love looks like. But there's another spin on this that isn't as clear. Her mom really can't move. Her dad, my wife's parents are quite elderly. Her dad is 89 years old. He can't help. They can't afford a nurse care. We're looking at the possibility of a nursing home. Her mother's terrified of that. So here's the question. What does love look like now? You know what our answer to that right now is? We don't know. We don't know what love looks like. For Bonnie's mom. We're going to bring that to God. And we're going to enter into the anguish of what love looks like. Do good to them. Bless them. Pray for them. Have the courage to enter into the anguish and struggle of what love looks like in this situation and that situation. Abandoning the one-size-fits-all. Why? would anybody bother to do this much work? Here's why. Because one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to and through the people of God is when the people of God live out the authentic love of God. Let's stand and be dismissed. Father it occurs to me that maybe the beginning of this is coming to you confessing that in truth we don't do this kind of love very well but we want to give courage for first steps in walking in what real love looks like I pray these things in Jesus name and all God's people say Amen
