Thank you, Joel. Thank you, guys. Dobre rano. Ako samate. Oh, I'm in Minneapolis. I'm sorry. My name is Tom Johnson, and along with my wife and I, we spent 16 and a half wonderful years, And now we are back in Slovakia, living there, and we're leaving tomorrow to return. But these wonderful years that we spent here, and it's so good to return and see many of you, were wonderful because we raised our three teenage kids here during that time. And if you have teenagers, you know how challenging those times can be and how grateful you can be as parents when other people are speaking into the lives of your kids. in ways you can't as parents. And we were blessed to have a number of people, including our beloved Dick McCauley, who loved our kids as much as he loved his own, it seems, and spoke into their lives in ways we couldn't. And we weren't able to be back here for the memorial service for Dick, but we've been able to come around Jean and spend some wonderful time with her and discover what that experience was like, as he is still alive and with us, but he's on the other side. Our mission in Slovakia is much like what Dick did to our kids, and that is to speak in and love the next generation who are coming up. And that's what we're doing there. We are doing that through a number of different avenues, sports, sports camps, sports activities, after-school programming, some educational opportunities for kids as well as parents. And we've had the opportunity as well to begin an English-language chapel in cooperation with a local church in Bratislava, a Slovak church, that had a vision for this a number of years ago and invited us to be a part of it. It's been a deeply satisfying past year. And we've been here now for almost two months. And contrary to popular opinion, we didn't come back to watch the twins in the playoffs. We came because there are two very special people who came into our lives in the months of September and October. Our first two grandchildren were born, Ezra and Ebba. And obviously our job for the last two months has been to babysit and to hold babies. And we've done plenty of that. And it's going to be sad to get on the plane tomorrow. It's going to be difficult. But during those times of holding those children, those precious children, those gifts of life that have been given to us, and staring into their eyes as they open their eyes and look up at you in that innocent, helpless, dependent way, it's been very overwhelming to look at those lives and say, What are the dreams? What are the possibilities? What are the hopes? What kind of a difference can these young children make? And as I think about that, it has brought on a whole new level the importance of paying attention to and investing in future generations. It's true in Slovakia, and it's true here. When I left Opendoor a year ago, there was a relatively new initiative that our church had taken on. And that initiative was something we sensed as a call of God, much like the call to go to Slovakia. My wife and I are not Slovak. But for whatever reason, God chose that avenue of ministry for us to invest in. And he's chosen that avenue for us to invest in North Minneapolis. It became our Samaria in biblical terms, a way to cross cultural boundaries, cultural divides, and go in and make a difference in an area that we really sensed God had called us to address. And one of the ways in which we did that was to help in the development and the establishment of Sanctuary Covenant Church. And with Sanctuary Covenant Church, the community development corporation that went along with it launched at the same time. And then we as a church began to engage in personal and specific ways as Men's Ministries Hearts in Action began to spend more time in North Minneapolis. Many of you volunteered with mentoring and tutoring and summer parks outreaches. You donated school supplies and winter clothes, and you gave money, lots of money, to help make that vision become a reality. Well, coming back after one year and kind of observing what's going on, it's been extremely gratifying and exciting to see how the torch has been picked up and carried on by some very capable, gifted, and passionate young people, People who, together with us old folks, can make a difference. Jen Linwall has worked hard to keep the initiatives alive and to develop them further. And Neeraj Mehta has taken on new responsibilities at the Community Development Corporation. And I want to commend them to you and challenge us to get around them and behind them. And together, let's make this extremely successful as we continue the bringing of good news to North Minneapolis. I want you to welcome Jen Linwall and Neeraj Mehta as they come to share this morning. Would you join me? Good morning. Last night they tried to use the full-size pulpit, and all everyone could see was my head. So today we've got a shorter one, and I'm very grateful. Many of you know that we have what we call here at Open Door our set of core values. 13 of our pastoral staff, including Tom, spent over a year discussing and discerning what Open Door held at its core in terms of belief, about who we are as a church and what we're supposed to be in this world. One of those values is we can change the world. When I first read that, I thought, whoa, that seems really big. Is that even possible? But the more time I've spent here at Open Door, the more I've learned that this value is not meant to be an overstatement. this is not supposed to be a picture of an ideal world rather this statement is an articulation of our belief that God intends the church to be a constant movement of bringing the world into his kingdom we believe that when people change and act accordingly the world around us cannot remain the same so out of our desire to live that value out corporately the Beyond Our Door special project was created nearly four years ago a lot of you were here for those initial services when Tom and Steve came to us with their vision and their dreams And I know that many of you joined in their excitement of this new vision to go beyond our doors and to join with other people in their kingdom work. And those of you who are here know that this campaign did not come out of an excess of resources for Open Door. It wasn't like we had so much stuff, we were wondering where we could give it away. Rather, this campaign came out of our desire to learn how to be a people who stop going like this with everything we have and learn how to go like this. We knew that there was so much to be done, there were so many places that could use our resources. But as we met people, relationships were formed. And as we listened to their dreams and visions for their communities, it became clear where we were supposed to be. So at that time, we invited you all into a relationship with the community of North Minneapolis and working alongside those who are in Kenya, Uganda, and Bangladesh working with the AIDS epidemic. The people who are infected and affected by the AIDS epidemic have been part of our life here for the last three years. And this partnership has led to some close relationships. It's made names like the Katabasis commonly used words around here. This partnership's given us visions of Immaculate, the mother of five children infected with polio and HIV, who now lives in the safety and security of her own home as a result of this campaign. Here in the States, we felt a call to North Minneapolis, a community that's experiencing a crisis in regards to violence, education, drug use, and families. And the money we've collected has been invested in Hospitality House, which is an organization that works with youth, provides a safe place for youth to go, hang out with someone as they work on their homework or play a game of basketball. The other part of that money has gone to Sanctuary Community Development Corporation, who we'll be hearing from today. About two years ago, my husband Ben, who works downstairs with the youth, some of you may know him, and I began to dialogue about moving into North Minneapolis. I, like a lot of you, had sat in those seats, listened to the sermons, and been moved from what I heard from the pulpit and challenged about how I thought and lived. Ben and I began to realize how badly we wanted to see change in North Minneapolis and how badly we wanted to see it in ourselves. We were pretty sure we were crazy, two young kids from the suburbs who knew next to nothing, I mean next to nothing, about urban culture. But when we moved in for one of the first times in our lives, we tried to go without an agenda. We decided to skip baking cross-shaped cookies for all of our neighbors and let our relationships form as authentically as we knew how. We knew that coming in as the great savior with all the answers would only make matters worse. And so we decided to make a space to listen and really hear from the people around us. And what met me there was unexpected. I was confronted head-on about my prejudices, my arrogance, my desire to control outcomes, my privilege, and so much of the stuff in my life. I realize that I don't have all the answers. And in fact, a lot of times I don't even know what question I'm supposed to be asking in regards to the pain and challenges of my neighbors. This process began a period that still continues of asking questions, discussing prayer, struggle, and action. And as I got honest about myself and the reality of the people around me, I found that I actually came to life in a different way. Now, I'm not an expert on North Minneapolis, but this personal experience has helped me view Sanctuary Community Development Corporation in a whole new light. Because in the CDC, we find a common heart to holistically address the issues that are rising up in North. When they look at the residents, they don't see just problems or issues, but they see people with complex stories. I see them looking to invest in the people of North Minneapolis, not just programs. And when I sit in their offices and listen to them dialogue, I can see and hear how they're coming face-to-face with some really, really difficult issues, but they're learning how to deal with them with authenticity and grace. And that's why I'm so excited to have Neeraj Mehta here from the CDC to tell us a little bit more about what he's experiencing and learning in his work in North Minneapolis. I've really, really come to admire Neeraj over the past year and a half for his passion and desire to seek justice and his willingness to ask the hard questions about the journey that we're on. Will you join me in welcoming Neeraj to the stage? It's a fun time, I saw it. Thank you. Good morning. I think this is my water from yesterday. I'm not sure. I'm really glad to be here. I didn't say that yesterday because I was really scared. But after getting one down under my belt, I feel good about this. Thank you for having me here. I want to start just by sharing a little bit about myself. I'm 28 years old. I'm Indian. My parents moved here from India in the late 60s. My sister and I grew up in an upper-middle-class family in the suburbs in Arden Hills. And my whole life, I thought I was going to be an engineer or a doctor, or I was also told that's what I was going to be, an engineer or a doctor, and some of my goals were a nice car, a nice house, stuff like that. But when I was in college, I ran into Jesus, or Jesus ran into me. I still haven't quite figured out which one it was. But my life took a turn for the worse. For the worse, if you're talking about how I thought my life was supposed to look. A turn for the better, if you're talking about how Jesus wanted my life to be. I moved into South Minneapolis, into the inner city, and started living in community with some other college students. And it was the same exact neighborhood that my parents had moved into when they first moved here from India. and had worked many years to move out of. So they were a little bit questioning me in some ways, like we worked our tails off to get out of here, now you're moving in. And it was confusing, let alone I became a Christian, which was a whole other sermon. But it was here that I met people, people who were seemingly different than me, but who I soon found out that we were almost exactly the same, that they had something to offer me, and God has shown me that I have something to offer them. Through jobs and volunteering, my life intersected with North Minneapolis. I didn't want to go to North Minneapolis. They said, hey, I got a job at an organization, and they said, we want you to work with youth in North. And I said, no South. And they said, no North. Started that. Then I moved up, started working with families, and they said, over North. I said, no, no South. They said, no, it's North. So there I was. I remember the first time I went over there with my friend Joel, and we drove down West Broadway Avenue. We drove down James Avenue. ended up then three blocks from where I now live with my wife today, and I was scared. It was dark. I remembered what they said on the news, and all I wanted to do was to get back to something that I knew and something that I was comfortable with. But somehow God did not let me do that. I ended up moving into the community four years ago, and in those years I have gotten to know some beautiful, beautiful people. Again, people who I thought were so different from me on the outside, but I found out are almost exactly the same. We're all people who are searching for identity, searching for life, searching for love, searching for a sense of wholeness, and often looking in all the wrong places. In this time, I've been privileged to be in relationship with people, to be in their houses, to be in their families, to share life together. And I've come to believe that they need to know you, and you need to know them. We are all people who are grasping to know who we are in Christ. We're believing in the same things, hoping in the same things, struggling with the same things, to know what we are supposed to be and do in this world. People who are looking to have their beauty uncovered. North Minneapolis is a beautiful, beautiful place. 60 or 70 years ago, it would have been a lot easier to see that beauty just from the physical realm. North Minneapolis was filled with strong families, strong schools, strong businesses, probably one of the most vibrant communities in Minneapolis. It was the heart of the Jewish community, the heart of the African-American community. But then, just like almost every other major central city in this country around the 50s and 60s, things started to change. Racial tension and political unrest set these parts of the cities on fire. Literally, somebody threw a rock through a storefront on Plymouth Avenue, and seemingly overnight, the north side went up in flames. The middle class moved out, businesses left, banks left, grocery stores left, families left, and even some churches left too. In its place were left fast food restaurants, gangs, drugs, unemployment, health disparities, concentrated poverty, and all of its negative consequences. The beauty that was once so easy to see was covered up and scarred. I've asked myself and I've asked God how this Indian kid from the suburbs has become so passionately tied to one community. In seven years, I've fallen in love with this community, fallen in love with the people that I know, the parks, the streets, the problems, its redemption. In three years of working with the Sanctuary Community Development Corporation, I'm sure of two things in all of this. That one, God desires deeply to uncover the beauty that once existed, that's still there but covered up. And two, he wants us to join in with him. He didn't reconcile me to himself or this church to himself simply to be about ourselves. He didn't give us gifts and skills and resources that would just benefit ourselves, but to benefit others as well. I think he did these things because he wants us to be his message to the world. We're the medium unto which we can deliver God's love sometimes. He wants us to be a certain type of people who through our lives would put God on display for the world to see. that we would be his hands, his feet, his mercy, his grace, his love wherever we go. And in that process, beauty would be uncovered wherever we go. I believe in the beauty that exists in North Minneapolis and I am dedicated to participating with God in uncovering it. I'm also grateful to have people like you alongside the journey with us. Coming alongside with your questions, with your fears, with your concerns. It's really bright when you look up. Sorry, I lost myself. But we're trusting one thing in all this. We're trusting that God wants us there. God wants us here. He has asked this of us. So what are we doing? Let me try to paint a picture for you of how I think I see it, or how I do see it. How many of you heard of the sculpture The David by Michelangelo? Raise your hands. All right, action. Beautiful sculpture. How many have seen it in person? It's gigantic. I think it's like 26 feet high or something huge. But it is really beautiful. And my wife and I were able to see it a couple years ago on our honeymoon. And we heard this story about how it came to be. Apparently somebody commissioned Michelangelo, who's the artist, to do this piece. So in my own way, I think they probably just dropped a big rock off in his backyard and asked him to create something. And it wasn't like he already had a pre-sketched out drawing of the David. So he didn't just go to his office, grab his sketchbook, say, okay, here's the David, here's a rock, let's bring this thing together. But since he didn't know, what he did was he just walked around the rock. And he walked around the rock, and he walked around the rock, and he prayed around the rock until it was revealed to him that inside this rock was David. That his job wasn't necessarily to create something new as much as it was to uncover the beauty that already exists. To chip away at all the pieces that were covered up inside the rock. I love the picture that this story tells of uncovering beauty that already exists. I think this is what God is doing in North Minneapolis. I think he's desiring for people to see their beauty in Christ, to rediscover who he originally created them to be in all of their infinite worth and dignity. Is that right? I believe that this is what God has invited us to be a part of in North Minneapolis. Not necessarily to come into this community and create something new, but to be used by God to chip away at all of those things that have covered up the beauty that already exists. So many of the individuals and families that I have met have lost their beauty, lost their sense of confidence about who they are and what they can accomplish. And the more and more I'm involved in community development, the more I see this as a unique role of the church, of God's people, to love people as he loves them, to uncover the beauty that already exists. Lately, I've been thinking about the man that Jesus heals in John 5, this man by the pool. And I'll just read the scripture for you quick. Sometime later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews. Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda, and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. Here a great number of disabled people used to lie, the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. One who was there had been an invalid for 38 years. When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, do you want to get well? Sir, the invalid replied, I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I'm trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me. I've been wrestling with this picture to me. I like to think of the Bible in stories, and so I just see this man there, and I wonder, how old is he? It says he was there for 38 years, sitting by the pool, but I wonder, is he 39? Is he 49, 59, 99? how long is his life and how much of that life has been spent at the pool. Either way, for me, I'm 28 years old, so 38 years is a long time just to be sitting somewhere. I would wonder how he got to be the way he was. Was he born that way? Was he in an accident? Did he have a disease? I could imagine that society back then wasn't as forgiving to people with disabilities. I could maybe imagine that after 38 years of sitting by the pool and not being healed, that that had become his identity? To himself and to others, he was just known as that guy sitting by the pool watching other people get healed. If he wasn't born that way, I would wonder what he did before he became an invalid sitting by the pool. Part of me thought maybe he was a Jewish carpenter who got hurt on the job. Did he have a family? And if he did, where are they now? What do people think when they just see him sitting there? Or one thing I thought about was, what about the people who do get healing? What do they see in him or what do they say to him when they walk by after being healed? I could maybe imagine that he's sad, that he's lonely, depressed. Maybe he's grown comfortable with his position, with his place in life. I bet on many days he might even just say, oh, well, I guess this is the way it is for me. Accepting it, feeling hopeless about any possibility for change. But I could imagine that the second Jesus asks him, do you want to get well? a million thoughts go through his head. Get well. Get well. If I get well, where would I live? And if I got to get a place to live, do I need to have a job? And if I need to have a job, do I need like interview clothes? And then how am I going to get to my job? Do I need to get a car? I can imagine all of these things, let alone saying, well, I'm this guy, so you're asking me to be somebody else. Who would I be? How would I be known? I can imagine maybe 10 or 20 years ago he would have jumped up and said, yes, I'm ready, heal me, let's do this. But maybe now after 38 years, it's a little bit harder, he's a little bit more dejected, a little bit more hopeless. And answering that yes, he would like to get well is just a little bit hard. So instead he states his current reality. I have no one to help me. I can't do it. I can't change. Nothing new is possible for me. This is what I know. What I know is that I can't do it. Sometimes when I'm in relationships with families on the North side, I feel like this is the exact same struggle that they're in. In some ways it was a struggle that I had been in before I came to know Jesus, stuck in an identity that is marred and disconnected from who God says I am and what he believes about me. That some families that I've known, they've lost complete confidence in who they are and what they can do. They've been told for years, this is who you are, this is what you can do. You're single, you're black, you're a single mom, you're a felon, you're uneducated. And that's come to be who they believe themselves to be. Defined by the world, defined by themselves, being able to say yes to the chance to change I don't think is always as simple as it might seem. As program director I see this idea of uncovering beauty and restoring lost identity to be at the heart of what we're doing at the sanctuary. Yet we understand this process of uncovering beauty to be difficult. We have to be willing to be in relationships with people long enough to realize that asking the question do you want to get well isn't always as simple as yes or no. that there is a history, that there's layers of experiences, family issues, health issues, spiritual oppression, structural injustices, personal choices that sometimes prevent people from simply saying yes and being transformed. Our role then, I think, is to love them, affirm them, support them, and in doing that, hopefully begin to join with God in chipping away at all of those things that are covering up their beauty and covering up their identity. At the core of what we're doing at the sanctuary through our after-school youth development programs and job training program, Momentum, is this idea of uncovering beauty. And I want to accentuate the fact how unique an opportunity we have through this. I've been doing community development for seven years. I went to graduate school, read a lot of books, talked to a lot of people. Though I'm not an expert, in the last three years of working with the sanctuary and being able to integrate Jesus and this holistic nature of taking care of people's physical needs is huge. lives are being changed and I want to share some of those stories with you there was this woman Nikki who came to our first job training program Momentum when she connected with us she hadn't worked in almost three years and she was discouraged and depressed and in her own words she told me that she had lost all confidence in herself but through the process of this eight week class God uncovered something beautiful inside of her it was like she all of a sudden regained confidence she had a sense of vision, sense of passion for what she wanted to do in this world. And when she graduated, she just hit the ground running. She got a job. She's been working full time now for a year and a half. She just called me a couple weeks ago to let me know that she'll be graduating in January with her associate's degree and be working as a medical assistant at Unity Hospital. There was this student, Cordell, 14-year-old student, junior high student in our Hip Hop Academy program last spring. It's an amazing little kid. He lives in my neighborhood. I I see him all the time. He came back to the Sanctuary Church to share with our congregation the impact of the Hip Hop Academy on his life. And he stood in front of 500 of us and shared one of the most amazing stories of transformation that I've heard. It was so amazing. Sometimes I forget what I'm doing in my job, and so to hear stories like that, just bring it back home. He talked to us about how he sees himself differently, about how he doesn't think he needs to sell drugs anymore, and that he sees something different for his future that he never saw before. He spoke with such hope, such strength. I'm not sure there was a dry eye in the whole house. This summer, we had another job training session of Momentum, and this guy, Kirk, came right out of prison. He came and shared with me. We were talking, and he basically talked about how before prison, during prison, and especially after prison, how his self-dignity and self-worth had been absolutely stripped, lost. he went through the program again God did something, he's been working full time at an amazing job, $12 an hour he's just doing fantastic he called me the other day and we were talking and just kind of catching up and he said something so powerful powerful to me personally but I think to what I'm trying to say today too and he just said Neeraj, the only reason I stuck with this program, the only reason I came through the way I did is because that first day I met you you told me you believed in me and I cannot remember the last time somebody said that to me and somehow I've come to believe in myself again and he just thanked me. There's a woman in our program right now who comes from a story of just absolute tragedy. Stuff I can't even understand. Abuse, addiction, prostitution. We were sitting in my office working on her resume and I was just asking her how she's doing, how the Momentum program has been helping her out and she just looked me straight in the eye And she said, Neeraj, for the first time in a long time, I'm starting to feel beautiful again. This is powerful stuff. People's lives are changing. Beauty is being uncovered through our work, and you all are just as much a part of this as I am. I remember one night a few years ago when I was new to the city, new to my faith. I was standing on the corner by this convenience store just observing, praying. I'm sure I stuck out like a sore thumb. But this guy came up to me and he asked me, what are you doing? And I said, well, I'm just praying for folks, looking around. And he said, well, man, you've got to pray for me because this is my last $10. And after tonight, my wife and I and my family, we're going to be evicted. We're going to be homeless. My kid needs diapers. We have no food. So please, please, please pray for me. And I said, absolutely. And he went into the convenience store. And 10 minutes later, he came out with a pack of beer and some cigarettes. and I looked at him and I was like, what? What about the food? What about the diapers? And he looked right back at me and he said, I think a very true statement, he said, you will never understand. And back then I didn't understand and I went home and I went back to my apartment and I screamed and I yelled at God and I asked questions of God and I cried in front of God. See, to me, when I became a Christian, I had this idea that God came to change the world, save the world. but then I was struggling with all of these realities of hunger, disease, drugs, racism, homelessness, joblessness and I couldn't reconcile what I was experiencing in my own faith journey and what I was seeing in the world and so in that moment at that night I screamed out to God where are you? In this community, in my life, in the life of that guy, where are you? What are you doing? Where are you? And he whispered back to me the way God so lovingly does, where are you? To deal with the suffering in the world, my solution is you. I'm placing hands on people through you. I'm healing people through you. And this, I think, is the most beautiful and the most difficult thing for us to grasp. While God could choose to bring justice and wholeness and shalom all on his own, we must struggle with the fact that he chooses us to be the medium often to bring his justice, his mercy, his righteousness, his kingdom on earth as it is in heaven. So now when I think about this partnership and I think about that question of where are you, God, it's gotten a lot easier to picture. He's working through a guy in your church who comes to my office every single Friday and works with the people in our job training program, helping them write resumes, search for jobs online, and just generally support and encourage them. That guy Kirk I told you about who came to our program out of prison, The job he got, somebody in your church gave him that job at his place of business. A woman from Open Door last week gave me 10 bus cards to just bless the ladies in the program as they were interviewing, searching for jobs, and hopefully getting their jobs. God is working through the 30 or so volunteers from this church who every week are spending an hour in North Minneapolis Public Schools loving kids, supporting kids, encouraging kids. He's in the mom and daughter who volunteered with our Beautiful program, which works with junior high girls after school, just loving them and building strong relationships with them. He's buying school supplies and coats and donating them to kids in schools who need them. God is working through you and he's working through others to uncover the beauty that exists in North Minneapolis. And I want to thank you. I want to thank you for your investment, for your time, for your prayers, for your volunteering, for the gifts that you've presented at the table and had God use to uncover beauty in North Minneapolis. As I end, I want to quickly revisit that metaphor of David and Michelangelo. I've got this group of guys that I get together with every few weeks to talk about God, life, love, family, politics, whatever it is. And I was sharing with them this metaphor, and they were kind of wrestling with it. And my friend Phil, who was just this deep, deep cat, he looked at me and he said, I've got questions. And I want to pose some of those questions back to you. His first question was, so who are we in this metaphor? Who are we? Who am I? Who are you in this metaphor? And I thought about that and I said, well, are we Michelangelo, the artist, the creator? And I thought maybe that was a little bit of a stretch. Maybe that's more like God's role. I thought, are we the chisel, the tool that the artist uses to uncover the beauty? I could see that, that in some way God is the artist. He picks us up, chisels away at the pieces that he wants to chisel, knowing what lies underneath. But I also landed on this thought. What if it's our beauty that's been covered up? What if in all of this giving to others, there's something that God is giving back to us? What if in us participating with God, there's a lost beauty he is trying to uncover in us? What if we're the ones who are scarred? And the chipping that's happening in North Minneapolis is also happening here. To you all as a body, to us as individuals, I wonder, I don't know. I think those are hard questions to wrestle with. He asked me the question, would you be comfortable with if you never fully saw it uncovered? Would we be okay with that? Do we trust God as the artist and creator to finish the work? What if the entire span of our life represented just one tiny cut at the base of the sculpture? Would our life, would our time, would our money be worth it to be a part of something beautiful? What if the beautiful thing that we're doing is simply participating in what God has asked the church to be about, what he's asked Open Door to be about, what he's asked you to be about, what he's asked me to be about. And what if what we celebrate and rejoice over isn't necessarily a final product, but that by joining God in this work, we are being who he desires us, the church, to be in this world. But again, maybe this question isn't just about us. Maybe it's about all of redemptive history and all of the things that God wants to do in this world. And I can think of nothing better than being here and partnering with you guys and wrestling with these questions. I told you at the beginning that I think it would be a great idea for you to meet some people in North Minneapolis and for them to meet you. And for logistical reasons, I didn't bring a lot of people here today. But there is one woman who I want you to meet who's going to share a little bit of her story and say thank you to you on video as a picture of what I think God is doing in North Minneapolis. Thank you. My name is Monty Smith. I would like to tell you about Momentum Job Training. Recently, I moved here about two months ago from Chicago, and I left my past behind me. So one day I was walking and I went to the South Asian Army and I seen a flyer with momentum job training on it. So I said, hmm, let me check this out, see what's happening with it, right? Well, I called and I talked to Neerich and he sounded so excited. He had me all pumped up. So I said, OK, I'm going to come check it out. Well, I missed my first appointment by babysitting. So the second time I came and we made plans for me to come to orientation. When I came to the orientation, I met like eight fantastic other ladies like myself looking for somewhere to go. When I first got here, it was like hard for me like to look in the mirror, you know. It was like, I can, well, not when I first got here, when I left, when I was in Chicago. And I look in the mirror and I used to say, I don't like this person, you know. I wasn't going anywhere, I wasn't doing anything with my life. But since I've been at momentum, you know, I can look in the mirror and I smile and I stand there and I pose. And I'll be saying, look at you, girl, you just something else. By being at momentum, I have learned how to bring out the best in me. The side that was covered up is not covered anymore. You see my whole natural beauty. Well, my future is looking very bright. Very bright. Yeah. I'm not afraid to put my foot in the door anymore. And I might get rejected, but I still put my foot in the door. I try very hard. I'm looking for jobs everywhere, so something's going to happen for me real soon. But I am a better person today, a better person. I'm the new and improved MIT. And thank you, Momentum Job Training, for helping me find myself today. Thank you. My beauty is inside and outside. It came out and being in Momentum, job training have really brought it out. I can really know the true person that I really am, the beautiful person I am and I love looking in the mirror these days. It feels real good to look at myself and have myself smile back at me. Thank you Momentum. Wow. You know, as I've spent time in North, living there and hanging out with people at Sanctuary, it's been amazing to see some of this beauty uncovered. To meet these teachers in the schools where our tutors are, to talk with some of the students in these programs, is to come face-to-face with people experiencing change. But I'm in a constant struggle regarding how much North is changing and how much we're changing here at Open Door as a result of this partnership? Are we both being impacted? How are we as a people looking, seeing, experiencing, and smelling the world differently? Can the people around us tell anything's different? As the Metro Impact Associate Pastor, I have the privilege of being in a relationship with many of you who are working on the North side. And as we ask people about how their encounter with North Minneapolis has impacted their life, here's what I've heard they've said. They are becoming aware that those people have a name and a face and hopes and dreams so similar to their own. Simple hellos and how are yous have often been enough to begin the process of understanding each other. In North Minneapolis, they're finding that they have so much in common with the people there. They're meeting people like them, people trying to make a better life for their family, people who love their children and want their children to be happy and successful. One gentleman who's been working with Momentum program said that he shared with one of the ladies that he's been unemployed for three months. And the woman told him in return she's been unemployed for three years. But she's still smiling. He said this, I think my brothers and sisters in North Minneapolis need a little help clearing their obstacles. But I think that I need them to show me a simple faith. I know this transformation is real because I've experienced it myself. I've seen the single mother with six kids who just can't seem to get her act together turn into my friend Darla, who's had a hard life and is so tired from doing it all alone. I tell you that when problems started changing into people, in my life, something huge started changing in me. And the common thread that I find weaving in and out of each of these stories and in my own life is relationship. Our only hope for seeing the beauty that lies beneath the surface in North Minneapolis and for having beauty uncovered in ourselves is relationship. We call this relationship a partnership because Sanctuary has things to offer us and we have things to offer them. It is through this partnership with the CDC that we have a means to be in relationship with the people of North Minneapolis. I was recently at a conference in Philadelphia where they decided to do a vigil for all the victims of gun violence in the city. They invited a young girl up on stage who we learned was a fiancé of one of the victims. And as she slowly read each name of the victim, I found that I was in complete tears. Because in this moment, the stats turned into people, and those names turned into stories. This is why our partnership with Sanctuary is so essential and important, because we need Sanctuary to turn those stats into people and those faces into stories for us. I don't see any other way for a large, mostly white, suburban church in the middle of Maple Grove, Minnesota, to be in a relationship with North Minneapolis. A friend of mine recently said he lives in North Minneapolis to be a witness. My first thought was, a witness. So you go door to door and tell people about Jesus, maybe? But then he said this, I live in North Minneapolis to be a witness to all the people outside of the community about what the people there are experiencing. Because the problems in North Minneapolis have grown worse as it's become more isolated from the metro area. And for many of us, the evening news may be our only connection to what goes on in North Minneapolis, day in and day out. Sanctuary continues to be that witness for us. Through them, we meet people like Monty. We meet people like Nicky. We hear about people like Kirk. And through them, problems and faces become real people with complex stories. Neeraj used the amazing metaphor of David and Michelangelo as he described how God wants to see beauty in each of us and his desire for us to help him uncover that in other people. But as we chisel, we are also chiseled. In fact, I would argue we cannot chisel others without being chiseled ourselves. Henry Nouwen in his book Reaching Out says this, the complexity of life is related to the fact that we find ourselves in all types of relationships, at the same time and on all sides. While being a father to our children, a teacher to our students, and a counselor to our counselees, We find that we have to also remain a child, a student, and a patient. While trying to be a good mother, we often still have to be a daughter. While teaching in the daytime, we're a student in the evening. And when we give advice to others, we realize how bad we need it ourselves. We're all children and parents, students and teachers, and healers and in need of care. So we move in and out of each other's worlds at different times and in different ways. I would add to Henry Nouwen, if I could, that we cannot tutor in North Minneapolis without being tutored. We cannot give job training without being trained. We cannot uncover beauty without having beauty uncovered in ourselves. As I said, this partnership is about a relationship and a commitment, and those of you who have been around for this know that. Open Doors, part of our commitment at Open Door, has been and continues to be financial giving. We consider it a privilege to join Sanctuary in their work by collecting designated funds over the past few years. But even this collection is not one-sided for us. We have the opportunity to financially participate in the work of the CDC, but through this, beauty is uncovered in us when we learn how to rightly order our finances, when we learn how to stop doing this as a congregation and start doing this. When I think about what God wants to do through the Beyond Our Door campaign, I'm overwhelmed by what he's already doing in North Minneapolis and us. That block of stone which is Africa, that block of stone which is North Minneapolis, That block of stone which is you and me already possess so much beauty. And I believe this campaign and our giving to this campaign is uncovering that beauty in both places. We had a dream at the beginning of this year to reach a million dollars. That would mean that over the course of four years, Church of the Open Door would have given one million dollars to work in AIDS in Africa and to help the community of North Minneapolis. At this point, we still have a little under $200,000 to go to reach that goal. Joel's going to come forward in a few minutes and share a song, and I want to invite you into a space of thinking how you may be able to participate in this campaign financially. We just want to make a place for you to talk with God and to dialogue about how you might be a part of this. We're really, really hoping to make a big chunk out of the financial pieces of this campaign in the next couple weeks so that Sanctuary can continue on in their work of uncovering beauty in North Minneapolis. I also have another really exciting opportunity I want to invite you to this morning. some of the very talented artists from this congregation have donated their time and talent to a photo gallery which includes images of North Minneapolis and Africa. These images are on display in an exhibit back in the gallery. Go check that out after this service. You definitely don't want to miss it. They've captured moments of everyday life for people in these communities. On another note, at 11 a.m. in the gallery Steve Hansen is going to be showing a video with some of the footage from his trip to Africa earlier this year. He wanted you to know that this is 70 hours of footage condensed down into 45 minutes. It's bound to be really good. So I strongly encourage you to check that out. I really love the journey that Neeraj invited us into about the chisel and the rock. And I would have to agree, I don't know where we are in this metaphor. In fact, I think we might be everywhere in this metaphor. And that's why I'm excited for us to continue in this partnership and relationship. Remember, there's a lot of ways for you to get involved right now. You heard me say financially, there's a large wooden box out by the Beyond Our Door wall there's also a box in the gallery if you'd like to consider giving we'd really appreciate that you can write out a check to Church of the Open Door and put the Beyond Our Door special project in the memo line for others of you maybe you can offer a job or two to some of the Momentum graduates maybe you're ready to sign up to be a tutor or mentor you can do that back at the kiosk in the gathering place we know a lot of you have untapped talents, gifts, and passions So Neeraj and I are going to hang out here after the service if you want to come talk with us and share your ideas with us about how you want to get involved. I just want to invite you to sit back now. We wanted to make the space for you to think about what your personal part in this is, what your part of this relationship is, if you can financially give to this. Joel's going to come forward and play a song. And here he is. Thanks so much for your time today, folks. Thank you. We come with beautiful secrets We come with purpose Written on our hearts Written on our souls We come to every morning With possibilities Only we can hold That only we can hold Redemption comes in strange places Small spaces Calling out the best of who we are And I want to add to the beauty And tell a better story Shine with the light That's burning up inside It comes in small inspirations It brings redemption to life and work To our life and our work It comes in loving community It comes in helping a soul find its worth A soul find its worth Cause redemption comes in strange places Small spaces calling out the best of who we are And I want to add to the beauty To tell a better story An invitation to be beautiful This is grace, an invitation Redemption comes in strange places Small spaces calling on our best And I want a hand to the beauty I want to shine with your light that's burning up inside. I want to add to the beauty to tell a better story. Shine with the light that's burning up inside. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Would you just pray with me? God, we desperately want to see beauty that already exists uncovered. We want to see it in Africa. We want to see it in North Minneapolis. and God, we want to see it in ourselves. Will you just challenge us, God, as we move forward? Challenge us to give financially. Challenge us to give of our talents, of our time and bring us into a deeper relationship with the sanctuary, with the people of North Minneapolis. In Jesus' name, amen. You're dismissed. Go in peace. Thank you.
