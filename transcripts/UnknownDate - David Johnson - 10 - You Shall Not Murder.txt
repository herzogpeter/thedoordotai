Open your Bibles to Exodus 20, verse 13. As we continue our study of the Ten Commandments, today coming to the sixth, you shall not murder. Specifically in the Hebrew, the word for murder is rendered this way. You shall not take without just cause the life of the innocent. This is not a prohibition against killing of any kind. There are times you may have to protect yourself or go to war. every kind of killing is not prohibited here, specifically taking without just cause the life of an innocent murder. My initial response to this commandment, before I had much thought or reflection on it, quite frankly, was relief. Finally, a commandment that I have not obliterated in some way. Finally, a commandment that will not require any deep repentance or painful introspection. I mean, if you've been with us at all for the last few weeks around this honor your parents thing, that has been a lot of work. And it's raised a lot of questions. But this is going to be a breeze, this murder thing. I think we can all relax and just kind of tell you on the front end, just go ahead and get comfortable. Because the absolute truth before God is this. I am not a murderer, and neither are you. Never have been. I doubt that we ever will be. I don't think it's in me to tell you the truth. Maybe in self-defense. To protect my family in a war by some horrible accident. I suppose I could, you could too, take a life. But to take without just cause. The life of an innocent. I don't think so. I just don't see me going there. I don't even struggle with wanting to go there. Beloved, we don't have the opportunity very often to be corporately and publicly self-righteous and sanctimonious. The reason is because though I believe we deal here at Open Door with sin quite directly, calling it what it is, sin, we almost always do it with a firm grip on and a deep awareness of our own sin and therefore our own profound need for grace. But on this one, I'm feeling a little hopeful that we might be able to indulge just a little morally superior, sanctimonious self-righteousness. Because the fact is this, we're just not murderers. Never have been, probably never will be. And if you are a murderer, you're welcome. But we'd kind of like for you to identify yourself so we can, you know, give you some space. and you just need to know that if you are a murderer you may be the only one in this group of fine upstanding people enough of the charade the reason I gave you all of that was to tell you this that it was to a group of people much like that that Jesus in Matthew 5 said these words effectively wiping the sanctimonious smiles off their morally superior faces Matthew 5 verse 21 You have heard it said from the ancients that you shall not commit murder, and whoever commits murder shall be liable before the court. And everybody who hears that says, Amen, we need some law and order around here. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court, and whoever shall say to his brother, Raka, shall be guilty before the Supreme Court, and whoever shall say, You fool, shall be guilty enough to go into a fiery hell. Is he kidding? I mean, is he exaggerating to make some bizarre point? Because to equate murder with anger, indeed, to make calling someone a fool a greater offense than murder, which is what the text does. Murder, you're guilty before the court. Calling someone a fool, you're guilty enough to go into a fiery hell. Seems like a bit of a stretch to me. Apparently, uncomfortably, murder, according to Jesus, is much closer to home than I thought. For while murder might not be in my hand, it may be living quite comfortably in my heart, proceeding quite regularly from my mouth. Jesus, in this text, identifies the primary ingredients for murder. they are number one rage number two malice which is what's behind raka and number three contempt which is what's behind you fool it's not about the words you see raka or fool we don't even know for sure what raka means it's a Hebrew epitaph it's like a Hebrew swear word but specifically what it means we don't know there's a lot of speculation and I've speculated on it previously if you were with us when I went through Matthew chapter 5 years ago, I speculated that given the fact that you don't know what really Raka is, what the equivalent for us would be today, to me, would be kind of like flipping somebody off. It's like giving them the bird, you know, whatever. You know what I'm talking about. And the reason that worked for me was because I don't really know what that means. When somebody does that to me, I don't know what it, I just know it's bad. It's a profane thing to do. Well, that's kind of the the essence of raka. And we've called people much worse than fool, I think. The issue here is not the words themselves, for on the other hand, some people have never used those words, never called anybody a fool, never made that profane gesture, never said a profane word. The issue that Jesus is confronting here is what drives those words. And what drives those words, what fuels them, is rage, malice, which is a desire to inflict and do damage, which, by the way, I can do with a smile on my face. I could do malice on you without ever swearing. The third thing that drives these words that are really not the issue is contempt. Contempt past malice is a judgment about you that you are insignificant. You idiot. Fool. Mix those three things together. Not those three words, raka and fool, but those three ingredients, rage, malice, and contempt. And you have murder, but not always a murder you can see. Not always a murder that produces a body bag. For just like there's more than one way to skin a cat, there is more than one way to murder a human life. you can do it with a club you can do it with a gun you can do it with a brick or a knife or you can do it with a word or a gesture or even a look perfectly timed dripping with sarcasm full of contempt driven by malice drawn from a deep well of received indulged and stored up anger always at the ready the spontaneity of which surprises sometimes even you And sometimes you have been the recipient of that kind of explosive, surprising anger that seemed to come out of nowhere. And sometimes you have been the deliverer of that kind of anger. Where one second you were relatively calm, somebody brought into your life some sort of offense. And before you could even stop yourself, the anger was explosive. We call it road rage. It's getting a lot of press these days. Some are calling it an epidemic. Explosions of anger over some real or imagined vehicular disrespect, resulting in some vile verbal exchange, complete with sign language for the hearing impaired, which is RACA. When it's verbally vile, it's not going to make the papers. That's no big deal. Nobody gets hurt. Recently what's happened is this phenomenon has become physically violent and people are dying because of this. About a year ago on a sunny afternoon after church, my son Caleb and his friend Ty came exploding into our house. And we were about to have dinner. And they were talking just a mile a minute. And that's not anything unusual at all. But they were very agitated and upset and even a little scared. And they just wanted to get our attention right away. And they told us of how on the way to church that morning, this lady, she tried to kill us, Dad. I don't even know what we did. Probably something. But this lady came up. She was honking her horn and swearing her head off and signing us. He didn't say that. And then she got right on her tail and she was following us. Scared us to death when she started following us and getting in front of us and slamming on her brakes. And it was incredibly frightening. And finally, we lost her. When she got in front of us, we turned off. And that was it. And I was still wondering. I mean, it happened in the morning. And sad to say, this kind of happens. So I'm surprised he's still kind of agitated about this after church. And so I said, what's the big deal? Well, here's the weird part, Dad. We got to church. Guess who we saw? Oh. I said, you mean she followed you to church? He goes, she goes to church. Here. By the way, he didn't know who you were. I don't know who you are, so it's okay. Busted. Wednesday afternoon, I was pulling out from a stop sign, turning right into a four-lane road. The car that had been about a quarter, half a block away, plenty of time for me to pull out. As soon as I pulled out, it sped up and got right on the rear end of my car. And at first, when it happened, I thought, well, man, alive. Was it right there? And it dawned on me. Now that car was way back, and it was like offended that I pulled out or something. I don't know, and got right up there and just stayed right on my bumper. Before I could think about anything, I felt something. The first thing I felt was love. yes I did you can feel the love in the room now the first thing the first thing I felt was that indignation, agitation hurt nation, ruination I mean I looked in a rear view mirror it was a kid It was a skinny kid. I could take this kid. Well, I'm ready to go. It's pitiful. Pastor Dave. Truth is, truth is, on this one, my anger did not last very long at all. I didn't yell, I didn't swear, I didn't sign. My wife would have been very proud. kind of let it go pretty quick but i did notice something about that little incident that lasted 15 seconds what i noticed was how strongly i felt and how quickly i felt it you see something inside of me had been tapped by this assault something that had already been there the car that came up on the rear bumper of my car did not bring. It tapped something that was already there. Here's the deal. Explosions of anger over relatively minor offenses are never about the offense itself. That offense merely triggered or accessed a vast supply of anger that many people carry around every single day. And in the normal ebb and flow of life, you would never know that the anger is there. Sometimes you, the carrier, aren't even aware of the anger that you have. But until some offense, some little thing, where nowhere else in your life were you allowed to get this out in a healthy way, this little minor thing comes and boom, this anger that has just been pooling goes there. And sometimes people get destroyed by it. You'll probably never murder anybody. But if you're honest at all with yourself, I think you will identify all of the ingredients there. And the ingredients aren't just saying raka or calling someone a fool. The ingredients are rage, malice, and contempt. Given the ingredients there, think about this. What might it take to mix those three things together just right, access them at just the right moment? What kind of thing that could produce? Some might want to let that in a little bit. Others might think, Dave, you're exaggerating. I mean, it's a good point. It's probably some good work. But still, the truth is, the commandment is don't murder. We're probably never going to murder anybody. Maybe act a little weird on the road. But here's the point. There's more than one way. to murder a human being. You can do it with a club. You can do it with a gun or a brick or a knife. You can even do it with a car. Or you can do it with a word or a gesture, even a look. Perfectly timed, dripping with sarcasm, full of contempt, driven by malice, drawn from a deep well of stored up anger, always at the ready. For three weeks in our study of the fifth commandment, We pressed the need for children to honor their parents. And we spent three weeks on that in light of the fact that because of how some parents behave, it's very difficult for some children to honor them. Take this next commandment and turn the tables just a bit. Consider now the power of a parent to, with a word, maybe many words, deeply wound the spirit of a child. Beyond wound, kill. the spirit of a child as effectively as if they had been shot with a gun. Please note, as I speak about words you use towards your children, it is not discipline that kills the spirit of a child. Even strict discipline does not do that. It is not saying no to them that wounds their soul. Even though when you say no to a child, they act as though you've just destroyed their life. giving them boundaries, consequences, and confrontations will not kill your children but contempt can and so can malice and so can the pool of rage that they tapped when they spilled the milk or scratched your car or interrupted your TV show or frustrated your plan you idiot how can you be so stupid can't you ever get it right you are such a loser. Now, let's say you're a parent who never, ever says, you've never in your life and never will call your son or daughter an idiot. Call them a loser. You don't need the word idiot or loser. You don't need to say raka or fool. The thing that kills the spirit is rage, contempt, and malice. And I promise you, with a smile on your face, you could communicate powerfully those three things. speaking of the power of contempt to kill the human spirit Dallas Willard says this contempt is a greater evil than anger for while unlike anger contempt involves a kind of studied for unlike anger contempt involves a studied degradation of another in anger I want to hurt you But in contempt, I don't care if I hurt you or not. You're not worthy of consideration one way or another. We can be angry at someone without denying their worth, but contempt degrades. Contemptuous actions and attitudes are a knife in the heart that permanently mutilates the soul. The intent of contempt is always to exclude, push away, and leave out. How often we see it in the schoolyard, at a party, even in the home or in the church sanctuary. That contempt is so common does not ease its destructiveness. In many professional circles and high society, where one might hope for the highest moral sensitivity, contempt is a fine art. Practicing it is even a part of being in good standing. Not to know whom and how to despise is one of the surest signs that you're not quite with it and are yourself mildly contemptible. Contempt has the power to stab the soul to its core and to deflate its power of life. It can hurt so badly and destroy so deeply that physical murder would almost be a mercy. End quote. Just so you have a hook to hang what I'm talking about on this morning, let me just give you two kinds of murder. I've already given them to you. The first we'll call murder Minneapolis style. Now, with sincere apologies to anyone who lives in Minneapolis, I want this to simply stand as an analogy of blatant, obvious, physical murder, the kind that we read about in the papers every day. You know, when I was studying this, I went into my garage and got into the recycling of the paper and pulled all of the papers out of the last week to try to get some illustrations around this. And I got so much stuff that I had to eliminate global, so I'm not going to talk about genocide. I had to eliminate national. That was just too overwhelming. Just local. Not even a whole week of media reports on murder. Just one day, the Metro section, Star Tribune, I believe I drew this out of Tuesday's paper, just the headlines in the Metro section. Body found in trunk of car. Girls bruised body leads to murder charges. Suspect charged in death of man at saloon. Suspects wanted in baseball bat murder. Mother, boyfriend, accused of abuse, found in autopsy, murder charges pending. A chance encounter leads to rape and murder of 13-year-old girl. Community members meet to discuss recent killings and rape. That's not global. That's not national. That's local. That's not a whole week. That's just one day, and that's what got in the paper. Murder Minneapolis style doesn't just happen in Minneapolis. I'm using it as an analogy, but it's the kind of murder that appalls us, that frightens us, that makes us want to move to a safer place, and it's the kind of murder that we would never do. What is wrong with those people? Well, something horribly is wrong with them. But there's another kind of murder. I'll call it murder suburban style. With sincere apologies to everyone who lives in the suburbs. Let this kind of murder stand as an analogy of subtle, well-manicured, nice-looking, malice and contempt that can kill the human spirit. It's really interesting. I discovered this week that there is a Jewish tradition that teaches that embarrassing someone in public is among the greatest sins among traditional Jews. Here's how it works. When people get embarrassed, they turn red. No real harm there. It's embarrassing. You don't like it. But maybe there wasn't any malice intended. But when embarrassment turns to shame, people become ashen. They turn white. Jewish tradition looked at this phenomena and commented that the whitening of the face was the result of blood leaving the face. You know, when you get embarrassed, blood comes to the face. When it's really bad, it leaves the face, and it is comparable in the Jewish mind to the shedding of blood. It's called murder, assault. Dr. Laura Schlesinger, in her, I think, wonderful new book, The Ten Commandments, comments on that tradition with these insights. One could argue that unlike gossip, which is done behind one's back, publicly embarrassing someone is acceptable to some because it's done with the person present, and at least he can defend himself. If gossip can be compared to a burglary when no one is home, then public embarrassment is like armed robbery. The words used are like bullets aimed at the heart. Many of us have been in the position where having the earth swallow us whole seemed a more welcome experience than the shame and humiliation felt at the hands of another through public embarrassment. Let's talk about gossip. That's another way to murder suburban style, to assassinate character with words. Spread when the person doesn't even know you're spreading them. When no one's clarifying the truth, impressions are formed, character is assassinated. Morgan Blake, writer for the Atlanta Journal, said of Gossip This, I am more deadly than the screaming shell of a howitzer. I win without killing. I tear down homes, break hearts, and wreck lives. I travel on the wings of the wind. No innocence is strong enough to stop me. No purity can daunt me. I have no regard for the truth, but I love half-truth. I have no respect for justice, no mercy for the defenseless. My victims are as numerous as the sands of the sea and often as innocent. I never forget. I seldom forgive. My name is gossip, slander, and rumor. And gossip can take without just cause the life of an innocent. It's called murder. James said it this way in chapter 3, verse 6. We spent six weeks on this one verse a little over a year ago. The tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity. The tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body and sets on fire the course of our life. It is a restless evil and full of, key words, deadly poison. Deadly poison kills people. See, here's the deal. There's more than one way to murder a human being. thou shalt not murder literally means you shall not take without just cause the life of an innocent whatever else this means whatever else this commandment says or does it does this it reveals the heart of God for his creation for people and hear this ringing through this commandment and the protection for people that is inherent in it, people, all people, matter to God. We have been made in the image of God, and here is what murder does. Whether it be with a gun or with a word, it strikes at the very image of God. We are not merely well-developed protoplasm. Every human being is unique in their essence, And the reason we know that is because of Genesis 2, verse 7, where it says this, God breathed into their nostrils the soul of life, and man became a living creature, more than an animal inhabiting a soul. C.S. Lewis says it this way, and if you've been kind of fading out with my talk here, I would call you back in to have your senses sharpened, to listen to this passage carefully. it is a serious thing he says to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses small g there to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day in heaven be a creature which if you could see it now you would strongly be tempted to worship there are no ordinary people you have never spoken to a mere mortal nations, cultures, art and civilizations these are mortal and their life is to our lives as the life of a gnat but it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit this does not mean that we are to be perpetually solemn we must play but our merriment must be of that kind which exists between people who have from the outset taken each other seriously no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption and our charity must be a real and costly love with deep feeling for the sins in spite of which we love the sinner no mere tolerance or indulgence which parodies love as flippancy parodies merriment next to Christ himself your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses if he or she is your Christian neighbor he is holy in almost the same way. For in him also Christ resides. End quote. When this thing began to come clear to me, it dawned on me that this commandment, you shall not murder, in the end, is more than a prohibition against. It is a call to love. For the fact is this, If I love you, I might confront you. I might disagree with you. I might even discipline someone that I profoundly love. But if I'm acting out of love, it's hard to imagine taking any delight or having any desire to humiliate them, to seize the moment, knowing that people are watching, and I could say something that would reduce them to nothing, to go ahead with that urge if I'm living out of love. And if you're living out of love, if you really are there, you don't even need this commandment. I can't imagine lying about you or slandering you, despising you or treating you with contempt. It's hard to imagine if I loved you, murdering you. for some this word from Exodus chapter 20 might be simply a call even a reminder to do 1 Corinthians 14 1 pursue love you may be in a real significant way already operating out of love and this just kind of reminds you of that and calls you deeper into it. For others, a word like this can be a powerful confrontation on your lack of love. For full of contempt and malice, you have slaughtered people, maybe even friends, maybe even spouses, maybe even children, maybe even parents. If that is how the Spirit of God is bringing this word to you, then I would call you to repentance. And in your repentance, delightfully, I would offer to you amazing grace. For still others, a word like this has stirred your need not for repentance, but for healing. In fact, beyond healing, you're beyond woundedness. You've been slaughtered by words spoken. You need resurrection. For you have been, by another's anger, contempt, and malice, murdered. If that is true of you, I would strongly encourage you before you leave to come to the prayer team for prayer. Let me close with this. Do you remember the purpose of the law? I gave you that the first two weeks we began this series on the Ten Commandments. There are four purposes of the law. The first is this, to reveal sin, to expose it for what it is. And that's exactly what Jesus did in Matthew 5. You've heard murder's bad, everybody agrees. Well, I'm not a murderer. Well, let's talk about your anger. Let's talk about your malice, and let's talk about your contempt. And all of that, what it does, it's using the law to reveal, oh boy, I don't have it in my hand, but it's in my heart. Second purpose of the law, after that sin is revealed, is to bring us to brokenness, where we recognize, I can't by myself just wave a magic wand and get rid of this. I can maybe act happy for a while, but this pool of anger is still here. I can't get rid of this. Purpose of the law, reveal your sin. Number two, produce brokenness. Number three, Galatians 4, the purpose of the law was to drive us to Christ, who is our only hope, so that we could now be justified and forgiven by faith, not by our performance of the law. But the fourth purpose of the law was after we've been driven to Christ and received grace and healing and hope. The fourth purpose of the law is then to turn around and call us to the fullness of our life in Christ, To call us to a higher place, to a kingdom living perspective. Its purpose in this prohibition of murder is to call us to a life of love. My prayer is this. That the law of God, spoken from this pulpit this morning, would do its work in God's children's hearts. Revealing sin. Breaking arrogance. Driving us back to grace. And calling us into love and true spirit-born holiness. I'd like you to stand as we close. altar team I'm going to ask you to come and take your place even as I pray father your law is good it's life to us it on one hand doesn't let us get away with anything that is going to kill or destroy us or other people it exposes the realities of our heart and that's a painful thing but you don't leave us there you offer us grace when we repent and we're grateful for that. But this law also calls us to deeper things and higher things and kingdom ways of living that creates an atmosphere where it's safe to live. God, even if there were no other motivation, may it be that we would together move toward things like this because we dream of being in a place, in a community of people, where it really was safe, where we weren't going to get murdered, humiliated. gossiped about pray in your name that your kingdom around this word would come give healing where that's necessary bring repentance where that's necessary bathe the whole thing in grace in jesus name amen
