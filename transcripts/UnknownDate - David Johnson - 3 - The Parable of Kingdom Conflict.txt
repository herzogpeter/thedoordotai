We're dealing, as you know, in a section of Scripture, Matthew 13, that is called the Kingdom Parables, the mysteries of the Kingdom revealed. It all began in Matthew chapter 13, verse 1, where Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea, and great multitudes gathered to him, so that he got into a boat and sat down and the whole multitude was standing on the beach listening to him and he spoke many things to them in parables. We found out over the last couple of weeks that a parable is simply a teaching device that Jesus uses whereby he takes what is physical, visible, and natural like a field or a seed or a farmer and then he lays it alongside something that is spiritual, supernatural, and invisible and he uses the physical extended into the spiritual to teach the spiritual truth. The parable we dealt with last week was the parable of the sower and the seed. And the sower in the field was Christ. Remember that? But it wasn't just Christ. It was also the disciples, and he was preparing them for their ministry in the field of the kingdom of God. And the seed was the word of the kingdom, and everything that was pertaining to the life of the kingdom and the power of the kingdom was what was planted into the field. And then the field was the hearts of men and women. And some of them were hard, and some of them had hidden hardness, and some of them were full of weeds, and some of them were open and ready to receive the word of the kingdom. And in those hearts, life was born. Today we're going to deal with three parables. The parable of the wheat and the tares, the parable of the mustard seed, and the parable of the leaven. That is a lot to bite off on one Sunday. But as we go through the text, I think it's going to become apparent to you why it is that we have to take all three, and we really do. We're going to cover a section from verse 24 to 43, but I'm only going to read as we begin through verse 30 to set the stage. Let's read it together. Jesus then presented another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and then he went away. And when the wheat sprang up and bore grain, then the tares became evident also, and the slaves of the landowner came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares? And he said to them, An enemy has done this. And the slaves said to him, Do you want us then to go and gather them up? But he said, No, lest while you are gathering up the tares, you might root up the wheat with them. Allow, rather, both of them to grow together until the harvest. And in the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers, Go and gather up the tares, bind them in bundles to burn them up, but gather the wheat into my barn. And so we have the parable of the wheat and the tares. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I thank you for the work of your spirit already evident in this time. Evident to my heart through the worship. And I thank you and I was thanking you even as we worship for the precious word of God that reveals your character. It reveals your kingdom. It reveals such powerful truth about who you are and it's so encouraging. And I pray that the power of your spirit would be released among us right now for ears to hear and eyes to see, hearts to respond. Do your work among us for the sake of the kingdom and in the name of Jesus. Amen. I'm going to break the text into four parts. The first part that I want to deal with doesn't really have anything to do specifically with the text. It doesn't draw from the text. But our understanding of the entire text is contingent on our understanding of the first point. And that first point is an understanding of the disciples' theology of the kingdom. We're going to come to understand why that's important. but the reason Jesus gave the parables was because the disciples had a faulty view of the kingdom. I'll explain that in a minute. The second thing we're going to deal with this morning is after we understand the disciples' theology, we're going to see the parable that he gives as a delivering of stark reality about the kingdom to the disciples. Here are some hard truth, disciples, that you need to know. You thought the kingdom was going to be that way that you're living in, but the kingdom that I'm bringing and the one you're going to have to function in is going to be this way. So there's going to be some hard reality. The third thing, however, he's going to give them is some profound encouragement. A profound encouragement, and that's going to come from the mustard seed and from the leaven. And the fourth is going to be a future promise that we need to embrace about the kingdom, and that's going to come in verse 39 through 43. Let's just begin to do our work. The first thing we need to know when it sets the stage for our understanding of why Jesus even taught the parable of the wheat and the tares is an understanding of the disciples' theology about the kingdom of God. Let me explain a little bit about what their theology was. Their understanding of the kingdom came entirely from biblical prophecy in the Old Testament. And their understanding was accurate as it was portrayed to them in the Old Testament. What they expected was a Messiah who was going to come in power and glory and authority and was going to establish his kingdom on earth forever when he came. They did not have any concept at all of the church age. of what is now referred to in Matthew. In fact, it's referred to in Matthew 35 as the mystery period. I'm going to open my mouth in parables and I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world. This whole church age where the kingdom comes in power, but it isn't here in culmination. What they were anticipating with the coming of the Messiah was the culmination of the kingdom where all sin would be eradicated. All evil would be done away with. Some of their perception of the kingdom coming did indeed have spiritual elements. Like I just said, when the king comes, and the Messiah comes and he will be the son of David. He is going to eradicate sin, pain, death, disease. It's all going to be gone and that will be glory for us. It also had a nationalistic flavor to it. They had very much what was called a Davidic concept of the kingdom. A Davidic concept of the kingdom is this. The good old days were when David reigned as king in Israel. Remember them? Those were the good old days and we yearn for those. And as soon as David ceased to be king, at the end of Solomon's reign, the kingdoms were torn asunder. And ever since then, the men and women of God have been pleading for the time when the kingdom would be restored. And so some of their view of the kingdom and the Messiah who would bring it was a spiritual one, no more evil, no more pain, no more death, no more sin, but also nationalistic. Israel is going to be restored to its former glory by this son of David. And they got that from Ezekiel, and they got that from Isaiah and all the prophets who spoke of a kingdom where the rebels would be demolished and the rejecters would be dealt with and evil pain would be gone forever and the kingdom would be brought by the greater son of David, Isaiah would say, the anointed one of God. When Jesus came on the scene, the disciples believed with everything they had that he really was. This is the guy. He is the anointed one. He is the son of David, the greater son of David. And so all of their anticipation, and you even need to understand this because some of their confusion about this guy came from their understanding of the kingdom. He's going to bring it all. With that in mind, come with me to the scene where Jesus is healing people. He heals a leper. My view of the kingdom is when the Messiah comes, he's going to heal all disease, not just a leper, and he heals the leper. He reaches out his hand, he touches a leper. Right before their eyes, he gets healed. The disciples are in the back going, He's going to do it now. It's coming now. It's all going to come. Let's look around. everybody else being here? Why isn't everybody? Why just him? And then, you see, they would deal with the Gadarene demoniac. Remember that? And he'd be coming off a hill and he'd be slashing himself with knives and wanting to kill everybody around him. And with a word, the demons were cast out and the disciples are going, again, with their view of the kingdom, he's going to do it now. This is it. He's been kind of dinking around for a while, but he's really going to bring it here. He's going to go over the edge and the whole kingdom is going to come. This is what we've been waiting for. This is what we were taught. He really is the one, but he'd always back off, and he didn't bring it fully. He'd cast out a demon. He'd exercise authority. What do you think they thought when he calmed the storm? Peace be still. This is the one. No more earthquakes, no more famine, no more tornadoes. The kingdom's coming, and he'd back off. And by the way, I don't know how to communicate this, but in his exercising power, but not eradicating evil in its entirety, was he was giving them a picture of the kingdom that he was bringing. Even just by doing that, the disciples didn't get it. One of the constant things the disciples would ask all through the Gospels was this, you're going to do it now? You're going to do it now? Is this the time? But something very troubling happened in Jesus' ministry with them. Rather than speaking of what he was going to do to the rebels and what he was going to do to the rejecters, they heard him begin to talk about what the rejecters and the rebels were going to do to him. I don't like this talk. This doesn't fit in the plan, Jesus. And rather than talking about how he was going to mete out justice and kill all the bad guys, he started talking about how the bad guys were going to kill him. And when they started talking about his death, Peter said, no way. Now, I've always had an understanding of Peter's not wanting Jesus to die and saying, you can't die, as number one is ignorance, because he didn't understand the plan of redemption, but two, his love for Jesus. I just don't want you to die. I've got to add to that his kingdom view. His kingdom view was that the Messiah would come on a white horse, bring it all, fully established, no more sin, no more pain. You're going to do it now. You're going to do it now. Every miracle they thought it would happen. Now he talks about his death. It's going to ruin the whole thing. right up to the triumphant entry. Remember that? The palm branches being put in front of him. People saying, Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna, Hosanna. The disciples' blood is pumping. Their hearts are pounding. This is it. This is really it. He's going to do it now. It looks exactly the way I pictured it, except for the donkey. It looks exactly the way I pictured it. I don't get the donkey part. Are you going to do it now? And right in the middle of the triumphant entry, he ruins the whole thing by saying, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it abides alone and there isn't any fruit. And you don't understand the kingdom that I'm bringing. I'm going to have to die so that I can rise again, so that there can be born fruit, and you are the fruit. I am the first fruit. And if I don't die, that's not going to happen. So he spoke of his death. And the disciples were confused because they were waiting for his ascension and they were waiting for the culmination. And this is going to be great. Is this going to be some party today? In fact, you need to know that their misunderstanding and their confusion went even past the resurrection to the ascension. In Acts chapter 1, verses 6 through 8, The disciples are gathered around Jesus, the resurrected Christ, and they say to him this. I don't know, I wonder if Jesus got tired of this, because you've got to know, after we're done with Matthew, we're going to know how often Jesus taught about the real nature of the kingdom. And after all his teaching on the real nature of the kingdom, they still ask this question. You're going to do it now? Is it at this time that you're going to restore the kingdom to Israel? You're going to do it now? And Jesus said in verse 7, it is not for you to know the times and the epics. In other words, no, I'm not going to do what you expect now. And then he says something incredibly powerful in verse 8. But while you want me to bring it all now, I'm not going to do that. But you shall receive power. After that, the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you're going to be my witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea and the uttermost parts of the earth. And all through the book of Acts, we have the cataloging of the power of God and the power of the kingdom because the power was released, but it isn't here in its fullness. By the way, when I stumbled on that verse as it related to the disciples' theology, Acts 1, 6 through 8, it put into clear focus what I was trying to say a couple of weeks ago. Do you remember that? I kind of gave as an introduction some faulty views of the kingdom. There are people today who believe and have a theology that the kingdom of God has come and it's here in its fullness. It's the name it and claim it thing. I'm not going to go deeply into it, but it's here and you just claim it and it's all here. Well, I really have the same heart you have, and the disciples had that heart. They wanted it all here now, but it's not true. It is no. It is not for you to know. That is not for now. But then I talked about another group of people. We call them the dispensationalists. That's because they call themselves that. So I called them that. And that's a group of people who says the kingdom isn't here at all. I mean, the kingdom came with Jesus, and the power of the kingdom was there, but when he left, he took it with him. So you are on your own, folks. Remember that? Here's the balance right there. Is it for today? Are you going to do it now? Verse 7, no. Verse 8, but you shall receive power. When the Holy Spirit comes on you to do the work of the kingdom, but it is going to be a war and it's going to be a conflict. The disciples thought it was going to be here. Oh, wonderful. Isn't it great? And so in light of their faulty, literally faulty theology on the kingdom, Jesus gives this parable. And the parable of the wheat and the tares is, among other things, an effort on the part of Jesus to straighten out the theology of the kingdom for the disciples. And I think you can probably understand why it's so important. If they go into their kingdom work believing all sin's gone, all pain's gone, all evil's gone, no more struggle, everything's going to be great, and then they run into evil, sin, pain, and suffering, they're going to get knocked right off their horse. And so Jesus, point number two, gives them a heavy dose of stark reality and hard truth in this parable that we call the parable of the wheat and the tares. We're going to do just what we did last week. In point number two, we're going to lay out the physical, then lay it next to the spiritual. The physical is revealed in verse 24. He presented another parable. The kingdom of heaven may be compared, or it looks just like this. This is what it's going to flesh out to be like. It's compared to a man who sows good seed in his field. Stop right there. Only thing I want you to note and file it for later is this. It's his field. Underline his if you mark your Bible. He owns it. He grooms it. It belongs to him. He has a right to do with it what he wants. But, and also he sows good seed. He sows good seed. But while the men were sleeping, his enemy came. There's a couple things I want you to note about that before we even lay aside anything spiritual. The enemy came in the night while everyone was sleeping. It was not inappropriate for them to be sleeping. At night, that's what you do. That's the appropriate thing. The work of the enemy was purposeful. It was behind the back. It was intentional. It was malicious. It could not have been prevented. Hear this. And again, it may not make sense right now, but as we make connections later, it'll start to click. The fact that tares get sown in the field is not due to the negligence of the owner. It is due to the malice and the hatred of the enemy. You got that? You need to know that. And what that enemy did was he sowed tares among the wheat. He sowed tares among the wheat. The word among there in the Greek is in the emphatic. And what that means is, simply put, he really got them among them, right in there. Picture is this. A man sows a field. He fills that field with seed. In the night when no one's looking maliciously, the enemy comes and over-sows, is literally what that word means, and that works for me. He over-sows, which means two things. he sows on top of the seed that the good owner gave. He sows on top of it, but to oversow also means he put more bad seed in than there was good seed. That's an evil thought, but that's what that means. So you got the owner sowing in the field, the evil one coming behind there and oversowing right among everything that was done. Let me tell you a little bit about tares. In that day, they were called Darnells. I've always thought of these things as weeds, and I've even preached this text as weeds among the wheat. But they aren't weeds. What they are is a form of a hybrid of corn, and they are noxious. Indeed, they are poisonous. It isn't just a weed that would choke off life. It is something that can take life. So it offered nourishment and it offered life. Does that sound like anything you know about? Something that offers life, something that makes promises, something that says, I'm going to make you better, I'm going to give you good life, I'm going to make you happy. That's what sin does. But what it is, is it is noxious, and it is poisonous, and it steals life. By the way, this whole concept of sowing, over-sowing an enemy in a field was common enough in Palestine. I mean, I don't know of any farmers who've had to deal with that, you know. But in Palestine, that concept was common enough that there was an actual law against it, and it was a very severe punishment if you were caught doing it. The reason someone would do that would be for jealousy, one, for revenge, or for just pure, unmitigated hatred. The reason it was good for revenge was this, that what darnels or tares, these poisonous things, would do in a field among wheat, it would defile the field. You can figure that. It would devalue the field. The wheat isn't worth as much. And it would also work against the purposes of the wheat. It's a defiled field when the Darnells are there. And then the slaves, in verse 27, come to the landowner, and this is kind of interesting. Sir, what I want you to catch here is the accusatory tone of this. Sir, did you not sow good seed? Didn't you feel? What are you doing? What kind of farmer are you anyway? How then does it have tares if you sowed all good things? I mean, what do you think? Somebody else is doing this? I'm going to give you an insight to where we're going with this that you need to catch right now. This little story of a farmer and seed, this parable is the attempt of Jesus to deal with and reveal from the mind of God the whole problem of evil. The slaves of the field come to God and say, Did you do this? Did you put this evil here? Did you put this sin here? Is it your fault that the women are scared to go downtown and park in a parking lot? What are you doing? What kind of God are you? Anyway, how come I'm dealing with little girls who are being sexually abused? This isn't right. What kind of seed did you sow anyway? How come people go through famine? How come people go through pain? I don't get this. Did you do that? The answer, no, an enemy has done this. You better know that. God, from the beginning, by the way, I can trace this parable in my mind all the way back to the garden where God planted life in the world, Adam and Eve. And it was good seed. And right after that, Satan oversowed. And he came in with sin and death and despair and disease and greed and envy and murder by chapter 2. And right after that, God sowed again with Abrahams and Isaacs and prophets and the kings and the word. and then Jesus and then us but Satan constantly oversows and God sows and Satan oversows and that's the pattern of life disciples I got ahead of myself again I can't help but make the applications right now stay in the physical here, okay well what do you want us to do, verse 28 how about if we go in there and judge him right now, rip him up Do you want us to do that? Gather them up right now. And Jesus, the farmer says, no, I don't want you to yank them up. I don't want you to nail them yet. There is a right time for that, and the right time is the harvest. Think about a field. If you go in there right now, you won't be able to tell which is which. Wait for the harvest. You need to know right now that what is wrong is going to be made right. What is evil is going to be destroyed. What is born of Satan is going to be bound up and burned. But you're going to have to wait. the slaves didn't understand i'm sure when he said in verse 30 allow both of them to grow until the harvest in the same way and in that time we're going to gather it all up and the slaves might have looked at the field and gone oh man this is frustrating i look at the field and even their frustration might even be because they love the owner and this is his field and he's getting a bad rap think about that all the people are walking around the field going boy he don't know how to do his field, that's for sure. Look at it, it's a mess. Look at that world. You're just going to have to wait for the harvest and you're going to have to trust me that I know what I'm doing because at that time I'm going to gather it and we're going to make it right. But you have to wait. Let's make the connections while I do this. Hope you're not offended. If you are offended, it doesn't matter. I'm doing it anyway. let's make the connections verse 37 he starts connecting all these things verse 36 actually he left the multitudes and went into the house and his disciples came to him and they said explain to us the parable of the tares in the field and he answered and said it's very simple the one who sows the good seed is the son of man the son of man is Jesus and the field is the world. Couldn't be much more clear, could it? The field is the world. And as for the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom. The children of the kingdom. Back off for a minute and get that picture. The sower in the field is Jesus. The field that he's working in is the world. That's an awful big picture. In my mind, I kind of have a globe or something and he's walking across the globe. And the thing that really exhilarates me, and I want this to get in your spirit somehow, is the seed that he's planting into this world is you, and it's me, the children of the kingdom. And again, now I want to kick you back into the parable we talked about last week to put this whole thing together. What happened last week was the sower was Christ. The sower then would be the disciples. The sower would be anybody who's spreading the word of the kingdom because that was the seed, remember that? And the word of the kingdom fell on your heart, and it fell on other people's hearts. And the heart that you had was good soil. It was broken. It was ready. It was receptive. And so it is that that seed of the word of the kingdom bore life. And that life was eternal life and regenerated life. And now it says here that what Jesus does with that reborn seed is he takes that seed and now he becomes the sower and the field is no longer the hearts of men. The field is the world and he takes regenerated people and he implants them into the world to infect the world, to permeate the world, to bring the kingdom to the world. God is the owner of the field it's his world he owns it he goes through filling it with you and me but the problem is this Satan has oversown everything that God's done and Satan continually oversows everything that God does every work of God that begins in his life Satan will come and oversow it every work of God that even happens in the context of this church as God begins to move and he sows that which is good and that which is life and that which is real, you can know that right behind that the enemy is going to come and oversow. He's going to oversow and seek to defile the work of God. He always has. He always will. That's the pattern of life. And what the enemy has sowed in this world is noxious, it's poisonous, it's sin, it's pain, it's death, it's evil. And again, as I said before, that cycle began in the garden. and at that point the field was defiled, spoiled, it got hard and pain entered. And the servants of the owner and the servants of God cry, how long is this going to happen? And I've gone over this already, but get this again. The servants of God who look at the world, those of you who are involved in people's lives and you see the pain of their lives and you see the pain of your own life and one of the things you cry is like the disciples, you go, God, if this kingdom is real, why is there pain. I don't get it. And we cry, God, bring your kingdom. Bring your power. Establish it forever. Even so, Lord, come quickly, because I can't hardly handle it. The tares are everywhere what Satan has sown. Satan has sown things in my family. He's sown things in our church. He's sown things everywhere. Let's do it now. Let's get the judgment over with. Let's bring justice. When are we going to see justice. And again, my heart cries with what we've even been seeing in the paper lately with people who can't feel safe to go into a parking ramp and little kids who get abused and, wow, what is this? What are you doing in your field? Did you do that? No, an enemy has done this. An enemy has done this. Now, you might not believe that, but you better know that that is what the Bible says. That is what the Bible says. you know what even Romans 8 28 says that all creation the world the earth groans and suffers pangs of childbirth waiting for its redemption earthquakes famine tornadoes is the earth groaning God and the earth itself is saying Lord how long is this going to go on this field has been defiled. Satan has oversown the good things that you sowed in the garden. But the word is wait. The word is wait. Because you may pull up some that are real. You might pull up some that are wheat. And you don't have the insight and the wisdom to bring the judgment of God on people. You just don't have it. You're going to have to wait like a field, a servant looking at a field, wondering what in the world is going on. You're just going to have to wait until the harvest. And the owner is the one who determines that. Now, this whole concept of being rooted up as it relates to spiritual things and terrors and pain in the world and judgment that needs to come so that people can live in peace. Why, he says, don't yank them up. I can't say that I really got a clear thing on that. I'll share with you my ideas on that. One possible idea about that came through the study that I did this weekend and it was that we could get a picture of why that's a dangerous thing historically. Now, I don't have a present-day equivalent to that right now. Maybe there is one, but it's not coming to me. But one way to look at that is in the Crusades. Remember that? The Inquisitions, where people in the name of God decided, I'm going to bring the judgment of God on people. And they started yanking people up and nailing people to crosses and burning them at the stake in the name of God. I don't know if you've ever heard stories like this, but even Hitler's Holocaust against the Jews, they tell stories. I think this came from Corrie Ten Boom of Jews who would look at these soldiers, And some of them had belt buckles that said, Jesus is Lord. In the name of God, we're going to get rid of these people and bring the judgment of God. Because we know who the tares are. Don't you do that. You are not the judge. You do not bring the judgment of God in the world. Your job is to be wheat. You let the harvester take care of that. There's another reason why I think he says, wait. And I think that has to do with his mercy and his grace. Every parable at some point breaks down. And this is where this parable breaks down. What I mean is this. It's real clear you've either got darnels, tares, or you've got wheat. The truth about redemption is this. Every one of you wheat one time were dead in your sin. You were a tare. And the mercy and the grace of God says, Wait, because you don't know which one of those darnels, which one of those tares are going to become regenerated by the power of God, by the permeating work of the kingdom, and turn some of those tares, those works of the enemy, into works of God. So you wait. Don't you act as judge. You don't know what you're doing. So wait. And you might look at that field and get frustrated and angry and have questions you don't understand, and you might even get mad at God and saying, why do you allow that stuff? And the word is wait. Okay, I need to back off. I'll give you a break anyway. You need a break. I need to do some counter-teaching here on the field and the sower and the seed. The reason I need to do some counter-teaching is because there is a real common interpretation of this passage that renders the whole thing to being something that happens exclusively in the church. In other words, God comes to the church and he brings his redeemed. And he establishes those who are real in Jesus and that's the we. But then Satan comes, the enemy comes into the church because the concept is the field is the kingdom. The field is the church. And there are then false believers in the body. And in fact, at the beginning of the week and as I was preparing this, I was kind of pulling out my Ishmael Isaac verses, you know what I mean? Ishmael was the one born of the Spirit, Isaac was the one... No, I got that wrong. Hey, Isaac, forget it. There was a good guy and there was a bad guy, right? Okay, Isaac was born of the Spirit, Ishmael was born of the flesh. They both call Abraham their father. They're not both real, you better know that. You need to know also that by way of principle, tares are sown among the flock. because wherever there's a work of God, Satan's going to oversew. But that concept that the wheat and tares are exclusively in the church is just not tenable. Number one, the text couldn't be more clear. The field is what? The world. The other thing that makes it untenable is verse 29 and 30 when he says, don't root it up. When you see something that isn't real, when you see something that isn't born of God, leave it alone for the harvest. That could possibly be referring to the church. Why is that? What is the church supposed to do when it sees sin in the church, immorality in the church, defilement in the church? Just wait for judgment. Well, okay, I know that's going on over there, but we will just wait for God. No, you cut out the leaven, 1 Corinthians 5. You discipline sin, Matthew 18. And if you don't do that, by the way, church, now I'm talking to the church, judgment's going to come on you. Incredible balance for that. I've got a lot of teaching here. It's 1 Corinthians chapter 5. I already mentioned, Paul is dealing in 1 Corinthians 5 about the leaven that infected the body. And the leaven in this particular situation was sexual immorality. And when that was allowed to stay there, it just began to defile the whole body like leaven, permeating. But then he gave this word to them relative to whether or not they should judge it. Verse 9, he says, I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people. Remember that? I don't want you to do that. But I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world, with covetous swindlers, idolaters, because if you separated yourself from them, you'd have to go out of the world. And I am the sower. And the world is the field. And you are the seed. And I put you in the world. That's how we're going to reach the covetous, the swindlers, the liars. That's how we're going to get them, by putting you in among them. So I didn't mean for you to disassociate from them, you knuckleheads. That's what they're doing. But actually what I wrote was to not associate with a so-called brother, a pretender who was coming into the body going, I love Jesus and living in unbelievable sin, not wanting to repent what I want you to do with them if he should be an immoral person, covetous, idolater, reviler, a drunkard, swindler. Don't even eat with such a one. So what do you have to do judging outsiders? Nothing. That's God's job. You do deal with that in the church. So there's the balance. And I just want to clarify that relative to the exegesis of this text. The sower is God. The field is the world. The seed is the redeemed. And we've been planted in the world. And disciples, you need to have a word here. Your perception of the kingdom, no evil, no pain, all wonderful. But the evil one has come and sowed over what I have sowed. And you're going to have to be ready for that. Because in the middle of the power I give you, in the middle of the kingdom authority I give you, in the middle of the regenerating and healing and delivering power you experience, you are going to experience the enemy's work in your face all the time. I wonder if this is what Paul thought of at all when he was shipwrecked and hanging on a board for his life. And he was sitting there. If he didn't have a view of the kingdom that was this one, he could have sat there going, well, where's your kingdom now? I wasn't supposed to have any pain. And pain is part of life. And it's even in this kingdom age. Pull it all together. Pull it all together. Again, the sower is the son of man. The seed is the children of the kingdom, you and me. The field is the world, and we have been planted in the world. But the stark reality is that Satan has sown seed everywhere. His purpose is to usurp, defile, devalue, diminish, and destroy the field. The result of his oversawing is pain, sin, suffering. Every form of evil you see spreading on the news at 10 o'clock tonight. All of that is the oversowing of Satan. And into that pain and into that suffering and into that anguish, I have planted the seed of life that was born in you. I have planted you, wheat. I put you right in the middle of that. And the kingdom is within you. And wherever you are is the kingdom. And wherever you are is the power of the kingdom. And you're going to be put right in the middle of the junk, disciples. And if you don't know that, you're going to get knocked off. The hard truth is that there's going to be both. Is it going to come now fully? No, but you shall have power. After that, the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you'll be my witnesses. But you're going to have questions you can't answer, and you're going to have pain that follows you right to the grave sometimes. But you're wheat, and I plant you there. After the hard truth, he gives them a powerful encouragement. And I just trust that after you've even heard the hard word there about the pain, that you let your spirit open up to the incredible encouragement that he is bringing to them through the parable of the mustard seed and the leaven. And I even want to pray right now. I just feel this is the juicy stuff coming up, okay? Lord, I feel tired in my body, and I pray in Jesus' name that you would overcome that, and not even that I wouldn't feel tired, but that your word would not return void, and that, Father, you would bring the encouragement that belongs in this text to people's hearts. I pray that be a supernatural work of your spirit. Amen. Here's the encouragement. while there is pain everywhere and sin everywhere and it feels overwhelming and you feel insignificant and you feel like there's nothing you could say or do to make a difference in this messed up world the kingdom of God is like a mustard seed which a man took and he sowed in his field just like the father and Jesus sowed you in the field of all this pain and that seed is the smallest of all seeds insignificant seed you little children of wheat children of God insignificant, smaller than all the other seeds, but when it was full grown, it's larger than the garden plants, and it becomes a tree. Let me tell you a little bit about a mustard seed. It is the smallest of all seeds as it relates to a crop-bearing plant. It is not the smallest of all seeds of every seed. There are other seeds that are smaller, but as far as a seed that would bear some sort of a fruit, something you could eat or use, this is the smallest seed, and it isn't a tree. It's a bush. The bush, however, grows in some instances so large that you could ride a horse under it and be on it. It has branches. It looks like a tree, but it isn't a tree. It's a bush. And it's so big, this bush, it does what bushes don't do. I mean, it's big enough and its branches are firm enough that birds can come and nest in it and make its home there. What does that mean? well I'm not all sure but I have some ideas about that Daniel 10 gives us some idea and Daniel 10 Nebuchadnezzar who was the emperor or the ruler of the Babylonian empire had a dream and the dream was of a huge tree that reached to the heavens and then the branches reached all to the ends of the earth and he went to Daniel and he said Daniel I had this weird dream what is this dream about and Daniel said that dream is a picture of the Babylonian empire and the Babylonian empire is so big and your influence is so great that it reaches to the heavens and it reaches to the ends of the earth and birds come and make their nest in it. And the birds referred to people that weren't necessarily part of Babylon. You understand that? Birds from other areas would come and nest in the shade and the sustenance that Babylon gave and they would be nurtured. The kingdom of God is like that. It is so big and it starts so small and it gets so big that birds can come who aren't even connected to the kingdom. they aren't even committed to the kingdom but they find shade they get blessed by the kingdom think about that for a minute as it relates to you as it relates to our church the kingdom of God maybe looks real insignificant but you need to know something that the kingdom is so powerful that as it grows and grows and grows and grows people who aren't even connected get blessed by it and they don't even know it you go into your job tomorrow morning you know what you bring with you? the kingdom of God and that little insignificant you can grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and before you know it, people find shade in you. The kingdom that's in you. And this little church has been planted in new hope and we bring blessing to this place that we don't even know. I could make it even bigger than that. Some argue that this even speaks to why America has been blessed to a certain degree. Now, I'm not naive enough to call America a Christian nation anymore, but it was founded that way and there are still influences like that. And people have been able to get blessed, even in America, by the power and the work of God in this nation. I just came from a land called Haiti, where voodoo and Satan is worshipped, and I can tell you what lives in their branches, nothing. There's nothing alive there. Just a thought about that. That's what that means. But what is the encouragement? What's the word? The encouragement to you and to the disciples is this, in spite of all that Satan sows and all the pain that he inflicts, and how insignificant you feel. The kingdom of God is like a little insignificant seed, but it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and all that Satan can plant and all that Satan can throw and all that he can do cannot stop it ever. Can't stop it. Can't stop it. It grows and grows. In fact, you want to get the big picture, it started real small. It started with a little manger and a bunch of cows and donkeys and pigs and whatever and a real bad smell and it grew, didn't it? It grew and it grew and it grew and it grew and it started with 12 motley guys, few in number, weak, slow in faith, slow in understanding. And it grew and it grew and it grew and it grew and even after the resurrection, it says in Acts 1.15 there was only 120 people who believed, who were there after the resurrection, but something happened after that and that was this, the Spirit came and the Spirit of God infected those 120 people and those 120 people then became the seed that God began to plant around the world. And what happened? With an insignificant start, the kingdom of God, like a mustard seed, tiny little thing, grew and grew and grew and grew and all that Satan throws can't stop it. That's what you're a part of. That's what you're a part of. Think about it personally. I've done that this week and I enjoyed that. It was a good feeling. Let this bless you. Make this your testimony. I've made it mine. 27 years ago, an 8-year-old boy named David Johnson and knelt at the side of his father's bed, and asked Jesus into his heart. I don't even remember what I said. It was probably stupid. Probably something like, please forgive my sin. I don't want to go to hell. Okay? I didn't know anything then compared to what I know now. I didn't enjoy anything then compared to what I know now. But you know what the kingdom of God is? It's a little seed. And it gets planted in an eight-year-old boy's heart. And you know what it does? It grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and nothing can stop it. not even adolescents. Maybe that will encourage some of you parents. But disciples, you need to know that. I'm about to leave. I'm about to die. You've got this goofy idea about the kingdom being rosy and no pain. You better be ready for the pain, but nothing can stop it. The kingdom, nothing. I rode home from the baptism service Wednesday night with my boy Caleb. We go in two different cars, and everybody wanted to go with Mom that day. And I had Caleb, and we drove home, and Caleb started talking to me about baptism. And he wanted to know what he had to do to be baptized, and he wants Joyce to do it. But I started sharing with him what baptism is about, how it's an outward expression of an inward condition that we've been raised to newness of life and that God gives us a new heart and forgives our sins and we become part of the family of God and we get entered into the kingdom of God. And I said it in as simple terms as I could and he was real embarrassed and he told me that he wanted to do that. So we prayed a prayer. He even repeated after me. And I said, ask him to forgive your sin, Caleb. And he said, I ask you to forgive my sin. Ask him to come into your heart. And I told him earlier about getting a new heart too. I said, ask him to come into your heart. And so he did in his own little way. It was just great. And then we were all done, and he said amen. And then he looked at me and he goes, what about the new heart part? Am I going to get a new heart here? So then we went on and prayed a little more, and he asked God to give him a new heart. And it was pretty childish, that whole thing. It was pretty silly, pretty stupid, pretty insignificant, wouldn't you say? Even I, as I was evaluating it later, you know, I even told him what to say. What is that? But I know his heart was into that. But you know what that is? That's the seed. That's a little seed. That's a little seed. You know what the kingdom of God is like? The kingdom of God is like the smallest of all seeds. But the kingdom of God that gets planted in the heart of an eight-year-old boy grows and grows and grows and grows and grows and grows and grows. And one day I got a vision that people are going to get shade in that little kid's life. That's what I think. Birds are going to come and be able to be in him and wonder why they feel good around him. That's what I think. So there. Why did he get so upset all of a sudden? He's so weird. That's what the kingdom is. And so be encouraged, disciples. Hang on. It is going to be tough. Your Pollyanna view of the kingdom is not an accurate one. Tears are everywhere, but the power is on you too. And the kingdom you're a part of will never end. Not only is it like a mustard seed, it's like leaven. It's like leaven. And the aspect of leaven you need to know about is that leaven permeates. Now, leaven in other places of the Bible is used to speak of sin. And that's why some people misinterpret the passage again, because they have this idea the only way leaven is used is negatively. The truth is, in real life, the only way that leaven is used is positively. Leaven has a positive effect on the bread. It makes it taste better. It gives it better texture. It makes it rise. Leaven, in a spiritual sense, is neither good or bad. The aspect of leaven, which is illustrated in sin that is in the church that permeates, the aspect is the permeation, not the sin. You get it? Here, the kingdom of God is like leaven as well, being planted into a defiled world. And what the leaven can do, that is the kingdom stuff, it can permeate the world. And it has the power to turn darnels and tares into wheat. That's what it has the power to do. You get planted in the world and you begin to permeate because you've been given life and everything around you is death. And again, like the mustard seed, there's two things about the leaven that I want you to know. Like the mustard seed, it really does speak to small beginnings with powerful influence later on. Let that encourage you. Again, the disciples had to feel incredibly insignificant, and so do you. I know that about you. I know that about me. Look at the pain where you work. Look at the anger where you work. The hostility toward God where you work. Feel pretty insignificant? Oh, but the kingdom's like a seed. The kingdom's like a little lump of leaven. Leaven, the way it would work. And by the way, it says here in this passage that there, what was the... Verse 33, there we are, okay. The woman took and hid in three pecks of meal. Three pecks of meal is a bushel. Huge bunch of dough. In fact, in the Old Testament, it was that amount of dough that fed all of Gideon's army, to give you a perspective on that. And you take a lump of leaven, and a leaven is fermented dough from another loaf. You just take a little chunk, and you insert it into that huge thing. It speaks to small things having a powerful influence. But there's something else about that that needs to be caught, and I need to say it out loud. The plan and the purpose of God revealed by this parable is to take children of the kingdom and put them in the world and put them in the loaf. There is no biblical allowance for us to live in isolation. We Christians love to do that. We even feel spiritual when we do do that. and separate ourselves from all the defiled people. I got a word for you. If you want to do the work of the kingdom, you're going to have to reject that born-of-the-enemy mentality. Frank Tillepaw calls it the fortress church mentality, where we build these little forts, and we have these invisible walls that keep sin out, and we're just all safe here. God got you reborn. I don't know. He regenerated you. And then he didn't do that, so you just lived this wonderful life. He did that so you could be light and life in a world that is dark. He puts you in the world. Every once in a while, I'll hear about a group building a Christian village, Christian condos, some holy city. And everybody goes, yeah, that would be just so wonderful. That is going to be wonderful, and we're going to enjoy that someday at the culmination, when the kingdom comes in its fullness, and that'll be glory. And your heart ought to yearn for that, but until then, you get planted in the field, and if you try to isolate yourself from the pain and from the sin and just separate yourself, you are running absolutely counter to the plan and the purpose of God for you. We are to be in the world, not of it, not of it, but in it. Jesus was put in it. He was not of it. He went to the tax gatherers party and prostitutes were there. He was where the tares were. He was where the Darnells were. He wasn't of it though. And he permeated and influenced. And so now you're thinking, I've got to learn what to say. You just need to go and know the kingdom's in you and you bring life wherever you go. No, just go with that. The kingdom's in me. The kingdom's within me. Wherever I go, I bring the kingdom. And even if I never see it, there's influence happening here that I don't even know about because the kingdom's within me. Pull it all together. The seed of the kingdom came to my heart. It bore fruit of eternal life. Jesus picked up that fruit that was my regenerated life and he planted it back in the world into a big pile of dough and I feel real insignificant and it's real scary because I got all sorts of junk all around me and so do you. And I feel like there is no effect but you need to know the kingdom's like a seed and your life might even be like a seed and it starts small but it grows and it grows and nothing can stop it and you might not even see what the influence is and it's like leaven and you get stuck in the dough and you might feel totally enveloped and totally overwhelmed but the power of the kingdom in you in ways that you don't even see begin to permeate and affect just like sin if someone's in sin among us they're having an influence on the body that you don't see you see that? in fact it's easier to understand it from the negative, isn't it? We have seen that in leadership. When someone is in our body and we find out two years later that they've been living in some real significant immorality and they're not dealing with it at all, all of a sudden we'll find out that that problem is going everywhere. They didn't even know it. They didn't try to do that. The same thing is true of you who are part of the kingdom. Wherever you go, the kingdom is. And you have a permeating, dynamic thing happening from you that you don't even know about. Know it though now. Be encouraged, but there's even more encouragement and that is this. While the word for you right now relative to all the pain you see is wait, there is also the promise that the harvest is coming. Verse 39, the enemy does sow these things and the harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are the angels. Therefore, just as the tares are gathered and bound, I like that word by the way, bound, that's what Satan is going to happen to Satan. He will be bound forever, no more activity. They're going to be gathered and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send forth His angels. They will gather out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks. Those who commit lawlessness and will cast them into the lake of fire. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The future promise designed by God to encourage the disciples and now to encourage us in this present kingdom where there is pain but there is also power. There are three things going to happen that we've got to look forward to in the midst of the battle you find yourself in now. Number one, promise from God. At the harvest, at the culmination of history, everything that is born of the enemy is going to be bound and burned. Satan, demons, his offspring, all the darnels, the lion, will lie down with the lamb and there will be peace and joy in the Holy Spirit forever. And the field will be wheat and nothing but wheat. The second thing is this, all those who are born of God, and all that which is born of God, and not just people, but things. Joy, love, life, happiness, pleasure, good things. All that is born of God. Everything that God planted in the garden is going to be gathered and burned. But there's one more thing, and it's the very best of all. It says in verse 43, and then, when is then? Then is at the culmination when Jesus calls his own to himself and all the pain and the evil and the suffering and the struggle you have right now is gone, then, beloved disciples, the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father forever. So disciples, I'm sending you into the world and you're going to see some pain there. You're also going to have some power, but you've got a future hope that one day you're going to shine like the sun. But there's another word here. You know what it is? you're going to shine now too. Now we're not going to shine now like we're going to shine then. You know why? Because there's tears. And Satan, every time God begins to move among us and we begin to shine. Have you ever been in worship and you can feel the shine? Have you ever? Did you feel it this morning? Maybe you did. Maybe you didn't. I don't know. I did. And I could just feel like we're shining like the sun. This is great. And every once in a while you get a glimpse and you'll see somebody healed or you'll see somebody redeemed or you'll see somebody broken and you'll go, that looks like the kingdom to me. And this is heaven and this is life. And we shine. We have glimpses of it, but the problem is we see through a glass dimly right now, don't we? And everything that we will be, we are not yet, but I'm going to see Him face to face, and then I'm going to be just like Him. And we prophesy in part now, but we do prophesy, but it's only in part, and we know in part now, but one day we're going to see Him face to face, and all prophecy will be done away in knowledge, because I'm going to know and be fully known, and I'm going to shine like the sun, but you know what the good word is? I can shine now, because the Spirit is mine now, and the gifts are mine now, and the healing is mine now, and deliverance is mine now, and forgiveness is mine now, and redemption is mine now. The pain comes in realizing that all of that is placed right in a slough called a fallen world full of terrors and pain, and so it is a struggle. But no matter what Satan throws at us, we are going to grow. The kingdom is going to grow. And no matter what Satan throws at us, the kingdom is going to permeate. And no matter what Satan throws, we are going to live. And one day, beloved, we are going to shine. I don't know. I just get a picture. We're all here. It's kind of fun. It feels kind of big. You know, what's it going to feel like when we're all gathered in that day and we shine? I wonder what you're going to look like to me. I wonder what I'm going to look like to you. We're going to shine like the sun in the kingdom of our Father. Revelation 11, 15, speaking of that day, the angels, the seventh angel sounded, and it said the voice, there arose a loud voice in heaven saying, it's finally happened. The kingdom has come in its fullness, and the kingdom of this world has finally become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and and when that happened, the 24 elders who were sitting on their thrones before God, they fell on their faces and they worshipped God saying, we give thanks to you, O God our Father, you who were and are and are to come, you alone have taken your great power and on this earth you've come to reign. And when you do come to reign and when the Lord comes again and when he decides now is the time for the harvest, you know what's going to happen to you and me? We're going to shine. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor now among the tares is not in vain. The kingdom of God is like a seed, and it's going to grow, nothing can stop it. It's like leaven, and it's going to permeate, and nothing can stop it. And one day, you're going to shine. I want to give us an opportunity to worship the way the 24 elders worship when they heard that they were going to shine and that Jesus, the kingdom of this world, had become the kingdom of our God and of his Christ and that he's going to reign forever and ever, the elders worship. We're going to do that now. And I want you to stand, and Fred's going to come over here, and we're going to sing the song that is consistent with that 11th, 16th verse of Revelation 11. But I want to pray before we start, too. Jesus, I thank you for your word. I thank you for the stark reality that you give us, that you don't allow us to live in some Pollyanna place that is unrealistic and is unwise about your kingdom, that you have placed us among terrors, but God, you have also given power. The Holy Spirit has come upon us, and we have the gifts and the Spirit to move and permeate in this world, but God, we do get beat up sometimes, and those terrors sure overwhelm us sometimes, and we feel awful insignificant sometimes, And God, sometimes our only hope, and maybe for some in here, the only thing they've got to hang on to this morning is that one day they will shine, because they can't even conceive of that now. I pray that you would help us shine as we worship. And Jesus, in your name, I release the power of your spirit for healing here. There may be some who, because they're living among tares, and they feel like one isolated shaft of wheat, I pray in Jesus' name that you would come upon them and embolden them and strengthen them and give them even courage to come as we worship and sing for ministry. I pray in Jesus' name, amen. We're going to spend the time in worship. Just a couple of songs. If you need to leave, you can. But we're going to worship for a few minutes here. But if you need to come forward for ministry, we invite you to come and respond to whatever the Spirit would have for you. Let's worship. you
