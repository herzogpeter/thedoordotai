The last of these three presentations on contemplatives in action. What does the life of a person who's taken a long-loving look at the real, at Jesus, who has discovered and owned the treasure, who each day is bringing the awareness of their belovedness into the very nitty-gritty stuff of daily life. What does that kind of a life look like to a neutral observer? the gospel of Luke in chapter 6 Jesus says be compassionate as your heavenly father is compassionate Do not judge. And you yourselves can live in the serene freedom of knowing you'll never be judged yourself. Do not condemn. And you'll not be condemned. Grant pardon. and you will be pardoned. Give, and they will be gifts for you, a full measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be poured into your lap because the amount you measure out is the amount you will be given back. Luke 6.36, be compassionate as your Heavenly Father is compassionate. Matthew 5.48, be perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect. 1 Corinthians 2, be holy as the Lord your God is holy. Today, biblical scholars tell us that the three words, perfect, compassionate, and holy, can be reduced to the same reality. Their conclusion, following Jesus in his ministry of compassion, precisely defines the biblical meaning of being perfect as the Heavenly Father is perfect. Perhaps the greatest mystic in our Christian tradition, Meister Eckhart, the 14th century Dominican, said the entire goal of the spiritual life is compassion. If all the months, years I've spent in caves, in solitary places, in deserts, in monasteries and retreat houses, if the thousands of sermons I've preached, all the books I've written, if they have not fashioned their compassionate heart, the whole spiritual thing is bankrupt. For Jesus, compassion is the central quality of his Abba, and it is the central moral quality in the life of any disciple whose life is centered in God. Compassion means to feel as God feels, to see as Christ sees, and to act as Christ acts. To be compassionate is what is meant elsewhere in the New Testament by the more abstract command to love. According to Jesus, compassion is the central quality of any life that is faithful to God, the compassionate one, and a life of compassion in the world of every day bears the stamp of unmistakable discipleship. Radical conformity to the life of Jesus, revolutionary obedience to his command, be compassionate as your Abba is compassionate, constitute the paradigm shift that can shape the North American church into a community of organized compassion. Before I forget this, I want to make a very practical suggestion that I think could truly revolutionize the local church. If every night, before you go to bed, you do the 10th step of the AA program, the 10th step is continue to take personal inventory, and when I was wrong, promptly admitted it. Now, we live in a culture where no man of any importance ever admits he's wrong. This is revolutionary. When I was wrong, promptly admitted it. If you do this, I call it the 10th step at 10 o'clock at night. I do it every night myself, the 10 at 10. Continue to take personal inventory, when I was wrong, promptly admitted it. And these eight guys who are coming tonight from St. Bonifaceous, all these real ragamuffins, they do it also. So even though we're geographically separated, we do it in spirit, it is impossible to harbor resentment to nurture anger, bitterness, or ill will if you do the 10th step sincerely. If you discover a resentment, you claim your own stuff, your own personal responsibility in it, and if it's required, either that night or the next morning, you call the person, you go see the person, and promptly admit you were wrong, you ask for forgiveness. that simple step done with heartfelt sincerity every night would revolutionize the local church and when unbelievers and seekers and utile observers looked at Christians they would say my God look how those people love one another that is the contemplative life in action I want to emphasize this because sometimes compassion seems like some kind of a wimpy virtue compassion is a spirituality of meat it is not of milk it is not for children it is for mature committed adults It is not about masochism. It's about love. It's not about philanthropy. It's about justice. To live the compassionate life requires a great deal of maturity, a big heart, a willingness to risk, and often a good bit of imagination. It is a new way of living in which comparisons, contrast, rivalries, and power trips are left behind. I am convinced this is what Paul meant when he wrote, if anyone is in Christ, he or she is a new creation. To be like Christ is to be a Christian. We are never more Christ-like than when we are choked with compassion for the brokenness of others. John writes in his first letter, Dear children, let us show compassion, not with words on the tongue, but with actions and in truth. When John speaks of being compassionate in truth, he's referring to the interior source of the action. It's not only what we do, but where what we do comes from. This happened in Southern California over a year ago. A 35-year-old attorney, very successful, already a multimillionaire, is on the way out of his house to go to work, And he's got a BMW parked at the curb. To get out the door, he's got to step over his four-year-old son. So he pats him on the head and he says, have a nice day, William. He gets out to his car. He's putting the key in the door when a guilt bomb explodes inside him. My God, what am I doing? I don't even spend five minutes a day with that kid. He's going to grow up feeling like he's an orphan. He doesn't even know who his father is. He made a spontaneous decision. No work today. Walked back into his house, laid down his briefcase, took off his suit coat, sat down on the floor, and began to play blocks with his son. And in less than a minute, the boy began to cry. The father said, what's wrong? He said, Daddy, why are you mad at me? I didn't do nothing. Why are you mad? Playing blocks out of guilt is not the same as playing blocks out of compassion and caring. Even a four-year-old can spot the difference. Had that father looked upon his son as a little sheep without a shepherd, had the tenderness and compassion of Jesus surged within him, then he would have been acting in truth. This gift of compassion is something to be fiercely desired and is to be prayed for with your arms extended until your hands fall off. Lord Jesus, grace me that everything I've experienced in the depth of my own being, the preciousness of the treasure, the awareness of my own belovedness, let that overflow today in every person I meet to see them with your eyes, to feel with your heart, Jesus, to be compassionate as you and your Abba are compassionate. Every time the Gospels say that Jesus was moved with the deepest emotions, they always go on to describe his doing something, feeding the hungry crowds, interceding with God, bringing physical or inner healing, deliverance, exorcism, or most of the time Jesus offered to people when he knew they needed more than anything else, a word of encouragement for their lives. The unglamorous, unpublicized ministry of small things, feeding, sheltering, visiting the sick, the incarcerated, educating, letter writing, speaking a healing word, bearing wrongs, listening in a sensitive way, counseling, washing dirty feet, praying with people, all these unsung ways of living the compassionate life. Back in New Orleans, when I'm home, I work as a volunteer at a place called The Bridge House. And it's called The Bridge House because, one thing, it's under the Mississippi River Bridge. And it's also a bridge from the world of addiction to the world of freedom. And there are 60 recovering low-bottom drunks and alcoholics who live there for a minimum of 60 days. And many go on to live there more than three years. And one day, the two secretaries are sitting out in the lobby, the front part of the building. And a guy walks in, about 30 years old, jeans, baseball cap, turned on backwards. He's got a baseball bat in his hand. He starts banging the bat on the desk and screaming all these filthy obscenities. Well, of course, the two women were terrified. They dove under their desks. And one recovering alcoholic who was standing off to the side went out and called 911. Upstairs on the second floor, Maureen O'Malley, who's the executive director of the Bridge House, heard the commotion. She came downstairs. She saw the man. She walked over to him. She reached under his elbows. She embraced him. And she said, Oh, you poor man. You poor, poor man. and they stood there in this strange embrace for over a full minute. Then she led him over to a chair. They sat down. They waited for the police to arrive. He never let go of the baseball bat. For many of us, our response to violence will either be flight or counter-violence. Maureen responded in a literally disarming way. And that is why I say a life of compassion calls for creativity. It calls for courage, for imagination, for risk. It is a spirituality for adults. It is not for children. What would be the result of this paradigm shift if the North American church became a community of compassion? I believe by the year 2010 this entire country will be converted to Christ Frederick Buechner said this we've always known what's wrong with us the malice in us even our most civilized our insincerity the masks we do our real business behind the envy the way other people's luck can sting us. All the slander, making such caricatures of each other so that we treat each other like caricatures even when we love one another. All this ugliness, all this infantile nonsense. Put it away, says the Apostle Peter, and grow up to salvation. For Christ's sake, grow up. the command of Jesus to be compassionate as the heavenly father is compassionate is never circumscribed by nationality status ethnic background sexual preference or the inherent lovableness of the other the other the one who has a claim on my love is anyone to whom I'm able to respond as the power of the good Samaritan so clearly states. Jesus says to the Pharisees, which of these three was neighbor to the man who fell with the robbers? They answered, we want to treat them with compassion and Jesus said, then go and do the same. Jesus' insistence on the absolutely indiscriminate nature of compassion is the dominant perspective of almost all his teachings on this subject. What do I mean by indiscriminate compassion. Take a look at a rose. Can a rose say, I'm going to offer my fragrance just to good people and withhold it from bad? Can you imagine a lamp withholding its rays from a wicked person who wants to walk in his light? See how helplessly, how indiscriminately, a tree gives its shade to Everybody, good, bad, young, old, high, low. The tree even gives its shade to the man who's coming toward it with an axe to cut it down. This is the first and foremost quality of compassion, its indiscriminate character. One day in the summer, Rosalyn and I, I have a play day. We go down to the French Quarter, which we often do. We're roaming around Jackson Square. We're sampling gumbo and hail and jambalaya. and finally we stop at a place I call the Shrine. And I genuflect when I pass it. It's the Haagen-Dazs ice cream parlor. And so we each get ourselves a prauline, pecan, creole hot fudge sundae that induced a little attack of the happies. For me, actually, it was a seizure of the happies. So we turn the corner onto Bourbon Street and a girl with a radiant smile, about 21 years old, she walks up to us and she pins a flower on each of our shirts and she asks, would you like to make a donation to my mission? So I asked, what's your mission? She said, the Unification Church. I said, oh, I guess that means your founder is Dr. Seung Moon. I guess that means you're a Mooney. She said, yes, I am. Well, obviously, she had two strikes against her. Here's a pagan who didn't acknowledge Jesus as her Lord and Savior, and she was a mindless, witless, naive kid who'd been brainwashed by some guru, and she'd been sucked into this cult. I said to her, you know something, Susan? I deeply admire your integrity, your fidelity to your conscience. it's 98 degrees out here you're out here beating the streets doing what you really believe in you're a challenge to anyone who calls himself or herself a Christian Rosalind reached out and embraced the girl I embraced the two of them and she asked in a very soft voice are you Christians? and Rosalind said yes and then she lowered her head and we saw her tears falling on the sidewalk she said I've been on my mission here in the French Quarter for the last eight days and you're the first Christians who have ever been nice to me most of them look at me with contempt one woman screamed at me and told me I was possessed by a demon and another woman hit me on the head with her Bible. What makes the kingdom come is heartfelt compassion. It is the way that the lordship of Jesus takes. It is the primary and most authentic fruit of a contemplative life. It is a way of tenderness that knows no frontiers, no labels, no compartmentalizing and no sectarian divisions. The Jesus who shared table fellowship with those who were called tax collectors prostitutes, sinners, outcasts those outside the law Jesus says that kind of conduct is what brings about the inbreak of the kingdom of God. Jesus the human face of God invites us to deep reflection on the radical lifestyle of a beloved of God. What it means to truly live as a disciple. I was told a story nine years ago. No, it was nine years ago. It was 1985. that unmasked me, that was like a knife going through my heart. It was an urgent call to repentance and to strike out a new direction. It's about two brothers in South Africa. The older one was very talented. extremely handsome, had great athletic ability, had major intellectual gifts and he won a scholarship, most exclusive prep school in South Africa. His younger brother had none of these gifts. He was awkward, clumsy, intellectually he was quite slow. He had no athletic ability, he didn't have much of a personality. The one gift the younger brother had was he had a stunning tenor voice. In fact, when people heard him sing, they would think of Pavarotti, of Yussi Bjerling, of Domingo. And the younger brother just loved to sing. He'd sing all the blessings at meals. He worked at his parents' farm. He'd sing all the time. Well, in a great gesture of compassion, the parents decide they're going to get a second mortgage on their farmhouse and send the younger brother off to join his older brother. Well, the young one arrives at the prep school, and one day, one of those... You know, teenagers can be cruel. It's kind of a mob action, and a bunch of kids ganged up on the younger brother, who had a severe hunchback, by the way, and they began to mock him, taunt him, pin him against the wall, slap him across the cheeks, and they pinned him on the ground, they ripped off his shirt to review those hunchback, and took out colored crayons, and began writing obscene things on his back. All the while, the older brother is sitting in the library doing some homework. He looks out the window. He saw that whole sick spectacle. All he had to do was walk out the door. At that point, he was a star player in the soccer team. He was the president of the student body. All he had to say was, that's my brother, this is over. It would have ended. But the older brother did nothing. He stayed in the library and failed to be there for his brother in the bad weather of life. Well, the younger one survived, but he quit school a month later, went back to his parents' farm. They noticed he never sang anymore. And they pleaded with him to sing the blessing of meals. He'd say, I don't sing no more. I ain't never going to sing no more. Well, World War II came along, and the older brother was drafted into the military. And one night he was lying on a hillside in Palestine, and the face of his younger brother flashed across his face. and he realized that he would never have any inner peace unless he went back and asked his brother's forgiveness and sought a reconciliation. So he made the incredibly difficult wartime journey from Palestine back to South Africa, walked into his parents' home at 6 o'clock at night. They were sitting at the table. The older brother knelt down in front of the younger one and he told him, I am so sorry that I wasn't there for you when you needed me. I was a coward. I was more interested in protecting my own image than in protecting you. Will you ever forgive me? The younger brother reached out and he held him. He said, I've been waiting five years for you to come home. And they embraced and they had a great reconciliation. They talked later into the night. Well, the two of them finally went to bed. After midnight, at four o'clock in the morning, the older brother was awakened by the sound of a full, rich, mellifluous, tenor voice soaring into the night, the voice of his younger brother, who was singing again. By one simple practice of the 10th step of the AA program, continued to take personal inventory, and when I was wrong, promptly admitted it. The older brother, one single act of compassion and caring, brought healing to his brother, to himself, and to their relationship. My friends, the ultimate betrayal of Jesus is the failure to show compassion when we have the opportunity to do so. When I heard that story, I had to sit down and radically reexamine my entire life. And I ask myself some of the most painful questions, like, Brennan, have you quietly been reeling in rebellion against the unfairness of a system in the Catholic Church that has disqualified you from ministry there? Have I allowed my pain to harden into unforgiveness? As I travel the country, do I communicate a smug superiority over less gifted people, over fundamentalist preachers. Have I betrayed my own inner word that compassion is the only reality, that everything else is illusion, misconception, falsehood? One thing I know in my own ragged, broken, and grace-filled journey, compassion is the name by which Jesus revealed himself to me and my own identity. My own sense of myself gets utterly ambiguous, confused. I'm lost inside when I allow anything but compassion, whether it be self-righteous anger, defensiveness, the competitive desire to win, the urgent need to change people's minds, carping criticism, this gnawing hunger inside of me for vindication, frustration, the blindness of people, whatever. When I allow that to dictate my perception of others and alter my response to reality, I'm alienated from myself. I have betrayed Jesus. I don't know who I am anymore. Compassion is the only reality. Everything else is illusion. It's misperception. It is falsehood. And I've asked Jesus as I began this talk today for each person in this room to have the courage today to set free the song that now sleeps in the wounded flesh of a brother or sister. Jesus said this is how everybody's going to know you're mine not because you're chaste, celibate honest, sober, respectable not because you're church going Bible totin' and psalm singin' you'll be known as mine by one sign only you're a deep and delicate respect for one another you're a cordial love impregnated with reverence for the sacred dimension of the human personality. The world will know your mind by your compassionate caring for one another. Would you please join me in prayer? In unselfconscious freedom, tune out everybody else around you. Center down. ask the Holy Spirit to lead you into inward stillness and listen my beloved child I have a word for you I know what is inside your heart I see your courageous impotent compassion and your fears and the tears you would cry if you could. And I do so love you. I feel how you hate your own selfishness. When you see my poor ones on the street I melt as you detest your defenses against them. I feel your deep heart secret. You wish you wouldn't run away, but could embrace the poor, kiss them, love them and caress their souls. And I do so love you. I know how you feel down deep when you lock your doors and secure your house and invest your money and try to enjoy your possessions. I know your dis-ease, your unrest, and I love you, and I drink from your discomfort, and I find it good. You're so rarely aware of me, how I embrace you as you read the morning paper, how my breath is on your hair as you listen to the evening news. If you but knew how completely surrendered I am to you, you could not help but surrender to me I have a dream for you and I shall never let it go your fears say you can do so little you can only bear so much you simply have to cope and I do so love you open to me now let your surrender to me be so complete so it'll be pure that the only thing left that is yours is the love in your heart no plans for tomorrow no strategies no comprehending of anything no defenses no coping no adjustment no compromise only compassion compassion delicate, compassion fierce, compassion angry, compassion complaining, compassion triumphant, compassion broken, compassion aching, compassion driving you crazy. Bear with me, my beloved, when you can't feel my presence, when it seems to you that I'm not there when you have nothing to hold on to. In those dark and lonely moments, I ask you to trust me that I am dwelling in the deep darkness of a richer faith. I love you, my beloved child. Surrender to my compassion for you. And I will change your name. I will change your name. You shall no longer be called. Who cares, outcast, lonely or afraid? I will change your name Your new name shall be Confidence, joyfulness Overcoming one Faithfulness Friend of God One who seeks my praise I will change your name You shall no longer be gone Move it out last Lonely or afraid I will change your name Your new name shall be Confidence, joyful rest Overcoming ones Faithful rest, friend of God One who sings my praise Love and airs, joyful rest Overcoming one One who faithful bears, friend of God. One who seeks my faith. One who seeks my faith. Thank you.
