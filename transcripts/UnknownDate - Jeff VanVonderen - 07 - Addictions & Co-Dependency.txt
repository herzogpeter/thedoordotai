A couple weeks ago I talked about the soil of shame, and what I mean by that is the place in our lives that we have a sense about ourselves that something's wrong with us. It's put there by messages we get from relationships and church relationships, family relationships, and just the messages that we get bombarded with in our life. I want to define shame for you, once again, just as a point of review, and then show you a brief picture of the soil of shame in the different plants. But this first session tonight, I mostly want to talk about one of the plants that grows out of shame, and that would be the plant called addiction. Because I think that that plant is a very prevalent plant in a lot of families. I think there are probably more families in our culture that are affected by it than are not affected by it in some way or another. So first of all, just a little bit of a review. There's a difference between guilt and shame. And guilt is an emotion about behavior. It's a signal about what you do. And so if you do a wrong thing, you feel guilty, and that's an appropriate way to feel. It means that you've crossed the line. It means that you've acted inconsistent with your value system or with your sense of what's right or wrong. I think that a lot of Christians think that they feel guilty because the Bible or God's laws represent the do's and don'ts of life, and they're kind of written out here on a piece of paper or in a book. And then what we do is we compare ourselves to the list, and when we don't live up to the list, then we feel guilty, and when we do, we feel okay. But I really think that scripturally, the reason why we feel guilty, the reason why we have this signal of guilt, is not because God's laws are written out here for us, but clearly scripture says that God's laws are written on our hearts and on our minds. And we have a new heart that God has given us, and we're new creations in Him and His Holy Spirit lives in us. In Ezekiel 36, 24, it talks about the standard that we're to live by or the motivation for doing right behaviors. And what it says is, I will take you from the nations and gather you from all lands and bring you into your own land, and I'll spring clean water on you, and you will be clean, and I'll cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. Moreover, I'll give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you, and I'll remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. That just means I'm going to take away your hard heart and give you a soft heart. And I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you will be careful to observe my ordinances. And so what God is saying here is the inside job I'm going to do on you is going to make it really hard to live inappropriately on the outside because I'm going to change so much on the inside that you're going to feel like Paul does in Romans 7 when he says the good I want to do on the inside, I don't do. I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man, but I don't always see that happening out here. There's a major battle out here. It's up for grabs out here. But inside, I want to do the right thing. I don't want to do the wrong thing. I keep doing the wrong thing, and I don't always do the right thing. Wretched man that I am. So he's feeling the conflict about living inconsistently on the outside with who he is and what he really cares about on the inside. And I think that that's why we feel the way we feel when we do the wrong behavior. And that signal is just to tell us that we need to do something else. We need to either stop doing what we're doing or go correct what we've done. And so if I do a wrong thing to a person, I feel guilty, I can go apologize. I can pay them back. I can fix what I broke. I can straighten out the lie that I told, something like that. And when I do the behavior that fixes the behavior, it's over and the guilt has served its purpose. Shame, on the other hand, is different. Shame is not just like a form of guilt or a worse feeling than guilt. In fact, I don't think that shame is a feeling at all, even though we talk about it like it is, you know, feeling ashamed. Shame is more, I think, a view of or a belief about or the word that I'm going to come back to later on tomorrow is shame is a mindset. It's a way of thinking about yourself. It's a way of viewing yourself. It's a belief about yourself. And so guilt is about behavior. Shame is about you. And that's why we say shame on you. You ought to be ashamed of yourself because it's a statement about you as a person. And so the difference is that shame is the same sense about self that guilt is about behavior. Guilt is I did a wrong thing. Shame is something's wrong with me. Shame is bigger than guilt. It's more all-encompassing. It's more controlling in people's lives. It cuts deeper. It's a more powerful message. There are some speakers and theologians and counselors that think that there is such a thing as good shame and bad shame. I personally don't think that there's such a thing as good shame. I don't think it's constructive. So guilt is about behavior. Shame is about you. It's a sense of being defective, inadequate. worthless, unloved, unacceptable, incapable. All the prefixes and suffixes that convey shame all convey a sense of lacking, something's missing, inadequate, defective, worthless. And shame is a very powerful message about ourselves that I think that we're bombarded with from every point in our life. And even though I talk about this and I know about this and I teach about this and I counsel about this and I fight in myself about this, there still is a place in me that under the right circumstances the message gets through and says something's wrong with me. And last time that I was here, I told you that just the night before I came, here I'm supposed to come talk about healthy family systems and things like that, and as I'm walking out the door, my daughter's so angry with me that she won't even open her door and talk to me. so that we can solve the issue that we have between us. And that doesn't feel like, you know, my daughter's making a choice about behavior. That feels like I'm a bad dad, you see. And so even though I fight with this kind of sense, it still gets in me because I have been taught, bombarded with messages, I'm an expert at, I have a lot of practice at, translating things out here to mean to have power to say something about me. And it's a fight and a struggle to re-translate that, to be about what it's about, and know that what is about me is the cross and what Christ has done and what his behavior says about me now that that's my bottom line. Paul says in Philippians 3, I have a mind to put confidence in the flesh. In other words, what my mind does, what I tend to do, what's easiest for me, what I'm programmed toward, what I'm bent toward is to put confidence here, to get my sense of identity here in natural kinds of things. And the struggle is to put confidence in the spirit instead of in the flesh, but that's a hard fight. We'll talk about that more tomorrow. So when I say shame, I'm talking about a sense about self. Not a bad behavior, but a bad person for having done the behavior. And then one of the other talks, I think session three, I talked about that all of us have a soil in our lives then that is made up of shame. And so this soil, what it does is it grows plants. And I named a bunch of different plants. One of the plants I talked about was addiction. And that's the plant I'm going to talk a little bit more about during this first session. Another plant that I talked about was family violence. And the thing about these plants is that when a person grows one of these plants out of their shame, it tends to bear fruit back into their own lives. It kind of reinforces the shame in their own lives, but it also then sends a shaming message to people that are around. The way I look at it is it kind of splatters shame into the lives of everybody who happens to be near. So this fruit, because it's rotten fruit, it's bad fruit, When it hits, it kind of just splatters over everybody who's around. Another plant I talked about was a good-looking plant, getting good grades. I see people that sometimes grow a pretty-looking plant out here, but it's not just simply because they're capable of getting good grades, but they're getting the good grades out here to try to fix their sense of defectiveness or to medicate the pain of their shame on the inside. They grow prettier plants on the outside. And how the solution to the negative plants is not just grown pretty plants. And I talked about some other ones too. The plant that I want to talk about tonight is the plant called addiction. And codependency also, but codependency is really addiction as well. And there's some concepts that I want you to understand before I get into describing the process of addiction. Just some kind of ways to think as you think about addiction. Because these are factors that are going to be involved when someone talks about, when someone's involved in the addictive process. And one is that when someone is involved in an addictive process, the action of, or the behavior that they do. So if they're chemically dependent, then the chemical using behavior. If they're sexually addicted, then the sexual behavior. whatever behavior we're talking about here, the behavior that they do, that a person does, tends to mood alter them in an upward direction. But the event... So the addictive behavior tends to move the person in an upward mood altered state. The behavior does, but the addictive event... Now what I mean by that is, before the use, the thinking about the use, the preoccupation with the use, the plans to use, all those kinds of things, the actual using behavior and then what the person goes through at the end of the behavior actually mood alters them in a downward direction. The action mood alters in an upward direction, but the whole event mood alters them in a downward direction. What that means is that they end up in worse shape after they're finished than when they started. It promises something it doesn't deliver. As a matter of fact, it takes away from a person. I've seen people describe it like this it would be where at the top of the addictive cycle is at the top of the addictive cycle would be where people begin to preoccupy with the use so they become preoccupied with the behavior they start thinking about the behavior and then they enter a ritual phase. And this ritual phase would just be the kinds of things that the person tends to always do around this behavior. They tend to always go to the same place. They tend to always hide the stuff in the same place. People who are addicted have incredible rituals around their addiction. I remember when I was using that there were people there who had brass pipes, you know, and they had certain brass pipes and they kept them in certain cases and they put them on certain shelves, you know, and people would roll joints and they would roll them just a certain way or if they were going to go to X, Y, and Z concert, they'd use certain chemicals and if they were going to go to ABC concert, they'd use other kinds of chemicals and a lot of thought and a lot of practice went into doing this just right, you see. So there's a ritual kind of phase that the person kind of tends to enter into. And then there's the acting phase where the person does the behavior we're talking about. So if this is chemical dependency, then it's the person uses the chemical. If this is sexual addiction, they act out sexually. And then over here would be remorse and guilt and shame and all that other stuff. Well, see, if the person is feeling remorse here, That means they're in a downward mood-altered state. Do you understand that? They're lower than when they started. They're feeling guilty and shame. Their mood is low. Well, what that does is that sets them up then for preoccupying, once again, with doing the behavior because preoccupying actually starts elevating the mood before you even do the behavior. I found in my own chemical use that I could miss a lecture in college as much or as easily by thinking about how loaded I was going to be at 5 o'clock than if I had just been loaded during the lecture. Do you understand what I said there? I could miss relationships and miss connecting with people as much by thinking about, you know, by being someplace else in my thinking than if I had just been doing the behavior. And so preoccupying with a mood-altering experience is not automatically a negative thing. okay fantasizing about something or daydreaming about something is not automatically a negative thing when you're in minnesota in january and it's 30 below and it's been uh 20 days in a row under zero degrees and you have a vacation coming in florida in march and you start thinking about your vacation in january it kind of makes the vacation last longer do you understand it it Steals a little bit of upward mood from March and lets you kind of get into it in January. And that's okay. That's not a bad thing unless you're sitting in a counseling session with someone and they're spilling their guts. And you're not listening to them because you're thinking about your vacation that's coming up in March. You see, then it gets in the way of something. And so what happens is that this person starts to preoccupy and think about the using event or the addictive behavior. and so they start to mood alter even before they actually use, and then the cycle starts over again, ends up in remorse and guilt and shame, which sets them up for preoccupation to mood alter them up again, and that's the cycle. The second thing that I want to show you when it comes to addiction is the concept of equity rescuing. Now, equity rescuing means that you invest more, you invest more to rescue what you've already invested. You have to continue to invest time, energy, money, whatever, to rescue what you've already invested. When you see equity rescuing happening, you're seeing an addictive phenomenon. People do this with cars. I had a 1972 Ford LTD, and when I hit 100,000 miles, things started to fall off and break and stuff. It started costing me a lot of money. So the brakes fell off. That's $150. The alternator falls off. That's $150. So I say, I hate this car. This car is sucking me dry. I got to get rid of this car. Well, I can't get rid of this car. I just put $300 in this car. I got to keep driving the car. So I keep driving the car. And then the muffler falls off. That's $100, $125. And then I say, I hate this car. This car stinks. I got to get rid of this car. Well, see, now it's harder to get rid of the car now than it was before, because now I have $425 in the car instead of $350 or $300. Then something happens with the transmission, which is $700, and now I've got $1,100 into a $500 car, and now it's really hard to get rid of the car. You see, I have more equity to rescue, more to lose by getting rid of it than if I just keep it and try to rescue everything I put in it. Plus, you know, I'm going to be darned if I'm going to let somebody else enjoy all these new parts I just put in this car. I'm going to keep driving this car. People do this with relationships. I have seen people who have gotten married to rescue four years of lousy dating. So they had four years of terrible, awful dating with a certain person, and it stinks, and it's painful, and it doesn't work, and instead of saying bye, this doesn't work, sorry, which would mean to them they'd wasted four years. They get married to try to rescue the four years and make it mean something, and all they do is end up with a permanent version of the four years. just a more permanent, painful relationship. People do this on hold on the telephone. They're sitting on hold on the telephone, listening to Herb Alpert and Tijuana Brass. And after five minutes, they say, I hate this. I don't have time for this. I'm hanging up. Well, I can't hang up. If I hang up, I'll have to call back and start over on hold. I'll just hang on, because maybe they'll come back, you see. So you hang on, and you hang on two, three more minutes. Well, see, now if you hang up, you've lost eight minutes instead of five. so it's easier to just keep hanging on and investing more time and energy. I think the United States did this about Vietnam. Whatever else Vietnam was, I think that the United States got in a place where they had to continue to invest more lives in a country to kind of justify all the lives we already invested in the country. It's like a trap. People do this with houses. There's a movie out with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long called The Money Pit. And in that movie, they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to rescue the hundreds of thousands of dollars they've already put in this house that just keeps requiring more and more kinds of things, and that's called the money pit. And that's what equity rescuing is. In an addictive process, so is it possible then to get addicted to a car? In other words, to not be able to be without your car. Could be. If you have so much invested in your car that to leave it would be leaving so much investment that it's easier just to keep going in that direction. I think that when people are involved in an addictive process where they've spent so much time justifying and they've paid so many prices to continue to do this course of action, for them to quit would be like admitting that this whole course of action was a waste of time. So they keep investing just a little bit more, trying to make the whole thing turn out, and they just get deeper and deeper into the addiction. So those are just a couple of phenomenon that I want you to know about as we talk about addiction. Now, addiction, the addictive process, and I'm going to talk about this in terms of drugs and alcohol, but I want you to be able to hear food, sex, religion, workaholism, any kind of mood-altering phenomenon, anything that someone can use for mood-altering, because that applies here, and it doesn't have to just be about chemicals. People mood-alter in many different ways. It involves two continuums. The first continuum is what I'll call the using continuum, and on this end, on the left side here, this would be abstinent. No mood-altering behavior. On the right side would be addicted. So everybody here in the room is somewhere between these two points. Do you understand this? We're somewhere between abstinent and addicted to whatever it is we're talking about here. This other continuum is an emotional continuum that goes from the top, which is light emotions, down to the bottom, which is heavy. Now the reason I call emotions light and heavy is because I don't want to refer to them as good or bad, like this is good feelings, bad feelings, or right feelings, wrong feelings. I don't believe that feelings are right or wrong. I think that they're automatic, instantaneous, almost physiological responses to what's going on on the outside. They're signals that tell us something's happening between us and the world around us. The choices that we make in response to that is what's right or wrong. These are just signals like that, and what we do with them, How we respond to them is what's the right or wrong part. So I talk about feelings like they're light and heavy, meaning light are those emotions that are easy to carry. They're light. They don't weigh a lot. Happy, excited, falling in love, feeling a sense of accomplishment. Those are light, you know, proud. Those are light feelings. They're easy to carry. They're easy to give away. People like them. They're flattered when you talk about these kinds of things. Nobody quotes a bunch of Bible verses at you for having light feelings. These are okay. When my little girls were born, we called people in the middle of the night. A couple of my kids were born at 9 and 11 at night. And so after all the dust settled, we called people at 1 or 2 in the morning. And everybody we called liked that we called. They all said thank you that we called. Because we were spreading some lightness around, you see. And they were happy to receive that. But heavy emotions, on the other hand, are hard to carry. And they're hard to give away. Anger, jealous, hurt, sad, embarrassed, guilty. Those are heavy, and some heavy emotions are so heavy that people can actually feel them physically. When you get caught doing something you shouldn't be doing, you get a feeling in your guts that actually feels like a physical weight pulling down on your stomach. You know, when you're really embarrassed, you feel like your face gets heavy. These are hard to carry, and they're hard to give away because people don't like them, they don't know what to do with them, they indict you for having them. We've been kind of taught in our culture that it's not okay for us to have them. Certain heavy emotions are wrong for men and certain heavy emotions are wrong for women. In our culture, it would be not okay for women to feel angry. Hurt and scared is okay for women, but anger isn't okay. See, we frown on angry women. That's why there aren't a heck of a lot of women martial arts movies because it doesn't sell in our culture for women to be going around kicking men around. So women can't feel angry, but they can feel hurt and afraid. Men, on the other hand, can't feel hurt and afraid. They can feel angry. And so for men, a lot of our feelings tend to come out anger. When we get a feeling, it turns into anger so fast that we don't even pay attention or notice what the feeling was. It just kind of comes out in an angry way because that's the feeling that's okay for men to have. So women can be weak and hurt and afraid. Men can be angry and take care of the woman who's hurt and afraid. The problem is that women get angry and men get hurt and afraid. It's just that we've been kind of conditioned that we're not allowed to have some of these, and so we pretend we don't. This line, then, each point on the line would represent a place halfway between light and heavy. So this line represents normal, but you see normal doesn't really look like a flat line. Do you understand this? There's no such thing as emotionally flat like this. A lot of people try to act like this. My dad used to spend a lot of energy trying to look like this emotionally, just this flat line. If you ever attain this emotionally, it's called dead. If you get this on your EKG, you're dead. If you get this on your EEG, you're dead. This is dead. Normal really looks more like this, up and down, depending on what's going on between you and the world around you. That's normal. A lot of people as children weren't allowed to have or express heavy emotions, and so what they were not allowed to find out is that, you know, some heavy emotions just over a matter of the course of time will go away all by themselves. But since they're not allowed to have them or express them, they can't learn that, you know. Another thing, how many of you came from a family system or church system that kind of told you that you can't love someone and be angry with them both at the same time? Anybody? That's a lie. That's a lie. It is possible to love someone and be angry with them both at the same time. And as a matter of fact, the people that you love will probably be some of the people that you get the most angry about because you're the closest and their behavior means more to you than somebody who's out here, you see. The choices that you make about the anger and how to respond to that is the issue, not the fact that you have this signal that says something's going on between you and this person. Okay, so people that I've dealt with that struggle with addiction typically start their process from a heavy place. In other words, they don't start from normal. They start from a heavy place, but they're so accustomed to feeling heavy that they thought that was normal. Does anybody relate to that? You're so accustomed to being in a low place that you just thought that was normal. You didn't even know there was a normal above that. And so for you, that was normal. And when this person decides to do the behavior, it mood alters them in an upward direction. Now, I want to be real clear here that it doesn't give them light emotions. Whatever it does, it medicates emotions. It numbs emotions. It doesn't give light emotions. It moves you away from heavy emotions. You know, I could talk to somebody who's been using mood-altering substances, and they would say, I don't feel sad because they don't feel anything. But I've never talked to somebody who's drunk, never once. Now, maybe there is a person like this, and maybe you've met them, but I haven't met them, a drunk person who said, I'm really happy right now. You see, because the person who's drunk isn't really feeling much. They're not even in touch with the light emotions that they would be feeling, let alone the heavy emotions, but the fact that they are drunk moves them away from heavy. It mood alters them in an upward direction. This is called an experiment. The purpose of an experiment is to find out what the behavior will do. It's to find out the results. When people use chemicals for the first time, when they act out sexually for the first time, when they smoke cigarettes for the first time, they're trying to see if this is going to do for them what somebody else said it did for them. So there's an experiment, you see. It's to find out the results. Once the results are discovered, the experiment is over. It's not an experiment anymore. Now, when I was in high school, we had a physics experiment where we took water, distilled water, sterile beaker, sterile thermometer, dry ice, and we chilled water below freezing, and it didn't freeze. So we made water go way below the freezing point, but it didn't freeze. And then the physics instructor took this piece of thread out of the corner of his pocket. He just kind of pulled it out and snapped it off and dropped it in the water. And when it hit the water, the water went and froze almost immediately. And we went, whoa, that was pretty cool. So we write it down. We did this, we did this, he did this, it did this. Okay, now the experiment is over. Then after class, we did it 14, 15 more times because it was so cool. We just had to see this again. You know, it was really great. The point is that we were no longer experimenting. Do you understand? That was not an experiment. The experiment was when we found out the results. After that, it's because we liked the results. I have had parents tell me that their child, their daughter or son is into heavy experimentation. Well, there's no such thing as heavy experimentation. You see, when you do it the first time, when you find out the results, that's the experiment. Once you find out the results, the experiment is over. After that, it's called using drugs. That's what it's called. So when the effect of the chemical wears off or the effect of the experience wears off, whatever the person's doing the mood alter, they return to normal. Society's definition of appropriate social drinking, for instance, would be a person who uses chemicals, but they stay above this line. In other words, they don't pay any heavy emotional prices or prices in any other areas of their lives to continue doing this behavior. So they continue to go up and down, up and down, using this mood-altering substance, and if they ever did pay a price as a result of it, they would eliminate the behavior that caused the price. And they'd stop doing the thing that caused them the consequence. That would be an appropriate social user. Let's say a person is not a chemically dependent person, but for some reason they're not careful. They misjudge. Usually if they are afraid that they're going to be in a bad place to drive, they make arrangements for somebody else to drive or they don't drink too much. But tonight they underestimated how much they drank, and so they're driving home, and they're over the.10 alcohol level, and they swerve, and the policeman stops them, and they get a ticket, and they go before the judge, and the judge says, don't do this anymore. you're going to hurt yourself, you're going to kill somebody, they won't do it anymore. They'll adjust their chemical use to accommodate their life. They'll adjust the behavior to accommodate their life. A person with a drinking problem could go get the DWI ticket. The judge will say, don't do that, you're going to hurt yourself, you're going to kill someone, don't do that. And the chemically dependent person will say, okay, and then watch harder for the cops next time they do it again, and again, and again. So they will adjust their life to accommodate their use. The difference between a person who is addicted and who isn't addicted is that a non-addicted person will adjust the behavior to accommodate their life and eliminate the consequences that the behavior might be causing. But if the person figures out a way to keep the behavior and adjust their life to accommodate that, then that's a signal that perhaps there's an addiction going on here. You know, when I was using, before I was using, I had a 3.5 grade point average my first year of college. I had a 2.5 grade point average and my second year of college I had a 1.5 grade point average and I had started using chemicals before my first year of college in that summer between high school and college. Now, if you'd have asked me, are grades important to you, I'd have said yes. If you'd have said, are chemicals important to you, I'd have said no. But here I was giving away the thing that I said was important to me to keep the thing that I said wasn't important to me. If you said, I think your chemical use is a problem, I'd say, well, it's just this little bitty thing, no big deal. It's nothing, it's just this little tiny thing. And if you said, well, what are grades? I'd say, oh, grades are important. So what I did was I just gave up this really big thing to keep this little tiny thing. See, that's a contradiction there. Do you understand that? There's something to confront there. That's a signal that something's going on with me. When I was in college, I made the freshman team in basketball, which was a big deal because I was a short guy compared to the people I was playing with. I never played against any tall guys until I got in college. Everybody in my whole conference was six feet tall, just like me. So I had to work like crazy to make the freshman team. And I made the team, but I couldn't get drunk and play basketball, both at the same time, so I quit the freshman team. If you'd have said, are sports important to you, I'd have said yes. If you'd have said, is alcohol use important to me, I'd have said no, it's no big deal. So I gave away the thing, I exchanged the thing that I said wasn't important to me, that I said was important to me, to keep the thing that I said wasn't important to me. There's something going on there. Can you see it? I'm adjusting my life and my thinking and everything else to accommodate the fact that I'm doing some behaviors now that I didn't used to be doing. Well, let's say this person uses again, and during the course of this experience now, it doesn't have to be chemicals, any kind of mood-altering thing, this person does something or says something that they wouldn't have done if they hadn't been using. So something that goes against their values. When the effect of the chemical wears off, They don't stop at normal. They get a heavy emotional signal that says, look at this, pay attention to this. They feel guilty, sad, embarrassed, hurt, scared, paranoid, some sense of heaviness about this behavior, and they should be feeling that, and that's okay. When I was in college, I was dating this woman, and we were madly in love, and we had this deal that neither one of us would go out with anybody else. Well, she went out with somebody else. I found out about it, got drunk, went to her dorm room, and hit her. Now, see, I don't think it's okay to hit people. I wouldn't hit anybody if I was sober. And even if I'm drunk or sober, I don't think it's okay to be hitting anybody. But I could hit people when I was drunk. The fact that I could hit them and did hit them when I was drunk doesn't make it okay that I hit them. My drunkenness doesn't justify it. It just explains it. Do you understand that? When a person gets drunk and runs somebody over in a car, the fact that they were drunk doesn't make it okay that they ran them over. It just explains why it happened. It doesn't make them not legally accountable. If someone gets drunk and runs into a tree, if someone's inappropriate like that, the fact that they're having a problem here doesn't make it okay that they did the behavior. It just explains how it is that they could do the behavior. I could hit people when I was using. It doesn't make it okay. It just explains why I did that behavior at the time. Well, see, when I sobered up, I felt terrible. I felt guilty and embarrassed and humiliated and awful and shamed and whatever. Lots of heavy stuff. And all those signals were there to say, go talk to her. if I'd have gone to her and said, look, I'm sorry I was wrong, I shouldn't have hit you, will you forgive me? Who's responsible for my behavior? Who? Me. So, I went to her and I said, you know, if you wouldn't have gone out of me, I wouldn't have hit you. Now, who's responsible for my behavior? Me. But, that's not how I saw it, and that's not how I thought about it. The way I thought about it was, she was responsible for my behavior, I'm not responsible for my behavior. If you wouldn't have gone out of me, I wouldn't have hit you. What do I have to feel guilty about? You're the one who broke the agreement. See how the thinking changed? And so instead of paying attention to the signal and doing something right about it, what I did was I just stuffed it and put a little bit of a wall in front of it that said, I'm fine, you're the problem. There's no problem here. You're the problem. And so I pretended to be up here at normal when I really still was in this heavy place. Well, see, the next time this person does the addictive behavior, they don't start from here. They start from here. They've lowered their normal. Do you understand this? This is back to the remorse now that sets them up to find out that preoccupying and using will mood alter them up. They've ended up worse than when they started. Well, the next time this person uses, they mood alter up, and then they come back down here, unless they continue to live in ways that conflict with their values or go against what they know to be right or wrong. Well, then they keep getting this signal that says, pay attention to this, you know, and the signal is guilt or, you know, some kind of, you know, heavy emotion. You know, if you're living this way, you should be feeling heavy stuff. You should be feeling guilty about the stuff you've done. You should be feeling sad about the friends you've lost. You should be feeling paranoid that this group of people that you told one story to and this group of people that you told another story to might ever get together and compare stories and find out that you're lying. You know, you've got a lot of work to do to cover all this stuff up, and there should be a lot of heavy emotional anguish going on. But see, at the same time that this chemical process or this using process is causing the emotional pain, it's also mood-altering the person out of the pain. That's the trap. Well, just to escalate this, what happens if you do this enough is that you could possibly end up way down here in a very heavy emotional place with a big, thick wall of excuses and blaming, denial, and minimizing, you know, and lying and stuff that's designed to tell everybody else you're fine and something else is the problem. and a big heavy load of emotional pain that you're not paying attention to and that you're just medicating and that's giving you more reason to medicate and that your using behavior makes sense with. Understand that? You know, mood-altering behavior makes sense with low mood. It fits with a low mood. It's just as simple as that. Well, if you come to this person and you say, don't use, quit using, you shouldn't use, stop using, it's a sin, God hates it, don't do it, they're going to think you're nuts because you're asking them to give up what maybe for them is the last way that they have to get from down here back up to here, at least somewhere around normal. If you come to this person and say, can't you see what you're doing to yourself? They can't see what they're doing to themselves. Well, can't you see how you're hurting your family? They can't see how they're hurting their family. In fact, if you ask this person, can't you see how you're hurting your family, how would they feel? How would you feel if someone said that to you? Well, can't you see how you're hurting your family? You'd feel guilty. Well, what do they do when they feel guilty? They use. But they wouldn't have to use if you were laying all these guilt trips on them. See how their thinking changes really quickly like that? Well, can't you see how it's hurting your health, how it's hurting your job, how it's hurting your grades? Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. Well, see, Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. That's my bias. That's what I believe. That is the most ultimate reality in the universe. This person can't even figure out little bitty realities. They can't figure out that if you get drunk and drive in a car, you can hit a tree and die. See, that seems kind of obvious. They can't figure it out. They can't figure out that if they say a bunch of hurtful things to their kids, their kids are going to be hurt. Can't figure that out. That seems kind of obvious. You do hurtful things, people get hurt. And are you going to give them this great big reality about Jesus? It is a reality, but they can't hear it. You see, all along the way, when they're making excuses and telling lies and doing stuff to get you off their case, it's called denial. This is called denial. and denial means I'm telling lies but I know they're lies and I'm making excuses but I know they're excuses my goal is to hopefully from behind this wall kind of lob an answer over it and hopefully you'll go away that'll satisfy you, it'll get you off my case but what happens is that this person somewhere in this process crosses a line and they lose control of their process you know they think they still can control it they go from a place of having control to being out of control but they still think that they're in control and that anytime they want to quit and pull out of this they can't. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 6.12 all things are lawful for me but all things aren't profitable all things are lawful for me but I won't be mastered by anything now it doesn't make sense for Paul to say I won't be mastered by anything if you couldn't be mastered by something. Do you understand? Addiction is the result of a process of becoming mastered by something. Loss of control. And when a person that happens to a person, all that denial I was just telling you about turns into delusion. And delusion is not just the worst form of denial. Delusion is not now, I'm telling you lies, but I believe the lies. I'm making excuses, but I'm convinced that the excuses are true. And the thing about this delusion that happens in people's lives is that they're sincere. They actually believe this. That's a very frustrating and very liberating thing, though, if you can grasp that, that when a person who's deluded is telling you stuff, they're not just making up stuff to get you off their case. It's like you feel like they think you were born yesterday, like you just got off the boat, like you're not capable of telling what's real because they're giving you the stuff, but the truth is that they believe the stuff, and they're so convinced and they're so sincere. So you give them information from your side of this grid, and on their side, the great, it all gets twisted up and they give you their answer to it and they're so convinced and they're so sincere that you wonder if maybe you must have seen it wrong. Like, well, you know, maybe I'm making this up. I mean, maybe I'm just making too big of a deal because you run into this sincere delusion. And you need to understand that because people believe the lie now. They're not just telling the lie, they're believing the lie. Here's a couple examples. I was counseling the guy in treatment. He had seven drunk driving tickets. When he got his first one, he lost his license, and he got aggravated DWIs and going to the workhouse, DWIs, and all these kind of DWIs. So I said to him, what's going on? He says, I don't know, man. Every time I drove, I got a ticket. I said, what did you do? He said, I quit driving. Well, that's good. It's good. Who wants him on the road anyway? Do you understand? But what's sad about that is the reason he quit driving is because he decided driving was the problem. So he quit doing the behavior that he thought was the problem, which was driving. Now he's walking. He's walking to parties, walking to work, walking to school, walking to the bus. And one night he's walking home from a party, 2 o'clock in the morning, drunk. He rips off a Sears Craftsman toolkit off the back of a pickup truck, weighs 500 pounds. I don't know how he did it. It's one of those red and gray things, you know. Pulls it on the ground, dragging it down the road, you know. Cops pull up. What's going on? He says, I don't know, man. how'd that get here? He was going to put it in his room. Second story room. I don't know how he was going to do that either, but he had it figured out. Got busted for felony theft. I said, what did you do, stop walking? He said, what? I said, well, you know, you were driving and getting tickets and you stopped driving and now you're walking and getting busted and I want to know if you stopped walking. He said, what? I said, did you ever get any tickets when you weren't drinking? He said, well, no. I said, well, did you ever get busted for felony theft when you weren't drinking? He said, no. I said, well, maybe it's your drinking. He went, it is. Never occurred to him. Guy was deluded. He was easy, too, by the way. All I did was poke a couple holes through here, and he looked in there and went, wow, it's me. I mean, he didn't go, oh, no, I'm a scummy, chemically dependent person. Oh, woe is me, shame on me. He was relieved. See, before that, he thought that the reason why he got kicked out of his house was because his parents were jerks, and he forgot the part about getting drunk and threatening to beat up his mom. And he thought that the reason why he lost four jobs in six months was because of the economy. See, he forgot the part about being too hungover or drunk to go into work, so he kept losing jobs. He thought the problem was the cops and the social workers and the treatment centers and the probation officers and the parents and the economy. And see, if everybody else is your problem, then you're just some victim who has to sit around waiting for the whole world to get right before you're okay. But if you're the issue, you can get help right now. So he was like, wow, you know, that's good news. I can do something about this. It's me. He was easy. Here's a medium one. I had a guy from Vermont, 50-year-old guy, visiting his daughter. Gets two drunk driving tickets in a month. So now he can't even go back to Vermont. He's got to stay here and go to treatment. So he's really ticked off, sitting in treatment. I said, what happened? How'd this happen? What'd you do? He said, you know, the cops hear something else. I mean, you know, they make you get out of the car and walk the line and touch your nose and hop on one foot and do a breath analysis and urine analysis and all that kind of stuff. I've been doing this for 20 years in Vermont and nobody ever said anything and I come here and I've got to go through all this. I said, you mean you're in the wrong place? Yeah. You mean you're in the wrong place at the wrong time? Yes. Huh. How'd you get the other one? He said, well, I was driving 3 o'clock in the morning, had a little bit to drink, no big deal, and I swerved over the center line. And the funny part about it was that if it would have been 10 o'clock in the morning, there had been all these cars on the road, nobody would have seen me. But it was 3 o'clock in the morning, I was the only car, I swerved over, the cops saw me, I got a ticket. I said, so you were in the wrong place at the wrong time? He said, yeah, if I was in Vermont, I'd be okay. I said, would you please fill out this release of information for him so I can talk to your probation officer. He said, okay. He started to fill it out. He looks at me and says, you don't believe me, do you? I said, no, I don't believe you. He almost jumped over the table and strangled me. He was so upset, so angry with me that I would call him a liar. But you know what? I did believe him. He wasn't lying. Do you understand? He wasn't lying. He was telling the truth the way it looks when you're on this side of the deal. And the way it looks on this side of the deal is real different than the way it looks on this side of the deal. He was deluded. He couldn't see it. I was counseling a 14-year-old girl who ran away about once every other weekend down to Iowa. She'd get loaded on pot, run away to Iowa, and then she'd get a call. The parents would get a call from some little dinky town in Iowa, and the sheriff would say, we got your daughter, come and get them. Then dad would have to go down and get the daughter once or twice a month. And the deal was that I don't think that this daughter was chemically dependent. I think that she was a drug abuser who was medicating pain that she had in living in this family where the dad was the alcoholic. That's what I think. So finally, the dad, in order to get the daughter to come back peacefully, promises that when they get back in Minnesota, they'll get some help. He'll get some help. She'll get some help. And she says, okay. So they stick her in treatment. He goes home. So she's really ticked. She feels set up and all this. And so now my job as a counselor is to help her deal with her issues. And all she wants to do is talk about the dad all the time. She's always talking about the dad. I mean, he kept hearing all about the dad's use and the dad this and the dad that. It was a hard struggle to get her to focus on her because if she's going to get well, she's going to have to focus on her, see. Well, the family conference time comes where I start getting involved with the family so that I can help the family but also make an assessment about where would be a good place to send this girl after treatment. So he's sitting in the family conference, you know, and here's the daughter and here's the dad and here's the brother and here's the mom. And I said to the dad, who's an executive over at 3M, I said to the dad, you know, ever since she came to treatment, all we've been doing is hearing about your drinking, and I'd like to hear about it from you, because I have to make a decision about where's a good place to send her after treatment, home or to a halfway house or someplace like that, and so I'd like to hear it from you. How often do you drink? He says, I don't drink that much. You know, I have a couple drinks when I come home to unwind. No big deal. She says, Dad, you drink from the time you come home to the time you go to bed every day. Mom says, he does not. Son says he does too. I said, well, how often do you get drunk? He said, well, not that often. A couple times a week. That's a lot. Once a week is a lot. That's a lot. It's a lot. No big deal. Once a week. She says, Dad, you're drunk every night. You pass out in front of the test pattern every night. Don't even make it to bed. The mom says, he does not. Son says, does too. So I'm watching this go on like this, you know. This is only a counselor for about a year. I didn't understand all this delusion stuff. And I'm looking at this and I'm going, I don't know what I'm doing. Like, okay, it's like I'm supposed to say something now and I don't know what it is. This is when I got my first chest pain as a helping professional. I did. I got a chest pain. My heart stopped. So I'm sitting there trying to think of what to say and my heart stopped and I notice that it stopped. And I'm going, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. And then it does two really hard beats. Then I'm out of breath. Then my breath starts to come back. Then my neck feels like it's starting to swell up. Of course, a couple weeks before that, we just had a CPR course, and I knew that the next thing that happened was your left arm started to go numb, and sure enough, my left arm starts to go numb. I mean, for two or three weeks afterwards, I'm driving home. Every night, I have to work with my left arm hanging limp at my side, thinking to myself over on 694, okay, now where's Unity Hospital, and where's North Memorial, and all these kind of places so that when a big one comes, I can drive myself to the... Seriously, I was in over my head. so I said to the dad you know it's really hard for me with a clean conscience to refer your daughter home when you can't even decide as a family what's real about the chemical use in this family I mean I got a person who's in treatment for chemical use and I'm supposed to refer her here and you can't even decide what's real here so what I would like you to do sir is I would like you to go get an evaluation for your chemical use and do what they say he said if I go and tell those evaluators how much I have to drink, they're going to say I have a problem. Can you hear it? Can you hear it? He's deluded. He's deluded. This is a guy who's got broken blood vessels in his nose, bleeding gums, and yellow eyes. The guy had yellow eyes. But if anybody thought that he had a problem, they would obviously be the problem. See, that's deluded. He's deluded. He can't see it. This is serious stuff. Now, I just want to spend a real quick period of time here because we got started a little late during this session, but I want to just show you what codependency looks like. This is dependency. It doesn't take chemicals for this to happen. It can happen with any kind of behavior someone uses to mood alter. I've heard just as ridiculous and sincere explanations for why people work too much as I have for why people drink too much. I have heard just as serious of reasons why people give too much money to church or too involved in certain church groups or religious factions as people who give good reasons for why they drink. So it's whatever a person uses to mood alter out of a heavy place. For every one of these people, there's three or four people who, number one, care about that person. If you don't care about someone like this, you won't be affected by their process. If you do care, you will be affected, who are ill-informed, meaning that they don't know exactly what it is they're looking at here. They're looking at something, but they don't know what to call it. They don't know what this is. So they're ill-informed. If you care, you'll be affected. If you're ill-informed, you'll be affected even more. And number three, shame. And what I mean by shame here is that if you have a sense that that person's behavior has the power to say something about you, then you'll be even affected more by this. It'll even be more painful for you. Because you won't hear this as about their process or their choices. You'll hear this as an indictment on you as a spouse or a parent or a son or daughter or something like that. If you care, if you don't know what you're dealing with and you have shame, that person's behavior has the power to indict you, then you're going to be affected big time. So here you are cruising along normal and this person does or says something and you feel pain about it. Well, that's a normal response, you see. That's just a signal that says something's going on between you and that person. What does the scripture say? The scripture says go talk to that person. Laying aside falsehoods, speak truth to each one of you with his neighbor for we are members of one another. So if that person does something or says something, you need to go talk to them about it. Now, I remember a few years ago, well, 10 years ago, I came home from work. I had a lousy day at the office. Nobody got well that day. I got in a traffic jam. I was driving a Dodge Colt, no air conditioning. I was out on 169. I was toasted. It was awful. Cars were beeping. They smelled like exhaust fumes. It was awful. I finally get home, come in the door. my daughter's greeting me at the door. Let's play. Let's wrestle. Let's read. Yay, Dad's home. And I'm toasted. I don't want to do anything. I say, look, I need some time for myself. Three of them go away. One of them doesn't. Play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play. So I just blew her up. I just lost my temper and blew her up. Okay, that put her in this place. You see, her response to that was she felt hurt about that. She put her hands on her hips and looked at me and said, I feel sad about what you said and I don't deserve to be treated that way. That's the right response. In fact, I taught her to do that. I want her to do that. I just want her to do that with you. So, you know, I said, I'm sorry, you're right. You know, I'm frustrated and angry, but it's not about you, and I shouldn't have put it on you. Understand? I put the whole day's heaviness on her, and it didn't belong there. Now, is it okay for dads to want to have time to themselves? Yes. Is it okay for dads to want their daughters to respect the fact that they need time for themselves? Yes. Is that a good enough reason to blow up your daughter? No. Well, what is a good enough reason to blow up your daughter? There is no good enough reason to blow up your daughter. So I apologize, and she comes back up to normal, and it's over. You understand? Restoration, whatever you want to call it. But let's say that I'm an alcoholic or an addicted person, and that means that I'm on my way home from work, and all this stuff is bringing me in a downward mood state. Plus, I haven't had anything to drink since last night, which means that I'm down here for sure. See, last night before I went to bed, it was the last drink I had, so now, since then, I've been going down, down, down, and then all this stuff happens, and I'm going down, and when I hit the door, and the daughters are all there, and Miller Time is in the refrigerator, they are in the way. So I blow them up, and they learn that they better not try to confront me because they're going to end up more hurt after they try to talk to me about it than before. Or maybe they run to mom and they say, Mom, you know, Dad came home and he blew us up. And the mom learned a long time ago that you don't talk to the dad because if you try to hold the dad accountable, you get hurt worse than when you started. And so the mom says, Well, you know, your dad's had a hard day at work and he works really hard to put food on the table, give him a break, which is to say there are good enough reasons to blow up your daughter. If you work hard, you can blow up your daughter. Right? Wrong. So people learn to stuff their pain just like this person is stuffing it. They learn to stuff it, put it down here in a box and put a little wall in front of it that says it's not as bad as it really is. And then they go a little bit farther along normal, which is now lower, you see, and the next event happens and they feel pain about that, but there's nowhere to go with that because they end up feeling worse if they try to confront it than if they just stuff it. They pay a price. To make a long story short, if you do this long enough, it's possible that you could end up with your own heavy load of emotional pain that you have chosen not to deal with, by the way. The fact that you have this load is not because of the addicted person, it's because of the choices that you've decided to do with your pain. Now, it makes sense that you would decide to do that, so don't hear me saying that. It makes sense that you would have decided to do that, but still, you did decide to do that. And your own thick wall of excuses that I have seen to be, for this person, every bit as deluded as the other person. You know, because you tell the lie so much, you cover for the person so much, that you can't see the problem anymore, and you believe the lie. And you could end up then, down here, with your own load of pain, and your own wall of dysfunctional thinking, and not even have to use to get there. Now, for this person up here, it's called the dependent person. And the reason we call them the dependent person is because they're dependent on the mood-altering substance, the chemical, the sexual behavior, whatever. They're dependent on that for their highs, which means when they have the chemical, they're high. When they don't, they're low. Recovery for this person, short version, is that this person needs to learn how to get from down here back up to normal without having to mood-alter to do it. just by dealing with their issues and learning new living skills and figuring out that this isn't working, they have to find a different way to live. We call this person down below here the codependent person. Now, I don't really especially like the term codependency, first of all, because codependency kind of sounds like a second-class dependency, okay, like it's a second-rate issue. Codependency is dependency. Codependency is as much addiction as addiction. It's addiction. The second reason I don't like the word codependency is because in the early days of chemical dependency counseling, we would have only ever called someone codependent if in the middle, in their story somewhere, we could find a dependent person. So then we'd say, well, you're struggling with codependency in relationship to this dependent person. But what I've seen since those days is that most of the people that I see that struggle with codependency were codependent before they ever even met their dependent person. See, what codependency is this? Dependency is they're dependent on the chemical or the sexual behavior or whatever it is for their high, and when they have it, they're high, and when they don't, they're low. The codependent person is dependent on the dependent person for their high. So when the dependent person looks good and does great and is making lots of promises and trying really hard and looking swell, then this person's high. And when the dependent person is falling short and telling lies and blowing it and not following through and looking really bad, then the codependent person is low. So their highs depend on the dependent person, just like the dependent person's highs depend on the chemical. The chemical, the mood-altering substance for the codependent person is a person. Codependency is people-dependent. It's relationship-dependent. And just like the chemically-dependent person has to learn how to get from here back up to here without having to use to do it, the codependent person has to learn how to get from down here back up to here without having to wait for that other person to get well first. Everybody needs to be in their same process. So codependency is people dependent. It's person dependent. And I've seen codependent people become as easily preoccupied with the behavior of the dependent person as the dependent person is about using behavior. And I've seen them get just as sneaky about their behavior as the dependent person is with their behavior. And all the symptoms of dependency are manifested in the life of the codependent because codependency is dependency. It's just a different mood-altering substance, that's all. With that, we'll take a break. Any questions? Yes? The couple or the family that you were working with? Yeah, the one with Iowa? Yeah. No. No. In fact, the question is, did the daughter ever, did the father ever go get the evaluation? And the answer is no. The father never did go get an evaluation. And what happened very soon after that is that the daughter acted out sexually with someone in the program and got dismissed from the program, but realized that or had some kind of commitment to the fact that she wasn't, she realized that somehow her acting out and all this work she was doing to act out her pain was really just bringing stuff on herself that was more about her dad's behavior than about hers. And so she went straight, and about nine months later, she sought me out at the treatment center and kind of defiantly and angrily came up to me and showed me her nine-month pin from AA and said, yeah, there, see, like it's going to break my heart that she stayed sober for nine months, which I was really happy that she did. But then on Christmas Eve, I got a call from her, and she said that her dad was drunk and passed out on the bed, and they were just getting ready to go to church, and what should she do? And I said, take a bunch of pictures, and then tomorrow when he's sober, show him the pictures. But don't try to deal with him when he's mood-altered, but maybe when he's not mood-altered, you'll be able to see it, and plus that would be tangible evidence that you can't, you know, it looks like what it is on film. And I don't know if she did that, and I haven't heard from her since then, but no, I don't think, I don't have much hope for the family. So, yes? Yes. Equity rescuing is the process of investing more of whatever it is you've invested to rescue everything you've already invested. so if you invest money then it's the process of investing more money if I come to your house and sell you a piece of swampland in Florida for $5,000 and this is a great deal and so you can get this good deal and so you give me the $5,000 and I take off and then I show up three weeks later and say there's a little hitch in the deal down in Florida unless you give me another $1,000 you're going to lose the $5,000 then you're kind of in a tough place there because you don't want to lose the $5 so you might end up giving me one more and lose six but you spend the one to rescue the five and people do that in relationships a lot and certainly it's an addictive dynamic yes the question is if you have a dependent person who's working on their issues and involved in their process of trying to recover and all that and then you have a codependent person who perhaps has brought the codependent issues into the relationship in the first place but they're dealing with their issues and their own process, is it best for them to do that separate? I don't know the answer to that. I don't think I have a rule about that. I would think that I have seen some couples where it was necessary for them to be separate because it was so easy for them to get off of looking at themselves and looking over at the other person's stuff that they just had to not be together. but I have seen probably more couples because of the support that they've availed themselves of that they were able to stay together and work on their own processes but you have to have a lot of people reminding you to stay on your own stuff instead of getting over on the other person's stuff. It's much easier to look over here at you if I believed that if you were just okay, I'd be okay. So that's a tough thing. I mean... Yeah, I would think that both people would have to have a lot of support in reminding them which process they're here to work on. There's a verse. I'll read it to you. I was going to save it for the next session, but it fits here, so I'll just do it. This is in John 21. and Jesus, verse 18, Jesus is talking to Peter. He says, Truly I say to you, when you were younger, you were used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you'll stretch out your hands and someone else will gird you and bring you where you don't wish to go. And he said this signifying by what kind of death Peter would glorify God. And actually Peter was crucified upside down and Jesus is kind of foreshadowing this for him. And when he spoke in this, after he told him this terrible death he's going to get for following him, then he said, follow me. And Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had also leaned back on Jesus' breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is the one who betrays you? Peter, therefore seeing him, that'd be John, Peter, therefore seeing John, said to Jesus, well, Lord, what about this man? And Jesus said, if I want him to remain until I come, what's that to you? You follow me. Now, what Jesus is saying there is that my relationship with him and how that works out is not your issue. You know, our relationship and how it works out between you and me, that's your issue. You worry about that, I'll worry about that. But in a codependent relationship, people aren't worried about that, they're worried about this over here. Oh, absolutely. Because codependency is dependency. That's why codependent, you know, it's kind of an overused word. It's kind of a trendy word. It's kind of a tired word now. It's been used for so long. But I don't know a better word. I mean, I think that it conjures up a whole set of meanings that make sense now. But codependency is not about being married to an alcoholic. It's about being relationship dependent. And I know people who never met an alcoholic in their whole life and they're codependent. Because their highs depend on somebody else, and so their whole life is spent preoccupying, and a lot of energy poured into that other person, just like the person who's trying to figure out what chemical to use with what concert.
