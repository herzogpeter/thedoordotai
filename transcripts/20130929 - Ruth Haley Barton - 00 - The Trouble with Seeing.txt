It says this, As he walked along, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, Rabbi, who sins, this man or his parents, that he was born blind? And Jesus answered, Neither this man nor his parents sinned. He was born blind so that God's works might be revealed in him. We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. Night is coming when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the man's eye, saying to him, Go wash in the pool of Salom, which means scent. Then he went and washed and came back able to see. The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask, Is this not the man who used to sit and beg? Some were saying, It is he. Others were saying, no, but it's someone like him. He kept saying, I am the man. But they kept asking him, then how were your eyes opened? And he answered, the man called Jesus, made mud, spread it on my eyes, and said to me, go to Siloam and wash. Then I went and washed and received my sight. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Thanks be to God. Indeed. Speaking of thanks, I am standing before you very grateful for the opportunity I have to introduce you to someone. Actually, many of you don't need an introduction to Ruth. Many of you spent the last several days at a retreat with her in this room. And we've had Ruth with us at other times as well. You know her name. often hear her quoted from this pulpit by either Steve or myself or someone else. Reflecting on what to say about her, I reflect on the years I've been here and the journey that we've been on as a church and how over the years one of the graces of God to us, for which I am very grateful, is that at certain very critical junctures in our church's life, and the rhythm was always kind of this, as God would stir in us a desire for some dimension or aspect of his kingdom's life, and our experience of it would rise in us, a hunger for that, a teacher would emerge who would be able to speak into our church's life and to our journey, and if you've been with us long enough, you would remember names like Brennan Manning, and then we began to realize the wonder of God's grace and the need for inner healing at deeper levels. And all of a sudden there was this woman named Leanne Payne and a hunger for the powerful gifts of the Spirit. And this guy named John Wimber shows up and begins to affect us. And then there's Dallas Willard as a hunger was growing in us for a deeper understanding of what the gospel really is. And in more recent years, the name that I associate with God's grace to us is this woman named Ruth Haley Barton. It started for me on a beach when I was reading a book called Strengthening the Soul of Your Leadership and it ministered deeply to my soul. Went home to try to tell everyone about this woman, this crazy woman who says things that are resonating. I found out I was the only one who didn't know about her. But it's become more than some author we read. She's become more than a speaker we would have come in. She's been part of the formation, I think, of even the DNA of our church. And not only who we are, but who we are becoming. She is actually a teacher of mine. I sit under her teaching and do it with great joy in the transforming community. My wife and I are part of that. It's a two-year course. And so it is a great privilege to introduce to you or bring back to you Ruth Haley Barton. God bless you. Come. We have had an amazing weekend exploring and experiencing the spiritual practices that open us to God's transforming presence. We have paid attention to desire and allowing that desire to be the fuel that drives the spiritual journey. We have explored and experimented with sacred rhythms of solitude and silence, prayer, scripture, self-examination, and Sabbath. That was a lot to get done in two and a half days, but somehow we did it, right? Amen, we did it. So you might be wondering at this point, those of you who have been with us all weekend, and those of you who know what spiritual transformation is, and you realize that it's a part of the passion of the leaders here at this church, and it is a deep commitment that they have to open up all the possibilities to you for how that transformation can take place. You might wonder at the end of such a quiet, meaningful weekend, how does anything get done? And that's the question we want to look at today. How does anything get done if we're all sitting around in solitude and silence and praying and listening to Scripture? And how do we move out and do something for God in the world? And you might even feel at some points and wonder, is all this spiritual stuff, is it kind of like navel-gazing? Is it kind of narcissistic? Is it kind of self-absorbed? When did we get to the part where we get to do something? And some of you are wondering that. And it brings us, I believe, to the culminating sacred rhythms of our lives, and that is the rhythm of discerning and doing the will of God. To me, that is the culminating rhythm, where because of our spiritual transformation, because we are being formed in Christ's presence, we're actually able to discern what the heart of God is in any given moment so that we can get on board with what God is doing. Paul has a very simple answer to the question, how does anything get done? When do we get to get out there and do something? And that answer is found in Romans 12, 2, where he says, Be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you can discern what is the will of God, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. So Paul establishes a cause and effect relationship between our spiritual transformation and our discernment. And in fact, we could put it this way. we could say that Paul is indicating that our spiritual transformation is prerequisite to discerning and doing the will of God. In other words, there's no way you can do it very effectively. There's no way you can discern and do the will of God very effectively if you are not committed to an ongoing process of spiritual transformation. So spiritual transformation, I know that you all know this, but we're going to say it again, that spiritual transformation is the process by which Christ is formed in us for the glory of God. for the abundance of our own lives and for the sake of others. So no one I think could have been here this weekend and seen what happened among us, see the truth that was told, people standing up and telling truth between themselves and God and with the community, sins being confessed, healing encounters with God, clarity about how God wants us to live, clarity about what our next steps should be in obeying God's purposes for our life. No one can see that sort of thing going on and not believe that spiritual transformation glorifies God. Amen? It is a glorifying thing to God to see human beings become like Christ. And in fact, it is the best testimony of the power of the gospel. When people can see ordinary folks like us changing right in front of their eyes, that is a testimony to the power of the gospel. And it's better than any words you will ever say. It's better than any little pamphlet you can hand out. It's better than any book. You transforming in God's presence, becoming a different person in front of other people is the best witness to the power of the gospel. And then it's for the abundance of our own lives. Who can experience encounters with God like what we experience in solitude and silence? Who can experience the intimacy that comes through our life in prayer? Who can experience the changes, deep and fundamental changes of the broken and stuck places of our lives and not believe that spiritual transformation is for the abundance of our own lives. And that the abundance that Jesus promises in John 10, I've come that you might have life and might have it more abundantly, that that promise is answered through the process of spiritual transformation, where we actually get to encounter God, where we actually get to experience ourselves changed, where we actually get to enter into rhythms of work and rest that are so good for body and soul that we just begin to love our lives, where we actually are able to face into the broken places without shame, but to look into them and to realize that God loves us so much that he can love us right there, and he also loves us so much that he wants to take us beyond the brokenness that we've been living in. Who can experience those kinds of realities in our lives and not believe that spiritual transformation is for the abundance of our own lives, that this is how the abundance comes, through the process of spiritual transformation, through the spiritual practices that open us to God's transforming work in our lives. And then we also begin to discover that as we get close to Jesus, as we, like the Apostle John, lay our heads on Jesus' chest and hear the beating of his sacred heart, and we begin to feel that we know the heart of Jesus, and we begin to love the world and to see the world through the eyes of Jesus, and we begin to get clear on what we think Jesus wants to have happen in the world, And we want to be a part of it. And we want to get out there and be involved in loving and caring for the world that Jesus gave his life for. That is the process. It is for the glory of God. It is for the abundance of our own lives. And it is for the sake of others because out of that fullness, then we can engage with the needs of the world. And also, Paul is saying there can be a certain kind of clarity. Because the needs of the world are too great for any of us to meet alone. The needs of the world are too great for any one community to take on all the needs that there are, right? So there's a need for us to be able to discern, first of all, what are the needs of the world? Secondly, to discern what Jesus would want to have happen in response to those needs. And then thirdly, what is our unique role to play? We can't do everything. So Paul is saying that discernment enables us to discern what is our part specifically, both personally and in community. And so we begin to experience the fact that as we get closer and closer to Jesus, as we lay our heads on his chest and we feel the beating of his heart, that somehow we are propelled out into the world and our transformation is for the sake of others, profoundly for the sake of others, as we are able to discern God's will in the world and as we are able to discern God's part through us in it. So we discover that mission, how it is that we're going to be involved in evangelism and mission and compassion, that that emerges from the process of spiritual transformation. And in fact, it could not happen any other way. When we get out there and try to meet the needs of the world without this process of transformation, we're just doing it on our own steam. Sometimes we're even doing it out of our own ego desire to make a difference in the world. We're not doing it though from a place of deep discernment where God has spoken to our hearts about what he wants us to be doing in the world. So this amazing, what I would consider to be the penultimate sacred rhythm is discerning and doing the will of God. Now, let's say right away that this is not always as easy as it sounds, right? I mean, it sounds really nice to think that we could be that clear, but it is not always as easy as it sounds. And our scripture reading today indicates to us that even people who have been walking with Jesus for a long time can actually get quite confused about what the will of Jesus is, that we can actually feel like we're very close to Jesus and still not be clear on what God's work in the world really is and how we can join God in it. So let's define discernment as we're talking about it today. Discernment, I think, is the ability to recognize and respond to the presence of God, both in the ordinary moments of our lives and in the larger decision-making of our lives. That's kind of a working definition that I like to work with. So discernment, an increasing capacity to recognize and respond to the presence of God in our lives and to actually do something on the basis of that awareness, both in the ordinary moments when we're walking along like the disciples were, just having a little walk, and also in the larger decisions of our lives. Discernment is a personal practice. It's something that we can engage in personally around the important decisions that we face in our personal lives. And our scripture reading today also points out that discernment is something that we do communally, that the community can actually help or hinder our ability to recognize and respond to the works of God among us. So the problem, of course, is that there are obstacles. There are obstacles within us. There are obstacles corporately. There are obstacles in the culture. There are things that actually prevent us from being able to recognize the works of God among us. And in fact, Paul goes on to say in 1 Corinthians 12 or 1 Corinthians 1 and 2 that the wisdom of God is often the foolishness of this world. In other words, it's hard to recognize. The wisdom of God is hard to recognize because human wisdom and God's wisdom are often opposed to one another. God's wisdom is often very, very different than what human wisdom would advise. And in fact, that's one of the obstacles is that sometimes God's wisdom flies in the face of what we would naturally think to do. That is one of the obstacles. and the truth is we are very attached to our human wisdom. The truth is that many of us have spent a lifetime honing our intellects and I bet there are lots of really smart people in this room today and the truth is that those of us who have those intellectual capacities we're very attached to them. We've learned to rely on them. They've gotten us far in our lives and so it's hard to let go of our intellect and to realize that God's wisdom might be profoundly different than what our minds could think up. That is one of the obstacles that we face. The truth is we don't part easily from our human wisdom. We don't part easily with what it is that we've worked to develop so long over our lives. And John 9 is a biblical illustration that illustrates the trouble that we have with seeing, seeing the works of God in our midst. It's a devastating account, really, of a group of religious people. It was a religious community, the Jewish community. many of whom were leaders they were all unable together to recognize the work of God in their midst and they actually missed the opportunity to be a part of what God was doing they missed the opportunity to be on board with God's work in the world everyone in John 9 saw the same thing or saw evidence of it everyone in John 9 saw the blind man healed but all of them had difficulty recognizing and naming it as the work of God among them the disciples were asking the wrong question the neighbors were stuck in an old paradigm the pharisees were concerned with protecting the religious system that they were a part of and then the parents were just scared to death to say what they had seen because they were afraid that they would be put out they were afraid that it would put them in opposition with the religious leaders and so they were afraid to stand in that place where they said yes a miracle did happen in our family today so sadly in this particular story we see that sometimes those who are most spiritual those who think they walk with Jesus most closely those who have spent a lifetime trying to uphold the the rules and regulations of what they feel God has told them to do sometimes those are the people who are most out of touch with the will of God and so as we enter into this story more deeply today the prayer is that you would be willing to allow God to show you where you might be in the story and as we enter into this story you might even want to become aware of a place in your own life where you are seeking to know the will of God and to do it, and where you have a question that you realize is not going to be solved at the level of your human wisdom and thinking, and you desperately want a word from the Lord, you desperately want to have a sense of what God is up to so that you can join God in it, and you're really not sure. If you could allow that situation in your own life to come to the surface of your consciousness today, and then move through this story wondering with God, where am I in this story? Which one of these characters am I? So let's look at this story for a moment and see what's really going on. You know, it begins as the story of a blind person. And you know, the telling of stories about Jesus healing blind people is one of the most pervasive stories in the New Testament. We see that story told more than any other story in the New Testament. Jesus seemed to always be healing blind people. Why do you think that is? I have an idea. I wonder if it's because this journey from spiritual blindness to spiritual sight is not a beautiful metaphor of the whole spiritual journey. That the spiritual journey can be understood as the movement from seeing God nowhere or seeing God only where we expect to see him to seeing God everywhere and especially where we don't expect to see him. It's this ever-increasing capacity to see and to discern the work of God in our lives and in our midst as a community so that we can respond and be a part of it. So in this particular case, the healing of the story of the blind man, or the healing of the blind man is just the beginning of the story. The rest of the story, there's 42 verses, it's a very long chapter, and the rest of the story is about spiritual blindness and how and why we can be so blind. So the story begins with Jesus seeing the blind man. And when that happens, that is really good news. When Jesus sees you and turns his attention to you, that is really good news. It is a wonderful thing to be seen by Jesus in our glory and in our grime, in our beauty and in our brokenness, in our possibilities and in our impossibilities. And when we are seen by Jesus in this way and we open ourselves to an honest interaction with Jesus in this place, the possibilities are endless. But unfortunately, the story goes downhill from there. Because the disciples saw the blind man too. And they used this man's misfortune as an opportunity for theological and philosophical debate. And their question was, who sinned, this man or his parents? And what is so striking about this is that the disciples were the ones that had been walking most closely with Jesus, and they were the most out of touch of the heart of Jesus in this moment. They were the most out of touch with the essence of our Christianity, which is love and compassion, and love and compassion in the world in which we live. So in this question, there was no love and compassion. There was no concern for his well-being. Instead, they turned this man into an object lesson. They reduced him to a specimen, and they used him to satiate their own intellectual curiosity. And in doing this, they distanced themselves from the raw humanity of the situation. They distanced themselves from their own calling as Christ followers to be compassionate in the world. And instead of seeing this experience as an occasion to care for another human being, they didn't ask any sort of question like what can we do to help, you know, or anything like that. Instead, they distanced from him and made him a specimen. And then they added insult to injury by asking the blame question, which is never a good question, right? The blame question never takes you anywhere that's good. The question, whose fault is it that this happened? Was it his sin or his parents' sin? This blame question was so wrong for so many reasons, because first of all, it was a question that was shaped by their cultural and theological biases rather than their ability to be open to something new. And the bias in that culture was that when there was sin, it was a very superstitious culture still, even though the Jews were moving in some new directions, they were still very connected to the superstitions of their past. And there was this superstitious belief that anything bad that happened in the world had to be because somebody sinned. This was an old idea. This was not part of what Jesus was teaching them, but they were still stuck, systemically stuck, in a way of thinking that was inaccurate and that It produced a very wrong question. So first of all, it came out of a cultural and theological bias that was just not helpful at all. It was a part of their life together that had not yet been redeemed. It was a part of their cultural life together where they had not yet experienced the new wind of the Spirit. And then secondly, the question was just the wrong question because it framed the situation so narrowly. It allowed for only two outcomes. And neither one was positive, was it? it was either the man who sinned or the parents who sinned there was no good outcome to that question and when that question was framed so narrowly it left no other options open and this is polarity thinking at its finest where we have two polarities and we think that never the twain can meet and so we fall down on one polarity or the other because that helps us to figure stuff out but it is rarely God's way. God does not think in polarities. God thinks in unifying concepts, that things that seem to be so disparate and separate actually in God find their way together into a profound kind of integration. And so the polarity that these disciples were trying to force Jesus into was actually kind of an either-or sort of thing that really wasn't all that helpful. And it was a way of approaching a situation that avoided all subtlety. There was no fine nuance here. It created a false dichotomy instead of framing the situation in a way where there could be hope and healing. And so the disciples, even though they had been walking with Jesus for a long time, were still caught up in a structural, systemic sort of blindness that they were all participating in together. And so Jesus calls this out right away. And he actually says to them, we need to reframe this conversation right here because this is a false dichotomy. This is not a train of conversation that's going to take us anywhere positive. And actually in Jesus' response, he's actually pointing out the fact that they're asking the wrong question. Neither this man or his parents sinned. That's an old way of seeing. That's an old way of interpreting reality. It has nothing to do with the spiritual reality that's unfolding right here, right now. This man was born blind so that the works of God can be revealed in and through his life. That possibility hadn't even occurred to the disciples. Their systemic way of thinking had produced the wrong question in the first place. The right question, according to Jesus, was what is God doing in this situation and how can I get on board with it? That's what Jesus was really saying. Can we get better at noticing what God's doing in this situation so that we can get on board with it? And in fact, that is the very best kind of a question that we can ask in the context of the brokenness and the impossibility of the human situation. I don't think Jesus was trying to sugarcoat anything here. I don't think he was trying to avoid the harsh realities of sin in the world. Yes, there is evil in the world. Yes, there is sin with all its tragic consequence. Yes, there is a complex web of cause and effect relationships between all the elements that are at work in the human experience, but what good does the blame question do at this point anyway? The real question is, what is God going to do with it? And in that way, Jesus engaged the heartbreak and the complexity of the human situation because he connected it with the possibility that God could be at work. And when we can connect the complexity and the pain of the human situation with the possibilities that God can bring, then we are engaging the world in a discerning way. That is the discernment question. What is God doing here? Even when it's painful, even when it's broken, even when it's dark, the discernment question is, what is God doing here? And how can I get on board with it? And Jesus says, we must work the works of him who sent me while it is still day. And then he proceeded to do exactly that, and he proceeded to heal the blind man. so one of the first things we learn about discernment recognizing the work of God in the world is that it will always lead us towards concrete expressions of love with real people rather than theoretical conversations about theology and philosophy and some of us really love that stuff some of us really love to get into our heads and talk that way but discernment being in touch with the sacred heart of Jesus is always going to lead us to a loving response in our world, and it's always going to be fairly concrete. So we can have the theological conversations, but they must always be leading us to love. They must always be leading us to the possibility of being God's loving agents in the world. And so the disciples' experience of being blind to the work of God in their midst is sobering, I think, for many of us who have been on a Christian path for a while. There are many of us here who have been walking with Jesus for a long time and we would probably like to think, I know the heart of Jesus. I know what Jesus is trying to do here. I'm in touch. But the disciples show us that we're all at risk. Even those of us who have been walking with Jesus for a long time intimately, we are all at risk of missing the point entirely, missing what God is doing in the world. And so I'm hoping that perhaps some of us might be honest enough today to realize, oh, that's me. I've been asking the wrong questions. And it's been so theoretical and so philosophical and I've been so caught up in my head that I have missed opportunities to be compassionate and to be loving in the world, to love the ones that Jesus himself loves. So that's the first category of persons in the story. Then there are the neighbors and the neighbors are stuck in their old paradigms. The neighbors were the people that saw the same blind man every single day. They saw him doing the same thing. He was begging by the side of the road and they were very intimate with this situation. In fact, I wonder if some of these neighbors hadn't been around when the blind man was born because this community hung together. The Jewish community hung together. They had no place else to be. So what I imagine is that some of these neighbors were actually around when the child was born. They had agonized and grieved with the parents when this man was born blind, and they had seen the same thing all of their lives, and it was so ingrained in them, they were so used to seeing things a certain way that they could not get outside of their paradigm and see this new thing for what it is. A blind man who could now see, and particularly this blind man who could now see, it was so far outside what they were accustomed to seeing every day that they couldn't get it. They couldn't see what they were not ready to see. And so the neighbors were afflicted, as we all are, with cognitive filters that helped them to categorize and to make sense of reality. And the problem, of course, is that these unconscious filters, which were developed over years of interacting with the situation in the same way, prevented them from seeing this new thing that Jesus was doing among them. And what's so funny about the neighbors, well, it would be funny if it wasn't so sad, is that they even tried to talk themselves out of what they were seeing. Did you hear that in the story? That they tried to question whether or not it was even the same man that they had seen day in and day out. And so what follows is this very circuitous conversation in which they cannot even agree on whether or not this was the man that they had seen every day. And all the while, the blind man is over there saying, hey, it is me, it's me, it's me. And the neighbors are saying, is this really the man? So do you see what happens here? Because they're not ready to see what's happening right there in front of their eyes. They're finding ways to talk themselves out of what they're seeing. This is what we do. This is what cognitive filters do. And we develop them over years of time, and all of us have them. And so the neighbor's predicament points out another sobering facet of the difficulty that we have with discerning and doing the will of God. And that is that we can only see what we're ready to see and what we expect to see and sometimes even what we desire to see. How desperately we need spiritual practices and experiences and questions that help us to get outside of our paradigms so that we can see old realities in new ways. And then there were the Pharisees. And the Pharisees were the religious leaders of the day. And they were the most faithful and presumably the most committed followers of God in their day. They were very pious. They thought they knew what was going on spiritually. And they felt it was their job to uphold a meticulous observance of the law. And we have people like that in the Christian world today. People who think it is their whole job to tear down other Christians and to point out the ways in which they think they're wrong. And there's this new thing happening. and they're on the outside of it by their choice because they are preserving the system as they have known it. And I would say presumably their own place in it. Whenever we find ourselves intensely trying to preserve a system that we're a part of, it could be a work environment, it could be the way our family does things, it could be the church environment. Whenever we find ourselves intensely trying to preserve the system that we're a part of, we might also wanna ask ourselves, am I trying to preserve my place in this system? because I realize that if this system were to change, that my place in it might change too. And I'm not willing for that. I'm not open for that. So among the Jewish leaders in particular, the Sabbath keeping was the litmus test. And if you read the whole passage, which we didn't have time to do today, you'll see that the Jewish leaders called attention to the fact that Jesus did this healing on the Sabbath. And that was the litmus test for true spirituality in their environment. and they chose to draw attention to the Sabbath issue rather than celebrating what Jesus had done. And I find this also to be an extremely sobering moment in this story because here there was this fresh wind of the Spirit blowing and it was Jesus himself who was right there with them and they could not recognize him. And in fact, in all their religiosity, they came against the works of God in that moment that were being performed through Jesus himself. No one, none of the religious leaders in this situation gave this man a high five and said, wow, you can see, what is that like? You haven't ever been able to see, what's it like to see a tree? What's it like to see this human face? What's it like to see birds in the air? What's it like to see blue sky? What's it like? None of the religious leaders thought to give this man a high five and celebrate what Jesus had done in his life. It is heartbreaking that the religious leaders were the ones that of all the characters in the story came over and against and moved themselves into an oppositional relationship with what Jesus was doing. And the Sabbath gave these religious leaders the perfect way to do it. Gave them the perfect excuse to focus on the Sabbath issue rather than to focus on what God was doing. And you could almost hear the Pharisees saying, what will we do if people start running around doing kind, loving things on the Sabbath? That'll just ruin everything we're trying to do around here. You know? I mean, it was so far against the heart of who Jesus was. So in a desperate attempt to control the situation, they chose to denigrate Jesus' character as a way of dismissing him. But there were a few brave souls who raised the question, well, how can a man who's a sinner perform such miracles? And this caused so much division among them that they tried going over the details again with the healed man one more time. And they were looking for clues to Jesus' identity, but it wasn't a real question. They had already decided. And if you look at your Bible passage, you will see this. They had already decided that Jesus was a sinner. They had already decided that Jesus was not the Messiah. And they had already agreed together that if anyone tried to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah, they would be put out. And so then in that milieu, they called the parents to come and to give witness to what had happened. So by this time, the interest of the whole community had been piqued. The Jews were refusing to believe that a blind man had actually received his sight, and so they called the parents in for an interview. But this was actually more like an interrogation, and the parents knew it. They knew that these religious leaders were not seeking truth about the situation. The whole community now was colluding to protect the status quo. Do you know what I mean by colluding? It means that the whole community was now participating together in trying to maintain their system in the blindness in which it existed. They were all working together to do so. It was unconscious, but they were all working together to do it. And so the parents were afraid. They were rightly afraid because they were common people. They were the defenseless poor. They were trying to survive in a religious system. that was oppressive and punishing and sometimes even exploitive. And so when the leaders called them into their midst to testify about what had taken place, they came quaking in their boots, knowing they needed to be very careful about what they were going to say. The parents were in a different category. They had seen, they knew for sure that Jesus had performed a miracle, and yet they were afraid to answer truthfully for fear that they might be punished. And they were also afraid that they might be expelled from the religious community that they were a part of because for a Jew at that time to be cut off from the religious community would have meant that they had no way to worship God. They would have no way to make their sacrifices, to receive forgiveness for their sins. The milieu in which they lived was very different than our own. We've got churches on every corner. If we don't like one church, we just go to another church, right? And there's a lot of people that just move through churches in a neighborhood trying to find what they want. Well, the Jews didn't have that option. There was no other option. It was be a part of this religious community or be on the outside. And so the parents were very afraid. And when the Pharisees asked, is this your son who you say was born blind, how then does he see? They said, yes, he is our son. Yes, he was born blind. But how is it that he sees? Well, we can't answer that on grounds that might incriminate us. Ask him. He is of age. He will speak for himself. And to me, this is the most tragic moment in the story because on a day that should have been one of the happiest days of their life as parents, a day of great celebration, these parents were afraid to name and to celebrate what God had done in their life in the midst of their community. Think about what it would have been like for you. What if you had been the parent who had given birth to a blind child, and that child became a man, and then that man had to make a living by begging on the side of the road, and there was nothing you could do about it. And on one day, Jesus comes and heals your son, and this thing that has been a heartbreak in your family for so, so long gets fixed, it gets healed, and all you want to do is hug each other and weep and cry and give each other high fives and talk about what's possible for him now. But instead, the community that you're a part of cannot celebrate with you. and they find ways to even dismiss what's happened in your life. And on top of that, they find ways to expel you because they cannot acknowledge the miracle that's happened in your life. And so I think what we see here is the tale of two journeys. That's what I call it. This story is the tale of two journeys. The people in the community were on the journey deeper and deeper into spiritual blindness, but the blind man himself was on a very different journey. he was on a journey of spiritual sight. While everyone around him was asking the wrong question, arguing, posturing, maneuvering, trying to trip each other up, the healed man is on a journey now of increasing spiritual sight as to who Jesus really is. Early in the story, he calls Jesus a man. Then he calls Jesus a prophet. Then he calls Jesus a man who comes from God. Then he calls Jesus the son of man. You can read the story and see all these places where the blind man's address to Jesus changes. Then he finally makes a full confession of faith, and he falls down on his face in Jesus' presence, and he says, Lord, I believe, and he worshiped him. And that, my friends, is a good journey. But where does all that clarity get him? Well, if you keep reading, you understand that it gets him expelled from the community. The religious leaders do indeed expel him from the community. but the beauty of the situation is that sometimes when we're expelled from a particular community because people don't want to acknowledge what's going on in our lives, sometimes we lose the group but we gain an encounter with Jesus and that's what happens because Jesus has such great compassion for this blind man that when he sees what happens he actually seeks this man out outside the community, and he seeks this man out to give him one more gift, and the gift is helping him to make sense of what happened to him on this day. And in fact, Jesus seems to indicate in this passage that sometimes it is the expelled one who actually has a head start in understanding the message, because usually they've been expelled from what is unreal anyway. So Jesus comes to this man, and they have a real intimate interaction, Jesus gently asks him, do you believe in the Son of Man? Who is he, sir? Tell me that I may believe in him. You have seen him. That is such good news. You have seen him, and the one speaking with you is he. And after such a long and wearying day, and after waiting so long for a place to rest his soul, the healed man simply gives it up. He finally gives himself over to his deepest knowing. he finally stops arguing and involving himself in what other people care to think about and he says lord i believe and he worships him and so then jesus gives him this one last gift jesus says let me help you make sense of what happened to you here today he says i've come into this world to give sight to the blind and to make blind those who see and it was pretty clear that the healed man was in the first category he was blind and the pharisees were more than a little concerned about where jesus comment put them in the whole scheme of things because right at the end of the passage they're kind of nudging one another they're close by over here evidently they can kind of hear what's going on and they say to each other surely we're not blind are we he's not talking about us is he he's not implying that we're blind is he and jesus goes right on to say he know he says you know it would be better for you if you were because if you were blind you would not have sin but now that you say i see your sin remains. That is the punchline of the whole story. If you were blind, you would not have sin, but now that you say we see, your sin remains. And so we discover that discernment, being able to recognize and respond to the presence and to the activity of God in our midst, begins in this most humble place. It begins with the willingness to admit that we're blind. Jesus is saying here, only those who admit they're blind can grow. Those who are convinced that they can see and stubbornly refuse to admit their need for healing will never be able to see anything new. They will not be able to progress on the spiritual journey like the blind man did. And so true discernment begins with this admission that we're really not good at seeing. And it begins when we acknowledge the fact that we lack wisdom. That wisdom that comes from God, we don't have it. We might have a lot of intellectual smarts, but we don't have the wisdom that is from God. And discernment begins when we touch, get in touch with our blindness, and we're willing to cry out from that place, my teacher, I want to see. So when you think about the issue that you're bringing today, the place in your own life where you are seeking discernment, where you want to know the wisdom of God, can you cry out in that place? Can you begin your discernment process by saying, I am blind, but I want to see. My teacher I want to see. And then can you ask Jesus perhaps where am I in this story? Am I like the disciples who are asking the wrong question? Do you suspect that you might be asking the wrong question and that you could cultivate spiritual seeing by asking a different kind of question? Do your questions have to do with blame and shame or does it have to do with loving real people? Could you be brave enough to ask the question what would love call me to? What would it mean to be compassionate here? What would it mean for me to make a choice that was actually loving? and how can I get on board with the loving thing in my situation? If you're like the neighbors and you resonate with the neighbors where you're so stuck in your own paradigms that you can't see anything outside, would you ask God, would you be brave enough to ask God to show you your paradigms for what they are? Not necessarily bad, they're just limited. Our paradigms aren't bad, they help us survive, they help us to function, but they're just limited. They actually can keep this new thing that God wants to do in our lives outside of our awareness. so could you be brave enough to ask God what are the paradigms that are holding me back right now from seeing your work in the world and participating in it where are you bigger and more and outside of my way of thinking and constructing my world that is a really brave question God where are you bigger and more and outside my own way of thinking and if you're not willing to ask that question you're only going to end up with the God of your own small mind sometimes we have to ask the question God where are you bigger and more and outside of the ways that I usually think perhaps you have some sort of an inkling that you might be like the Pharisees that you're so caught up in preserving some system that you're a part of even your own inner system even your own inner thought life that has to do with your own ego that you're so intent on preserving that system that way of doing things that there are things that are more important to you really than God and what God's doing that really if you were to be honest preserving your own system is more important to you than what God is doing and what God wants to do. And you could ask yourself, what am I trying to protect? What am I afraid of here? What do I stand to lose if I were to really see what God is up to and if I were to really seek to join God in that? Is there a place where God might be calling me to lose my life in order to gain it? These are brave questions as well. And remember, when we ask that kind of question, we don't stand to lose anything that's of real value anyway. All we have to lose is our false ego self and its attachments, which is an illusion anyway. And then we might even think that we're a little bit like the parents, those of them who knew that something really great had happened, something really miraculous, and they wanted so desperately to stand in that place and to say, yes, in our family, this wonderful thing has happened today. But they're afraid to do it because they were afraid of what response they would get. Do you have a place like that in your life where something really good is going on between you and God, something new, something fresh, something miraculous, and you're afraid to say it to your community, you're afraid to say it to the people close to you because you're afraid that they won't understand, you're afraid that they'll think you're weird, you're afraid that you'll find yourself outside of the in-group, whatever group that is for you. Richard Rohr says that it's easier to belong to a group than to belong to God. Sometimes we are more attached to the group that we're a part of. We're so attached that we're unwilling to name this true thing that God is doing in our hearts. So my prayer, my prayer, and it's already happening here in this community. You have leaders who are cultivating a community for discernment, cultivating a community where this kind of thing can go on personally and also when you're together. It's a great gift. Stay in this community because if you stay, you will learn about discernment and you will get better and better at recognizing and responding to the will of God in your life and in the life of the community because your leaders are committed to being a community for discernment. But would you be brave too in your own personal prayer and in your own personal relationship with God? Would you be brave? And would you ask God to help you to find yourself in this powerful, sobering story? And would you be committed to getting on the journey from spiritual blindness to spiritual sight, the journey from seeing God nowhere or seeing God only where we expect to see him to finally seeing God everywhere, especially where we least expect to see him. So let's stand together. I have a prayer of healing. This is a prayer for the healing of our sight. We're gonna pray together today that God would heal our sight, not only for our own good, but also for the good of the world. And so we pray. God, we put ourselves in your presence today, and we pray. Heal our inner sight, oh God, that we may know the difference between good and evil. Open our eyes that we may see what is true and what is false. Restore us to wisdom that we may be well in our souls. Restore us to wisdom that we and our world may be well. Heal our inner sight. Oh God, get us on the right journey, we pray. In Jesus' name, for Jesus' sake and for the sake of the world that Jesus loves. Amen. Thank you.
