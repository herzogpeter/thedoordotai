Open your Bibles with me to the book of Ephesians, the fifth chapter, the 18th verse. Ephesians chapter 5, verse 18. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father, and be subject one to another in the fear of Christ. Let's pray. Lord, this morning I feel like I need you in a very special way to do far more than preach and teach, but to share the things I feel and not only struggled with this week, but am struggling with now. And I pray, Father, that as I share my struggle, that through it we will see more and more what it means to really be full of you and not full of us. I ask that in your name Amen Be filled with the Spirit I've started my sermons for six straight weeks With that little phrase We have buried ourselves In this particular text This week God began to grip my heart Concerning this text and I don't even know if the things that I feel like I need to share with you are going to be shared to their fullest extent pray for me as I preach and share with you I want so for you to see a piece of me that can help us all be more real and relate to this in a living way I feel that we have buried ourselves and studied this particular text to such a degree that it's almost to the point in a joking way I could say that anything you wanted to know about the filling of the Spirit we know we know it all we've done it all there have been no stones left unturned and I might add not only did we do it and not only did we study it and not only did we use the Greek and exegete and all these wonderful things, but we did it well. We did it very well. I want you to think for a moment of all the things we know after six weeks of having studied this text. We know that this passage is the key to the whole book of Ephesians. We know for sure that there is no way in the world that we can apply the things we're about to study in the next several weeks and maybe months in chapter 6 and the rest of chapter 5, that we can even understand anything about the battle unless we understand what it means to be filled with the Spirit. We know that. We know that this is the focus, the turning point of the whole book of Ephesians. We know that, but we know more than that. We know that this filling is letting the Word of Christ dwell in us richly. We found out that that's synonymous with the filling of the Spirit, Colossians 3. Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly is the same thing as being filled with the Spirit. We know that. We know that being filled with the Spirit is kind of like practicing the presence of Christ. We know that too. We know that the filling of the Spirit involves some things I don't do. I know that the filling of the Spirit involves not quenching the Spirit and not grieving the Spirit. And so what I'm supposed to do is remove all those things that do both of those. I know those things. It's wonderful. We know that the filling of the Spirit is not some mysterious, mystical experience. It's simple. And after we kind of studied this whole thing, I remember kind of feeling while I was even in the pulpit, wondering and scratching my little intellectual head, why is it not self-evident to everyone? these wonderful truths that we're discovering. It's just so simple and so clear. Almost coming to the point where I was thinking, well, they just don't understand it, and we do. It is not neat. We know, because we've spent so much time that this text breaks down into three very nice segments, we know that it comes off with a contrast, be not drunk with wine, and that is being contrasted to the command. The command is this, be filled with the Spirit. And we discovered right off the bat that this is not an option for the believer. This is something I can't just kind of pick and choose and kind of feel like the filling of the Spirit might be something I'd like to get involved in. And if it isn't, it doesn't matter. It does matter. It's not an option. It's a command. We discovered that there are consequences. The three segments were the contrast, the command, and then the consequences. Real nice. We know all that. We know very well that the believer, and I feel that we have been taught well, that the believer is, every believer is a possessor of the Holy Spirit. We're not shabby on that. We're not shallow on that. We understand. Every believer is a possessor of the Holy Spirit. Every believer is indwelt with the Holy Spirit. Every believer has been baptized by the Spirit into the body of Christ. Every believer has been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. All of those things took place at the point that we believed. We also know that not every believer has been filled with the Spirit. Not every believer is being filled continually with the Spirit. We even learned in these past few weeks what filled means. The word play ra'o. Remember that? There were three meanings for it and we got all excited and I got all excited. One of the meanings is kind of the first shade of meaning is to fill the sails with wind. Play ra'o. To be full and to be born along by the wind of the Spirit. We know that there's another shade of meaning, and that is to be permeated. Like a chocolate going into chocolate milk. And permeation. We also learn that it means basically control. Absolute domination by the Spirit. We know that. It's wonderful. We learned also some of the nuances of the Greek grammar, that it's in the present tense. And so basically, we understand that this filling of the Spirit is not a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience, but we are instructed to be being continually filled. So it's a continuous thing. It's a moment by moment. It's a commitment for now. It's a walking step by step by the control of the Holy Spirit. It's a walk. It's a step at a time. We know that. It's wonderful. We know it's in the imperative mode. Again, I told you that. It's not an option. This is normal Christian living. We know that. And I got real excited, and I remember saying, this is not going to be a mediocre church, and we can't sell it for mediocrity, and that can't be one of the things we're going into. maybe it's because I studied it so much but I left feeling like boy we really did our homework we did our study and everybody knows what it means to be filled with the spirit we dug deeply into the text and we see and we know and we understand and good for us because God is well pleased for we see and understand things that are less intellectual and less intelligent and less spiritual people never do. And we not only know and understand the contrast and the command, but we understand even the consequences. We understand the nature of the filling of the Spirit, and we understand how to be filled with the Spirit, and we understand how not to be filled with the Spirit. We even see the consequences, the real consequences, you know, that we sing and we say thanks and we submit and great and everything's all there. And by the way, it's all right. Everything we've learned is all right. I need to pray again. I need to pray, Lord, free me from this, the notes. So I can share. Amen. I like being right. Feels real safe. When I'm right, I feel real strong. And I spend a lot of time making sure I'm right. I study long hours, and I even let people know I do, like I just did. See, I'm really basically no different than any of you. When I get up here, I feel real insecure. And I'm real afraid of getting in front of people like this. But I'm not afraid if I know I'm right. You know, if I've got the answers and it's all there, and I know it's right, and if you argue with me, you've got to argue with the Bible. I feel real strong. I feel real afraid of doing things like this. because I'm not sure it's right. And one of the best ways I have of handling the times I'm afraid to tell you how I feel and to tell you what I'm struggling with, one of the ways I handle it is the same way some of us handle it, all of us, is I just get right. I just make sure I'm right. And then no one can attack me and no one can question me and no one can question you, and I just surround myself with all sorts of right answers. The first thing I have to ask myself as we're going through this is, is there something, and maybe you're, well, is there something wrong with being right? I mean, is the last five weeks we spent studying, is there something wrong with it? No, nothing. We need to have the knowledge. We must have direction. I don't know how many times I've said it, and I'm going to say it over and over again, that we don't even know how to respond unless we've laid the foundation. Maybe what we've been doing for five weeks has led us to this, or led me to this. But sometimes for me, being right becomes a kind of armor that I wear. It's, again, it's strong. It's like a fortress. No one can jab me in. If they do, they've got to argue with scripture kind of thing. It's a fortress I live in. It protects me from being really seen. Same thing with you. We all do this. And let me just share too. One of the reasons I feel okay in sharing this is because I feel like I'm just normal enough that if I'm struggling with some of this and do some of these weird things that you do too. That fortress, even though it feels safe, it also feels cumbersome. And even though it feels safe, you know what it doesn't feel? It doesn't feel free. It feels right. But it doesn't feel free. And it doesn't feel alive. And it doesn't feel like God. It feels like me. I like being right. Because when I'm right, I feel strong, and I feel like I'm in control. And when I preach, I like to feel like I'm in control. And when I'm right, I feel bold. It's great. The best thing is about being right and doing all the homework, you know, and having it all and telling you the three ways, the Greek word, is that when I know I'm right, I don't have to be real. when I know I'm right I don't have to be real it helps it's nice it's good when it works out that way but I don't have to be being right protects me and I go on and I can be in the pulpit and zing ya. And I feel strong when I do. And God dealt with me this week. Because when I feel strong, right, I don't feel strong at all. And when I get myself consumed in being right, again, there's nothing wrong with being right. But when I focus on that and it becomes the source of my strength, all of a sudden I'm not real at all this was a strange week for me I got to the office on Tuesday and began to do what I normally do I began to study and I got further into the text and I've been thrilled with what we've been doing I think it's been exciting and I'm not trying and I wouldn't want you to negate the things we've learned in the last few weeks it's only that God has dealt with me and I need to share it but I began to study and I was going to the second consequence remember last week the first consequence of the spirit filled life was singing and we just had a ball last week and what a tremendous time of fellowship and that was real and I got into the next one and it was this always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God even the Father great text wonderful it even broke down right now excellent I can do this always giving thanks okay when do you give thanks always okay for what do you give thanks all things I don't care if you're going through bad things or good things. We always give thanks for all things. Who do you give thanks to? God the Father. Even to the Father. And then we're subject to one another. It broke down real nice. And suddenly it began to hit me. And I had this terrible fear that what we were going to do was get right back into a cycle that we've been trying to prevent ever since we got into this concept of being filled with the Spirit. And that was this. That we'd have a bunch of people who were leaving and trying like crazy to be thankful. Because that's what Christians are. Christians are thankful. And we have a bunch of people leaving who are trying like crazy to sing a song. Because Christians sing a song. Spirit-filled Christians sing a song. And we have a bunch of Christians who are wanting to demonstrate that they had a spirit-filled life. Would be trying like crazy to be subject to one another. And then we're going to go on. And the reason I think it's important that we stop right here and evaluate this. Is because the rest of everything we're going to be doing for the next few weeks is going to be these results. And I can just see as we look down the road. All of us together, trying like crazy to be the wife that God wanted you to be. And trying like crazy to be the husband that God wanted me to be. And trying like crazy to be the child God wanted me to be. And trying like crazy. Instead of trying like crazy to get in touch with what it means to be filled with the Spirit, so those things just begin to flow out of my life. Do you ever, in the quietness of your own heart, wonder, even as you sit here right now, do you ever wonder if people would still love you if they really knew you? Let's even take it further. Maybe they'd love you because we're a loving church. Do you think they'd respect you? Let's say you're an elder, a pastor, song leader, piano player, just Sunday school teacher, somebody who comes all the time and you're just distant enough that nobody really knows you. But you're coming every Sunday and you just kind of think, this is really great because maybe, you know, it's real safe not to know anybody too because you can come and kind of sit and really kind of get in with it and assume that people don't know you that well so they assume that you're moving along with all these things and that's why you're here and it's wonderful. Do you ever sit and wonder that if they really knew you, they wouldn't love you and they wouldn't respect you? Did you ever just sit there and think, well, I'll tell you, if they knew what it was really like at my house, if they knew the way I really talked to my husband, or the way I really talked to my wife, or if they knew how I really acted at work, or if they knew, maybe I got my act down, and so the act is no problem, but if they knew how I really felt inside, and if they really knew, and maybe you're an elder, let's say, and you have all sorts of doubts, and if they really knew about the doubts I had, and if they really knew that sometimes I feel like I don't know God at all, and if they really knew, and because that fear so often is so great for us, what we do is we just go on and we pretend that I don't have those fears and I don't have those questions and I don't have any of those weaknesses and I go on being real strong and surrounding myself with being right. And it feels real good. But you know what? It doesn't feel good at all. It feels right, but it doesn't feel real. And it doesn't feel free. And you know what it doesn't feel? It doesn't feel full. it doesn't feel full what we feel when we're doing that is we feel phony and we feel bound up and we feel empty and we feel weak and so what we do is we continue to search for things that I can do or I can say or I can get involved in that will convince me and everyone else around me that I'm none of those things that I'm not a phony I don't want anybody to think I'm a phony that I'm not bound up I don'T want anybody to think I'm bound up that I'm not empty I want everybody to think I'm full that'm not weak I want everybody to think I'm strong and so I look for things I can do and I look for things I can say and I even maybe maybe that's what I do when I learn all the cliches of the church because whenI learn all the cliches that are used around here and I use them then everybody thinks I'm strong and what happens when I get doing that the cycle just continues and instead of instead of not feeling phony anymore, I feel more phony. And instead of not feeling bound up anymore, because I've gotten some behaviors that make people think I'm not, but I feel more bound up than I ever did. And insteadof not feeling empty anymore because I've found some behaviors queues that make people think I'm not empty, but I'm really doing the work of the Lord, I feel more empty. And instead of feeling stronger, because I'm trying to convince people that I'm strong, I feel weaker than I ever felt. But the cycle continues and I keep doing it and I keep looking for those kinds of things. And the incredible paradox of Christianity is this, that it is only, the only way I'm ever set free from these things is to begin to reveal those things about me that I fear most. To finally come to a place where I see myself as a hypocrite because that's what I am. You think I'm a hypocrite? You're right. You think I'm empty? You're right. You think I'm weak? You're right. And you know what happens? I quit trying to convince everybody that I'm all those wonderful things and you know what happens? Then God begins to do His work in me. And then I'm strong and then I'm real. and then I'm full. I really debated over whether I wanted to even share any of this. They're going to think I'm nuts. They already know I'm nuts. They'll think I'm weak. I am. So are you. One of my fears is that you just won't get it. that I won't make any sense. I've got to share something. You know one of the things that makes me feel strong? Is the very fact that I prepare so hard. That I never come into the pulpit without knowing exactly what I'm going to say. And then I feel like the Holy Spirit energizes it. And I even get upset when I hear people say, I go into the pulpit and I just trust the Holy Spirit to give me words to say. I go, yeah. you know what happened to me this week the words I usually have to say just weren't coming I would sit in my couch or I would sit in a chair and I would spend some time with the Lord and it would begin to flow and I would begin to feel it and I would begin to see what he was trying to tell me and then I'd go to the paper and try to write it down and it just went away right now and coming before you and having a big, large segment of what I want to share with you, not even knowing what I was going to say, is something that is terribly frightening to me. Because I don't want to look weak. I want to look strong. I want to be right. See, if I just talk from my heart, I might not be right. And I get my strength from there. this week we're not talking about being filled with the Spirit I trust that this week what is happening here is for me anyway I'm not talking about being filled I am it isn't because I'm strong it's because I feel so terribly weak that's my confession I hope you heard it I think some of you might be there but there's some comfort in this too comfort for me and I want to share it with you because you know what comforts me it comforts me I can't remember the quote exactly C.S. Lewis said it though I read it this week there's nothing that builds a bond of friendship like realizing that when I share something with you you've had the same thing happen to you and we identify well it was a great comfort to me to go to the word of God this week and see that somebody like the apostle Paul struggled with the same thing the apostle Paul was the very first one to verbalize this bizarre paradox the bizarre paradox is simply this that when I am weak then I am strong you see the problem with Paul was he was the kind of guy who did have enough intellect and he did have enough energy and he did have enough ability and he did have enough charisma and he did have enough just plain self-discipline to come to a portion of scripture like Ephesians 5, 20 he had spent his whole life being that kind of person he had spent his whole life learning how to be strong He had spent his whole life learning how to be right. He went to the greatest teachers and he was successful at everything he did. He spent his whole life learning how to have the right answers. And how to measure up. And how to perform. And how to be self-disciplined. And how to create in his life all the characteristics that a good Jew was supposed to have. If anybody could boast in what he did, Paul could do it. And Paul, maybe more than anyone else, could come to these kinds of truths and characteristics that need to characterize us as believers and do them. The problem with Paul was this. The problem with Paul was this. that Paul was insightful enough to realize that when these characteristics that characterize the Spirit-filled life were being produced by him, were being produced because he had enough self-discipline to be loving and to be forgiving and to be humble, at least to appear that way, that while many people would be convinced that he was a great man of God, that he had enough insight into Scripture and walked closely enough to the Lord to realize that when he produced them, you know who people saw? They saw Paul. And they patted Paul on the back and they exalted Paul and they said, oh, what a man. And that is why in 1 Corinthians 2, Paul says this, I do not come to you in superiority of speech, proclaiming to you the testimony of God. Why? Because I don't want you to see Paul. I want you to see something bigger. I want you to see God. I want you to see Christ. And what is really ironic about Paul, please get this, about Paul saying, I do not come to you in superiority of speech and great wisdom. You know what's so ironic about that is because, again, if there was anybody who could have come, who could have come with superiority of speech and blown him away, it was Paul. And he could have come and he could have said, this is right. And I see him in that text in 1 Corinthians stripping away all of his protection, stripping away all the things that made him feel safe and that was his intellect and his self-discipline and his ability to create all these things. And he said, I came to you, and I just babbled in front of you, because I wanted you to see God. In fact, just getting a little bit of the tension of what was going on when Paul shared that. He says this, I didn't come to you in superior speech, that would have been easy. But he was coming to a group of people in Corinth, I think we know, we've talked about them over and over again, who were a carnal group. And they were fleshly. And they were real impressed with externals. And they wanted their superstars to act like superstars. And they wanted their pastors to look like pastors. And they wanted their apostles to act like apostles. And Paul just irritated the dickens out of them when he came and refused to act like a superstar. They wanted him to blow them away. They wanted to be impressed with all the external things Paul could do. You know, do wonderful things. And he came to them and says, I am determined among you to know nothing except Christ. I know that you want me to act that way. I know you want me to act strong and together. And I know you want me to act cool. But I can't because I'm not. Verse 3. In 1 Corinthians chapter 2, he says this, I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. What a dumb thing to say when people are blasting you because you're weak and you have fear and you tremble. What a dumb thing to tell him. What if he had any sense at all, he would have built himself up and said, yeah, I'll show you. Verse 4, he says, my message, again, was not a persuasive words of wisdom, but a demonstration of the Spirit of God. Why? So that your faith wouldn't rest in me, so that your faith wouldn't rest in any man, but that it would rest in God. They wanted to see Paul. They wanted to see Paul do his thing. They wanted to see Paul be a superstar. Paul's desire was quite a bit different it was I want you to see God the problem with that lack of communication when somebody wants to see a superstar and that guy wants somebody to see God you know what happened to the church in Corinth they saw neither they saw neither they didn't see the superstar they wanted to see they didn't see the paragon of virtue they wanted to see what they saw was somebody like that and like themselves who was being honest with where he was before the Lord and they hated him for that and they didn't see anything they didn't see the superstar and they didn't see God. This church had a terrible time with Paul. They attacked Paul. They undercut his ministry over and over and over again. They spread rumors and lies about what he did and where he was going. They ridiculed him and they would not accept his authority as an apostle. And what did Paul do? He defended himself. And you know how he defended himself? He told them they were right. Can you imagine that? After all the ridicule and all the attacks and all the things they bombed him with, he came to them and said, you know all the things you said about me? You're right. You're right. I'm all those things. He laid out all through 1 and 2 Corinthians just a parade, as it were, of his weaknesses over and over again. The times he was shipwrecked and the times he got beaten and the times he was humiliated in front of large groups of people. And the fact that he didn't feel like he was a skillful leader, that he didn't feel like he was a skillful speaker. He felt like a weak leader. He felt he really had a struggle in 1 Corinthians with the problem that when people supported him, he somehow felt bound to them, and all of a sudden he didn't feel free anymore to preach the gospel as it was, but he began to change his message. And a strong person wouldn't do that, and a good person wouldn't admit it if they did. He just laid it out, just laid it out. They shared with him the fact that he was publicly humiliated in 2 Corinthians 11, 28 and 29. it says of him that when someone is weak and failing and stumbling in sin you know what he does? He feels it every time it says he grieves over their sin and 2nd there, 1 Thessalonians he was speaking of the believers there and he says I have birth pangs for you because when you go through pain and when Christ is not being formed in you it grieves me, I feel it the strong the strong trusts God for everything and go on their way. The strong leader has a better balance. You know, it just isn't affected by that kind of thing. 2 Corinthians 12, 8 through 10. Turn to it. 2 Corinthians 8. I'm sorry. 2 Corinthians 12. He's talking here about the thorn in his flesh. We're not going to read all of this. but he's talking here about the thorn in his flesh and he's talking about the fact that this thing is coming to his life and it's a constant reminder, whatever it is some people think it's physical some people think it's an emotional problem some people think that it's just the hassle he's getting from this Corinthian church that they never accept him and they never love him and they never bring him to their bosom, never and that's the thorn in his flesh but he shares with them that he prayed three times for Christ to remove this and he didn't unanswered prayer apostles don't have that unanswered prayer he goes on and he talks about the persecution and the insults that he's received and the things that have been blasted him the things that have blasted him and he says you say I'm weak you're right you say I'm the recipient of all sorts of abuse you're right you say I'm not a strong leader you're right you say I'm not a skillful speaker you're right and then he goes further and he says on top of all those things you say I am you know what else I am? I'm afraid. I'm afraid, chapter 12, verse 20. I'm afraid of disappointment. I'm afraid that when I come to you, you're going to reject me. I'm afraid, most of all, that I may be humiliated in front of you. Do you hear this? This is the Apostle Paul. I am afraid. If he was strong, he would have never admitted it. Right? I am afraid that when I come to you, I'm going to be humiliated in front of you. Because what I'm going to do when I come to you is be honest. And you don't want me to be honest. You don't want me to be weak. You want me to be strong. I'm afraid I'm going to be humiliated in front of you by showing my weakness to the very people who are looking for weakness. Can you imagine that? You know, it's easy for me. It's hard for me to do this. but I'll tell you, it is easy for me because I know you love me and we love each other and there is a bond between us and so it's almost fun to pour it out here. I love it! I can't imagine what it would be like to do this if I know you just were looking for little weaknesses and little picky things. I know you're not, so I feel free. But he was going to people who were looking for weaknesses and for looking for things that would prove he wasn't a good apostle. and he just poured it out, looking for excuses to reject them, and he just gave them a whole bunch. And then look at chapter 12, verse 10. He says this, But I am well content with weaknesses and insults and distresses and persecution, because when I am weak, I know it, and I don't hide it. And then I am strong. And when I am empty of myself and my trying to perform, then I am full. See, Paul saw something very often we don't see. He saw the launching pad for God's power not being his strength. He saw the launching pad for God's power in his life being his weakness. Being the fact that he couldn't always put it together. and he always tried to stay in touch with the things that made him weak. In fact, in verse 9 it says, My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness. Oh, I've got to stop here. For power is perfected in weakness. Have you ever thought that the things that even now in your life you are desperately trying to hide from the rest of the body and from your best friends and from your wife and from your husband and from your kids? Have you ever thought that the very things that you think would be the weakness that would reveal you and cancel your ministry and cancel your effectiveness? Did you ever think that that very weakness is the thing God needs to be in the open so He can work through that weakness and demonstrate His power through you? And we hide it and we push it down and we show our strength and we don't look strong. he says your power is perfected in my weakness most gladly therefore I will rather boast about my weaknesses he reminded himself he worked at revealing himself he worked at being honest he worked at being real why? so the power of Christ may dwell in me How do you get strong? You get weak. When you're empty, that's when you're full. Something hit me this week as I was dealing with the filling of the Spirit. Be being continually full. And we go, okay. Be being continually empty. Be being continually weak so He can fill you and He can strengthen you. I'm going to take my weaknesses and put them up on a board so you can see them. and you know what because even in spite of him God still uses me and I believe it same for you and then I'm free I don't have to pretend anymore Paul was a comfort to me in this you know who else was a comfort to me in this Peter you know how I love Peter good old Peter what a dodo so much like us Peter is a good example to me because Peter is sincere the things that Peter did when he did them in the flesh they were like we do them when we do them in the flesh I don't see us when we get into this thing of trying to produce the godly life ourselves it's not because we don't love the Lord it's not because we don't care and we're just callous it's because we do care and we do want to see these things born in our life we're just getting things turned around what I'm thinking of right now is the confession that Peter had with Jesus on the beach. You remember that? Where Jesus looked at him three times and he says, Jesus or Peter, do you love me? This hit me in a way it never hit me before. I began to see this particular confrontation as the culmination of Jesus' ministry with Peter. I began to see it as the thing that Jesus always wanted to happen between him and Peter, but the circumstances were just never right and things never quite came together and Peter never really saw it yet and so he couldn't do it. But right now, just before Jesus is about to ascend, there's this meeting, and it was done. Peter was the guy whose strivometer was always going just nuts. He was always doing stuff. You know, he was like us, who are sincere and committed and ready to go and just involved in everything. He was always jumping out of boats. He was always knocking people's ears off. You know, he was always moving and talking and acting and making commitments. You know, he'd be coming forward, you know, and say, oh, I will not deny you. and I will commit myself to you and I will go to the mission field and I will fail. I will succeed where others have failed because I will hang in there. He's like us. Just bold and strong. Strong, right? Jumping out of the boats, whacking people's ears off. Ready to go. Thank you.
