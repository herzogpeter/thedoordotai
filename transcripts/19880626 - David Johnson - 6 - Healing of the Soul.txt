Matthew chapter 9 verse 1. We are in a section now, chapters 8 and 9, that we are calling the healing ministry of Christ, or the miracles of Jesus. I think it's important to note that in this particular section, the picture that we want to have in our mind is that of the warrior king, Jesus functioning in that role. And what he is doing in these two chapters is in a very aggressive and attacking kind of mode. and I think it's important even as we begin to even have a little click in our minds or registration to learn something from that. There are times in spiritual warfare and in the kingdom life as people that we experience times when, like Jesus, we're lopping off the head of the enemy and the enemy's fortresses are falling down and that is the kind of mode we find ourselves in. But one of the things that I think is important to touch on now, even recognizing the fact that this is a very aggressive time, This passage of scripture, real victorious. It's a time we're gaining ground. We need to understand, and maybe some hearts here even need to hear it, that that is not always the way it is. There are times in our lives, in kingdom living and in spiritual warfare, where the enemy comes at us. We don't go at him, he comes at us. And we are under assault, we are not bringing assault. And we are under attack, we are not bringing attack. And in fact, in the life and the ministry of Jesus, there is an ebb and flow that is very much like that. In chapter 4 of Matthew, Jesus was not attacking the citadels of Satan the citadels of Satan were literally assaulting him you remember in the wilderness and Satan came to Jesus to buffet him and to tempt him and to draw him into sin and the victory of Jesus in that time was not bringing the sword and winning all these victories and gaining ground as much as it was hanging on to the truth and hanging on to faith and God and not giving any ground up the reason I'm even saying that as we go into this Some of you may be in that mode this morning. And some of the aggressive talk we've had these last few weeks may be real hard for you to enter into. Just know that you're going to be at this point from time to time. You're going to be under assault. And then there are other times when you're bringing assault. And the mode we're in is a bringing of the assault. The warrior king destroying the works of the enemy. Another thing I want you to note as we come to the text even before I read it. is that in these miracles, there is a progression of importance and vitality, or vitalness, if you will, that we need to catch. Let me explain it this way. The very first miracle in this section that Jesus did was he reached out his hand and he touched a leper's body and he healed him. And what that demonstrated was that Jesus had authority to heal sick people. And he moved in that arena. But not only that, in the next miracle, the sphere of influence, if you will, the power and the authority that Jesus had was demonstrated to go beyond the physical because in the middle of a storm, with a word, he calmed the storm. And the response of the disciples at that time was this. What kind of man is this that even the wind and waves obey his very word? You see, I saw him heal physically and that was amazing. But this guy, even the wind and the waves, it was a higher progression. There's another arena in which he is the king. and then last week we saw him move into a situation where someone was absolutely in the bondage of and being tormented by demonic forces, living spirits that people could see in this person's life and with not even a word, with the very presence of Jesus in the midst of those demons, those demons were buckled at the knees and they fell at the feet of Jesus and Jesus said, be gone and they were and now all of a sudden we kind of think that has got to be the ultimate expression of God's authority and power. He not only heals physical things, He not only calms the storm so He is the Lord of nature, but He with a word can bring demons to their knees. What could be greater than that? There is something greater than that, and there is something more powerful than that, and that is this. Jesus says with this next miracle, in the healing of the paralytic, these words, Not only do I heal bodies, and not only do I calm storms, and not only do I cast out demons, but I can literally come to you, man, And I can literally come to you, woman. And I can give you what you need more than anything on this earth.I can give you a clean conscience. I can forgive your sin. I can give you a brand new heart. A brand new start." I can give you a new identity. I can give you your dignity. I can give you your humanity back. I can deliver back to you your soul. The message here is that he forgives sin. And that's the miracle we're going to look at. Let's read. In getting into the boat, he crossed over and came to his own city. Now, something I need to tell you, too, is I need to fill in some blanks for you here. This Matthew account in verse 1 and 2 doesn't really paint the picture well for us. So I want you to know that out of Mark chapter 2 and Luke chapter 5, we get all sorts of information about this incident that I'm going to give you. And I just want you to know where I'm getting it. It's Mark chapter 2 and Luke chapter 5. He came to his own city. His own city, by the way, was not the city of Nazareth, which you might think. That was where he grew up. But by the time this account happens, Luke 2 has already recorded that he came unto his own and his own received him not. That was Nazareth. And he basically got kicked out of Nazareth. He has resettled into what is now his own city, Capernaum, and he is living in the house of Peter. We found that out in some other accounts, but we also got introduced to the house of Peter just a couple of chapters ago when he healed Peter's mother-in-law from fever. when he was in Peter's house what we know from the other accounts is that a great crowd was meeting him there and probably it was the very same crowd that left him when he crossed the Sea of Galilee went to the area of the Gadarenes cast out the demons and now he is back the same crowd is there they found out he's back they're gathering around him and they found him in the house and basically I even want you to know what the house looked like because it's important for our study the common structure of the houses in those days was that they would be two stories high They would kind of look like a box affair. The second floor was generally just a large empty area where people would come when they would have large groups of people, social gatherings. Maybe somebody would call it the family room. I don't know. Kitchens and bedrooms would be on the first floor, just a large area. We have reference to this. When Jesus had the Last Supper, he was in an upper room. When the disciples were scared to death and they heard Jesus had risen from the dead, but they weren't sure, they were gathered where? In an upper room where a large gathering of people would be. The picture you need to get is that that is where they are. They're in that upper room. It's packed with people. There are people probably lined up down the stairs. There are people downstairs. There are probably people up on the roof. The roof was flat as well. People would go up there, get suntans, watch the cubs from across the street, things like that. And in verse 2 it says this, And behold, with this big crowd of people around, and by the way, I need you to know this too, the Luke account indicates that a significant number of Pharisees and scribes and teachers were in the group too, taking notes on what Jesus said. Basically critiquing what he said, looking for something to accuse him with. And behold, they were bringing to him a paralytic. Well, who's the they? It doesn't say here. Mark 2 and Luke 5 tell us there were four friends who basically brought this guy in on what is called a pallet. It looked like a stretcher. That's all it was. And basically what they did was not just able to walk in and everybody cleared the path and, you know, because the order of business for the day was to heal this paralytic. That was not the order of the day. The order of the day was to hear what Jesus had to say, and all the crowd was there. And they weren't letting him in. There was no way for them to get in, so they climbed up on the roof, they cut a hole in the roof, and they lowered him down with four ropes on each handle. You need to get the picture. The room is crowded. Jesus is teaching. The Pharisees are there taking notes and critiquing. A little dust begins to fall. The debris begins to come as well. A commotion begins to happen, and then as if from heaven comes a guy who looks like he's dead lying on a cot. And he comes right into Jesus' lap. And with that, now we can read Jesus seeing the faith of these four men. By the way, it wasn't just the four. The faith that he saw was in the five, also the guy who was on the cot. He said to the paralytic, take courage, my son, your sins are forgiven. And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, this guy blasphemes. And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why are you thinking evil in your hearts? Why are you plotting evil things? For which is easier to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and walk? But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the paralytic, Rise, take up your bed and go home. And he rose and he went home. And when the multitude saw this, they were filled with awe and glorified God who had given such authority to men. Let's pray as we begin. Father I pray that your spirit would give gifts to your body and Father as I consider this text and the wonder of it the glory of it the message behind it I am made aware that there are people in this congregation whose lives are paralyzed who cannot relate to a guy being lowered on a cot because of physical paralysis but they can when they look at their marriage and they can when they look at their job and they can when they look at how their kids are doing and how their life feels. They feel paralyzed. And Father, there are people in this room who need a divine touch from your Spirit. They need to hear your sins are forgiven. And they need to hear you're going to walk again. And you're going to be okay. They need to hear your grace. They need to be healed. I pray in Jesus' name that the power of your Spirit be here today for healing. Not because of words we hear, but because of a dynamic of your spirit that we see and sense and know and experience. And I pray, Father, that forgiveness would flow like a river today. And use your word by the power of your spirit to quicken those things among us. And I pray that in Jesus' name. Amen. There's five things I want us to see this morning about this text and walk away with. The first thing is this. I want us to see and understand the plight of the paralytic. The plight of the paralytic. Paralysis, first of all, is, I think, as you know, the loss of motor function. It means you cannot move, an inability to move. There is some indication from this particular text and in this particular situation that his paralysis was rather severe, possibly a quadriplegic, which meant he couldn't move at all. The fact that he was laying on a cot, he didn't move, he was of no help at all to his friends, doesn't necessarily indicate that he was a quadriplegic, but it lends some credence to the fact that he possibly was. We don't know that for sure, but you can consider that as one of the possibilities. The causes of paralysis in that day were much the same as they are in this day. One of the causes would be an accident. One of the reasons people could be paralyzed and having to be sitting in a wheelchair like some people in our congregation right now. Could be because of an accident. They dove into water, they hit the sand, they ended up being paralyzed because their neck was broken or their back was somehow damaged. Their spinal cord. Another way would be through birth. Cerebral palsy is a disease that we know about that causes paralysis and it happens from birth. One of the things, however, in that culture that was not consistent with our culture was this. And this was a common cause of paralysis then. You'd never connected. It was the problem of syphilis. You see, in our day, syphilis is curable. You just get a shot of penicillin. Now, there are different strains of that that are not curable anymore. And they're always having to chase that thing around. But in that day, there was absolutely no cure. And so syphilis was allowed to run its course in people's bodies. And one of the manifestations of this, when it ran its course in people's bodies, was paralysis. And I just want you to have it in your mind that it was very possible that this guy was paralyzed with an accident. It wasn't his fault. He just made a mistake. He fell off a ladder. Another possibility was that it was a birth defect. Again, it wasn't his fault. He was just paralyzed because something was given to him. Kind of cursed him with. But the other possibility you need to constantly consider, and I'm going to be constantly bringing this in, is the fact that he was on that cot because he sinned. And it was a direct result of disobedience to God and moving into behavior like fornication and adultery that was condemned by God, and he was suffering the consequences of that. Consider that. Keep that in your mind. Today, as then, someone who is paralyzed has a deep issue to deal with. I'm sure they have to deal with anger. They've got to deal with frustration. They've got to deal with some measures of humiliation, constantly in a position where you cannot help yourself and at the mercy of other people. In our day, there is medical knowledge and there is apparatus. Though it is a small constellation, the apparatus can help people be somewhat mobile. They can move around. They can get from place to place. Some people are able to learn how to drive vans and cars and things like that. Some people, however, quadriplegists who can't move at all, find themselves absolutely immobilized. But in that day, however bad it is now, in that day it was far worse. If you were unable to help yourself, unless you had people who in an unusual way were willing to commit themselves to you, you would sit in a corner, lie in your own waist, and die. And in fact, because of the humiliation that would be attending a disease like that, you might even prefer it that way. Let me add to you another thing in terms of a theological perspective that prevailed in Capernaum that might cause you to want to sit in a corner and die. Not only were you sick and laid out flat on a cot if you had paralysis, but the theological perspective of that day was this. If you are sick, if you have trouble, if something is going wrong in your life, it is obvious that it was caused by sin. Now, you remember when we dealt with a leper a few weeks ago, and the fact that the leper was ceremonially unclean. So specifically, leprosy was a sign of sin. It looked like sin. It was an illustration of it. But you need to know that sickness in general, in the city of Capernaum, by the Jews who lived there, sickness in general was perceived by them to be a manifestation out here of sin in here. It would be like wearing a sign. If you're healthy, I assume you're holy. And as soon as you've got problems, As soon as you have pain and sickness, I know something about you. He's really following up. He's obviously got sin. It's like wearing a sign on the outside. I am bad. I did it wrong. And see, the gossips, you can even hear the gossip mill begin to move. Depending on the severity of the disease, that would simply indicate, obviously, wouldn't it, that you have a real grievous sin. Now, see, I see that guy lying there in a cot. And I don't know what his sin is. I wouldn't pretend to know that. I'm not God. That's a very spiritual response. I just know that he has it and it must be really bad. Remember when Job got sick? Job was called by God, by the way, a holy and a blameless man. And then he lost his family. And then he lost his money. And then his body got filled with boils. And all the spiritual people around him said, I know why that is. If you got problems, if you got pain, if your family is dysfunctional, you did it wrong. What did you do, Job? And so on top of his pain and on top of his physical and also emotional paralysis, Job is left with a great big weight that says, you did it to yourself. But see, I've got to add something. Maybe he did. See, maybe this paralyzed guy did, so I've got to kind of keep that in there. Now, just kind of following through this attitude that was pervasive in Capernaum, If I've got this little theory that says, if you've got problems or if you're sick, it's because you did it wrong, there's another thing that pervades as well. Not only do I see you and your sickness as having been someone who obviously sinned, my ministry to you will just simply be to help you figure out what the sin was. I've got this idea about myself that if I don't have sickness and if I don't have pain and my family's doing real well and my life isn't paralyzed, that I did it right. And I walk around like a Pharisee in light of the fact that I don't have paralysis in my marriage, in my family, with my kids. No sickness. I must do it right. You must do it wrong. In fact, if that is my attitude, I might even feel justified, or we might feel justified And when we see paralyzed people not helping them, why? God's dealing with them. God's dealing with them. I mean, I can't, I'm not going to interfere with God's judgment on that guy or that gal. God's dealing with them. He deserved it. She deserved it. I don't know. And if they do need help, and if I do come to a point where the compassion of God moves in my heart to help people who are paralyzed in their lives, whether their bodies or in their lives, the help I will give them if I maintain this little philosophy that's real cute and really works, good people or people who don't have pain are good people. And people who have pain obviously did something wrong. If I keep that going, if I do help people who are paralyzed, it will come guaranteed from a position of superiority. And my help to you will not be getting down there with you and helping you in your pain or even bringing healing to you. That's what Jesus did. He healed this guy. My healing, my ministry to you will be that of this. You did something wrong. Let's figure out what you did wrong. I do it right. Let me tell you how I do it. Won't that be a blessing? In order to get this, you know what I think we need to do? We need to climb in the cot. We need to get on the stretcher and lay there for a while and try as much as we know how to feel what it would feel like to be paralyzed. And I think you already caught that I'm not just talking about physical paralysis, but emotional paralysis. family paralysis my life feels paralyzed my marriage I thought it was going to be like this and it's not like this I always had this little thing that if I loved my wife she'd love me if I loved my husband she'd love me if I had family altar with my kids they'd serve God if I loved them and played with them and prayed for them they'd all turn out alright and some of them are but some of them aren't and I'm paralyzed paralyzed. But the problem is this. Now keep going here. We got to be where this guy is, okay? The problem is you wake up one day and your life is paralyzed and you wake up to realize you live in Capernaum. Is that a scary thought to you? Because in Capernaum, the theory is this. If you got problems, you brought it on yourself. Dad, mom, if your kids aren't turning out just the way you thought, I don't know what your problem was. I don't know how you made your mistakes, but it's obvious you weren't a very good parent. You fooled everybody. You live in Capernaum. And if your marriage is going through hard times and you live in Capernaum and your marriage is paralyzed. It's obvious you did something wrong. If your marriage, if you were doing it right, it would be as nice as mine because we do it right. Sometimes when people get paralyzed, it's because they chose to disobey. It is true. Syphilis would be the correlation of that. Sometimes when people get paralyzed, it is through no fault of their own, but people think that way. By the way, even the disciples did. They were walking with Jesus one day and they said this, Jesus, tell us, whose sin is this blind man? Is it his father's or is it his? My ministry to this blind man, Jesus, is not to heal him. It is to figure out who did the sin in his life. Obviously, he did something. And obviously, we're above that because I'm not blind. And my kids are okay, and my marriage is still together, and na, na, na, na, na. With that little image I created in your minds, ask yourself another question. If you were paralyzed, how would you deal with the fact that you lived in Capernaum? And that was the pervading attitude. Well, I think for one thing, you would receive a lot of it. You would receive a lot of it. If that was where you lived and that was all you heard, you would not even have to hear the indictment from people. you would bring the indictment on yourself. I don't know what it is that I did, but I know I did something. Because this wouldn't be happening. I got this nice little formula. They probably are right. I really am a wretch. Look at my life. I'm paralyzed. Not only that, would you shame yourself with that, but the second thing is this. You would learn to hide from people. I'm telling you what, if you got paralyzed and you live in Capernaum where everybody's judging it and they got it all figured out while you got pain, your number one priority in life is going to be to avoid the people who with their stares and their comments constantly indict you. In fact, the scary thing about your desire to be alone when you're paralyzed and hurt and you need to be healed, the scary thing about that is this. Even you realize that if you go off in that corner where it is dark and no one can see you, you will go in that corner and die. The real tragedy is this, that if I go in that corner and die, and I'm even aware that that's what will happen, I still prefer that to coming in the crowd where Capernaum is and hearing the comments and seeing the stares that constantly indict and never heal. Let me ask you another question. Do you think that that is possibly one of the reasons why so few paralyzed people ever get to church. Because maybe in ways that we don't want to look at, but we have to. Church in many sectors has become spiritual Capernaum, where we've got it all figured out. And the prevailing attitude is this. If you're sick, if you've got trouble, if you're paralyzed, it's real clear you did it wrong. You know, the other thing I've got to throw in here, maybe you did. And we start talking, I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I'm just sure that I did wrong. And our ministry to those people will be, God, tell us, what is this person's sin? It won't be to heal. It won't be to move. What is this person's sin? And why are they so messed up? What did they do wrong? So we can tell them how to do it right. I want to tell you something. That little formula works really well. Some of you have that formula and you don't even know it. Maybe when I say it, it kind of crops up a little bit. But some of us have that formula and don't even know it. But it works really well. Again, the formula is if you do it right, everything will go well. And if you do it wrong, everything will be messed up. And if things are messed up, you obviously did it wrong. That works real well. You know how long it works? It works until somebody in your family gets paralyzed. It works for Job. Oh man, he had all the answers until he got paralyzed, filled with boils, family gone, money out the window. This one hits real close to home for me. Because in my family, we learned a very, very powerful lesson about being a spiritual Capernaum. Where we had it all figured out about people's pain. I've shared with you several things about my family and in some ways I've shared what I'm about to share with you. But as it relates to this, I can say this. My family was very clear. We loved Jesus. And that was the theme in our house. But in ways we didn't see in years past, I was about a sophomore in high school when these events transpired. In ways we didn't see and want to look at, our house was very much like a spiritual Capernaum. In that while we loved Jesus, we had it all figured out. Everything was very clear. If you do it right, have the family altar. Play with the kids. Pray with the kids. Nobody's going to get sick. And if they do get sick, and if someone's marriage does get paralyzed and the kids do end up messed up, you did it wrong. And the truth is, in our family, it was a very compassionate family. I mean, we really did love Jesus. My parents really did. And they loved him so much that they weren't like the Christians who said, I'm not going to mess with paralyzed people. They ministered to paralyzed people. We had paralyzed people in our homes whose lives were a mess. But, didn't see this when it was going on, but the method of ministry was always this. Jesus, tell us what this person's sin is, because if they got problems, obviously they're doing it wrong. And that formula worked really well. Just wonderful. It was preached. It works really well until someone in the family gets paralyzed. and the way the paralysis came to our family was that two of the kids who are older than me I have two younger than me, I'm right in the middle two of the kids and in a pastor's home the kids are trophies you see of the fact that if you do it right they'll be okay, right? isn't that right? we do it right, watch our kids you just go ahead and watch them don't watch them two of the trophies got tarnished more than tarnished they got broken more than that they got smashed and all of a sudden the little formula didn't work anymore but you're stuck with it in fact as the pastor he created Capernaum in that place and see that's what they did they opened their eyes one day found out they were paralyzed also found out they lived in Capernaum not only did they live there they helped create it and they were left asking some questions the most popular of them being what did we do wrong. Let me tell you something. You know what, when they asked that question, you know what they found out? They did some things wrong. They did some things wrong. But you know what else? Another thing that emerges from this story of the paralytic and the story of my family and that whole kind of issue and your families as well was this. After everything said and done and all the questions are asked, the real issue is not whether they did it right or wrong and not whether the paralytic had sin or not because the paralytic might have, but he might not have. We don't know that. The issue is this. Paralyzed people need to get brought to Jesus. And this guy had four friends who would do it. Let's look at the four friends and their faith. They brought in the paralytic lying on a bed and Jesus seeing their faith. Stop right there. By the way, I really like this. I don't know how to recreate this in your spirits, but the picture of somebody who's laid out, whose life is paralyzed, doesn't just need somebody who's given them all the answers. They need someone who knows how to carry them to Jesus. I hope that when I get paralyzed, you know what, I will, just like you. You have times in your life when you're paralyzed. Absolutely. And I hope for you and I hope for me that I have people who know how to bring me to Jesus when that happens. Jesus saw their faith. I have a question. how did he see their faith? I mean, how do you see faith? Faith seems pretty nebulous to me. How do you see it? It says he saw it. What did he see? Well, I think he saw it by what they did. He saw it by what they did. If you're taking notes, write that down. It was an active faith. It was an active faith. Well, what did they do that indicated to Jesus that they had faith? Well, what they did was they brought the guy. They overwhelmed all sorts of obstacles to bring the guy. They risked humiliation and also rejection by bringing the guy. I mean, you got to know when they're dropping that rope, what is he going to do for sure? I'm not sure what he's going to do. And not only that, they tore a hole in the roof to get this guy to Jesus. And Jesus said, I see your faith, and seeing their faith. The thing I want you to grab is this. The fact that what they did bore witness to what was going on inside of them. Jesus knew that what they did bore witness to the fact that something powerful was happening in the spirits, in the minds, in the hearts of these five people. The first thing it bore witness to, and please get this, was this. When he saw them deal with the crowd, when he saw them actually cut a hole in the cotton-picking roof and dropped this guy in the middle of a meeting right in the middle, he saw something about that whole event that said this, these guys here believe that I heal paralyzed people. They believe that. Not only that, what they're doing here demonstrates another thing. Not only do they believe that Jesus healed paralyzed people, they loved paralyzed people. See, if you just believe that in a generic sense, nothing happens. But if you believe that Jesus heals paralyzed people, and you love paralyzed people, you put those two things together, and the equation that issues from that equation is this. You start tearing the roof off of houses to get your paralyzed friends to Jesus. You really should witness. You really should get out there and do it. I don't have the energy for that. I want to tell you this. If you really believe that Jesus heals paralyzed people and knows how to put marriages back together and knows how to heal broken hearts and really does forgive sin and really does heal bodies. If you believe that and also if you love paralyzed people, you're going to start overcoming obstacles and you're going to start risking humiliation and you might even tear a hole in a roof. I pray with everything I've got. That's not the whole essence of the sermon, but that God invade us with the spirit and the faith of those four people. That God would generate in us a belief and a faith that God really does heal broken people. And second of all, I know some paralyzed people who I need to learn to bring to Jesus. But if that gets released here, do you think it would make a difference? Phew. Another thing about the faith, it was a silent faith. And I just bring that up to draw a contrast that I think Matthew intended. Remember the scribes' faith? It was big, it was bold, it was loud. I will follow you anywhere. Remember that a couple weeks ago, they were leaving the shore and Jesus said, I want you to come and follow me and the scribe says, I will follow you anywhere you go. And it's real impressive, that kind of faith. It stands up in church and says, I believe in Jesus. Great, sells well. The problem was that guy with the bold, verbal, loud faith never got in the boat. These guys in all of the accounts, by the way, never said a word. In Matthew, Mark, or Luke, there is no account of him speaking, anyone speaking a word. They said nothing. No big promises. they just got in the boat and brought to a friend of Jesus. Third thing I want you to see is the response of Christ. The response of Christ to this guy being dropped in his lap. He says this, this is so good. Take courage, my son, your sins are forgiven. Two things. First of all, take courage, my son. In order for us to even get a glimpse of what that must have meant to that guy who got dropped in Jesus' lap, we've got to climb back in the cot again. You've got to get back on the skid. And you've got to remember, as we consider this, that this guy would do anything to avoid a crowd. And now he is being put into a position where he is not only going to be in the crowd, it's not like he's lying in a corner in a room and there's all sorts of people. He is being dropped from the ceiling. And it's interesting, if someone was dropped in the ceiling, how our attention would be drawn to that person. He wouldn't be able to hide very well. His greatest fear is being realized here. Another thing is this. He cannot move at all. And the Word of God says he doesn't talk. He doesn't speak. Now whether he could speak or not, we don't know. But he doesn't speak. What that means is this. When this guy gets dropped down and he finally breaks the plane of vision and sees Jesus, There's only one way for him to communicate to Jesus what his need is or what he's feeling, and that is with his eyes. He can't even reach out his hand to go, like that would indicate, I need some help. I want you to help me. Would you take my hand? He can't move anything. There's one thing, his eyes. What do you think Jesus saw in his eyes? Calm serenity, right? Hello. Peace that passes understanding. He was probably sleeping, right? Now, none of you believe that. You believe he had fear. Fear is not a good enough word. Panic is not a good enough terror. What is he going to do? What is Jesus going to do? More than that, what do the people think? What will they say? What will they do? Will they kick me out of here? And again, what will Jesus do? See, what I want to know is when that plane of vision comes down, what I want to know is what are Jesus' eyes going to say to me? Boy, I don't know if I can recreate it in your mind. But I see him being lowered, and all he can see, he's looking straight up. So all he can see is the hole in the roof and the sky above that. And he maybe hears some commotion and some people kind of going, what's this, I'm rumbling. But he doesn't see anybody, he doesn't know who's there. And the first thing he's going to see as the plane of vision cracks is going to be the face of Jesus. That's the first thing he's going to see. What am I going to see? What am I going to see? I'm sure his heart was pounding. What are his eyes going to say? Are they going to be an indictment? Will they be impatient? Will they look like disgust? Will there be anger? I mean, he has every right to be angry. What are you doing? You're interrupting the meeting. I'm right in the middle of a talk guy, okay? Who's going to fix the roof, pal? You? You're paralyzed. You ain't going to fix the roof. I think it's incredible. we cannot miss the fact that his first words were take courage, my son. In Luke it says friend. The Greek word for son is technon. It's a very special word, a term of endearment, of infinite tenderness. The word courage is even more significant. There's two Greek words for courage. It's important that we get this. The first Greek word is not the one used in this text. It is talmao. Talmao. And it means to grit your teeth, to get going, to stir things up. And by the way, it's in Scripture. It's absolutely appropriate to bring that kind of exhortation to people from time to time. It is what Paul brought to Timothy when he said, Timothy, stir up the gift in you. Timothy, quit whining, quit complaining, quit acting like a baby. It's time to grow up and take some responsibility. You're responsible. Start moving. That is absolutely appropriate at certain times. If I were to bring an illustration of that, it would be a couple weeks ago when we brought some things into this pulpit that talked about areas where we needed to take courage. Great. Stir up some things. Become aware of some things. No, I'm going to go into that. That's an illustration. But in this particular situation, that was not the word he used. The word is tarseo. And what it means is this. There is nothing to fear. Take courage. Take courage. There is nothing to fear. And by the way, that simply affirms to me that what Jesus saw in his eyes was absolute terror. Take courage. There is nothing to fear. Why is there nothing to fear? That's the next one. Your sins are forgiven you. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why would he say your sins are forgiven? How would he know that he needed to have his sins forgiven? And the other thing is this. How would having your sins forgiven cause me not to fear? Did you follow all that? Those are all the questions that kind of get stirred up in me when I hear that. Why would he say your sins are forgiven? How would he know that he needed that? How did Jesus know that the healing that this guy was coming for went beyond a physical need? He saw him and he just recognized right now, this guy's going to walk, but he needs something more than he needs physical healing. He needs the healing of the heart. Your sins are forgiven, you. Well, one way he knew it was simply this. He was God and he could read the heart. We know that even when he read the hearts of the Pharisees in verse 4. Why are you thinking evil in your hearts? He read their hearts too. And maybe there was something in this guy's heart that he wasn't verbalizing, couldn't verbalize, that said this, the real cry of my heart is, I want to feel clean. More than I even want to walk. Maybe they were communicating on that supernatural kind of level. It could also be that Jesus simply recognized that when people are this laid out, that this is indeed the result of sin, not specific sin that he necessarily did, but sin in general. We've been talking about that as being the work of Satan. Disease came with sin. And so he knew that in a general sense, this guy was a sinner like everybody else, needed forgiveness. Maybe that's what he had him do. The other possibility is that he said, your sins are forgiven because the worst case scenario that we've been playing with really was true. Maybe Jesus knew something about this guy and that was this. You didn't get paralyzed with an accident and you didn't get paralyzed with a birth problem. You got paralyzed because you disobeyed God. And I know your deepest need and your deepest hurt right now is that you need to experience the forgiveness of God before you ever walk. So maybe that's why he said it, but what I still want to answer is this. How would knowing that your sins were forgiven cause you not to fear. Get back in the cot. Get back on the stretcher. You're being dropped. One of the things you realize as you're being dropped is that you got kind of talked into this and you're really happy for it and you really believe God's going to heal you somehow because you've seen him do it and you've heard about it. But at the same time, while you're in the middle of it, I'm sure you've had things like this when you kind of went over the edge, you're going, I can't go back. And I got a feeling all of a sudden some of his own unworthiness began to wash over him. If this guy really is a God-man, he's going to spot the fact that I am not worthy to be healed. And again, let's play it both ways. Let's say he had the syphilis problem, so in his spirit he knew that he really did deserve to be there. But let's say he didn't have that problem. It was just because he was born, but see, he grew up in Capernaum. And so what he heard ever since he was a kid, you deserve it, you deserve it, what did you do wrong? Must have been your father, must have been you, I don't know who, but you are not a worthy person. So whether there was specific sin or not, he's being dropped going, I do not deserve this. And you know what? If he really is a God man, one of the things he's going to spot when I come into view is he's going to spot my sin. And if he spots my sin, he's going to humiliate me in front of everybody. And I think his heart was pounding because of that too. And so it is that Jesus' first words to this guy were this, Take courage, my friend. Friend? Did he say friend? Calm down. That means he doesn't see your sin. If he called you friend, he don't see your sin. If he called you a son, he don't see it. We aren't going to deal with that. The second words out of his mouth were this. Your sins are forgiven. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This doesn't compute anywhere. This doesn't compute. Because if I'm a good performer and if I'm doing well, I'll get forgiven and I'll get received and I might even get healed. But if I'm not doing well and if I'm the embodiment of sin. I thought he didn't see my sin, but now he says your sins are forgiven. That means he does see my sin and he knows my sin and he called me friend and then he forgave my sin. Does that mean that maybe I don't even have to hide my sin? I got over needing to hide my body and I let him drop me, but maybe I don't even have to hide my sin. and I can say, I want to confess my sin and I want to repent of my sin and maybe he could heal my heart too. I didn't even think of that when they were dropping me. I didn't even hope for that when they were dropping me. Who is this guy? There is nothing to fear. I'm going to clean your heart. And then we meet number four, the fury of the scribes and the Pharisees. Verse 3, And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves very quietly, so no one could hear, this fellow blasphemes. Why is that? Because he's forgiving sin, and nobody has authority to forgive sin but God himself. Not only is he a blasphemer, but according to verse 11, they said this, Why is your teacher eating with tax gatherers and sinners? Not only is he a blasphemer, he's immoral. He hangs around with tax gatherers and sinners. He's immoral. Not only that, in verse 14, they say, Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast. How come you don't fast? Not only is he a blasphemer, and is he immoral and hanging around immoral people, but on top of that, he's irreligious. He keeps breaking the religious rule. Why does he do that? He couldn't be a man of God. And then in verse 34, they sum it all up by saying, this guy's got to be from Satan. All he does, he does by the power of Satan. We're not going to deny that he does it anymore. He just does it by the power of the evil one. Now, we have dealt with this kind of person before, and I'm not going to dwell on it, but I want to give you the truth again. The fury of the scribes brings to our mind again the fact that the mark of the religiously damned, the mark of the religiously damned is this, that when God does what he does, and he breaks the religious rules, and he dispenses grace on broken, hungry, mourning people who are repenting of their sin, the religiously damned consistently do not get it, they do not spot it, and if they do, they do not like it. what you need to do is contrast in your mind on one hand the faith of the paralyzed sinner with the fury of the religiously damned and Jesus stands in the middle on this side giving grace and mercy and help and on this side giving justice and judgment and then we hear the rebuttal of Jesus and by the way just a little thing a little by way of teaching kind of thing I've already been talking about little formulas that we've had. We've got it all figured out, you know. One of the things that's interesting is even in this, it just dawned on me, this is kind of just from me to you. But we've got this little picture sometimes that if anybody ever comes against you or says something and comes in some way that would require some sort of rebuttal, we should never say anything and never defend and never come against anybody ever because in 1 Peter 2, it says being reviled, he reviled not again. I don't think you should ever revile, ever. But sometimes we get a rule that says anytime anybody says anything, you should never say anything back. You should never defend. You should never bring another argument ever. 1 Peter 2. 1 Peter 2. Here's the formula. See, somebody else can come to this and go, and somebody says something to you and blasphemes God. You come back and say it. That's not the formula either. The formula is this. Jesus is walking by the Spirit all the time. And he didn't do anything but what the Father told him to do and what the Father told him to say. Here's the formula for the believer. Walk by the Spirit. Be in tune with what the Spirit's saying. Listen to God and the result of that is sometimes when somebody says something to you, you're going to keep your mouth shut. And sometimes you're going to speak. That's for free. Let's look at the rebuttal. Why are you thinking evil in your hearts? Verse 4, verse 5. For which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or say rise and walk? Think about it. Which is easier to say? It's obviously easier to say your sins are forgiven. I mean, I could walk around this whole thing going, your sins are forgiven, your sins are forgiven, your sins are forgiven, your sins are forgiven. That's easy to say. Who would know? Right? In fact, it'd be funny how if I walked around here going, your sins are forgiven, your sins are forgiven, how little impact that would have on you. You know, well, he said my sins are forgiven, but I still don't feel like the weight is off. I mean, what authority does he have to do that? How do I know? Just because he said it, I am forgiven. I love this verse. I'll tell you what, this gives us insight, and you better just hang on to this and know this forever. This gives us insight into why Jesus moves in his church, why God with power manifests himself, why God today heals people's bodies physically, why today he casts out demons, why today he can calm a storm, why today he moves in his church and shows his people who he is with visible, invisible ways. You know why? So that we will know when he operates in a visible way, we will know that he also operates in an invisible way. so that we will know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. I'm going to raise some people from the dead. I'm going to heal some broken bodies. I'm going to cast out demons so that you know the real thing I came to do, and that was to forgive sin. I'll tell you what, I think it's okay. This brings such a balance and a credibility to the whole area of the gifts of the Spirit and signs and wonders in general. God does not move in his church and manifest his power so he can show off and we can go, wow, what a guy. He doesn't come and do tricks and do it to try and draw a crowd. If he moves in his church, he does it so that his church, having seen his hand and heard his voice and seen his moving, will know in their hearts that not only does he have authority to move in that physical way that I see, But that physical manifestation tells me that he also has authority to move in the invisible way that I have a hard time believing. How many of you need to know you're forgiven? How many of you need to know that God does or would forgive? Well, the voice of Jesus says this, in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive your sin, which is your deepest need, I might even touch your body so you understand that. I move and touch the visible and the physical in order that you may know I heal the invisible and I touch the spiritual and the emotional I touch the heart I can forgive sin sin is the root of our problem disease is the symptom of that problem Jesus is saying here I touch the symptom, in order that you may know, I do touch the root as well. And the root is the thing that really matters. And that's what you need. You know what you need to know? If you're sitting here this morning and you're paralyzed, you know what you need more? And you might even know it in your heart. What you need more than to not be paralyzed in your marriage or in your family or with your kids anymore, you know what you need to know more? That you could have your sin forgiven. You need that more than knowing you're going to walk again. And in order that you might know that he forgives, he might just touch your body too and raise you up to walk again. That's what he does. Beloved, it's really important that we grow this morning to a point where we even have the whole area of signs and wonders and miracles and healing that we believe in and are beginning to see more and more that as God moves in our church and we see his hand more and more among us that we hang on to something very important that every time we do see God move and every time we see him heal and every time we see him deliver and every time we see him restore a marriage that's broken or a person that's destroyed that every time that happens we would look past the moving and the healing and the deliverance and the restoration and we would hear a message from the heart of God saying this friend, friend, okay look at that body that just got healed and look at that marriage but here, here, here's the real message I did that visible thing so you would know again and again and again and again that I do the invisible thing. I forgive your sin. And he does that because we have a hard time believing that. We have a hard time remembering that. We have a hard time even asking him for it. The result in verse 8 was this, And when the multitude saw this, they were filled with awe and glorified God who had given such authority to men. They were filled with awe. The word there is phabas. we get our English word phobia from it it simply means fear but it isn't timid and quaking I'm afraid of you fear it's reverential awe and it is simply this I would say it this way it is an awareness of who God is and what his agenda is and what he can do who God is he is powerful and he moves and his agenda is to forgive sin and when I see him move that's what I hear that word awe phabos is the exact same word that is used to describe how the disciples felt when he calmed the storm they felt fabos. It is the same word that is used to describe how they felt when he walked on water and they saw it. They felt fabos. They were taken with fear. It was the same word that was used when he healed the demoniac and the paralytic. It was the same word that people felt when Jesus raised the widow's son from the dead. It is the same word that Mary and Martha felt when they came to the tomb. The stone had been rolled away. The angel said these words, He is not here for He is risen. It was the same word. And it was the same thing that in Acts chapter 3 people felt when they saw the signs and wonders and the miracles of God that were attending the coming of the Spirit into people's lives. And from that was coming the power of God. And you see, they had seen up to that point the power of God manifest through Jesus. And then through the 12, and then through the 70, and then in Acts chapter 3, they were seeing the power of God through them. Themselves. And the result of that was that they felt awe. But here's where you need to hear the fact again. The fact is this, from the sixth verse of chapter 9. Beloved, I want you to know that I do calm the storm, and I do walk on water, and I do cast out demons, and I do raise the dead. And I did roll the stone away, and I have sent to my church gifts of the Spirit in order to storm the gates of hell, and I have given to the church the manifestation of my very presence and power. but I did all of that so that you would know I forgive sin. That's the gospel. I make people clean. I give them back their humanity. I give them back their dignity. I give them back their identity. I give them back their purity. I forgive them. In Acts chapter 9 it says this, the church was called and the church needs to walk in the phabos of God. I like that. Catch that in your spirit someplace. That we would walk in the fear of God. Not quaking timidity, but a constant awareness of who God is and what He does and what His agenda is and that He does indeed heal people's sicknesses, but He does it in order to ultimately destroy the works of Satan and forgive sin. and that is why our God came in Christ two things you need to know this morning as you leave number one he can forgive your sin anybody here need to know that number two some of you need to be reminded that he has you just need to be reminded that he has because you could even stir up faith to believe God for miracles but you have a hard time stirring up faith to believe that you really are forgiven and the result of that is Satan keeps us impotent sitting in our pews never serving because we're never worthy are we? I'm going to tell you I'm going to manifest myself in your presence so you will know I forgive. In the Luke account chapter 5 verse 17 the Luke account of this incident it says something that I want to give to you now it says this that it was interesting because when that paralytic was dropped the power of the Lord was present for Jesus to perform healing I don't know all of what that means I'm not going to exegete it right now but it indicates that there was an ebb and flow even to Jesus' ministry there were times when healing happened and there was a power for that to happen other times it didn't happen it occurs to me that if we are dealing with the very issue where the power of God was present for healing that in the spirit realm that God would bring that same reality and that same kind of power for healing here I've been getting a word I think from God that forgiveness needs to flow here like a river. And people need to know they're forgiven. And you need to know the power of God is here for healing of this heart. But in order that you may know he forgives sin, he sometimes touches the body. He touches the body. He raises paralytics. It could be that some are sick physically and you need a touch from God and to come and ask God for a touch. It could be that you need to know that God forgives sin. You need to be reminded that he has, and it could be that you are harboring some sin that you've never repented. You're blaming everybody else, maybe. You're thrashing. You're doing all sorts of things, and you need to become broken, because the promise is, if you get lowered by the rope, I think Jesus is going to meet you. You can know that. Take courage. There's nothing to be afraid of. I'm going to heal your heart..
