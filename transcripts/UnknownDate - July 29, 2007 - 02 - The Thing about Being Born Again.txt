me. Jesus, thank you so much for Brenton and Brett, their leadership, and the way that your spirit was so present over the last few minutes of worship. And over this time, I pray for the same thing. I pray that especially in my spirit, there would be life. And that where there is dark places, your light would come, and your life would come. And that it wouldn't be because of a talk, but it would be because of your spirit that is alive. Amen. Amen? Amen. Turn your Bibles to John chapter 3. We're in the second week of a three-week deal that we're calling Small Kingdom, Big Kingdom. Looking at familiar passages and turning them upside down, shaking them all out, and seeing what they really mean. So I want to read just one verse to you right now. John 3, verse 3. And as you're finding it, it's going to be up on the screens as well. But John 3, 3, Jesus replied, very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again. No one can see the kingdom of God without being born again. Now there's a phrase with a lot of juice behind it, right? Born again. I was at CPC, my church, a few months ago, and I was speaking, so I was going around and introducing myself. It was at the 930 service, which is the traditional service, a lot of older people, and I met this one woman. I said, hi, my name's Steve. She said, hi, my name's Phyllis, or whatever her name was. I'm a people person. Her next question was, when were you born again? And I mean, no kidding, if I was drinking a little water right then, I would have gone, not that that's not a good question, it's just not the usual question that I get when I've just met someone. So what thoughts and images come into your mind when you hear the phrase born again? What stories or people or thoughts come into your mind? I think there's at least two groups of people. One, there's a group of people that hear that phrase and think, you know, being born again really makes me think of that time in my life when I came face to face with my sin and I found a Savior in Jesus. And I had a conversion experience that resulted in a changed life. You think about Chuck Colson and his book, Born Again, that he wrote in the 70s after his imprisonment following the Watergate scandal. It's a convergent experience that results in a changed life. And it's this beautiful thing. Well, there's another group of people that hear that phrase. And to them, it kind of sounds like a group of people that belong to a country club that have a secret handshake that only they know. and they want you to join their country club but they don't really like you. They want you in but they want you to change a lot of stuff before you come in so that you'll fit in to their country club. My wife's sister and her husband are moving to Toronto much to our chagrin and displeasure thanks to their company. And so they went to go rent this house and they decided on the house and they had the privilege of talking to the previous renters. The previous renters said, oh man, this neighborhood is incredible. It's very diverse. You got a Pakistani on one side. You got another ethnic group with a different religious flavor on the other side. And that's our whole neighborhood. You're going to love it. And then this pause came to their face and they said, literally, unless you're an evangelical, then you might not really like it too much. And I heard that story, and it was like, ow! Ew! Ow! I mean, that's what I'm talking about when I'm talking about this country club with the secret handshake that people want you to join, but they don't like you. Being born again, It's a very divisive phrase, actually. And some of my friends who don't really go to church, aren't really Christians, you know, if they knew I was speaking about this, they'd be like, are you kidding me? Like, that's a made-up phrase, right? I mean, you guys just made that up because it sounds that stupid. And I'd be like, no, actually, Jesus coined it first. So can we go back and find out what it means? Can we do that? I think that'd be good if we did that. So John chapter 3, I'd like to read the verses that surround that verse that I read to you. John 3, starting in verse 1. Now, there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus, who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. And he came to Jesus at night and said, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs that you were doing if God were not with him. And Jesus replied, Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again. In verse 4, how can anyone be born when they are old? Nicodemus asked. Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born. Now who is Nicodemus? Nicodemus is a Pharisee, but he's not only a Pharisee, he is a part of the Jewish ruling council, also called the Sanhedrin, which is roughly equivalent to the Supreme Court of our day. He is a very, very big deal. We can assume that he is brilliant, that he's very learned. He's a scholar. He's a teacher. He knows his stuff. So why does he come to see Jesus? Well, we read that he comes to see Jesus at night. And I was always taught, you know, I was kind of like, ah, Nicodemus, that rascal. He was so embarrassed that he had to come to see Jesus at night. What a loser. And if he was really authentic, he would come to Jesus full on in the daytime. You know what I have to say about that? I don't care when he comes to Jesus. Come at night. You can come to Jesus at night. He will accept you at night. And we don't even know if Jesus initiated this meeting or if Nicodemus initiated the meeting. Now it is true that night is used all throughout John to symbolize a spiritual darkness. Someone who is walking around in the dark and has not found the light of God. So we can correctly assume, I believe, that Nicodemus does not yet get it. But I think that's partly why he's seeking out Jesus. Perhaps in all of his religion and all of his teaching, he has a wondering in his mind that maybe, just maybe, I can find life. Maybe, just maybe, I can find life in this rabbi that they call Jesus. So what is he asking? Well, first of all, he affirms Jesus. He says, rabbi, he calls him rabbi, he affirms him as a teacher. We know that you are a teacher who has come from God. That's good. But he also says, we know you are from God because of the signs that you are doing. And no one could do those signs if God weren't with him. The problem with that, Nicodemus obviously didn't read verses 23 and 24 of John 2 right before this because it says this. Now while he, that is Jesus, was in Jerusalem at the Passover festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name. That's a good thing, right? But Jesus would not entrust himself to them for he knew all people. Jesus wanted something a little more than people who believed in him based on his signs. And so Jesus responds to Nicodemus. And there's this weird thing like, notice Nicodemus doesn't ask a question here. It's sort of like if you came up to Dave after a message. And you're talking, you'd be like, I appreciated your message. It was excellent. That's kind of like what Nicodemus is doing. There's a question behind it somewhere. And it's almost as if Jesus just jumps right in and says, very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again. And it's like this Jedi mind thing. Right? So he says born again, and it's this really interesting and brilliant play on words. Because it says again in John 2 verse 23 that everyone is in Jerusalem at the Passover festival. Now what the Passover festival is, is a time where all Jews would gather on Jerusalem and celebrate the birthday, the Passover, you remember it back in Exodus, of the Jewish nation. the birthday when Jews would celebrate God passing over the house of the firstborn, their house, because they had put the blood on the doorpost, thereby saving the firstborn son. So everyone, over glasses of wine and talking, they'd be saying, hey, I am a child of David, 14th generation. How about you? They would be talking like this. On everyone's mind would be where they were born, how they were born, and why they were born, and what that birth brings them into. So when Jesus says, you must be born again, he's using the context that they would be thinking of. And it carries two meanings, this born again at the same time. It means a literal time, a start over, or a renewal. A time where you are renewed, where you get to start over. And it also means a source from which this birth originates. But the word again can also be translated from above. So into the Jewish Passover festival, when they were talking about being sons and daughters of Abraham, and that's what gets them into the kingdom of God, Jesus says, no, you need a different source of birth in order to be a part of the kingdom of God. You need a source that's from above. And this would have just messed with Nicodemus. Now to us it sounds like, well yeah, I mean, obviously. To Nicodemus this would have been, this isn't computing, this isn't going in. It would be like if Jesus went over to Nicodemus' house, and I believe Nicodemus was a very ordered person. I believe he had all of his files neatly filed away. There was no papers on the desk. And it would be like if Jesus came in and just said, nice file cabinet, nice file cabinet, and you could just imagine Nicodemus kind of standing there going, whoa. See, Nicodemus had categories for what he believed. He knew that he was from God, that Jesus was from God because of the signs that he was doing, because he knew that's what the scripture said. That's how you can tell a prophet comes from God, if he does signs. Jesus said that's not enough. He knew that he was a child of God because he was born of Abraham. And he knew that God's kingdom was going to come for the Jews, and it was going to set everything right when the Messiah came. That was his file system and Jesus was overturning it and shaking it out. Jesus, here's the thing, Jesus is asking Nicodemus to let go of what he knows in order to be reborn through a different source of life. And it hits him like a ton of bricks. Here's what he's saying. It comes out of John 1, verse 9. And you've got to hear this as a Jewish person in the first century would hear this. John 1, verse 9 says, The true light that gives light to everyone, interesting, everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, made through Jesus, that's so weird, I didn't know Jesus was present in Genesis 1. Apparently he was. the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own, the Jewish people, but his own did not receive him. Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God. Children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. A different kind of birth, which would have messed with Nicodemus. I have a friend that went to Jordan recently. Not the Jordan that's just right by Shakopee, but the Jordan that's in the Middle East. And he met this priest there that he could tell just, I mean, the spirit of God was all over this guy and everything he said had weight. So he asked him, what would you tell someone who's asking how to be a disciple of Jesus? And without even stopping to think, This guy said, to be a disciple of Jesus, you have to learn the principle of immigration and how to be a stranger in your own land. You have to know how to leave what you know. And he said, you know what? Leaving your possessions behind, that's the easy part. Leaving behind what you think you know, that's the difficult part. It's like going overseas. If you've taken a trip overseas, when you get over the jet lag and you find a cab and you get taken into the middle of the city and you're looking for a place to eat, there's a little part of you, there's a little piece of you that is looking for a McDonald's. And you don't even really want to eat there, but you just want to know that it's there. Because it's comforting, the golden arches. It doesn't matter if the Big Mac is pronounced Big Mock or whatever. you want to know that it's there and if you're there for over two or three weeks you will eat there once and you'll say it tastes a little different but mmm Big Mac, love it we are comfortable with what we know we are uncomfortable with what we don't it's like if you've ever gone on a missions trip some students from Open Door just recently went on a trip to New Orleans and they're going to do a lot of work for the people in the ninth ward there. But you know what's going to be the best thing that's going to happen? Is the minds of these high school students are going to be opened to a different way of thinking. That's going to be the treasure. And that's what Jesus is inviting Nicodemus into. And here's the thing, his response. How can anyone be born when they are old? Surely they can't enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born. Now, remember, this guy is brilliant. He's not an idiot. He's not actually asking, hmm, my mother is dead because I am old, but you're telling me to climb back in her womb. Maybe I'll try it. I think Nicodemus actually is starting to get the metaphor, and he's saying, this is going to be really, really hard. How can a man my age who's had these files for this many years change the way he thinks? You can't change who you are after you're already born. So Jesus tries again with another double meaning. And this is where sometimes Jesus, he's just mean. He's just Jedi. But he's also brilliant. John 3, starting in verse 5, this is picking up where we left off. Jesus answered, Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to Spirit. You shouldn't be surprised at my saying, you must be born again. The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it's going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit. Then Nicodemus asks, how can this be? It's double thing, water and Spirit. When Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, that baptism that John did was called a baptism of repentance. And it was out in the wilderness, wasn't in the city, and Jesus was baptized by John because I think he was taking a stand and saying, a baptism of total life change is required. So born of water means entering into this outward expression of something that's happening on the inside, this metanoia, this changing of your mind about where to find life and literally turning. That's the born of water piece. But the born of spirit piece is more even interesting and more mysterious because if you think about wind, even strong wind, you can tell when it's here, right? I mean, you can tell. You can tell the windows rattle and the trees shake and your slice gets a lot worse. But you can't really chart its course. You can't really totally tell where it's coming from or where it's going. Wind is really unpredictable that way. And Jesus is saying that's the Spirit of God. It's wild. And you can't always tell where it's coming from or where it's going. And the thing that messes with us, even in your mind right there, you're thinking, ooh, hey, ooh, ooh now, hey now. I'm not comfortable with that wildness. you know what I'm not I'm not comfortable with that wildness I like my files where they are Jesus is saying that you are in danger of rejecting the thing that surprises you you're in danger of rejecting that thing that surprises you N.T. Wright says this about this spirit. The spirit is on the move like a fresh breeze and no human family, tribe, organization, or system can keep up with it. He says it's like throwing open your windows on a warm spring day and all your papers are scattered on your desk and guess what happens to all your papers? Gone. Your order is gone. When I was engaged to my wife, Mary, I was really in this black and white phase where I knew it and there was a right and there was wrong and I was always right and she was in this beautiful I heard sort of a knowing chuckle there. Anyway, she was in this beautiful phase where she was teaching me how to question and I remember her saying this phrase I just, I don't know if God can be trusted. You know, instead of invite, instead of me taking that invitation into further conversation, I was freaked out by that. Because here was a woman I was going to marry. And she didn't even know if God could be trusted. So I was living in Chicago at the time, finishing up grad school, and she was here in the cities, and I called her up. And this was before email, before cell phones. like you know long distance still cost like 50 cents a minute back then so i'm trying to get my question out and here was my question i tried mary i and i tried all these things and what i was asking her was mary are you saved keith's laughing because he knows mary mary are you are you saved and and she just kind of said huh and we got into a real long conversation and then I accepted Jesus it was great Jesus is constantly throwing open the windows he did this with Peter don't turn there but in Acts 10 Peter got this vision he was sleeping he saw this sheet coming down from the sky four corners on the sheet and inside the sheet were all these unclean animals reptiles and birds and all this kind of stuff. And he heard God's voice saying, kill and eat. And Peter was like, no, I've never eaten any unclean thing. And I'm not going to start now. And then God's voice said, do not call unclean what I have made clean. And Peter got the word from God that Gentiles were being invited into the kingdom of God, just like Jews. and that it wasn't a source of birth from a person that mattered. It was a source of birth from above that mattered. To be born of water and the Spirit means to submit to and then be a part of the wild, expansive, and sometimes unpredictable nature of who God is. It's wild. And you can't tell where it's coming from and sometimes you can't tell where it's going. So that should lead you to the next question. Well, what can I hang on to? Is there anything firm? Well, part three of this great passage gives us a place to be grounded. Verse 10 of John 3. You are Israel's teacher, said Jesus. And do you not understand these things? There's a lot of red here in my Bible anyway. I mean, Jesus goes off a little bit. He kind of says, okay, no, I'm just going to lay it on you. Here we go. And do you not understand these things? Very truly, I tell you, third time he has that phrase, very truly, I tell you, no kidding here, we speak of what we know, pointing back to when Nicodemus said, we know that you are from God because of the signs. And Jesus says, we speak of what we know. A little bit of a jab, but I think it's good. And we testify to what we have seen, but still you people don't accept our testimony. I've spoken to you of earthly things and you don't believe. How then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven, the Son of Man. Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up that everyone who believes in him might have eternal life. When Jesus says, no one has ever gone into heaven except for the Son of Man who has come down, he's painting this picture of this bridge, that it is really Jesus that spans the heavens and the earth and brings them together. It's Jesus and Jesus alone. Jesus of Nazareth, this Jesus the Messiah that was rejected by his own, is the one and only link between God and people. I had this friend that says this thing. He says, religion is the way that people get to God, but the way that God gets to people is Jesus. Isn't that good? Religion is the way that people get to God, but the way that God gets to people is Jesus. But I think the confrontation that Jesus has for Nicodemus is also a confrontation to us. Because it's so easy for us to not cling to just the core. There was a little phrase that went around Open Door years ago. It was from Busby or maybe Dave, but he said, the gospel is Jesus plus nothing. The gospel is Jesus plus nothing. but it's so easy for us to get attached to the things around the core. And that might even be the way in which you experience conversion is the things around the core that actually isn't Jesus, but it's the way you found Jesus, and that becomes the gospel. And Jesus is saying, wind, dangerous, unpredictable, source of life is from above. It would be like my little nine-week-old son, have I talked about Isaac before? Have I mentioned him? He's a really advanced kid. He rolled over this week. Most kids don't do that until 12 or 13 weeks, but no big deal. I mean, Isaac, he's, I mean, he's, you know. Anyway, it would be like if we framed his birth certificate and put it on the wall. And you know those little birth announcements you get in the mail and you get these cute little pictures of naked babies and stuff like that? It's kind of weird, but it would be like if we sent out pictures of the birth certificate. And people would be like, well, that's cute. No, no, no, we have to prove to you that he was born. Check out the birth certificate. There it is. It's black ink. It's great. Instead of saying, no, no, no, no, hi, hi. What was that? The proof that Isaac is alive is the fact that Isaac is alive. And that he laughs at me and coos at me and rolls over at nine weeks. But again, that's not a huge deal. It's probably way faster than your baby did it. But no, it's not a big deal. I'm totally that guy now. I'm so sorry. How can we cling to the core? Just the core. Well, let's look at, just real quickly here, I'm going to buzz through a few of these, but according to the Bible, how is someone born again? According to the Bible, in Luke 7, verse 38, we read about a woman, and I'll just read it to you, she stood behind Jesus at his feet weeping, and she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and poured perfume on them. It's a very intimate scene. Then in verse 45, Jesus says this to his host, this Pharisee at his house. You didn't give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You didn't put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven. According to this passage, how are your sins forgiven? Well, you have to kiss the feet of Jesus and pour perfume on his feet and wipe him with your hair. I mean, that's the way. In Matthew chapter 9, this is fascinating. Jesus stepped into a boat, trying to get away from people, I think, crossed over and came into his own town. Some men brought to him a paralyzed man. This is a really cool scene. These friends bring to Jesus a paralyzed man lying on a mat. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, take heart, your sins are forgiven. According to Matthew chapter 9, the way your sins are forgiven is you better have friends that are full of faith, right? Wow, that's weird. Acts chapter 9. The apostle Paul, the writer of most of the New Testament. Here's his conversion story. He fell to the ground and heard a voice. It's so wild. He's riding on a horse. And he gets knocked off of the horse. Knocked off of the horse. fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? Who are you, Lord? I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. He replied, now get up and go into the city and you'll be told what you must do. According to Acts chapter 9, you have to ask a question. That's how you get born again. Matthew 7, 21, this is weird. Jesus says this, not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven. But only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven. Now it's about doing the will of the Father. In Luke 4, 33, this is fascinating. We read this. In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. And the demon cried out at the top of his voice, Go away. What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. The Holy One of God. Moreover, demons came out of many people shouting, you are the son of God. No one else got this. Demons did. Demons believed it. What's the only common denominator in all of these stories? Jesus plus nothing. religion is man's way to Jesus Jesus is God's way to humanity it's Jesus plus nothing it's Jesus alone and there are really a lot of different ways that you can experience Jesus Christ see I believe with all of my heart that Jesus is the only way to God Jesus is the only way to God I'm more convinced of that than ever he is the image of the invisible God he is the light in the darkness only he, only he could represent who God is and could give us the source of life through his death on a cross I just think there's probably more ways to Jesus than we think there is are you willing to wrestle with that? that there might be more ways to Jesus than we think that there is. So what do you do with this? What do you do with this maybe confrontation that's also an invitation? Because being born again, Jesus is saying, means to have a repentance, a turning, a changing of your mind about where to find life. And then to get that life from the source that is God, Jesus who died on a cross bringing redemption for our sins that's the source that brings life that's the only source what do you do with that? I think you need to ask the Spirit of God to help you sometimes sit in the dangerous place of unknowing so that your files can get turned upside down every once in a while, amen? You know we have this phrase we put God in a box is, oh, don't put God in a box. We will put God in a box. We do. The challenge is to allow God to break your box so that it can become bigger. And then the thing is, because God is infinite, your box will never be big enough. Our whole life, we're going to, wow, wow. We could read just the Gospels for our whole lives and be like, oh my, wow, you know what Jedi? I mean, it would be amazing because Jesus is infinite. I have a friend that says, it's when I sit in these places, these scary places, that I begin to feel like the files are being turned over, that I feel like abandoning that process the most, but it's that place that I need to sit in the most because God is revealing to me more of who God is. And we need to be okay sitting there. so with yourself ask the spirit of God to help you sit in the dangerous place of unknowing and with others there's this whole country club thing in a world that lives in darkness and it really does need to experience light and there's a passion in us to help people meet Jesus right? so our job is not not to convert them but to lift up Jesus according to John 12 32 Jesus says I when I'm lifted up from the earth or when I am exalted I will draw all men to myself I will draw all people to myself when we lift up Jesus what does God do? God begins to draw all people to himself in John 12 35 and 36 we read this then Jesus told them you are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light before darkness overtakes you. Those who walk in the dark do not know where they're going. Put your trust in the light while you have the light so that you may become children of the light. We think all the way back to Nicodemus who came to Jesus in the dark. And you gotta wonder, this Nicodemus guy who I have just, over the last couple months, I've come to love this guy. I love his spirit. I love his inquisitiveness and how he just goes after it. He keeps asking the question, I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. What happens to him? Well, we read, he's only mentioned two other times in the whole Bible. But one is in John chapter 7, verse 15 and 51. Nicodemus, he's sitting around with his fellow leaders in the Sanhedrin. In John 7, 50, Nicodemus, it says, who had gone to Jesus earlier and it was one of their own number, the Sanhedrin asked, does our law condemn anyone, talking about Jesus, without first hearing him to find out what he's doing? I mean, that is like, here's my head, here's the chopping block. What did Nicodemus do that night? He went to hear Jesus to find out what he was doing. And the rest of the Sanhedrin called him, What, are you from Galilee too? They massacred him. Well, the other place that we find the story of Nicodemus is in John chapter 19. And it says later, this is after Jesus was crucified and his body had been taken down off the cross. Later, Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy guy, asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now, Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, He came and took the body away and he was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night, who earlier had been at night, who earlier had been in the darkness. But now he brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about 75 pounds of spices, to soak the body of his rabbi in because he treasured his rabbi so much. Nicodemus, I really believe, found the light. Nicodemus walked from the darkness into the light. And you know what? His story is my story. And it's your story. We need to allow God, through the person of Jesus, to break us out of our mold and mindset and to follow the dangerous, wild wind of God that is the Spirit from the darkness into the light. Amen? Amen. Let's pray. you know in this moment there's a reality where some of you have been met even in these moments by Jesus of Nazareth and you've been walking around in the darkness and you've seen a light a light of redemption and a light of grace. And Jesus is inviting you into a new way to live, even right now. It's not a weird country club and it's not a secret handshake. It's the master of the universe inviting you into a dangerous journey of life. And some of you, in your spirit, need to respond to that. And so, I'd like to give just a moment of silence for you to respond to the master of the universe inviting you to life. You know, others of us have been born again. and have experienced conversion, but as we look at our life, there is no life. There's no life. So we need to come to the rabbi and ask him for life. He might overturn all of our files and we might need to die to find life in certain things. but Jesus says that it really is worth it. So he invites you into life. And lastly, others of us are confronted with an arrogance that we've known exactly how it goes and exactly how to do it, and we need to repent of that. We need to repent of ways that we've hung on, not to the core, but to the things around the core. And Jesus, as a body, we ask your forgiveness for that. We ask you to bring us into the light. of freedom and grace and hope and truth. Thank you, Jesus, for your life, for your death on the cross, which brings us life. Amen.
