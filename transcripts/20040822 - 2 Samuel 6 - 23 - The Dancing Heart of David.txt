Hello. My name is David Johnson. Oh, sit down. Mully. Has my mother put you up to that? What's that about? And I'm the senior pastor here at Church of the Open Door. You know, all the jokes about me being a guest pastor, a guest speaker this week. It's not that funny. It's not funny. Anyway. So don't say it to me anymore. It'll be the 12th time. My summer break this year was, I think, a good mixture of ministry and rest, culminating in the last couple of weeks in Bratislava, Slovakia. Bonnie was able to go with me along with Keith Meyer, our executive pastor, and Sherry, his wife. Meeting there in Bratislava with friends that we have been getting closer to as a church more and more over the last few years. I think if you were here in February and you would remember when Uri, one of the elders of that church in Bratislava that we're connected to, and Daniel, their pastor, came to this pulpit and preached this relationship is just getting deeper and more meaningful as we find more and more in common in terms of even being able to help us with the missions that we are both on. I was able to spend a full week with them at a camp for adults that they had. I spoke, I preached Beatitudes there through a translator, which was a very interesting discipline for me to slow down. It was very weird for me. Last Sunday, I spoke in their church and dealt with the text in Joshua chapter 1 through 3, where the people are crossing the Jordan River. It's something I did here, and many of you may remember, where we talked about stepping into the deep water of a risky obedience. And when we step into the deep water of risky obedience, we might think we're going to die. But when we do that, God makes a way. And the waters parted. And not only did the waters parted, but it created dry ground for generations to come. And the reason I'm telling you that is because it was a very interesting thing and quite humbling to tell you the truth to be among a people where I was preaching a sermon like that that's kind of designed to call out risky obedience, but then to realize that for years these people had been doing this, stepping into deep water of risky obedience. This is a church that was founded when communism was still in rule. They have a paper that they share with people of 80 miracles, miracles that had to happen for that church to even exist. So you just got to know it's a humbling thing to speak to people about and calling them to risky obedience when that has been their legacy. That has been how they've been living and how they've been founded, in fact. But now they are doing the same as they are stepping into deep water of risky obedience, trying to figure out what it means to have a culturally relevant presence for the kingdom of God in the context of a culture that is pretty well hostile to the things of God. And by the way, that's where we've kind of meshed with them. Because we're trying to figure out how to do the same thing, to be in the world, to be totally connected to the culture we live in, but not of the world, but bring the life, not condemning messages, but the life of God to people. And we've just developed this wonderful relationship with them around that very mission, if you will. So it's not us going over there and telling them how. We're learning from each other. I also need to say as I kind of reenter here that I'm just very grateful for the men and women who ministered in this pulpit. In my absence, I heard from numbers of you over the weeks that I was gone, actually. This has just been great, and it's very clear, and I've listened to all the tapes of these people. It's been very clear that it was more than just having good speakers. I mean, that's one thing. But every single one of these men and women spoke in a way that was right in the flow of the vision that we had been talking about just before I went on break. And one of the things that occurred to me, and I just wanted us to notice it, is that as these people came from various parts of the country and even the world, and as I was in a different part of the world at the same time, they were all speaking things that were very consistent with the direction we're moving. And it's an interesting thing to notice that we are networking more and more with people in this community, in our nation, at a broader level, even around the world. As I think of John Lynch who came and spoke to us about amazing grace. What an incredible talk. He's from Arizona. Kurt Vickman, pastor, one of the pastoral staff over at Christ Presbyterian right here in town. But when he told his story, it's real clear that he's kind of one of our guys. But he came back and he talked to us about what it means to leave a legacy for future generations. And on and on. The speakers were all like that. But what I noticed, again, was this sense of we're in a stream of networking of relationships that's getting bigger and bigger. That's creating kind of a synergy relative to what God's called us to. And I think we should have our hopes up about what God's doing. It's just a good thing. And I'm glad to be home. Let's pray as we go to the word. Father, I thank you for our time of worship that allowed us to declare our love for you and declare to you that we're here to worship you. And sometimes we don't do it well, but our desire is to have you at the very center of our lives, of our thinking, of our desires. And Father, as we now move into this time of the word, be on it and in it, breathe life in and through it. In Jesus' name, amen. We are returning this morning to what we have been calling for some time a journey of the heart. It is a journey we began actually last September with some obvious detours and stops along the way. The guide we have chosen for this journey is David. Through the examination of his life, it's found in 1 and 2 Samuel. But the real attraction to David for this journey of the heart has been his heart. And it wasn't that David had a perfect heart. It wasn't that he had a flawless heart. Far from it, actually, as we will discover in rather graphic detail next week. He just had a really good heart. Referred to in Scripture as being a man after God's own heart, and we have discovered of his heart over these last several months these things that David had, among other things, a passionate heart. He had a bold and courageous heart, a loyal and generous heart, a praying and worshiping heart, characterized at times by wild abandon. 2 Samuel 6.14, we find David dancing before the Lord with all his might, which just happens to be where we are going to stop today on our journey of the heart. Today I want to examine what we will call the dancing heart of David, and in particular, I want to examine what his dancing reveals to us about his heart. The biblical account for this event is found in 2 Samuel 6, so if you have your Bibles open to 2 Samuel, the 6th chapter, the incident at which this dancing display took place came in the context of the return of the Ark of the Covenant to a place of centrality in the life of God's people. Let me tell you a little bit about the Ark of the Covenant, maybe beyond what you know from Indiana Jones movies. The Ark of the Covenant was a rectangular box, not quite four feet in length, a little over two feet in depth and width. It was constructed with wood overlaid with gold. It contained three things. Number one, the tablets of stone that Moses delivered from Sinai. Number two, a jar of manna from the wilderness wandering of God's people. And number three, the staff of Aaron that had budded. Those three things spoke symbolically of three very real things in the life of God's people. They spoke, first of all, of the covenants of God. that would be the tablets, the promises of God, and their presence among God's people would be an ever-present reminder of the covenants of God. They are irrevocable. My love for you will never change the promises of God. Second, the provision of God, that would be symbolized in the jar of manna, and the power of God symbolized in the rod of Aaron that was budding. But when you put all those things together, what the Ark of the Covenant symbolized most profoundly for the people of God was the presence, the manifested presence of God among his people. Just a thing to note about the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark of the Covenant did not have magical powers. And when the people of God tried to treat it as if it did, which they sometimes did do, they got into trouble and they fell into error. The Ark, however, was a symbol of something very real. I just mentioned them. The Ark of the Covenant was a symbol of the power and the presence and the promises of God. And for David to bring back the Ark at the beginning of his reign as king was to send a very important message to the people of God relative to what his kingdom was actually going to be about. And the message he was sending was this. the promises of God, the covenants of God, the provision and the power and the presence of God is going to be, in my kingdom, is going to be the very center of our lives. And the reason that was important to do at the beginning was because it hadn't been that way. It wasn't that way under Saul. Under Saul, there was a lot of God talk. They were God's people under Saul, but the provision and the power and the presence of God was not the center of their living, And it hadn't been that way for many years. In fact, it hadn't been that way since the Philistines had captured the Ark of the Covenant, which was the symbol of all of these things. So as the Ark of the Covenant comes back into the city, having been gone for so long, it says this in 2 Samuel 6, 5, and picture this, the Ark of the Covenant is finally coming back after years in exile. It says this, that David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the Lord with all kinds of instruments made of firwood and lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets and cymbals. Verse 14, and David was dancing before the Lord with all his might. And was shouting in the sound of the trumpet as David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord as David danced before the Lord with all his might. Irenaeus, the ancient church father, says this, that the glory of God is a man fully alive. You've got to get a picture of David, that when he danced, he was fully alive. The Bible says there was a time to mourn, there was a time to dance. Being fully alive and being made fully alive by God is manifested in knowing when it is time to mourn and when it is time to dance. It was time to dance, and he danced with all his might. But not everybody danced that day. It says in verse 16 this, Then it happened as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David that Michael, the daughter of Saul, who was also the wife of David, looked out the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord, and she despised him in her heart. So they brought in the ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the tent which David had pitched for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord. And when David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offering, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts. This was a very good day. Verse 20. But when David returned to bless his own household, Michael, the daughter of Saul, came out to meet David and said, how the king of Israel distinguished himself today. He uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servant maids as one of the foolish ones shamelessly uncovers himself. So David said to Michael, it was before the Lord who chose me above your father. Stop right there. There's a little tension in this marriage, don't you think? Chose me over your father to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel. Therefore, I will celebrate before the Lord. I will celebrate before the Lord. I don't care what you say. And I will be more lightly esteemed than this if I have to be. And I will be humbled even in my own eyes, but with the maids of whom you have spoken, with them I will be distinguished. Again, there's something going wrong with this marriage. Maybe explain some things we're going to talk about next week. And Michael, the daughter of Saul, had no child to the day of her death. So what we actually have here are two hearts. One, the dancing heart of David. the dried up and despising heart of Michael. Dried up and despising hearts are not that hard to find. I think they're a dime a dozen. I'm not that interested in her heart. I'm much more interested in this dancing heart of David. And not just the dance. It's not just that he danced. And the appeal today wouldn't be to get everybody to dance. What I'm interested in is in the story behind the dance. Because the story behind the dance reveals to us something about David's heart. For it answers this question. What would make him dance for joy? Let me ask you a question. Have you ever danced for joy? I think most of you know, and it's been well documented, meaning that there is plenty of proof that I am not much of a dancer. Lots of evidence for that. But when I ask myself this question, Dave, have you ever danced just for joy? I thought of a few examples of that. One is captured in this photo right here. And the story behind the dance is in the picture, isn't it? That's the day I danced for joy with my daughter at her wedding. And when this little scene between me and her was over, I took off my coat and everybody joined us and we danced for what? Joy. Another dance that I thought of is captured in this picture. That's my wife, in case you don't know. And there's a story behind that dance a few years ago. Christmas Eve, all the presents were opened and one of the presents was a Barry White CD. Where is he? Come to Papa. Okay, okay, that's enough. Yeah! Man, if you can't dance at that, you can't dance. And I can't dance, but we dance for joy. I mean, I want you to move in on her face. There's one happy, satisfied woman right there. What did you think? Come on. I'll tell you the story behind that dance after 30 years. I am nuts about my wife. That's the story behind that dance right there. Another dance came to mind, and this is because it was so recently when we were in Slovakia, and it's captured now in this video. No, no, no, you get out there, Dan. Go, come on. That's me being pushed. Okay, there's a story behind the dance. The story behind the dance, this was in Slovakia. We were doing a camp away from Bratislava. We weren't the only people at this resort type of camp. There was a group of Russian women and a bus. We called them babushkas. That was just our name for them. They were about this tall. They were at least that wide. They could have played linebacker for the Chicago Bears, every one of them. And we were walking through this rumor. They were having a polka band and got caught up in the fun. It was a lot funnier if you were there. the dance for joy that may come closest honestly I was trying to figure out what in my human spirit could most connect with David when he danced this dance the dance for joy that might come closest to looking like the dance of David is a dance I've never actually danced though I hope to someday it's how I think I will look and it's how I think I will feel if the Chicago Cubs ever actually go to the World Series and win. For on that day, beloved, David and all the house of David will rise up with shouting and the sound of the trumpet, and we will dance before the large screen TV with all our might. I promise you that. And there's a story behind that dance, too. As you wonder, how are you going to bring this back to the story of David? Watch this. There is a story of the dance, that I will dance if the Cubs win the pennant. The story behind that dance is 100 years of futility. Part of what explains the exuberance is that we've been waiting, 100 years of waiting, Watching, desiring, wondering, will it ever happen? So that when it does, you know what you do? You dance. That's exactly what's going on here with the ark. David, a man after God's own heart, has been desiring, has been wondering and watching. Will the presence and the power and the glory of God ever be absolutely central to the people of God again? And as the ark is beginning to come in, he is seeing this desire finally fulfilled that maybe he wondered if it would ever happen, and so David danced. Let me tell you this morning the story behind the dance of David, because the story behind the dance reveals something to us about his heart, for it answers the question, what would make him dance for joy? The story begins actually in 1 Samuel 4, before David, before even Saul. But I will begin this story with this word, Ichabod. It's a strange word, Ichabod. It's an even stranger name, but it's a name that appears and is central to the story. And what it means is this, the glory of God is gone. Ichabod. 1 Samuel 4. The nation of Israel is in trouble. Their nemesis, the Philistines, were coming against them at Shiloh for a great battle. The spiritual leaders of Israel at the time, most notably the two sons of the prophet Eli, named Hophni and Phinehas, were pathetically weak individuals relative to things of the spirit. They had no sense of reverence for God. They had no hunger for the presence of God. But they were religious, which made them superstitious. Religious people are that superstitious. So when the battle approached, they were looking for an edge. So they brought out the symbol of the presence of God, the Ark of the Covenant, into the battle, which to them was not much more than a good luck charm. A way for them to look reverential toward God when they really weren't. Again, they had no desire for the presence of God, no hunger for the glory of God. They, I think, were much like people who go to church as an addendum to their life. They tip their hat to God, but it's not much more than a good luck charm. Kind of touching all their spiritual bases or rubbing a spiritual rabbit's foot, so maybe if they do this little religious thing, things will go well for them. It's really, when you think about it, an odd and futile way to feel as though you have some control of God by doing religious things. I'll do this, then God has to do that. That's a very small God. Well, not only did they lose the battle, but 30,000 people perished. Hophni and Phinehas among them. The Ark of the Covenant was taken then by the Philistines. A single messenger escaped, ran back to the city to tell Eli, the prophet, the father, again, of Hophni and Phinehas what had happened. He found Eli sitting on a wall and told him this. I have horrible news. The battle is lost. 30,000 are dead. Your two sons are among them in the Ark of the Covenant. the symbol of the very presence and glory of God among God's people is gone. Eli was so overwhelmed, he fell over backwards off the wall, broke his neck and died. So the messenger needs to find someone else. He runs to the wife of Aphinahas and tells her the same story. She was great with child at the time. The trauma was so great, it sent her into labor. She gave birth to a son. She died immediately after that. But before she did die, she named this little child Ichabod with this explanation. 1 Samuel 4.21 I name him Ichabod for the glory of God is departed because the ark of God is taken away. Ichabod. It's a strange word. It's an even stranger name. It would be a horrible moniker to have placed on you. But in Revelation chapter 3 verse 1, it is a moniker, a designation that is given to, of all things, a church. The church in Sardis. To the angel of the church in Sardis write this. I know your deeds that you have a name that you are alive, but you are in fact dead. In other words, Ichabod is written, the glory has departed. It's still a church. People are still coming. Just no glory in this. Just no life in this church. Like the rhyme of the ancient mariner, corpses man the ship, and dead men pull the oars, and dead men steer the vessel. That is a compelling and disturbing image to me. The ship is moving and from a distance appears to be functioning. There's only one problem. Everything on that ship is dead. It just looks alive. Now, the point of all of that is this. That this kind of thing, disturbing as it is to realize, can happen among God's people. They are still God's people, but the active presence of God can be quenched. It is certainly happening in David's day and in these biblical accounts I am sharing with you. And it's something that can happen in a church. And if it were a church, activities would still be happening. Classes would still be meeting. Songs would still be sung. Pews would still be filled. Money would still be raised. Buildings would still be built. Just one problem. No overwhelming sense of God's glory. sweet sense of his presence. Lots of activity. Lots of movement. Lots of noise. And maybe because of the movement and the noise and the activity, a lot of people wouldn't even notice that the glory is gone, but some would. And there would be in them a yearning and a hunger and they would even look around and say things like this. Lots of activity. Lots of buzz. The parking lot is full. But what happened to that? What happened to that sweet sense? I can't even define it. I don't even know how to say it, but I miss it. Ichabod is written the glory of God is gone it might look great worship services that are rousing and majestic sermons that are entertaining and funny maybe even draw a tear to your eye but it is no longer the pervading overwhelming undeniable presence and power of the living God that you experience or even desire anymore just good well crafted religious entertainment. Ichabod is written, the glory of God is gone. Beloved, the reason David danced was because the glory and the presence and the power of God that had been absent and David knew it, even though they were going, I mean, they had their kingdom. Saul had a kingdom, a lot of God talk around it. That presence and power and glory of God was returning to a place of centrality among the people of God. And it wasn't going to make all their problems going to go away. This wasn't going to be a magic wand, but it was going to be a place where the people of God would once again be centered around their God. And the reason he danced was not because of the magical effect, but because the presence and power and glory of God is what he wanted more than anything. He wanted more than his own glory. He was just beginning his kingdom there, and his glory would be something that would be an issue, don't you think? but he wanted God's glory more than his own more than his own kingdom more than his own success and here's a little flash for you it's the people who want his glory and his kingdom and his success and his renown that are generally the ones who get that stuff for the eyes of the Lord move to and fro throughout the earth that he may strongly support says the scriptures that he may manifest his presence to those whose hearts are completely his. So David danced with all his might. Why? Because he was beginning to experience and see and taste and smell what he had long desired, God's glory, God's presence, and his power once again being central to the people of God. It's happening. It's happening, you guys, would be David's response. Another story, by the way, that illustrates this same dynamic is found in Exodus chapter 3. Again, if you have your Bibles, turn to that. Exodus chapter 33, near the front of your Bibles. Read verses 1 through 3 with me. They'll be on the screen if you don't have the scriptures with you. Then the Lord spoke to Moses, depart go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying to your descendants, I will give it. And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive about the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. Stop right there. What he's speaking about, obviously, is the promised land flowing with milk and honey. It's the next phrase that is disturbing. Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not go up in your midst with you because you are an obstinate people lest I destroy you on the way. I mean, you're only going to pull this thing together and give you a picture. God is saying to Moses here, most amazing thing. I'm going to give you, Moses, church, if you will, finally everything you ever wanted in your life. The land I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the promised land flowing with milk and honey, it's yours. And I will send an angel to remove all the obstacles, and the obstacles were people, the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, and the Parasites. In other words, everything you ever wanted, people, everything you ever longed for, hoped for, prayed for, wandered in the desert looking for, it's yours. Only one catch. I will not go with you. You'll still be my people, but that overwhelming sense of my presence and that sweet sense of my power and provision will not go with you, for you are an obstinate people and I would consume you. I'm going to sit on that one and let yourself be a little bit disturbed by that. First of all, let me explain why he called them obstinates. Just previous to Exodus 33 is Exodus 32. But it creates a context. In Exodus 32, you have what we all know to be the golden calf experience. And without going into all the details of that, What was really going on there was that Moses had gone up onto the mountain to get a word from God for the people. And it ended up being the covenants of God, the Ten Commandments. But he was taking too long. And the people who were waiting for Moses to come back were becoming impatient. In other words, the picture here was they were a people who as soon as God didn't do what they wanted him to do, and the way they wanted him to do it, they went and fashioned for themselves. And by the way, this is what's at the heart of the golden calf. It's not like never have a golden camp. This is what they had to heart. But what they did was they fashioned for themselves a God that was more to their liking. A God that they could manage. A God that they could control. And that was the offense God took. See, they didn't want the real God. They wanted one that jumped one. They said, jump. You're taking too long. You're an obstinate people. And I have news for you. This is the nicest thing I could do for you because if I was actively present among you, my active presence, my being who I am and pressing into the things I care about would probably consume most of you. And there's that disturbing thing again. The thought that the active presence of God would consume. Maybe many of us haven't thought of that. we are a people who desire the presence of God, especially here at Open Door. We talk about that all the time. But I wonder if instinctively we do get this. I wonder if maybe it's why many people are satisfied with a little religion, just a little taste, a little dose. Because I wonder if instinctively we know if the living God were really actively present among us, he would probably consume our ego and consume our pride and consume our agenda and our control. I think a lot of us, myself included, say, oh, God, we want your presence so bad, but what we really want is the goodies that he gives. The milk and honey. We don't really want him. God knows that. So I'll give you the goodies. God says, that's exactly what's going on here in Exodus 3. Okay, you want the goodies? I'll give you the goodies. The promised land, the milk and honey, contemporize that for us. If it were a church, you want success, you want size, you want to be the biggest church in town, you'll get it. I'll give you that. No more wandering in the desert. No more wondering where your next meal's coming from. No more desperate dependence on or pressing hard into me because you're not sure where to put your next step. No more fear, frustration, or fatigue. Milk and honey. You won't need me where you're going. because you will have arrived. You'll have everything you ever wanted and what you wanted was the milk and honey but you won't have me primarily because I wasn't what you wanted. What you wanted was the milk and honey and you thought you could use me like a rabbit's foot to get that. Do you know how many people I think are in church today and the reason they're in church is because it's like a rabbit's foot. They're using God to get and they'll make it all go good. it wasn't me you wanted it was the milk and honey so I'll give you the milk and honey you can have it all but I will not go with you you'll have a bunch of neat cool things you'll be the biggest church in town but you will not have that breathless undeniable tear in your eye take your breath away since God's here well to the people's credit this stopped them in their tracks. And by the way, authentic people of God, we often get off. And for us, it often can become a part about the milk and honey. I mean, the last sermon I preached before my break was about a hunger I have for more of the power of God. And you know what? And the manifested power of God, gifts of the Spirit being on display. And you know, it doesn't take much, does it, for us that all of a sudden the whole pursuit of God is really because we want the signs and wonders so we could be the hottest, show in doubt. I want people who want me all that other stuff flows out of that to the people's credit when this word came they began to mourn in verse 4 and to repent Moses in particular really shines here as his true heart for God is revealed to be very much the same as David's heart verse 15 says this then Moses said to God God if your presence does not go with us do not lead us up from here in other words Lord, I would rather stay in this dark place. I hate dark places. I am not saying, Lord, that I like it in the wilderness, but I would rather stay in this dark place and have this breathless sense, this undeniable sense of your presence and your provision. I hate manna, but I know it's coming from you. I don't have any wonderings about what's keeping us alive. It's you. I would rather eat manna for the rest of my life. Having this connection that it's coming from you, then move into this place where everything is easy without you. Because what I desire more than the goodies, this was a reminder. It was bringing him back to his real heart. What I want more than the milk and honey, more than comfort and success, is you. Said Moses, verse 16, he says something that goes to the very core of who we are as the people of God. And we ignore or forget this to our peril. And this word, by the way, has some history even here at Open Door. It's a word I've spoken before and we've dealt with before and confirmed our desire before. The verse says this. The verse is on the screen. I'm going to paraphrase it this way, Lord. Moses is speaking. It is only by your going with us. It is only by your manifested presence among us that we can be distinguished from any other people in the world. Meaning this, and this would be true for Moses, and I think it's true for us. As Moses is looking at himself and where the people of God fit in the world, did he have to be saying this? God, I mean, you look at your people. You didn't pick us because we were the biggest and the brightest and the best. That's not what we have to offer the world. What we have to offer the world is something that is only one thing. We're a people of the presence. who we are. It's all we've got. 1 Corinthians 14.25, Paul touches on this very thing. You may not know that he does, but he does. He's speaking to the Corinthians. They lost their focus. And they were all about some very peripheral things and trying to put on a big show. And they had begun to miss the point. And it was a spiritual show they were trying to put on. And basically what Paul said to them was this. Again, my paraphrase of 1425, 1 Corinthians 1425, Paul says, here's the goal of your come together time, your worship time. It's not to be a fancy show and glitzy entertainment. This is the point that by the working of the Holy Spirit of God among you with power through the worship, through the declaration of the truth and the word, that the secrets of men's hearts would be disclosed, causing them to fall on their face and worship God, declaring as they do that God is certainly among them. That verse, just so you know, I don't refer to that verse. That verse is like a dream of mine. I mean, we have a big church, and we try to do things in a way that's excellent. I mean, I don't think God is glorified in a shoddy thing. But I have no confidence in my ability or our worship band's ability or anybody on our staff or anybody of telling a joke funny enough or giving wisdom good enough to help blind eyes see or deaf ears hear or lame people walk. We've been called to do something that goes way beyond our physical capacity. One of the dreams I have is that people would come and they would walk out the door and they wouldn't walk out the door going, oh, that was a good talk. Oh, that was really good music. I like the guy in the horn. But they would walk away and have to, maybe after some of that stuff, they would have to in their spirit say, you know, I don't know why. smelled something. I tasted something. I don't know if I've ever tasted that before, but it tasted good. I think it was God. That's the presence. And we are a people of the presence. It's who we are. It's all we've got. For without the manifested presence of God, said Moses, what do we have to distinguish us from any other people? Here's the answer. Nothing. We're just another dog and pony show, and guess what? We can't compete. I've said this before. Hollywood makes better movies than us. Broadway makes better plays. Corporate America builds bigger buildings. That's not the level at which we're going to compete or try to win the hearts of men and women. We are a people of the presence of the holy God of Israel. It's who we are. It's all we've got. Question, how do you get that presence to move among people? I don't have a big, complicated answer. You know what I think is the accurate answer? Want it. more than anything want the presence and the power and the provision and the promises of God to be the centerpiece of your life, of our church's life, because it's the people who want it more than anything, more than success, more than size, more than milk and honey. They're the ones who get it. See, the reason David danced, the story behind the dance, And what it reveals to us about David's heart is that David, like Moses before him and Paul after him, had an intense hunger and a deep desire for the manifested presence of God to be experienced by his people, for the glory of God to be central and seen among his people, for the promises of God to be remembered. So we will speak of the covenants of God to us, the beloved. And he wanted the ways of God to be followed and embraced. So that when that Ark of the Covenant, which was a symbol of all those things that David desired, when that Ark was being brought back to the place of centrality among the people, David danced. Why? Because this was the fulfillment of everything he ever wanted, not just for himself but for his people. This is the kind of kingdom and this is the kind of king I want to be. David was a king, and he had a kingdom, and from a human point of view, he was going to have a responsibility and a human authority to rule that kingdom, to make judgments and choose directions. But this was his prayer. Even as he was responsible to do all those other things, His deepest prayer, his deepest heart was this, Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth. Hallowed be thy name, because what I want more than my name, says David, more than my throne, my kingdom, my power, our presence to be seen and known is yours. And that is the story behind the dance. Revealing to us maybe just one more reason why David was called a man after God's own heart. Let me close with this quote from Eugene Peterson's book, Leap Over a Wall, which is a story of David that we've referenced from time to time on this journey. Peterson says this, David danced. Because in God, David had access to life that exceeded his capacity to measure or control. He was on the edge of mystery, of glory, and so he danced. When we're going about our work responsibly and steadily, we walk. But when we're beside ourselves with love, charged with excess of meaning, shaken out of preoccupation with ourselves, we dance. David danced. If he had been merely carrying out his religious duties or conducting a political ceremony, he would have walked in solemn procession before the ark, leading it into Jerusalem with dignity and formality. But he wasn't just doing his duty. So David danced. I'll leave you just with a question, which is a little odd. Preachers are supposed to leave you with the answer. I'm going to leave you with a question. It's the same question I've been, and I want to continue to ask myself. What makes you dance? Like David danced. What do you want? What do you want as much as David wanted the presence and the power and the glory of God to be central and seen and known among the peoples? And what does what you want reveal to you about your heart? So you know who gets to experience the presence and the power and the promises of God? I've already said it. It's just so simple. It's the people who want it more than anything. More than the milk and honey. I've got news for you. God gives milk and honey. God gives good gifts. But it's the people who seek the giver. The promises and the covenants and the power and the presence of God who get the whole enchilada, if you will. The whole ball of life. I agree with Arrhenius, who said the glory of God is a man or a woman fully alive. David was that man. Let's pray as we close. Father, I thank you for this story. I thank you for the revelation, again, of David's incredible heart. And we just would bring our heart to you. and we identify with so many people I do in the stories that we've looked at today identify with the people of Israel in Exodus 33 who lose their way and all of a sudden it's about the goodies and not God and now Lord I can say too I identify and we identify with being brought up short and realizing again what we love the most and it's you, it really is Father I pray that as we continue our journey of faith as a people, as a community of faith in this community where you've placed us with responsibilities that go beyond this community into a nation and even around the world, that we would be a people who are consistently coming back to this center thing, that we want to be a people who have your covenants, your promises, your provision, your glory, and your presence at the very center of who we are and how we live and how we love and how we dance. I pray all these things to be true and growing among us in Jesus' name. All God's people said, amen. The altar team will be here for anyone who needs prayer for anything at all. The rest of you are dismissed. God bless you as you leave. Thank you.
