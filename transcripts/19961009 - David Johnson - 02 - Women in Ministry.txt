...a course that is dealing with the issue of women in ministry. Essentially, what I'm sharing with you is kind of a statement of our position as a church. What I'm sharing on these weeks is more than just our conclusion. I've been trying to share as much as I can the process we've been going through. And so we've gotten into some things beyond just the excesis of what I think are some critical passages. Three primary passages that we're dealing with, as I indicated last week, First of all, 1 Corinthians 14, verses 34 and 35. We're still dealing with that today. We didn't quite get out of that last week. The second is 1 Timothy 2, 9-15. And the third is 1 Corinthians 11, but simply because of time, only portions of 1 Corinthians 11. And sharing with you this study, I've also shared with you, and we began to talk about our method of study, and sharing with you the principles of biblical interpretation, trying to include you in, again, not only in our conclusions, but in the process and some of the biblical interpretation tools that we applied to the texts we were going through them. The first you might remember was grammatical integrity, that any time we come to a text we need to involve ourselves at some level in the original language. And the original language reveals what is being said. Last week, I'm not going to go into it again, but I went at some length, giving me some illustrations, and some of them were rather current, as to how an insight into a Greek word really opens up the text for us and really makes it richer. Grammatical integrity is the first historic integrity, that understanding historic and cultural realities that surround the text help explain not just what is being said, but why certain things are being said. And again, I gave some examples of how doing work in history has really enlightened us as to what a particular writer's scripture is saying and why they're saying it. The third principle that we've been utilizing is contextual integrity. I hope you never forget this. Any text without a context is a pretext. We talked about just kind of having a preconceived idea and finding Bible verses that support our thing, our idea. But when we see the context around that verse, we find out that verses often mean far different than what they mean on face value when you see them in the context. Fourth was that we need to know the difference between a timeless truth and a regulation for a certain people at a certain time for a certain purpose. And again, I gave an illustration to that explaining what I meant. With all of those things in mind, we began with 1 Corinthians 14 asking this question. 1 Corinthians 14, let me just read it again and kind of refresh your memory. It says this. In the middle of a discussion about prophecy and tongues and their out-of-control expression, Paul said this, Let the women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak, but let them subject themselves just as the law also says. Do not allow women to speak. The question we asked on the front end of that was, is that a timeless truth? And to answer that, we began to apply some of the principles of biblical interpretation. The first thing we dealt with was history as it relates to culture. Remember that? That's where we talked about the rabbi's view of women, and we talked about misogyny, did a big section on that. And basically that women were subservient and inferior. We went past, that was the cultural view of women at the time these words were written. We went past that and dealt with the history as it relates to scripture. And we went further back in history than what the culture was around 1 Corinthians 14 and talked about creation. And in Genesis chapter 1, when God created male and female, he created them. And he said to them, rule and subdue and multiply. And we talked about a co-reigning of men and women, a co-regency. And we talked about Adam, who, when he looked at the created woman, got it right. Remember, he didn't say, I may be served me and weighed on me and babied me and always remember she's subservient to me. He said, that's bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. And for that cause, a man shall leave his mother and father and cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. The God-intended deal was a one-flesh dynamic. And he said to them, rule, multiply, subdue. What blew that apart was, theologically, the fall of Genesis 3. And one of the results of the fall, among many other things, was this relationship between men and women that was now, instead of this, it was a vying for power. Men and women were vying for power. He and her desire shall be for him. And the desire, remember that? The desire there was not a warm and gooey I love you desire, which would be a good thing. The desire was the same desire that is spoken of in the very next chapter of Genesis. The same Hebrew word where God says to Cain, Cain, sin is crossing at the door, and its desire is for you. And its desire is to tear you down. And he shall rule over you is not God's ordained pattern, Genesis 3. Her desire will be for him to tear him down. He shall rule over her is not God's ordained pattern. That's the result of the fall, and it's the despotic crushing of the woman, and now you've got the spying for power, and then we've been going to use for submission and execution, but I'm just trying to get you up to speed. All of that speaks to Scripture as it relates to theology. In fact, in Galatians chapter 3, verse 28 says this, there is neither, now because of Christ, you're clothed in Christ, the result of that is there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female, for all of you are one in Christ. Now, back off of that, you're all one in Christ. That does not settle this issue. That verse does not settle this. What that says is that, and by the way, whatever side of the argument you are on, women can do ministry or exercise authority and do leadership in the church or not. Everyone would agree that that is true theologically. So, you know, this is how the argument would go. Of course that's true theologically. Theologically, men and women are equal. Jews and Greeks, all of us equal. But does that translate into function? Okay? That's the next question. Does that historic view of women theologically, that they are redeemed just as men, no more Greek or Jew, no more male and female slave or free, does that translate, that theological truth that we would all agree about, translate into function? And that is a very important question. Let's do some work around that. Acts chapter 2 speaks to that, I believe. I wouldn't build my whole argument on any one of these passages, but this is certainly one I would point to. it's Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 most of you know that amazing things are happening Peter in verse 14 stands up to explain as best he can what it is that these people are seeing when the spirit has just fallen it says in verse 14 but Peter taking his stand with the eleven raised his voice and declared to them saying this let this be known to you and give heed to my words for these men are not drunk as you suppose for it is only the third hour of the day. If it was later, they might have been drunk, but that's not what's going on here. What we just saw here, what we have seen manifested here with this bizarre stuff is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel. So we're seeing a fulfillment of a prophecy. And what Joel prophesied was this, that in the last days it shall be this way. And by the way, the last days are a bunch of stuff. I don't want to get lost in this. But, you know, why are we in the last days? We've been in the last days since Christ roll us from the dead. The last days is a very long day. We are in the last days. We've been in the last days since Christ roll us from the dead. It shall be in the last days, in this final age, that I will pour my spirit on all mankind. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall dream, and shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams, even upon my bond slaves, both men and women, I will in those days pour forth my spirit, and they shall prophesy. Stop right there. You've probably heard those passages before. Go through them piece by piece and be a first century Jew as you're hearing them. I will pour forth my spirit upon all mankind. Stop right there. All mankind. It doesn't probably affect you. You don't have any kind of visceral response to that other than that's nice. If you're a Jew, though, what that means is, what do you mean all mankind? Who would you have a problem with the spirit falling on? A Gentile. What do you mean all mankind? The door is being opened. The door of the kingdom, because of Pentecost, is being opened. Barriers are being destroyed, and I'm changing the economy, God says. I'm changing the economy. It is no longer just for the Jew, but also for the Gentile. I'm going to pour my spirit on all mankind. And so any Jew hearing that is going, I mean, this has been an upsetting day, wouldn't you say? Being, you know, okay, being asked after two, the spirit fell, weird things are happening. They're hearing their, you know, from people who don't know their language, the great deeds of God. and you're going to pour forth the Spirit on everybody. So that's got me reeling right there. And by the way, just to, this is a little side light for people who struggle with and need to go through a little bit of a process accepting some of this stuff. Just know that while Peter is preaching, the Spirit's going to fall on all men, which would include Gentiles. There was a time in Peter's life that he had a hard time bringing it to the Gentiles. Remember that? He had to grow a little bit and accept something that kind of blew his paradigm a little bit. Well, if you're gagging on the neck on that all men thing, then the next thing is really, I mean, some people I'm sure quit listening by this point. Because then it says, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. When getting problems with the sons, but your daughters shall prophesy. Young men and your old men will see visions and dreams, bonds to these men and women. Let me tell you about the economy in Israel and why those persons are so revolutionary. The basis of authority and power in Israel was fundamentally based on three things. It had to do with race, it had to do with gender, and it had to do with age. So if you're a Jewish, that was the race you wanted to be. Male, that was the gender you wanted to be. Old person, that was the age you wanted to be old. Then you had power. Old Jewish guys, that's right. Old Jewish guys, it's a great system, by the way, if you are an old Jewish guy. Know why? Because you don't have to be smart. You just have to be an old Jewish guy. Right? You don't have to be wise. You don't have to know God. You don't have to breathe the very word of life. You just have to be an old Jewish guy. And we'll go, oh, okay, because you're an old Jewish guy. Because the basic authority was being old, Jewish, and male. It wasn't such a good deal. If you were a young Gentile woman, that would be a bad deal. Jesus comes at Pentecost and says, I'm changing the rules. I'm changing the rules. It's no longer authority and power and status, if you will, in the kingdom is not going to be based on race, class, age, or gender. It's going to be based now on the spirit in you. The spirit on you. And men and women on whom the spirit falls, in whom the spirit resides, that will be the quality we now look for. We'll look for a different thing. And so, again, with that little paradigm of what authority was about, when you find out the young men, that would have been what they tripped over, not the old men. And the bond slaves, they would have freaked out over that as well. Well, what I'm giving you that for is to say I think that this new economy at Pentecost does speak to function, not just to a theology that says, yes, in Christ, men and women are equal. But that speaks to function, I think. Well, let's keep going. Let me give you another example. Romans chapter 16. Romans chapter 16, verses 1 and 2 is an example of men and women prophesying or moving in ministry. It's kind of this in action. Paul is speaking. He says this. I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church which is at Centuria, that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and that you help her in whatever manner she may have need of you, for she herself has also been a helper of many, and of myself as well. interesting passage of scripture she's called a servant in verse 1 she's called a helper of many in verse 2 not bad translations but it's interesting when you get into what was one of the principles we need to do in the Greek you want to get into the syntax and get into the original language the word servant in verse 1 of chapter 16 is interesting it's the Greek word diakonos and it's the word deacon, it means deacon it's interesting the literal translation who is a deacon of the church, which is a centuria. But it's interesting that when the word means deacon, here it's rendered servant. Now, it can also mean servant. So it's not a bad translation, but the literal word means deacon, indeed the office of a deacon. And what was interesting is I kind of stumbled on that when I found that same word, diakonos, in other passages as it referred, and it was referring to a man, a man, it didn't call them servants, it called them deacons or ministers. The word diakonos means deacon, minister does mean servant, but it's interesting that when it was applied to Phoebe, it's the word they chose to use, still consistent with the verse, but they chose to use the word servant rather than call her a deacon or a minister, which is also what the word means. Here it's servant. Why? Well, my opinion is that at that point, somebody made an interpretation, didn't do a translation. I don't want to get in trouble. Well, I might get in trouble. But are you aware that the word of God is an error? But there are translations from the Greek where people don't translate the word right, and we have interpretations and things like that. And so you need to be careful. It's one of the reasons that I think it's important to work in some of the original languages. And I'm not talking about huge errors. It's not a huge error, but it's interesting. It's just an interesting thing. One translation that I read, I had a bunch of translations out of my desk, got close to calling her a deacon when they called her a deaconess. I said deaconess and I've been to a deaconess. The only thing that was interesting about that was that there's no such word. There's no such word as a deaconess. And what I mean by that, in the Greek, it's a neutral term, like a teacher. A deacon is like a teacher. A deacon is a deacon. A teacher is a teacher. If I called the teacher who was a female a teacherette, how would you feel? It sounds like you're not quite a teacher, doesn't it? You're kind of a teacherette. It's like a Chevette. It's like not quite a car. Ha, ha, ha. Not quite a car. Anyway. Ha. Yeah, anyway, anyway. The point is, I don't want to get creepy about it, but a deaconess, there's no such thing as a deaconess. Not in the text. Not in the text. She's a deacon. And I just think we're nervous about that, because we're not comfortable calling Phoebe a deacon. Because that's what men are. Men are deacons, women are deaconesses. And we wouldn't even need any disrespect, but I'm going to be picked. No such word. Helper of many. Verse 3. By the way, let's get back to verse 1. I commend you to our sister Phoebe, who was a minister of the church here, which is at Centuria. I commend to you, our sister Phoebe, who was a deacon of the church, which is at Centuria. And I think it can be rendered also, I commend you to our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church. Because to be a deacon, you are a servant. To be a minister, you are a servant. But I would put all three of those words in there. But you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, that you help her in whatever she may have need of you. So I want you to serve her. She might have some things and work, and I'll tell you what she needs. For she's a helper of many. Now that was an interesting phrase, a helper of many. And then when you first read that, I'm not trying to be creepy, but that's a safe thing to say. I mean, women are helpers of many. That's kind of a role for women. That's a safe word, though, for helpers of many. The Greek word is prostatis. Get away from the text. Get away from what you think it ought to mean. And just get into the Greek and you find out that prostatis means this. To order, to arrange, to appoint, to order, to arrange, to appoint. Still okay, it doesn't bother me. To rule, now I'm getting nervous. To manage. To rule, to manage, to care, and to help. So, okay, we didn't defile the texture by calling her a helper of many. It does mean to help. It does mean to care. It also means to manage and to rule. And I found it interesting in 1 Timothy 3, 4, and 5, when that same word, postatis, is used to describe elders, the phrase goes he prostates his family well he rules his family well he rules his family well when prostates was connected to a man they didn't say he helped his family a lot it says he ruled his family well that was when they had it connected with a man they called it a ruler to rule your family means to order, to rule, to manage to help Therefore, 1 Timothy 5.17 calls for double honor for those elders who prostates well and work hard at preaching and teaching. Double honor for those elders who prostates, who are the helper of many. But when it was translated in this, connected to an elder, the prostates there was an elder who manages well. So, you hear the point I'm making? When that same word was used in connection with a man, they saw them as a manager or a ruler. It's interesting that that same word here applied to Phoebe. She's called a helper. One translation calls her a good friend of many. The problem is that's not a translation, that's an interpretation. She's a woman, and I don't, you know, I don't want to, but it feels like what was implied was that that couldn't mean that she's a ruler or a manager of many. I think the way you could read it, for she herself, I want you to help her in whatever matters she may have need of you, for she herself has also been a manager of many, a ruler of many, and of myself, oh no, and of myself as well. She's managed me as well. Oh no! Paul's saying that. Okay, those two examples to me speak of function. I mean, I'm going to go past theology. Theology, everybody agrees theologically, men are women, no longer slave nor free, great nor Gentile, or Jew nor Greek, male nor female, all of the world of Christ. But those two examples at least passed theology into function. So what do we know? What do we know so far? Even pulling out of some of the things we had from last week. What's history tell us? Well, what history tells us, both culturally and biblically, is that there were women who were deacons. Phoebe is an example of that. They governed some churches in Macedonia. In Macedonian churches, we have examples of that. They did prophesy and they did pray publicly. That redemption bought back for all people oneness in Christ. And that the principle of authority and function in the New Testament has more to do with gifts and sensitivity to the spirit than race, position, money, or sex. Okay? We're not done with this text, though, 1 Corinthians 14. We still have to apply some more of the principles that we've been working through. And by the way, because of what I just said, where I'm going is I'm not thinking women be silent in the church is a timeless truth. It doesn't feel like a timeless truth right now. I have too many examples of women who are already in leadership and are already speaking and being told they're going to speak and they need to speak. So what is this about? Well, we're not done. Let's consider the context. Do you remember last week when I first read these verses in 1 Corinthians 14? Part of what troubled me was that it seemed to come in the middle of nowhere. He's talking about prophecy, remember that? He's talking about tongues. In the middle of this discussion of tongues and prophecy, out of the blue, he goes in, and women, you be quiet, and whatever. Remember, I kind of said, well, maybe it's some weird and knee-jerk reaction to Paul. He didn't like women. He had a whoopie mother and a whatever. No, a whoopie father and an overbearing mother, and he just said these weird things. What he's doing here is speaking of tongues and prophecy. But the context is interesting because it's not as out of the blue. Although he's speaking of tongues and prophecy, in verse 28 I see something similar to what he's saying in verse 34. He's just saying it to a different group of people. Let him keep silent in the church. Verse 28. Now, okay, that's a flow. That's a connection. He's telling women to be quiet in verse 34. In verse 28, he's telling men to be quiet. Or men and women, I suppose. Let them be silent in the church. Forever and ever, timeless truth, forever and ever. He's talking about their abuse of tongues and prophecy. Verse 30, let the first keep silent. So he's telling somebody else to keep silent. Now here in verse 34, he says, women keep silent. I don't have time to go into all the things about tongues and prophecy, but one of the things that was happening in the Corinthian church was that tongues and prophecy were being done in a disorderly way. Verse 43 gives us some hint of that. If therefore the whole church should assemble together, and all of you speak in tongues, and the ungifted or unbelievers enters, will not they say, you guys are nuts? That's my very case. Are you not mad? And then he appeals to, but if he prophesied, and speak things that we can understand, they're going to come to you and say, isn't God in their midst? And that's what you want. You want that kind of effect. The point is, there is general chaos in the church in Corinth. Every element of their own life, if they came out of the pagan worship before they got saved, they brought all of that stuff into their new life. That's why last week I mentioned how bizarre it was, that they were getting drunk in communion, except we found out that they got drunk in their mystery religion, pagan religion, to help them do their worship. And so it wasn't so much a belief that they would do that in their Christian expression as well. Every part of their own life, they dragged it into the new. And he's telling a number of people to be quiet. And the way I kind of put it together is like this. Okay, you guys, you guys who are prophesying all over the place and there's no control, you be quiet. You guys who are talking in tongues and out of control, you be quiet. You loudmouth prophets, be quiet. You women, you be quiet too. It's like in my house. Every once in a while, everybody's talking at once, and I just kind of go, everybody quiet. Shut up, all of you. Okay, okay, okay. Maybe I'm right about that. I'm damn good. Maybe you can read that that way. But if you're honest with the text, and I hope you have your Bible so you can see these wordings here, it sounds a little more inclusive than you loud mouth, you loud obnoxious women. It says, the women. It doesn't say, you know, you're out of control, women. It says, the women. As I say to women, are allowed obnoxious, manipulative, eternal. Okay? Do we know anything about what's going on here in a broader context? Remember I said this last week, you've got to do context, and sometimes context gets bigger, sometimes the whole Bible. Well, we don't have to go to the whole Bible. If we had the luxury in this class of going through 1 Corinthians verse by verse, and after about a year and a half coming to this, we would have already had in the hopper of our teaching and understanding some stuff we learned back in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 about what was going on in the Corinthian church and in the Corinthian culture around the women that shed some light on why he might say to the women in Corinth, be quiet, okay? I'm going to give you some background. This is going to be out of 1 Corinthians 11, but also a little bit more history as well. The fact is this, that in current there was a militant feminism sweeping through that city. And consistent with everything else about the Corinthian church, whatever part of their own life they had, they brought it into their new life. The result was this, that in the name of freedom, which they had in Christ, in the name of equality, which they had in Christ, they were doing something that, quite frankly, you know, we look at it a lot, who cares? They were throwing off their veil, and they were shaving their heads. I remember the first time I preached this, this is two stories, way back in our other building, at the Crystal Building. And I remembered it was summer, and women were coming to church, and their hair was short because it was hot outside. You know, they were shaving, they were shaving, they were shaving their hair. And I'm thinking, oh, that's a stupid thing, it doesn't compute. What is this about? Actually, I mean, some of you might have been in religious contexts where they would encourage the women to wear a veil and to not shave their head. That would be a big thing about that. The fact is this. Paul does say, don't throw off the veil and it would be a shame for you to cut your hair. But he's dealing with a deeper issue. He's dealing with a deeper issue. Veiling that culture meant something. It doesn't mean anything to us. It's like, we have to grapple. What would that be for us? Fail in that culture was a sign of commitment. It was a sign of submission. It was a sign that said, basically, to a woman, to her husband, I belong to you. And basically, it would be, in its best rendering, in terms of what it meant, it could be oppressive, but in its intended meaning, the fail would mean this. You know what? The only one who needs to know what I look like, whether I'm beautiful or not, the only one who needs to know is my husband. I belong to you. It was a sign of fact. It was a sign of I belong to you. You belong to me. Nobody else needs to know. Throwing off the veil was more than getting comfortable. Shaving the head was more than cooling off for summer. It was an act of defiance saying, basically, I give a rip about you. The Bible says we're independent and we're equal and I'm going to do what I want. You can't tell me a thing. And that was rampant in the Corinthian church. Now, you know, I'm thinking, how do you preach this? Now, at the time, when I first went through this, I'm not trying to do anything on women's ministry. I'm just trying to do 1 Corinthians 11. Like, this week I'm trying to do James 2. I don't care about anything else. What does this mean? What is the name? It doesn't mean anything to our people. And I'm assuming I'm not going to say, women, you need to wear a veil. I don't believe that. It's a deeper issue about independence. I would give a look about you. And I thought of it as embarrassing, and I wasn't very comfortable, but I guess I should do it. And I think it's a good one, but it's very embarrassing. Late 60s, early 70s, active independence, everybody burned their... I didn't have to say it, you said it. See? Everybody's burned their brats. You know, I thought about that. Not everybody, women were. Yeah, I thought about it. I always do this with my eyes closed. I thought about this and then I pictured that whole time of our life together and what I thought was this is going to sound offensive to some people if I say this but the fact is you know what I don't think God cares I don't think Paul cares I don't think Paul cares I don't think Paul knew much about that stuff No, I don't think they had a living brother. I don don' think they had a living brother. I don't think they had that, then. It's not something. God cares a whole lot about that. The issue's bigger than bras. The issue's better than bales. The issue's bigger than hair. The issue is, and all we've seen is every time. The issue is that the heart is in a lot. I'm not going to be a human. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11, verse 11, as he's going on and on about, you know, women came from men and men. Yeah, women came from men, men. He kind of settles this whole debate about the hierarchy business. He's going into this whole hierarchy thing in the 1 Corinthians 11. Verse 11, verse 11, it kind of says, however, debated all of you on it. However, in the Lord, which is what we are, Neither is woman independent of a man, nor is man independent of a woman. So you throw in this zone to say, he's coming off the fail stuff. You know what? You are dead wrong if you think you're independent of him. You aren't independent of him. And neither is man independent of woman. You are dead wrong too, man, if you think you're independent of her. And you can live any way you want. You can't. Well, you can, obviously, but not still be under the sovereignty of God. For as, this is a great line. For as the woman originates from the man, what's he talking about there? Creation. From Adam, from his rib, came Eve. For as the woman originates from man, and by the way, later on in Timothy, there's going to be a big thing about man was created first and then the woman. But the same guy who wrote that also writes this. The guys are walking around, yeah, we were created first, so that's why we're created. Then he says, why do you get all excited about that, guys? Just know that so also man has his birth through the woman and all things originate from God. We're outnumbered on this one, guys. Here's the deal. For as women are raised from man, one woman came from one man. Every single man after that came from woman. Got it? So get all excited about, yeah, you came from this, so you're good. Okay, fine. Paul said that right there. But just know that ever since then, man has his birth through the woman. All things originate from God. What's he trying to say? Nobody's going to cut us from anybody. Everybody's under the sword. Everybody's under the sword. And if anybody tries to act like an under the sword, you're out from the end of the sword of God. And, by the way, see, I just gave you an example. Remember I said you've got a certain timeless truth from the regulation for certain people over a certain time. I think veils and how you cut your hair is a regulation for certain people over a certain time. I don't think it has any application to us. But there is, even in principles that God gives that are for a certain time, underlying principles that are deeper, and we just figured out what it was. It was about acting independently. And we, Paul says in Ephesians 5, be subject one to another and still trust. Nobody's independent of anybody. Women in Corinth, I hear it. Does that pull it together? Kind of pull it together. Women in Corinth, you have been set free. You are one in Christ. You have been given gifts. You have been brought back to infinite value in Christ. Leadership, service, and authority is not based on race, age, status, or sex, gender. It's based on maturity, gifts, godliness, and spirit control. And that is why, for all this stuff in, and that is why when I find a Phoebe, Paul says, Romans 16, or when I find a Euodia in Philippians chapter 4, or Cintiq, or Priscilla, they work side by side with me in the spreading of the gospel, Philippians 4, 2, 3. You follow that? When I find them side by side with me, equal in ministry, they teach, they lead, they manage, they rule. But when I find a bunch of carnal, whining, manipulative, power-grabbing men or women, he already told them the men to be quiet earlier in 1 Corinthians 14. What I'm going to tell them is shut up, sit down, go home, grow up, because the way you talk is indecent, improper, and disruptive. Interesting. In Corinth and Ephesus, and Ephesus is the church that 1 Timothy is about. Timothy and Ephesus. And those two churches were carnal, shallow women who are coming right out of a pagan culture. They're told to be quiet, and there's no authority given yet. There's three Macedonian letters, 1 and 2 Thessalonians and Philippians, where women were ministering. You find no restriction. No restriction there. Why? Because maybe the real issue isn't silence or no silence. Maybe the issue is carnality, independence, authority, and godliness. With that, let's go to the third principle. Grammar, because I still have a question, one more lingering question around this 1 Corinthians 14. It's amazing how long you've got to stay in one verse. Grammar syntax. I need to do that work because it says, at the end of verse 13, But the subject themselves, just as the law also says. Now I'm stuck. Aren't you stuck? Just as the law also says. That does not sound like a regulation. That sounds like a timeless truth, doesn't it? That the law says it. That's a timeless truth. Okay? Let's look a little more closely. What does the answer to this question? What is it that the law also says? Does it say women keep silent in church? Well, I mean, you've got to trust me, sir. there's nowhere in the law that that is said. Other places, that they're not permitted to speak, it doesn't state that either. Subject themselves, that's in the text, look at the text, but let them subject themselves, just as the law also says. But it does say that. But note, the subjection that's called for here is not just to the husband or to the church. Just like the tongues talkers, and just like the prophecy givers, The women in general and men in general, Ephesians 5.21, here is the word of the Lord to you. Be subject one to another in fear of Christ. Now, we struggle with this whole authoritarian power submission thing. And are kind of just, have been raised on and weaned, not quite yet weaned on this whole hierarchical thing. And struggle with this whole thing, don't feel like the Lord Richard. Remember at the beginning of this one, I did Acts chapter 2, and we looked at the spirit falling in all men. We talked about the fact that Peter had a hard time accepting the Gentile thing. If you struggle with this whole thing, so did the disciples. Just like us, the disciples grew up in a culture that was clearly hierarchical. What I mean by that is this, that the leaders were not only men, but leaders were the biggest, the strongest, and the toughest, and the loudest. The goal, therefore, in the culture, just take it away from the men-women thing, the goal in the culture, man or woman, was to be the biggest, the strongest, the toughest, and the loudest. And the proof that you were the biggest, strongest, toughest, and loudest was that you could sit like a king and have people wait on you. And maybe get a wife before you. Every time they do it, they would say you were indeed the king. And that's what leadership looks like. And it's in that way of thinking, it's that entire paradigm of life. Jesus said to Moses, I saw our things. He's grown up in Sunday school, so we don't even hear the confrontation anymore, but it is a confrontation on our culture as well. He comes and he sits and he says, you know what, disciples, Luke 42, you are called to leave. I didn't know you guys were dying to leave. You know, you want to know who's the first and who's the greatest. You are called to leave. In the home and in the church and in the world, here's how not to do it. Like the Gentiles who lord it over and exercise the fear. The people who would lead must first be a servant, and that's above submission. Knowing they didn't get it, Jesus asked this question. Who do you guys think is greater? The guy who reclined at the table? Meaning the guy who gets served or the guy who's served? Well, that's easy. The guy who's greater is the guy who gets served. The guy who's greater is the guy who gets other people to weigh none. And then Jesus said, fine, answer it. He doesn't evaluate. The disciples don't answer it that way. In fact, I'm adding, you know, my answer. Jesus doesn't wait for him to answer. He just says this. However it is you want to answer it, just know this. I am among you as the king of kings. I know the Lord. I've got to be in this. And I am among you as the king of kings. Thank you. Pull it all together. We're ready now to move to the next text. But before we do it, I would say this. Men, the essence of the criteria of leadership is not that you're big, bad, tough, and mad. The essence of the criteria of leadership in the kingdom is humble submission to the sins. Humble submission to the sins. To guide the people. Subject yourself, one to another. Get on your hands and be a whole. That's how you do it. That's how you do it. Women that are carried out in leadership is not improving how independent you are. I can too. You can't stop me. Shut up. Go home. Go home. It's not, it's not, it's the same for you as it is for men. You're getting ready to be done with you. It's the same for you as it is for men. So no one's an outing fear of Christ. Wrap it up. The glory of the new covenant is a basis to service leadership in the story. not race, age, financial status, gender. The basis is men and women in whom we discern the control of the Spirit, in whom we see submission to God in men, gifts of the Spirit, knowledge of the Word, in a word, in whom we see spirituality and life of God. All that boils down to this. Men, just because you're a man doesn't mean you can leave. Women, just because you're a woman doesn't mean you can't. Now we go off to New York and talk. It's not everybody. It's a leader. Men only. Women, just because of women, doesn't mean you can. Men, just because of men, doesn't mean you can. And we're going to look for different things in general. Okay. Let's move on to the even more delightful passage, 1 Timothy 2. This is a fun one. 1 Timothy 2, 9-15. Let's just read it and get upset and then start doing our work. Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, Now with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments, rather by means of good works as befits women making a claim to godliness. Let a woman quietly receive instruction with a tire of submission. But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet. Here's the rationale. After all, it was Adam who was created first. This is the same guy who, a member of 1 Corinthians 11, is going, Don't get excited, guys, if you were, you know, a woman came out of here. Now, he's arguing for that. For it was Adam who was created first, then Eve. It was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was quite deceived, someone's betrayed aggression. Huh? Okay? But women shall be preserved through the burying of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity of such a strange thing. Okay, it's obvious at first glance that there are some serious issues, some puzzling questions. This is a passage that even people who teach the hierarchical approach, you know, men and women and men and women like that, even they sometimes are embarrassed by this. They don't know. I mean, if you want to really take it literally, if you want to, oh, then we'll be the literalist. Well, then take it literally. And there are some parts of this that I've never heard anyone on either side, there are issues in here that I've never heard anyone reconcile completely to the study of the text. to raise up some of the questions. One of the first things that strikes me about this passage is that it feels like it brings up issues that are bigger than women in ministry. I don't know if you picked that up, but it feels like this is bringing up things about women in general, not just women in ministry. Verse 15, you are preserved through the bearing of children if you continue in faith. It's not enough to continue in faith. What preserves you is childbearing. What does that mean? Preserved. You are preserved. Well, one rendering of that word is saved. I don't think that could mean salvific, salvation, but that is one rendering of that word. You are saved to be bearing, you are in some sense saved to be bearing children. Is that true? Is that true? Well, the Bible says, in what sense is it true? If it is true, how many children is enough to be preserved? Right? I mean, I've got to ask that question. you're preserved through the bearing of children. Plural, plural. How many is going to preserve you? And how many, I mean, could you actually, you know, have so many children that you go back beyond being preserved to actually being pickled? Could you get that far? If it's true that women are in some sense, we don't even know for sure what preserved means, but they are in some sense preserved by the bearing of children, why doesn't it say a single woman? Have any single women here? I don't know. Does it first bother you at all? Or maybe it hasn't bothered you. Yes, it has bothered. Maybe not. But the question is, what does it mean to serve you single women? Well, what about the women who died in childbirth? Well, I don't know. Let's just keep working. Let's keep working. By the way, if you're a single woman, and maybe this person never bugged you before, I mean, you never took it to heart. It's not like, you know, I swear you maybe had your devotion since one of those things. If you did, if you did, you might have skipped it. I don't know what that means. I'm going on. Somebody knows. You know, maybe Dave knows what that means. Well, Dave doesn't know. Let's keep working. But if you did let that in your spirit, it's another one of those little messages that say, if you're not married, you don't have kids, you don't have value. Now, maybe you're past that, but I know single women and single men struggle with that a lot. The problem with that, if that's what this means, I mean, we've got another problem with Paul. He's a schizophrenic guy. He's not really, but I mean, he always seems to contradict. Because in 1 Corinthians 7, the same guy who writes this, commends singleness. He says, I prefer you stay single. Because then, at least among other things, you can have your undistracted devotion to God in ministry. Distractions would be your marriage and your kids. Remember when I taught that? I mean, I taught my kids are godly distractions, but they're distractions. And they're distractions I've got to pay attention to. But if you're single, he commends singleness. If you preserve through the bearing of children, what about infertile women? What about women who are fertile, but their husbands aren't? How are you preserved? Meanwhile in the world. Something's up here. Paul really did have problems with him. Yeah, you know, I mean, isn't he even feeling like this is a great book, even first time it's wonderful, but all of a sudden there's, you know, just five persons that are weird, and no big human bridge, go on. Well, maybe, although, maybe there's something else going on in Ephesus that we don't know about. Something in the culture, the history of context, I don't know, the syntax and the shit, some more puzzling. Adam was not deceived beneath, for it was Adam who was, not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was quite deceived, but especially, only one problem I could find was that, and that was the truth. Well, both of them were safe. Both of them fell. Why? He's landing so hard on Eve here. Why then? He's landing hard on Eve here. Why then? Did he, and same guy, in Romans 5, say four by one, what? Man, sitting there, he lands hard on Adam. Why? It's gone. What is it doing? It's going to be a good one. Something else must be going on. People are not confused. The Bible is inconsistent. Romans 5, he says four by one. Man, Senator, is a roaster, putting the spot to the land. Man, there he's putting it on. He, verse 12, again, just pull out and got a sense of cement, throughout the world of women, be silent behind the scenes. Nothing at all wrong with silent behind the scenes. Nothing wrong with it. Men ought to be there, too. But it was a false intention for the women there, throughout the process, to start to get contextual factors, Context reveals, first of all, that this is a personal letter from Paul to Timothy. It may not sound like a big deal, but that's a big deal. Paul wrote to the Corinthians. How many people is he writing to? Hundreds, maybe a thousand people to the Corinthians. When he writes to Timothy, it's a personal letter. I mean, I don't mind. I think this is the inspired word of God. I do not get in trouble with this. I'm not convinced that Paul, when he's writing to Timothy, it's going to be in the Bible. Make it clear. He's writing a letter to Timothy. He's writing a letter to Timothy. You know what? There's some things he's saying in this letter, I believe, that Timothy knows exactly what he's talking about because Paul is obviously responding to another letter. They didn't have phones. Everything is by letter. He's responding to another letter and there's some things that we don't know that Paul is speaking to. We've got to support him. What do we know about Timothy? Don't start speculating. What do we know about Timothy? We do know that. In fact, he was a spiritual leader by his grandmother and his mother. Paul says that he reminds me of that in the first or second time. But those two women were the most significant people in his life, his grandmother and his mother. But in addition to that, let me give you this. Right to me who was. He's a pastor, the church, the church. That's who Timothy is when his letters are written. Paul says, but the church he's trying to pastor around 3,000. The founder of the church he's pastoring in Ephesus was Paul. So he followed Paul. Not a good idea. You can put that in current, current. It would be like somebody right out of seminary following Billy Graham. John, Chuck Swindoll. Good luck. It's a kid. Timothy is young. Paul's style is at the front of direct and powerful. Through his ministry, he kept away. He kept the wolves at bay. In Acts chapter 20, he says, when I depart from Ephesus, he's talking when I depart. He said, the grievous wolves will come in from among you. When Paul was there, the grievous wolves were held at bay. He was a powerful personality. He wasn't working with the Spirit. Timothy now has got the mantle of the authority in this church now. And it's really big for him. Timothy's young. He's inexperienced. It seems that there's part of his personality that is timid. He does not have the presence, the physical presence that Paul did. And also in 1 Timothy, basically what Paul is doing is encouraging him. 1 Timothy 8, chapter 4, verse 12, says this. Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather, speak, comment, love, faith, and fear. Show yourself an example of those who believe. Until I come, give attention to the public reading of Scripture, exhortation and teaching. Do not know but the spiritual gift within you, which is bestowed upon you. It's a prophetic utterance. It's a laying out of hands. As you press, consider you taking pains with these things. That is the study of the Word. You absorb in them so that your progress may be evident to all. Make close attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in these things. For as you do this, you will ensure salvation for both yourself and to those who continue. Over and over again, Paul said, I know you're young, you're inexperienced, and you're in a very confusing ministry context. So what I want you to do is preach the word. Just stick your nose in the word. This is where Paul says, study to show yourself a truth unto God, a woman in the East Coast. You see him rightly dividing the word the truth. That's a first for us. But Paul meant that's a first for Timothy. Timothy, you're in a very confusing church. There's all sorts of ericings. I'm going to get into that in a minute. You do not have the wisdom to untie the knot of all these subtle new age things going on. Forget about the new age. Preach the word. Okay? Like Dave, until you really get it, don't be trying to assault the new age and tell us all it's wrong. Maybe you'll do that someday. When you're young, you don't know it. Just preach the word. Just give it to the word. That is the text. Just give it to the price. Key issues in the face of church was three things. The first problem that Timothy faced after Paul left was some false teaching. Chapter 1, verse 3, reveals this. As I urge to, this is Paul speaking to Timothy, upon my departure from Maspione, to remain on Ephesus in order that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines. Why we say that is that people were teaching strange doctrines, nor to pay attention to myths and endless technologies, which give rise to mere speculations, rather than furthering the administration of God, which is by faith. All of that was going on real strong in Ephesus. Genealogies, myths, strange Godfrey, but the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart, and the conscience, the essence, the faith. Timothy warns him, some men striving from these things to turn aside the fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters of how they stand in confidence or decisions. Timothy prays the word, and in fact, later, It's my favorite thing about sticking your notes in the Word. It talks about realizing that in the last days, difficult times will come. Men will be good, lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful arrogance. Avoid such men as this. Evil men and apostles are going to grow from bad to worse. By the way, Timothy, it's really bad for you now. Here, I want you to recognize that it's going to get worse. Evil men and apostles will grow from bad to worse. And you, however, continue to think and confirm to come to this of the Lord, to only learn them, which will be your grandmother and your mother, and from Paul, this child, and you have known the sacred righteousness, which are able to give you wisdom, and you have to be used to salvation. So faith, which is in Christ Jesus, all scriptures and spirit of God, as I call to Jesus, and you will be blessed to teach the Word. Why? Because it was incredibly subtle and hard to figure out heresies heresies that were going on in Ephesus. While everybody in Ephesus was not buying the whole bag, it's called synchronicism. It was happening. It was finally a little bit more. It's feminist. The synchronicism is when pagan culture and Christianity blend, and then they just kind of become the same thing. An example of that, again, we were going through First Corinthians or something, but in Corinth, in Corinth, These people coming out of the mystery religions, they had a paradigm that said ecstasy equals spirituality. And so that just kind of got blended with Christianity. And then in a change, when they became Christians, they kind of had to sit with God. Anything that's ecstatic and not a control must be God. And that's why when the gifts of the Spirit really did happen, and some of the gifts of the Spirit manifested in ecstatic ways, that's fine. But the Corinthians didn't have a paradigm where they understood they needed to discern not everything that's ecstatic is God. Let's give you an example of some of these. Another problem in the Ephesian church that Timothy was facing was an airing of private speech and public meetings. That's why in chapter 2 verse 8 he says, I want men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without wrath or dissension. A third problem was apparently inappropriate behavior among some of the women. Apparently in the streets, inappropriate dress, starting off with that. Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing. Which means, from other things, that there had been some improper form. And as you think, this defines for them in the context of their culture, what appropriate would we all get into that? Indeed, I think they've been advised. That's one thing we know. I told you a little bit about Timothy, a little bit about what he was facing. Now let me give you a little, not so much about Timothy or the church, a little bit more of the culture. This is not a history piece. Ephesus was the center of a number of pagan cults of the religious ancestors of that. You've probably heard me mention this when we went through Acts, and Paul first came to Ephesus, and they had this incredible revival there. The most notable of the pagan cults in Ephesus was the worship of Diana and Artemis. A significant aspect of the worship of Diana and Artemis was the involvement of the priestess and the cross. It's limited number to end of thousands. I saw before Christianity, I mean, I saw before Christianity, there were numbers of thousands. The interesting things about them was that they were often more educated than common Greek women. They were more cosmopolitan, they were more worldly. Another thing in the culture was that they had marriages. And marriages in that culture, in this culture, were matters of community. They were arranged. The result was this. And this looks like, this might sound bizarre to us, but it was common for Greek men to use their wives for losing heirs, for keeping meals, for maintaining the house. Now, there are some Americans that are like that now, and nobody says that love. In that culture, that was just the, of course, this is why you're here. You make babies, you cook the meal, you maintain the house. And Greek men, in the Christian culture, this is before they became redeemed, one elsewhere for friendship, for companionship, and for what I would call fun sex. You wouldn't do that with your wife or your husband. You'd go somewhere else for that. At home, you just make babies to put them in the house. It was common and accepted in the history of life. Add to that dynamic in the culture of religious elements, and the religious element I've already touched on in the pagan religion, was that the highest expressive spirituality was sexist. They believed that the universe in this mystery religion was filled with gods and goddesses, spirits, and what our job, the job of the devil attained, was to somehow connect with one of those gods and goddesses. And the way you would attain that would be through drunkenness and sex. The role of prostituting in the temple was to facilitate that exorcism. Welcome to Ephesus. The Gospel. Thousands of saints rocks the city. Acts 19, verse 17. This became known to all both Jews and Greeks, and Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all. In the name of the Lord Jesus, the King of Magi. Many also of those who were able to keep coming and confessing, and the most of the practices. Look at that again. Some of what I just mentioned. And many of those who practiced magic, rather, of books that began burning at the sight of all, They counted up the price of a piece of a thousand pieces of silver. So the word of the Lord was going mighty and unveiled. And I'm not going to read the whole thing. You might remember that a riot broke out in Ephesus because people were in such great numbers changing their lifestyle that it blew up the economy. Temple priests and prostitutes were getting redeemed. People who went to the temple were getting redeemed. People quit buying the paraphernalia of the temple. I mean, the whole economy of Ephesus is built on this pagan worship, and people in thousands of numbers will be coming in the day, and they're all coming into the church. Now, if we had that kind of revival, thousands of people came to open the door next week, as well, like I say, we would be absolutely delirious. Pentecost has come. Isn't this wonderful for a day we'd enjoy? Right? This is a mess. What are you doing? 5,000, 10,000, I don't know how many people they had. None of them know a thing about the life of God, the walk with God, holiness, purity. They are bringing all sorts of things. You know, pastors that are not. You know? Among those big saints, I mean, those with us, our leaders, for example, priests, prostitutes, and false leaders. It's a wonderful, horrible, delightful, terrible thing. The Paul's leadership takes me solid. The Paul's leadership, lifestyles, and change. Thanks for helping check. My dad has this rather true way of talking. Especially when he's thinking about legalism. The neighbor will never do it. He said legalism is like a cockerel. It never dies. You've got to keep spraying. You always got to be doing grace. Even if you don't see the cockerel. Well, the cockerel just weren't visible when Paul was there. But they were there. Paul left it in the middle. This is our analogy. And on Timothy, he just, can you picture the guy? Oh, a guy, a lot of guys. He's probably gifted for ministry. Probably will do it. All that will be loved. A little side note about syncretism, I promise I'd say. Syncretism, historically, this phenomenon is one of the greatest enemies to do with the doctrine. Syncretism is a blending of Christian doctrine and coaching. It's a thinking core system. One of the places that happens most rapidly, it's a little propaganda. That's what it is. This is South America where you hear these words made from two million dollars. We do it, and it's just an end. How do you? Well, that's what it is. And it just kind of gives you something, you know, there's something that's contemporary. I don't have to go all the way down to the Bible. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. So Cephas, who was a Jewish historian, said this. The climate of exile in Alexandria complained in his memoirs that Christian groups had turned their communion into drunken orcs..... Well, you've got to be tested to find it out. It's not that hard to find it out. One of the things that's not in the text, is to ask them before, this is a personal letter. I'm calling you to call the end of the text. You have a system that you know. This has to do it. I'm going to read that. Because Timothy is a personal letter, some of the issues that work are not spelled out in the text. The reason is that they have common knowledge of what we should have in the United States. The most likely case is that Paul is responding point by point to specific issues that typically perform the norm to create this false promise. This, again, will strict with history and concepts, so rightly, and by this, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then. Okay, next point. Is this a timeless truth? We can't remember anything. I don't allow women to do exercise authority. It's a true sense of the language. Well, if Paul's prohibition here to teach an exercise authority is timeless, Before I even get into the text, I mean, you can tell we have a problem with some other stuff we already talked about last week. We have a problem with women in ministry. We have a problem with Paul that we discovered last week. We almost said, Phoebe, taking, exercising gifts of blue and amazing. Acts 18, Priscilla, who taught and taught us the way of God more accurately, we got promised that, but this is a timeless truth in you. Because obviously Priscilla, in a teaching context, would have been exercising a story over a problem. And that's what we're talking about. Well, let's get to the grammar and syntax to try to answer that. But I do not allow a woman to teach exercise to it. But I do not allow. I gave this to you last week. That is in the present active indigestion. That is in present active indigestion. I write that down. Present active indigestion. Which means literally this. I am not now pressively permitting a woman to speak. That's the pressively. I'm not now pressively. I don't get time to speak. It sounds like it might not be time to speak. Another thing that was interesting, and this was something that Dr. Birkin Michelson, I got this from Dr. Birkin, Birkin Michelson. He made a big thing. I wouldn't build everything on this, but it's something to fill in the pot. He built a big thing about the narcissist now, And that is the noun in the Greek without the definite article in front of it. And the absence of the article, according to Berkeley, the absence of the article is deep, meaning I do not allow three women to teach with which I would have been rendered if it would have been a definite article there. Indicates that he's not speaking of all women in general. It does not say I do not allow three women to teach this class. Berkeley's point of policy. Here according to Berkeley, some women with character traits that must be changed. The absence of the article with women, woman, shows that quality of kinds of women are defined by the context. There's only a certain kind of woman, there's only negative in their supply. Okay, thank you. I wouldn't rest anything on that, but it's interesting to have that in the plot. More compelling to me around social media is to rebuild authentic, but not allow them to exercise authority. What was interesting about this, and I got pretty excited about this, and spent a lot of time reading this, was that the first thing I discovered was authentic. It's a rare Greek word. The only place I want to do this is found is right here. One of the things you do when you go into Kettle and you look up these Greek words is they show you a number of different ways that this word is used. For instance, y'all have a section where authentic is used. We'll read the Testament usage, and they'll see all the places you use on how. Old Testament usage, the Septuagint, which is the Greek Old Testament. And then they'll go into this thing called classical Greek, which is kind of the way this word might have been used on the street, not necessarily how people use this word. And this word was nowhere else in Scripture but here. And even in classical Greek, it was hard to find. The only usages of it, the only resources of it is worth the classical reading. The most basic meaning of authenticity is to trust oneself. That's interesting. To trust oneself. I do not allow them to trust themselves over men. I remember having a question, you wouldn't allow men to do that either. I think it would be a good thing. Just like early. In his commentary, I was trying to translate it authentic, not as an exercise authority, but exercise with sexual license, sexual manipulation. To trust oneself, solicitation for sexual involvement. What a curse, what a curse. That would be the most good. I'm not saying all this. Are there any lights going on for you? Any lights going on for you? As it relates to what we know about the culture, the emphasis, the temple priest, the presence, the thousands of young people. in a function in the temple. Add to that word authentic what we know historically and culturally about Ephesus. It's a center for pagan cultures and moral practices. Syncretism is clearly at work and manifest in the self-fulfilling. Paul has already admonished the immodestly dressed women literally wearing the garb of temple prostitutes. Graded hair means nothing to you. I would never tell a woman, don't break your hair. In that culture, that was the sign that was going to cross them. That was the sign. Now he proved to him it prohibits them from teaching and using sexual manipulation to gain influence in the church as was the common practice in the temple. To stand there and quietly receive correct doctrine and change the life of God. I think that's what he did. I really did. That was just a thought. It was just a great social expression. I think that one was. That one may come pretty good. Verse 13 and 14 compares two fields of creation and order of things. And nature is to explain why women can't teach. And thus, why the rest of the destruction of all the means for history. In addition to the various cults of this guy in Christian groups, I've already discussed a powerful movement called Gnosticism. It was strong in Ephrathicism. Gnosticism, and now if you've heard of Gnosticism, you probably have. Gnosticism is one of the same when I was in seminary. I heard about it all the time. And I got to ask you. So I went back in my notes and I found out a lot of things about Gnosticism. And among the things I discovered was this about Gnosticism, that among their heresies was that teaching their purpose that women could possess superior intellectual and superior knowledge in fact were created before men. Now some of you don't have much problem with that at all. I mean, especially possessing superior intellectual and spiritual knowledge. But there was this weird thing in Gnosticism, they don't know anything about first image. If you went and studied narcissism, and you studied it long enough, you find this in one of your deals, that women were created first. They would have a legend about creation, and it would have been women being created first. And they were superior to men as a whole kind of flip-flip. And I could pull us further, that on top of being created first, they had special knowledge that Adam did not have. These heresies were rampant in the early church day, especially in cult-centered Ephesus. An understanding, I believe, and an awareness of these errors is exactly a word. Help us unlock, possibly unlock, the mystery of these verses like this. The mystery of verses like this that otherwise seem to try to dictate to other scriptures or non-sensuals. My paraphrase, this will send you a message. Now listen, you may not be able to, or you're not going to be able to do that to social media. If you want to get the board, you may be able to take that message. But just listen to the paraphrase. Women, you will not be allowed to sexually manipulate men to be empowered for the church the way you use it to do it in the painting. In fact, I do not allow you to teach at all. Instead, you need to sit quietly and receive instruction with the entire submission. While we're at it, why don't you wear some peace and clothes? You look like this. This is my first question. Don't try to blend pagan teaching and tradition with Christian doctrine. Eve wasn't created first, and it was. He didn't have any special knowledge in Adam. In fact, she was the one who was the first to see it not Adam. If she has such special insight, why would she have to speak it all? The whole history around that is to never still have any sense of that. If that's not what it means, you've got a whole, you have a whole other room of problems. So, if you're a specific person, you're going to have a lot of teaching things. And that's exactly what it means. First 15 still hangs on a second. The first of the community is a very significant issue. Keeping with the context, Paul may be indicated to these women that even if they have been, even if they have given birth to ill-tinent children by their participation in cultural activities, which they undoubtedly have, as a community of institutions, but they are still preserved through them. That was one thing that they had to do with the most about our students. You can get that you are preserved through the childbearing. It's not even a positive thing. You're saying that you're priests and prostitutes and tell those women that they're preserved. You're saved in the same way. In spite of that, if they continue to stay together, that kind of holds together. I don't know if it's a shame that holds together. That's not acceptable. So let's see if the idea that women are saved and bearing children, I don't think anybody can lose that. Since we've got 2,000 super fans, we've never had children. Brooklyn Michelson says this about it. It seems to point the women's role of further to bring people into the world and thus preserving not only the marriage, but the Godly prosperity. The problem for me about any of these is that there's nothing to land that I can land on and go, yeah, yeah. I mean, I just don't feel high-five about it. But I've never heard anybody do dust. Pick a side. I've never heard anybody say that. That holds it together, not just the first of all, the scriptures. In closing, the whole thing. It's our opinion, and I'm now speaking not just for myself, but I am speaking for myself, for all the elders who are just now, that this passage is not a timeless truth, forever prohibiting women from positions of authority. There are, however, timeless truths in this text, just like in 1 Corinthians 14 and 11. There are timeless truths in this text that must be consistent. Why? Like, don't let people without understanding teach. Men are women. People without understanding are not allowed to teach. They should receive instruction in awesomeness in this before they are released to give any instruction. This applies to men and women. Women and men. That's a timeless truth. Okay? That's cross-league. Morality and purity in living is also a timeless truth. That's called forefair. Another timeless truth is that you confront false teaching online. You don't try to coexist with it. Forbidding women to teach is, in our opinion, no more a timeless truth than prohibiting them from braiding their hair or wearing golden clothes. Lots of women braiding their hair, and lots of women wear jewelry without looking like prostitutes. The issue in Ephesus was that they were dressing on purpose to entice and thereby being the other thing. And see, by the way, that would be a clear point. If someone came off the street into our church, off the street, I wouldn't even do this. If they came here with the intention of enticing, we might decide that. Get it? I don't want those people to entice. Okay. To make this prohibition a timeless truth, in our opinion, would contradict Pentecost, it's not just Jews, it's Gentiles, it's not just old, it's not just sons and daughters. It would contradict, we believe, teaching and actions of Paul himself when he dealt with a poor godly woman like Kasella, Steve, Lydia, and others. The glory of the church, the glory of the new covenant, This debate, service, leadership, authority is no longer race, age, money, or gender. This authority, the control of the Spirit, the submission of God in men, the test of spirit, evidence of people, knowledge of the Word of God, it all boils down to this. Men, just because you're a man, those people can lead. And women, just because you're a woman, they're really weak. We're looking for other things. Spirit of me. Yes, it's spirit. Mentority, depth, innocent ability. Bring down this nuts and bolts. Presses me. Okay, baby. In church, you have to do that. Can a woman be a teacher? Yes. Can a woman teach men? Yes. Can a woman be a teacher? A man be a teacher? Can a woman be an elder? Yes. Can a woman preach? Yes. And a woman be a missionary. Of course. And a woman be the senior passenger to the open door. No. I'm the passenger. So don't get any ideas. Back off. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Sure. Ha. How close is this? The very first time we did this, we have a few minutes here, and I'm going to take some time to do it now. Time you're here. The very first time we did this, we had all been on our elder board, and there was a very, very strong sense of unanimity about this teaching. And I remember I gave it, it was a Sunday night, we did a seminar at Cooper High School, and I gave it on a Sunday night. And then during the week, anticipating the next Sunday night when I would do this teaching, I remember the elders coming together and praying over what we did and wondering how we should do the next week. And I felt like God gave some words on that particular weekend, and it turned out to be one of those incredible things. And on one hand, I'm doing a teaching, and I'm doing it here today. I believe in it, but I don't know how it's landing on you. Men are women. I don't know what it's doing to you. And one of the elders said, you know what? What do we feel like? We need to pray over the women in the church. Because most of the women, well, all the women in our church are told, we are deciding to do this. Is the church that say women? The answer is yes, no. They've been living under a no. And it's taken no one. And the way we wanted to do that was we wanted to praise the women. So what we wanted was when we did that thing. And I can't recreate this. But we asked all the women to come forward. We wanted to know. We wanted to know. We wanted to know. We wanted to know. And then we had all the elders come up. And then I said, all the men who agree with us that we want to come off the room, we want to bless our women, whatever God is wrong with us, we will be in the church because we need all of you. I want the men to surround us with us to pray. I believe you, you know what? And I thought it was the right thing to do. I was excited about doing it. And this is the most amazing thing to do with you. We're here today. At this point, we had some hard feelings about the spirit. It was a great thing. I think we had a great time. I think we had a great time. I think we were very good. It was pretty amazing. But it was amazing. We heard a story about the spirit of God. The way the spirit of Christ is, it was in my eyes, it was a great time. Thank you. January, January, January. Anybody, elders, but also men, men who in your heart say, I want to be part of taking this off, blessing, I want you to receive. I want you to do one thing that makes me come around, and I ask Tom to pray, and I'll pray. He doesn't have to take it on, but I think it's important. Another reason I'm doing it, one reason I'm doing it is because I think it's really important. Another reason is, And one of you, maybe that's a certain number of you. Check at the bottom of your screen. I think I might like to see that. I'm going to be in the middle. If you do, that's what you're going to do. Lord, I do thank you for your work and for working this and stuff. I thank you for the fact that you did not make any mistakes. You did not make any mistakes when you made the women and the women. that you did not make any mistakes when you gave a significant number of women in your church leadership gifts. When you gave them leadership gifts, they made a question that not, you didn't make mistakes in the church. I pray in every way, not just women, men too, that men and women redeemed by the blood, full of the Spirit, would be rising up more and more in our church and in this city and in this nation, full of your Spirit, equipped by your Spirit, to serve you with the fullness of beauty, The fullness of them is one. I pray these things. Thank you.
