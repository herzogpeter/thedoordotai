One day, Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer at 3 in the afternoon. Now, a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, Look at us. So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said, silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk. Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping and praising God. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. So God, please come and meet us here. We need you. Amen. So the phrase that has been sticking in my mind for about three weeks now as we've walked our way through these eight verses together at length is when Peter says, silver and gold I do not have. but what I do have, I'll give you. What does it mean to know what you have and to know what you don't have? What does it mean to look at someone who is in pretty desperate need and to confidently say, I have what you need. And what does it mean to really know what it is that they do not need? I think this question of what is it that you have to offer is a pretty interesting one. And so I want to camp on it for a second. Let me ask you as if we were at Caribou or Starbucks or Dunn Brothers and we were just having some coffee and you were asking me this and I was asking you this. what do you have to offer? Like not me right now, like not what do you have to offer me, but just in general, what do you have to offer? From time to time, and it happened just yesterday, I got an email from a younger pastor, and it's not like I get a lot of these things, but from time to time I get a request, hey Steve, could I buy you some coffee and pick your brain, right? It's happened yesterday. and I love doing this actually. It's really fun for me to meet with young men and women, younger men and women who are maybe just starting out as a pastor and for me to just talk to them and listen to them and ask questions and they ask me questions and it's fun because I feel like I have some things to offer them. I have some years in ministry and I have been around the block a couple of times, not as many times as some people and not as few times as others but when you think about it that way, they're getting together with me because they think I have something to offer them. And all of us have things to offer. If you think about it like a piggy bank that is located somewhere inside of you, you have things to offer people. And it might be things like this, like your wisdom. No matter how old you are, you have wisdom. Your experience. Maybe your charm is what you have to offer. Some of you on StrengthsFinders have woo. Do you know that's a strength? And we love these people with woo, right? And we love to be around them. We love to, Al Shuck has woo. Joel Hansen has woo. Some of us have our money to offer, and we offer that. Some of us, it's our ideas or our energy or our influence or our power. And the thing is, we all have these things in our piggy banks, and we all need to offer these things when they're asked, right? I mean, these are good things to offer each other. these are good things that we need to say hey if there's a way in which you can learn from my wisdom or my money or whatever if you need that and i can give it i want to give it to you but what i know about that piggy bank for me is that there's a point at which those things all run out my wisdom runs out my money runs out my experience runs out my charm for sure runs out and so does yours. Your energy runs out, your time runs out. All of those things run out. And so we can ask the question, what is it that you have to offer? But an even deeper question is what about when what you have to offer isn't enough? What about when the need that you're staring at across the table or down on the ground in front of a gate called beautiful? What about when you know you could break that piggy bank open, you could spread out all the resources you have and they're good resources, but what about when you know that they will not cut it? Like, what do you do? honestly, what I do is I try to find some more of those resources. There's got to be some more, some more. I mean, there's got to be more energy. I've got to be able to really tap into some energy. Maybe there's wisdom that I don't even know I have, that if I just think about it a little longer, I will get more of it. Maybe there's more money. Maybe if I just did one extra speaking engagement, I could get some more money. And when you get exhausted from doing that, you're still faced with the same question. so I want to tell you this story that Peggy just read from the perspective of the lame guy and I hate that we don't know his name I kind of want to call him Larry but I feel like that might be inconsiderate to some of you whose name is Larry so I've changed some of the words please accept my apologies if this offends anyone but I'm just going to read Acts 3 1-8 from the perspective of this guy. One day, I was being carried up to the temple gate at the time of prayer. It was a little before three in the afternoon, actually, so people would see me as they were going in and maybe give me some money. It's what I did every day. And I ask everyone for money. sometimes I get a little sometimes I don't get much and that's the way every day goes but on this day something different happened I asked two guys for money like I always do and both of them stopped and they actually looked at me and the loud one said hey look at us I was shocked no one looks at me so I gave them my attention hoping for something a little extra because I was hungry question have you ever been there how often do you let yourself go there where you're really dependent on someone else because what you have to offer has run out or because no one seems to think you have anything to offer. Because what did this lame guy have to offer? Now, of course, we're friendly, kind church people. We're Christians, and we could probably come up with a lot of things this guy had to offer. but the truth is we don't really think guys like him have very much to offer us. How often do you let yourself get that needy? How often do you get in touch with yourself in a way that maybe you look fine and you're walking around just fine but if people could really see the state of your woundedness you would be sitting down beside a gate asking for something that you desperately need because really, you're starving. How often do you let yourself go there? I hate letting myself go there. And I almost never do. I break that piggy bank open and I spread out those resources and I scrimp and save so that those resources help me to make it through whatever it is that I need to get through. And many of you do the same thing. Many of us just hate the idea of being carried somewhere and laid down so that we can ask for what we need. But this guy, let's continue on in the story, continues his story. The loud one, that's Peter, for those of you who maybe haven't made that connection. The loud one said, silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have, I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk. And taking me by the right hand, he helped me up. And I felt something I'd never felt in my whole life. My legs. Unbelievable. So then things got really crazy. I don't actually remember much of it. I jumped to my feet, I guess, and began to walk. Then I went with them into a place I'd never been allowed to go before, into the temple courts. And you guys, I was walking. I was jumping and I was praising God completely undignified because I finally had something. And it was the greatest gift I ever got in my whole life and it wasn't walking. That was a great gift, learning how to walk. I mean, oh my goodness, that was a great gift. It was a miracle. The gift was, I got the same thing that Peter had. Now Peter, I think, had some stuff to offer, didn't he? Here's a young guy, obviously gifted in leadership, kind of raw, for sure. But he just gave a sermon earlier on in Acts where 3,000 people were saved and responded to his message that Jesus is the one that saves them. I mean, Peter had some stuff to offer, but Peter, I think, was in touch with his own version of himself sitting by the gate. He was really aware that not too many days before this day, he was out in a courtyard denying his best friend. I mean, he denied Jesus and left. At another time, Jesus actually called him Satan. Remember that one? Get behind me, Satan, which would not be a great resume builder. I think Peter was really in touch with the fact that though he had some things in his piggy bank, What he really had to offer was the power of the risen Christ. What does it mean to really know that no matter what happens in your life, the power of the risen Christ is what you have to offer? It makes the piggy bank look a little silly, doesn't it? I mean, I'm going to give my piggy bank, I'm going to pour that thing out. I'm going to use those resources. I'm going to give those resources away. But I think the kind of person that really is in touch with the power of the risen Christ is the kind of person that's also really in touch with their own woundedness. that I can only carry the power of the risen Christ to the extent that I realize that my piggy bank is limited. And I am the one that needs Jesus first every single day of the seven-day week. Amen? So question, I'm gonna keep bringing these questions to you every time you see a black screen with white words, hopefully the heart rate doesn't go up too high. Where do you bring your neediness? When you're feeling needy, where do you bring that? Suppose that in this beautiful story, we switched it and we kind of made it so that you were both Peter and the guy sitting down by the gate. And suppose you had the gift of walking up and seeing yourself as needy as you actually are. You tracking with me? Suppose you could actually see it. What Peter did was reach down, heal this guy, and bring him right into the temple. That's what Peter did with this wounded guy. In the scenario where you see yourself as wounded as you actually are, sitting by the gate that is called beautiful, that's a little gift for each of you to take away. A little hint, a little wink, a little nod about what God thinks about your wounded self. Now that's another four sermons. But what do you do with that person, yourself? I'm going to suggest to you that most of us ignore that person that is ourselves, that is needy and wounded. Most of us don't even make eye contact. Most of us go right into the temple. Maybe we flick a little something in his direction so that he'll shut up. What would it look like for you and me to just get right down, eyeball to eyeball with our own neediness, And say, I'm not going to ignore you anymore. I'm going to bring you to Jesus. I mean, that would be phenomenal, wouldn't it? It's right in the text, Acts 3, verse 8. This guy jumped up to his feet and began to walk. And then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping and praising God. And that's amazing for a number of reasons. For one reason, it means that those who are outcasts really belong in. That's an amazing thing. But if you look at it in terms of what if it's your own wounded self, then the self that has something to offer picks up the self that has nothing to offer. Again, this is my same self. And now as one integrated whole, we walk into God's presence. I'm going to argue that that's the kind of person that gets in touch with the risen Christ within them. Amen? That's the kind of person that knows I'm not just a victim. I'm not going to stay sitting by the side of the road with nothing to offer. I have something to offer, but what I have to offer most to the world is fueled by my knowledge of my own emptiness. And to the degree that I ignore that guy that is myself sitting on the side of the gate, I will not walk in the kind of power that Dave has been talking about over the last three weeks because I will act as if I will wholly trust on my piggy bank. I will not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly trust in Jesus' name comes to the kind of people who say I'm not going to ignore my emptiness and brokenness and neediness. I'm gonna pick that guy up, that girl up, and bring that to Jesus. Henry Nouwen in his book, The Wounded Healer, says this, the paradox of Christian leadership is that the way out is the way in. That only by entering into communion with human suffering can relief be found. And the only way that you'll ever enter into communion with someone else who is suffering is to get honest about your own suffering. That's the only way. That is the only way. As you're walking by yourself, sitting down there by the gate, that is called beautiful. You got to pick that person up, integrate it into yourself, and that's where you walk, into the temple courts, and that's how you will have influence over this world. So what does it mean to be a wounded healer? What does it mean? Well, our example comes right from Isaiah 53. I'm going to read three verses to you from the message. This is talking about Jesus, but it's hidden and veiled because it's written to the children of Israel about someone that is to come. The servant, read Jesus, grew up before God, and then this is how Isaiah describes Jesus. It's pretty awesome, pretty amazing. a scrawny seedling, a scrubby plant in a parched field. So it's not even a scrubby plant in a fertile field. It's a scrubby plant in a parched field. There was nothing attractive about Jesus, nothing to cause us to take a second look, which I think is a confrontation to what we think about when we think about Jesus. The truth is that was what we saw him as and most people saw him as. He was looked down on and passed over. He was a man who suffered, who knew pain firsthand. One look at him, and people turned away. We looked at him. We looked down on him. We thought he was scum. But the fact is, it was our pains that he carried, our disfigurements, all the things wrong with us. We thought he brought it on himself, but we thought that it was God who was punishing him for his own failures. it was our sins that did that to him. Our sins that ripped and tore and crushed him. Our sins. He took the punishment. And that made us whole. Through his bruises, we get healed. The person that we say we follow is himself a wounded healer. So we who are called the body of Christ in the world are called to be wounded healers. Amen? We are called to be people who are in touch with our own suffering enough so that we can have something to offer someone who is also suffering. And that something we have to offer isn't just, oh, I've been there. It's I'm as broken as you are, and the only thing that helped me was the power of the risen Christ. So I'm banking on the fact that that's the only thing that's going to help you. It'S NOT GOING TO BE HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HOW MUCH I PRAY FOR YOU. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HOW MUCH I MOVE TOWARD YOU OR LISTEN TO YOU. IT'S GOING TO BE THE POWER OF THE RISEN CHRIST WORKING IN YOUR LIFE THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU. AND ALL I CAN GIVE YOU IS A TESTIMONY TO, I ONCE WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE. THAT'S ALL I CAN GIVE YOU. Ruth Haley Barton writes this the possibility that human beings can actually be transformed to such an extent that they image Christ is central to the message of the gospel and the mission of the church the ability that we have to image Christ is absolutely dependent on our ability to see ourselves as the person sitting by the gate called beautiful and also the person that's walking by with something to offer. We image Christ when we say that all we have is Christ. And I'm not talking about some neat kind of sermon that you might give. All I have is Christ. I don't need anything. No, I'm talking about the kind of gentleness and authority that comes from someone that actually lives it out day by day by day in their actual little, not little meaning insignificant, but little meaning your life. So a question. What do you have to offer today, right now? Now, if we broke up in the piggy bank, there'd be lots of stuff. I mean, let's just say that. You have wisdom, you have experience, you have life, you have... You have lots to offer. But I think the heartbeat of the people of this church is that you actually want to offer the power of the risen Christ to those that you meet that have no other hope. Because your ideas and your wisdom and your experience and your money and your idea and all that stuff, that's going to help. but it's not going to give them what they need. So what that brings up in me sometimes when I think about the need that is out there is I do get a little panicked. Because when I'm sitting across a couple that's not doing well, or when I'm sitting across my friend who I met with this last week who's signing up for a life that is going to involve being face-to-face with monumental need every day of his life. This panics me a little bit. What are you going to do in your actual life when you're sitting across the table with that kind of need? What can you bank on? Well, I'm going to read to you these verses that are either total wishful thinking and magical thinking and throw a magic wand on everything and fairy dust and all that stuff. Or else they're our only hope, okay? So I'm banking that this is actually true. Or else my piggy bank's gonna be so shriveled up and empty. I don't know if a piggy bank can actually get shriveled up, but that's what mine would look like. Empty, broken, nothing left. 2 Corinthians 9, verses 8 through 11. This, again, from the message. God can pour on the blessings in astonishing ways so that you are ready for anything and everything, more than just ready to do what needs to be done. Most of us think that's not true, but I'm gonna ask us to push past the fairy dust thinking and say this might actually be true and real, that God might actually be able to pour out the blessings in astonishing ways. As one psalmist puts it, we read, he throws caution to the winds, giving to the needy in what? Reckless abandon. That means in indiscriminate generosity is how God gives. Sure, I'll give you more, more than you need. His right living, right giving will never run out. And that's good news because mine does. And so does yours. This most generous God who gives seed to the farmer that becomes bread for your meals is more than extravagant with you. He gives you something that you can then give away, which grows into full-formed lives, robust in God, wealthy in every way so that you can be generous in every way, producing with us great praise to God, Walking and leaping and praising God will be the result when you encounter people and really all you have to really give them is the power of the risen Christ that is made manifest in your life when you have the courage to see yourself sitting by the gate that is called beautiful in your wounded condition, needing Christ to raise you up. When you're in that place, remember the picture that Dave gave us last week? I love this picture. You're right in the middle of the Trinity. You're right in the middle of the dance of the Father always saying, I love my children so much that I will give of myself. Remember that? The Father saying, I will give continually. And then the son responding to the father's giving saying, father, if you will give, then I will go. I will become one of them. And then the spirit completing this dance saying, if the father will give and the son will go, then I will pour extravagantly, abundantly, so that every single person that calls on my name will have enough to do what I'm calling them to do, to live their life. And that is the picture of what wholeness in Christ looks like. Is anybody hungry for that? Because I am. So let's pray for that right now as I close. close your eyes if you want to you don't have to I remember growing up never wanting to close my eyes in church that was my little act of rebellion so put out your hands if that helps you put out your heart if that's what you can do and see yourself sitting by the gate that is called beautiful allow yourself to see your woundedness your neediness allow yourself to see the piggy bank that's broken and empty man you got so much to give but that's all done that's all gone and now picture Jesus walking up to you and he's got a kind of smile on his face that's like quirky and like he's about to do something that's gonna bring him the most joy that he's ever experienced and he looks down at you and he asks you this question do you wanna be whole? do you wanna be well? Do you want to have something really to offer? And you don't have to have all your theological buttons lined up. All you have to have right now is a big old yes. Yes, Jesus, I want that so bad. And picture Jesus reaching out his right hand, It's powerful right hand in lifting you up. And all of a sudden, through a gift of the Spirit, you have what you need. And together, you and Jesus walk into the temple and out into the rest of your life. You will never walk another day alone. You will have the power and resources and presence of the powerful risen Christ within you so that you can do every single thing that you're asked to do. Thank you, God, for giving. Thank you, Jesus, for going. Thank you, Spirit, for pouring out your presence on us right now. We praise you. We thank you. In your name, amen. you
