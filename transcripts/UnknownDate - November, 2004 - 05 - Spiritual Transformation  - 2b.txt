It is true that you need to be ready, and the preparation for that really does go along with our vision and intention model up here. I hope that's helpful. We'll have some time here. If this doesn't get to what you're concerned about, we'll have time to let you say something. All right. What about our interactions with the world? Can we defend ourselves from people who want to physically harm us? This is a good one. See, this is my example. My cousin was a police officer and shot a criminal in self-defense, but my cousin, who is a Christian, felt guilty for sending that guy to hell. Well, quickly, he didn't send the guy to hell. Going to hell was something else. You know, this business of going to hell is pretty serious and you want to recall, you want to recognize that people don't go to hell by a little slip or an oops. And sometimes the way we talk, especially about the importance of being right, you might think if someone just missed a little turn, it'd be like the driver's license test or something. You know, you missed three and you have to go back. in this case you don't get to go back. When people go to hell, it is the result of their sustained choices. It's the result of their sustained choices. And in a manner of speaking, they would rather be there than the other possibility. Lewis, C.S. Lewis has this phrase where he says, you say to God my will be done long enough and he says okay and that's how you get separated from God you've been wanting to get away from him devoted your life to it okay he says now your will be done and now there's some deeper questions in this that we want to talk about one thing that may be in this question is something like resisting evil turn the other cheek well let me just approach it piece by piece here and hopefully if I don't get it you'll speak to me again about it here one thing to say is don't turn someone else's cheek. If it's your cheek, it's yours to turn. But don't turn someone else's cheek. See, the person who tries to blow this into an issue of pacifism forgets the other neighbors that are in the area that he's supposed to love. I used to have a friend who was very convinced on this issue, and he said that if he saw a man going down the street with a rifle shooting people, he would not do anything to stop him except to kneel and pray. Well, I would pray all right, but I would also do what I could to stop the man because he's not my only neighbor. The people he's shooting are my neighbor too. So I have a responsibility to them. Now that doesn't mean that I should do anything in any way to the person who is perpetrating the evil. It doesn't license me to just do anything. But I must do something out of love. Love for my neighbor and actually love for that man because he's not doing himself a favor by going down the street shooting people. So I need to try to act to stop him. As far as my turning my cheek is concerned, I have to also consider what that's going to mean to other people. And turning the cheek isn't the only thing. Turning the cheek means someone has hurt you. And what Jesus is saying is, don't stop being vulnerable to that person just because he's hurt you. Now, that doesn't mean that you just go on forever. because you as a responsible person, as creative will for good, you want to be responsible for the good that is under the range of your will. Remember, your kingdom is your effective will. And you take that into God's kingdom, and then you're responsible as well as empowered to act. So then now you act, not trusting you, not out of hatred. You don't have to get angry, be contemptuous of the person, try to vilify them or anything, but you may need to stop them. So that's a judgment you have to make. And you make it independence upon God. So my friend says, I could only kneel and pray. I would say I'll pray a lot as I do what I can in appropriate ways to stop that person. Now, this case is one where apparently someone was about to shoot this police officer, and he shot or acted in self-defense and killed the man. And I can understand the concern of the policeman. I mean, it's not a nice thing to kill someone. It's not... Nice isn't the right word. I mean, it's an unhappy kind of situation to be in. But sometimes it is necessary, especially for a police officer. So they need to rethink what it means for them to be a police officer. What are the responsibilities? Now, see, can you take that into the kingdom of God? Can you be a police officer in the kingdom of God? Answer? Yeah. You're going to be a very different kind of police officer. And in general, you're going to be a much better one. but you won't be hung up on the legalism of doing your duty in a situation where it requires force or violence or possibly even killing. Let me try to illustrate how this works otherwise. Often I am talking to people probably like most of you who are in positions of some authority and they have to deal with people who are not performing. So the question is, can you fire someone in love? Can you? Yes, you can. It would be very different from the way it's usually done if you fire someone in love. It would mean, for example, that you don't just write them off and are no longer concerned for them. You're still concerned for them. Maybe there are things that you could do to help them still. If so, then you would be conscious of that. It would require very fine communication between you and that person. So the way the firing was handled would probably be very different. And sometimes we fire people like docking a lamb. You just jerk them up and cut their tails off and they run off into the forest, the pasture. And see, that's not the way to do that. So you have to learn how to treat people in a process like that in such a way that your will for their good is manifest. And that would mean, among other things, that you would be able to explain to them why your will for the good of everyone else involved in that job situation seemed to require that they be somewhere else. Now, normally we don't go into that. and it's a painful situation. We don't know how to be there. But now you notice that's true in all the kinds of things we've talked about, like, for example, blessing those who curse you. When someone comes at you and curses you, it does things to you, doesn't it? Kind of curdles your body, gets your feelings all stirred up and so on. Well, see, you have to not go there. You have to not be in that position. You have to be able to receive what is coming at you in a way that will allow the presence of the kingdom to be your support and your guide and your stay in that situation. So that would mean, for example, if you fire someone and they get angry at you, you don't get angry at them. Am I making any sense? See, now this is something we have to learn. But some of the most brutal firings I've ever seen have been in Christian context. And they were brutal because the people in that context were mortified in a bad sense with it. They did not know what to do with it. And very often they would fire people without ever dealing with them at all because they just didn't want to have to deal with it. So part of firing someone in love is to learn how you would deal with it. and it would mean, among all, that you met with that person. You communicated with them. You allowed them to be angry. And you didn't get angry back. They used to have an anti-acid commercial that would show all these terrible acid things around in your tummy. and then it would show the little medicine things coming down here and gobbling those terrible acid things up. And a Christian is a lot like that. A person who's really a follower of Christ is a lot like that. They absorb stuff without it absorbing them. And they do that because they are, they have these resources that are available to them because they're living in the kingdom of God and they have gone through a process of transformation so that the standard things that might be in the human heart or the soul or the mind or the body and so on, they just aren't there. They just aren't there. The emotions and the thoughts and so on, they just aren't there because they've been through a process of transformation that has changed them. Now, you know, I'm not talking about being perfect. I'm just talking about doing a lot better and how we can do that. Perfection will take care of itself. Don't worry about that one. Eventually, you'll grow better and better, and you may never become perfect in this life. I'm not counting on it. You don't have to be, but why not move in that direction as much as seems possible? Well, this is really a very important question. It has to do also with loving your enemies, things like that. Now, suppose you're a soldier in Iraq, and you have the responsibility of shooting people under certain conditions. Can you do that in love? Just hang on to that now a moment. Can you do that in love? could you do that as a part of your will for the good of the world and the people you're involved in now you know I would be perfectly sympathetic with a person who said I can't do that in love but I would want to say are you sure that that's the limit do you think everyone is like that? Do you think you could never change to the point to where you could take someone's life as an act of faith in God and love for the person concerned? I'm pretty sure that if the other person were the only person concerned, you couldn't do it. But I don't want to rule that out. There's so many ways, there's so many things that need to be thought about before you start ruling that out that I wouldn't want to rule it out. Now many people who have, through the ages, who've been followers of Christ have ruled it out. And I don't mean to criticize them, but just to say that in this area you want to be alive to the possibilities and the necessities that go with being a responsible human being living in this world and living in the kingdom of God simultaneously. And now I'm going to shut up in a minute and give you a chance to criticize that if you want to. I've got one more question here. In Colossians 3.12, we are to clothe ourselves. And the clothe themselves is a nice contemporary version. It actually says, put on bowels. Put on bowels. But, you know, what do you do with bowels? I was going to use that old translation in The Divine Conspiracy. And finally my editor, a lovely woman, came to me and just said, Please. So I put heart in. And here, the phrasing in the version this person reads, to clothe yourself with, and then it goes into mercies, meekness, and humility of mind, and so on. How does this fit in with your understanding of being baptized in the Spirit, being filled with, versus being filled with the Spirit? Actually, when you understand it in terms of put on bowels, this is exactly what's going on when you obey the command to be filled with the Spirit. Because what you're doing there is you are looking at the inner dynamics of your life, and you are allowing the Spirit to come in. And so, for example, if you're going to practice mercies, long-suffering and so on, you would do that in cooperation with the action of the Spirit in you. So that would fall more in the category of being filled than it would being baptized. But you know, you don't want to cut these things too fine. But still, that is, let's put it this way, if you're filled with the Spirit, you're going to have the right kind of bowels. you'll be okay and that will be something that you do but of course it won't be something that you do without the action of the spirit because in the divine conspiracy some of you may have seen this I use this little triangle. I call it the golden triangle in the center. This is how to put on the mind of Christ. And that's a reference to Philippians 2 where it says, let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus. Let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus. Now, I put up at the apex here the activity or the action of the Holy Spirit. Okay. And I put it up there because there is a dimension of passivity in the process. And here you want things like the new birth. and that is an action of the Spirit, isn't it? New birth is being born of the Spirit. Do you remember how John 3 reads? It's being born of the Spirit. That's the point at which the new life comes in. It comes into our mind, is presented to us through the thoughts that are in the gospel, and perhaps with the suasion of the Spirit, our will is brought around, and we say yes, and the connection now is established, And we have, instead of being spiritually dead, we're now spiritually alive. But you also have things like baptism by the Spirit, filling, anointing. And that's closely related with gifts. All that goes up here. Closely related. There's some activity, some passivity in it. The old Schofield Bible uses the formula, one baptism, many fillings, constant anointing. Not too bad. Not too bad. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if you couldn't have more than one baptism. You know, it isn't like we Baptists where you can just get saved once, you know. So if you want to get saved again, you have to say that other one wasn't it. So that's the action of the Holy Spirit. Over here are, let's just say, temptations. This is real life. that's real life that's temptations isn't it I mean what is life well you get lots of troubles don't you and so it's important to keep this here to keep us from heading for a monastery see now if God has called you to a monastery go but the monastery you don't have to go to the monastery occasionally I irritate some of my Catholic friends by pointing out that Jesus was not a monk and none of the apostles were and that that's a form of practice that comes along later and I think that there's some legitimacy to it for some people but we don't want to get in the position of saying that everyone has to head for a monastery You're going to live right here by the kitchen sink, in the garage, by your computer, in the midst of your children and your family. So that's real life. And you have to have this to know the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God is right here in real life. It's where you are. And over here then, I put disciplines. These are chosen practices. And the action of the Spirit now doesn't come into us without our response. And a part of our response means to practice those kinds of things that will enable us to come to grips with the presence of the kingdom in real life and the Holy Spirit as a part of the action that's going on here in real life. So now, we don't just...it might be, for example, that a part of being filled with the Spirit would be choosing to fast or memorize scriptures or do other things of that sort in the midst of real life. It might be to put ourselves in a position of service, which is a marvelous discipline for the transformation of the mind or the self. And that would also occur here in real life. Or we might go to a monastery and have three days of solitude. Don't start there. I mean, if you're going to start on solitude, start with three hours and move up. Some people can go faster. And there ought to be a time when you might go for three days in a retreat somewhere and just be there. And those things often are tremendously helpful. But all of this is a process that we are involved in and we're clothing ourselves. Now that goes together with the verse that we had earlier about tarry in Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high. But we don't do the clothing. In that case, we do the tarrying. There are other cases where we may take steps here. Notice they had to tarry at Jerusalem. That is a case of a discipline. And ten days in the upper room would do a lot for your temperament, perhaps. At least it would be a path of discovery, I imagine, for you and those who are with you. So once we have this kind of diagram, There's nothing special or legal about this. It's just a way of thinking about the factors that go into the transformation of the mind until you come to the easy mind of Christ. Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus. And that's something for us to do, and that's a context to put it in. So go along with the filling of the Spirit. Now, we have a few minutes left, So let me ask you if you have remarks or questions. You don't have to be questioned. You may want to make a declaration. And you're welcome to do that. And I'll try to respond if it seems like something I should respond to the best I can. Otherwise, we'll just listen to you. So anyone? Here's a gentleman over here. I'm perplexed by what seems to me to be... Start again, sir. Yeah. I'm perplexed by what seems to me to be kind of an average guy model that is foundational to this. If I think about broader samples of people who are unusual, who don't have intellectual capacity, reasoning abilities, who are not in the, if you think in terms of the psychology of individual differences, that they represent the ends of the continuum. I wonder what you do with those groups. I'm thinking particularly of, say, psychopaths, people that would clinically be seen as having a lack of capacity for normal affective functioning, normal cognitive functioning, that there is something constitutionally impaired about them. And it seems to me that if a model of spiritual life, spiritual discipline means anything, it has to have some application to those groups of people. And so I'm wondering kind of how you get to that group and whether or not this is even applicable to that group. Yes, I think it is, but there's something very important in what you're saying. Not everyone can do spiritual disciplines. So you don't start there with people who can't. Some people need ministry. They need people to gather around them in love. They need people to pray for them, both for inner healing and of the wounds that they probably received, as well as for specific needs that they may have in the present. Like, for example, this type of person often can't hold a job, if I understand the kind of person you're talking about. Or they may be able to hold jobs, but at the expense of everyone else that's working around them. Let me just clarify this a bit. Sure. And this is my own kind of professional, personal issue at this point. That's all the better. In Minnesota, there is a law called the sexual psychopath law in which we civilly commit people who are seen as sexually dangerous or sexual psychopathic personality. I've been involved in this for about the last 15 years. one of the difficult issues around this is that this is a population that's not treatable. There's no clinical literature that indicates that these people benefit from treatment, but we commit them and we demand that they be treated. And what I have been struggling with lately is, is there any, for lack of a better term, and I hate this term, Christian model or component of Christian perspective that you might offer that would have some capacity to touch these people, to make a difference in a way that clearly clinical models today do not. And I think in a sense it's like putting to the test a lot of what we talk about as Christians, but most of which I think tends to be rather meaningless and doesn't work. So I want you to figure this out for me, I guess. And I'd like for you to do it tonight Right, because... Go ahead. But it's something, frankly, that I think that... I really appreciate you doing this. This is really valuable. So thank you very much for it. I'm not so sure that I can give you anything like a solution that could be worked on. In this respect, it's similar to the death penalty, I think. And it's hard for me to imagine in a society as rich as ours that we would have to have the death penalty. On the other hand, what are the alternatives? We're not apt to set up a situation that could handle the circumstances around such a thing with the resources we have and the knowledge we have and the willingness we have of people to lay out their resources. You see, in the case of the people you're talking about, I think you would essentially have to establish a community for them in which they were known and dealt with in ways that would allow them to not harm other people, but also to have some sort of existence that's worth living. Now, I think beyond that is treatment not by the models that we would understand for that now, but rather people who would be willing to take them on as spiritual friends, pray for them, teach them, be with them. That might be something for Christian churches to do. But it would be very hard to get Christian churches to do that now. I'm afraid God's suggesting that I might do that, and I think it's a bad suggestion. Well, no, I don't think you can do that. But I mean in the sense that formulating a community of Christians who have the capacity, spiritually, emotionally, etc., to formulate some kind of ministry, essentially, to that population. Well, it would be one that would have to contain, would have to involve both forced restraints of certain kinds with love and teaching and ministry. Something that would allow these people to have hope. And I don't, I think individuals, I guess my view is that this would require such a commitment on the part of so many people that you wouldn't be able to find the people to do it. And so I guess I would say that the only kind of thing you could reasonably live with here is something that would be in a future where the people of God have stood forward in society in such a way that they can lead the whole society and get their cooperation in establishing what is needed. And now, see, I don't think that's the next step. I think that's probably several steps beyond where we are now. And that what we really at this point need to do is to be able to lead masses of people who are not in that position and who can practice spiritual disciplines and so on, to get them involved in that so that this church of Christ stands forth in the community in a way that convincingly says, here's the way to live. And that's why we don't have that now. Now, some places are better than others, but generally speaking, that's not what people think of when they think of the church. So I think we have to grow our fellowships and our teaching down the road ways before we could ever deal with that. And beyond that, it's going to be up to maybe an individual here and there with special powers and abilities who can help individuals from those groups. So we've got work to do. And we can't forget about these people. Yes, ma'am. I have a request. Yes. If you, this is just a request, and you guys can say no, but if you and Todd could pray for him. I work with children and families, too, and have dealt with some people who have come out of that kind of lifestyle. And I know there's freedom, as we were talking about, if God's seed is in us, we will not continue to go on sinning. That there is freedom for people who live in that. And I think what you're saying is true. It's a process, but I would ask if you would pray for him right now, and as a community, we would pray for the releasing of God's power in that because that has been on my heart for people that have lived in that and want to become free of that kind of lifestyle and give hope. That man has a place where he could give hope, and I want that we could pray for him now. Are we talking about you? You work with people who... You help these people. Right. Yes. Minnesota spends about $143,000 a year on every sexual psychopath that's committed. We have $170,000 at Moose Lake right now. We're going to increase the facility. We'll be spending another whatever it is. We'll probably have another 300 people in there within the next couple of years. That's a population that people love to hate. Yes. And that bothers me. No, that's true. That's true. And there are reasons to hate this population, but they're not good enough. Well, they're not good reasons at all, but they come out of fear. The hatred comes out of fear and the sense of inability to do anything about them. And what redemption for the children if they could see that God can make these people whole and that there could be healing and restoration and true restoration? Well, I don't know where you want to go with this. No, I just needed a clarification. Now, who do we want to pray for? You know, Dallas, I've got a suggestion. Yes. Let's do this. Let's take a couple more questions. And in the end, I want to pray for you. I'd like Todd to pray for you as you go to do what you're going to do. Maybe, Todd, you could pray for Jim. Would you do that, Todd? Then I don't want to just pass that on, you see. I sense your heart, and this is something we really need to pray for. I feel like we need to pray for the ministry of the gospel among Christian people to help them understand how not to hate people they fear and how to… You see, so we'll… Todd, you're going to sort this all out in a moment when you pray for us, okay? Was there another question or comment? A comment might be turning into a question, but in response to what's been presented, as an in-home family therapist, part of my mission statement is that I am the unsaid hands and feet of Jesus as I enter these homes, although I may not ever be able to say a word about Him. and I think in situations when people look really hopeless it's very easy to look for results and if we're doing the process something is happening whether we ever see results or not and that's what I'd like to encourage whoever this gentleman is and other people who may be working in really difficult situations that we can still bring the kingdom without ever even naming it in real power. No, that's right. That's quite right. And we really must accept that as the principle that we live by, is the kingdom has come nigh unto thee, whether you know it or not. And I do think that often we, I guess I would qualify it simply in terms of you will, there will be results. You may not see them. But now then we still, I think, need to be serious about this issue of what do we do. And you know that's only one class of people, right? See, I don't know if I have a feeling you have it up here too, but we have in Southern California people who just are so angry at undocumented people standing on the street corner looking for work. So, I mean, this is humanity. This is the way things go. This was true in Jesus' day, and that's why in the Gospels you have people pulled out of especially despised classes. And his teachings are given in relationship to that. You may know that in the story of the Good Samaritan, the phrase Good Samaritan never occurs. And it could not occur because there was no such thing. and so we need to be thoughtful about that. Are there any other questions or comments? I have a comment. Yes, sir. I'm the field director for the Twin Cities-Seven County Mentor Area for Prison Fellowship, and I want you to know that the church is alive and well in the prisons in Minnesota. In Oak Park, there's a number of psychopaths there, But about 20 of them have come to Jesus in the last four or five years, and they are walking in what you're talking about. Of this group? There are some sex offenders of Moose Lake, yes. And the problem in Minnesota is once labeled a sex offender, that never leaves, no matter what the level is. Now, we have three classes of sex offenders, level one, two, and three. And so I understand what our brother is saying. We do need to pray for that. But the church is going into these facilities, and there is hope. So I just want you to know that so that as you pray and as you believe and as you understand that the gospel is alive and well in the prisons. Well, and to reiterate, there are some cases where you don't talk about people doing disciplines or things. You minister to them. A primary minister to them is to preach the gospel. But that is something that should be done by loving them and doing everything you can to help them. And sometimes that is not a very direct kind of thing that you might look at. It might be legislation. It might be someone saying, I give my life to understanding these kinds of things as a social scientist, and I, by the grace of God, will find ways of ministering to and dealing with the people who are in need. But that's an encouraging thought, and thank you. I was in prison, and you visited me. Dallas, too, don't we have situations in the life of Jesus where he came across people who were somehow sexually twisted? And in some cases, such as in the case of the woman in Samaria, love conquered. Yes. In other cases, we see of a prostitute that many demons were driven out of her. So sometimes this becomes an issue, does it not, of spiritual warfare? Absolutely it does. And a combination of spiritual warfare and love, those two issues can do it? Yes, and it's a dreadful thing to think of spiritual warfare without love. But if you allow it to descend into a kind of mechanism, you can actually get that. And you may have seen it. So we need to combine those. That's why I say ministry is often what it's called. Concernment, the ability to stand with someone over a period of time and pray and speak to the need in the power of the kingdom and watch the result and let it move and stay there. But the hardest part often is staying there, being with them. And, of course, in prison ministry you do that. But we need to emphasize again that ministry is often what is called for. See, that's where the spiritual life comes into the situation. And we have to have the faith and confidence that it's there and step out and depend upon it to happen. And I know I've spoken with Christian psychiatrists and others who have learned how to have prayer ministry with people as they worked with them and have seen individuals of extreme mental illness change. The psychopathic is probably the hardest one to deal with, but change is possible. Anyone else? Okay. Thank you. Dallas, I don't know if we're going to get a chance to ask you any more questions after this, so I want to ask some personal things about you. Sure. I remember when you were here about four years ago, you said that the church really needed teaching on the nature of heaven. Mm-hmm. I'm curious as to what your publishers want you to work on next and what you'll be doing in the near future. Well, those are two different questions really. It could be one, but as it turns out it is two. I won't be writing a book. I'm not thinking about a book on the nature of heaven. But that is so important for people so that they will have a sense of what their life is and how it continues. Actually, I'm going to try to talk about that Saturday night and Sunday here. But in the nature of the case, you can't get a lot done in a Sunday morning service. You have to hit the high points and hope everyone can hang on. Maybe I could just say a word about tonight, Keith, in response to part of that, and that way people could pray better about it. What I'm writing on now is the disappearance of moral knowledge from our culture. And what I mean by that is over a period of about 100 years or so, we went from a situation in North America, shall we say, and certainly was true in Britain and in most of Europe. We went from a situation where people knew the difference between good and bad and right and wrong. And it was available to them as a resource for guiding their choices, both individually and in social things. And that has disappeared. It isn't that there is no knowledge, but it's not available to people. And people don't recognize it as such. And this is primary... So I'm writing this book on the disappearance of moral knowledge, and it will be centered on essentially Christian issues, but they will be addressed within the framework of moral theory as it is done in the universities. And the reason I'm doing that is because that's where the problem is. The university is now the authority center of our culture. And when you look at the way events go in the culture, you will see that the ideas that come down now since the Second World War come out of the universities. So that's where it has to be addressed. And this evening I'm actually going to the University of Minnesota. I have no idea where this is, but someone knows, and they're going to take me. I hope someone knows. And I'm going to speak on moral education in the university. And I'm going to talk about how it is actually done now, even though people deny that they're doing it. and how they actually teach a system of morality while denying that they do and that this gives them the advantage of not having to defend what they do. And I will conclude by talking about Jesus' teachings on morals and how we haven't found anything better and it would be a good idea for the university now to turn around and go back and look at that seriously and consider the possibility that Jesus really is the smartest person who ever lived on earth. That he knows what he's talking about when he talks about love and when Paul talks about love. And in fact, that is the underlying view insofar as we have one in this culture, that love is really what makes a person a good person. And that the good action is the loving action. You'll even hear that argued. For example, the idea that hate speech is wrong. Well, what's wrong about it? It's not loving. Love is actually the standard that's being applied, but no one has a framework to defend it. And so that has some reasons, and I'll go into those. So you can pray for me as I go, please, and we'll see what the Lord will do. Thank you, Dallas. I actually think these two things that Jim brought up and where Dallas is going are vitally connected. We've talked about perversion here today and wisdom to escape it. And if you would think about all the money that's being spent to reforest Mars. Yeah. If people could be given a different kind of life than a palm tree. And all the minds and money were to go towards that. And that's the vision that Jesus had us pray for, that this kind of thing that Dallas is going to talk about, that the Christians that are there that are light on the hill would reverse this thing and bring all these resources to bear on these kinds of issues. Todd, would you pray for Dallas tonight? And also pray for Jim, because Jim, I think you represent all of us who face different issues that just almost seem insurmountable. That one's huge. Would you pray, Todd? I thought of this text with reference to Dallas's work tonight and Jim's work day in and day out. If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, or that could be translated without in any way shaming, he should ask God. And God will give wisdom that comes from heaven that is first of all pure, peaceful, considerate, submission, full of mercy, good fruit, impartial, and sincere. So now, Father, we come in one of those positions where, Jim especially, in his work, all of our hearts can go out to the seeming impossibility. We stand before you asking for wisdom. And we want that wisdom that doesn't make us feel dumb or ashamed or set aside, but catches us up into the action, your action, and does so in ways that are peace-filled and power-filled and helps us to submit ourselves to the ruling and reigning of your kingdom. And we ask as Dallas goes now, Lord, that as you set apart Paul and Barnabas from a community like this, full of the Spirit, and sent them out, we now send out our friend and brother Dallas and ask that he would be the ambassador and spokesman for your kingdom tonight. In Jesus' name. Amen. Once again, let them eat. We sit and eat. Sit and eat. The rhythm. We've got to do one more thing, Todd. Dallas has got to take off, so we would ask you just not bug him and let him go with Dick, who's going to get him there. So go, and we'll see you later. Thank you.
