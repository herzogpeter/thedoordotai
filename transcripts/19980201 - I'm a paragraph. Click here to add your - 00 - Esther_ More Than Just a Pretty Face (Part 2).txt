Webster's Dictionary defines a hero as someone who demonstrates great courage and nobility, who performs great deeds involving daring and risk, often putting themselves in harm's way for the sake of people, principle, or cause. As I think of the dynamic of heroism, what occurs to me is that it generally requires the convergence of at least two elements. Number one is circumstance, which provides the opportunity for heroism to be demonstrated. Number two is character, which provides capacity to act in an heroic way when circumstance avails itself. I am convinced that there are many men and women in this room who, without doubt, have the necessary character, the heart of a hero. But it hasn't converged with the kind of circumstance that might make that heroic heart publicly known. And so it is, many of you in this room live out what I think probably is a life of heroic faith. in an anonymous, almost invisible way, seen by some but only a few. Others, by circumstance, have been given the opportunity to act heroically, to demonstrate defiant, risk-taking faith. But when that circumstance presented itself at the critical moment, you lacked the necessary character. A few weeks ago, I had the painful honor of doing the funeral of one of the dearest friends I've ever had, Dave Busby, who I will ever remember as being marked by, among other things, heroic, courageous, defiant, risk-taking faith. Often putting himself at great personal risk. Sometimes that was physical, sometimes it was emotional because in a place of depletion he gave it anyway. Putting himself at great personal risk for people, principle, or cause. The word of God is shot through with examples of men and women, ordinary men and women under other circumstances. Who when the circumstances presented themselves demonstrated in a variety of ways. Heroic, risk-taking, defiant faith. Esther, whose life we began to examine last week, is one of those people. This week we are going to see the defining moment of her life where this heroism manifests itself. It comes in chapter 4, verse 16, when a little bit later, again, in the context of the story, we will hear her say these amazing words. And thus I will go into the king's presence, though I know it is strictly forbidden. And if I perish, I perish. She risked it all. The question I would like to pose relative to her heroism, defiant faith, that will drive the rest of our study, including today, but also one more week we're going to have in this, is this. How does heroic, defiant faith, like the kind we're going to see in Esther today, get formed in the lives of ordinary people like you and me? Indeed, how does heroic, defiant faith get formed in the lives of people who, like Esther, may at one time in their life appear to us to badly lack the necessary character qualities for true heroism? Because our perception of them, maybe until this heroic act manifests itself, is this, that they are superficial, shallow, and self-absorbed. Esther, you may remember, if you were with us last week, when we met her last week, had risen to a position of great prominence and was treated as someone of great importance simply because of how she looked. The fact is this. That dynamic does not often produce people of much substance or depth. We see that dynamic often played out in a contemporary context, in the context of professional athletes who all their life, for instance, get treated as someone of great importance because they can hit, run, or catch. And there is nothing particularly wrong with being able to do any of those things. any more than there's anything particularly wrong with being beautiful and winning a beauty contest. Nothing wrong with that. But if that is the essence of your sense of importance and value, it breeds in you a lack of substance unless something else is going on as well. Thus the question I find very curious, how did heroic defiant faith get developed specifically in Esther, who I think had a lot of reason to be superficial, shallow, and self-absorbed. Well, to find the answer to that question, open your Bibles with me to the book of Esther. As we enter the second week in what is going to be a three-part mini-series of her life that I have entitled, Esther, More Than Just a Pretty Face. Let me remind you of the story and where we are so far. It's said, as you know, in the capital of Persia, the city of Suze, It concerns the people of God, Israel, living in exile there, far from home, with no prospect of return to home. They have completely lost sight and lost hope of ever going home. In this entire book, there is no mention of Jerusalem, no mention of the temple, worship, the priests. There is even no mention of the name of God in all of this book. In fact, one of the reasons that Esther, there was some debate about whether Esther would even become part of the canon, Because God's name is never explicitly mentioned. But God is shot through this book in terms of his activity. In their hopelessness, God seems to these people to be hidden. And I am quite convinced that there are people here this morning who are experiencing that very thing. Where God to you seems very hidden and completely silent. The message of Esther is this. At times like that, when that appears to be the case, he is not. inactive, indeed the primary point of this entire story, which will unfold even more next time. And it is also what the Jews even today celebrate about this story of Esther is this, that even when God seems to be invisible, seems to be silent and absent, he is not. He is constantly at work, sometimes behind the scenes on behalf of his people. We met Esther last week in chapter 2, When she took the place of the old queen Vashti, who had been banished by King Ahasuerus because Vashti had the gall to say no to him, she won the position, did Esther, of being queen strictly on the basis of her beauty. She was the winner in chapter 2 of this vast beauty contest. But she would end up being more than just a beauty queen, Indeed, proving herself to be a mighty warrior for the living God. Several years ago, there was an incident that was reported in the newspaper, which is a true story about a toy company that was making these dolls. I don't know if kids still get these or not, but a few years ago, this was all the rage, where they would have a voice box put in them, and you'd either pull a string or shake them, and they would speak to you various things. And the story was about Mattel, who evidently at the time had the contract for both the Barbie doll and the G.I. Joe doll, and those voice boxes got switched, which made it quite interesting. So in some G.I. Joes, they had the Barbie voice, and in some Barbies, they had the G.I. Joe voice. And so there's little kids all over the country pulling the G.I. Joe string and hearing him ask, how do you like my dress? Stuff like that. Create all sorts of gender issues going on. I like it a lot. Anyway, anyway. Don't go there, Dave. And then they'd pull the string on the Barbie doll, and we'd hear her scream, Hit the deck! No, no, no, no, no! It's all sorts of confusion. You're wondering what that has to do with Esther. A lot. It really does. See, King Ahasuerus, who picked Esther to replace Vashti because of her beauty, thought he was getting a Barbie doll, but he got a G.I. Joe. Esther had a cousin. His name was Mordecai, who when she was orphaned took her in as her own. And I'm even referring to him in some places as her father because he functioned, though he was her cousin, he functioned in her life as her father. In chapter 2, verse 21, it indicates that he sat at the king's gate. That does not mean he was loitering there and just meeting there every day to have coffee with the guys. what it means is that he had risen to a place of playing some sort of role, probably not very high up, but it was some sort of official role in the king's administration. Because of that, he was sitting at the gate. In the process of fulfilling those obligations, whatever they were, of sitting at the gate, there came a time when he overheard and uncovered a plot to kill the king. It saved the king's life. It was recorded then in the king's annals, but he was never rewarded. That's a little piece of information you kind of have to keep for next time. It's part of the story, but that's going to have a big thing to do with our story next time. In chapter 3, then, we get introduced to the next major player of our drama. We've already met King Ahasuerus and Vashti. We've met Esther and Mordecai. We now meet the bad guy, Boo and His. His name is Haman. Let me summarize. Yeah, let me summarize. Okay. Let me summarize. That's good. Audience participation. Very good. Let me summarize this life for you. Starting in chapter 3, verse 1, it indicates that Ahasuerus had promoted him, giving him then, by this promotion, authority over all the officers in the land. He is essentially the chief operating officer in the land of Persia, the number two guy in the kingdom. The king trusts him explicitly. But he is obsessed with his own honor. And when Mordecai, who is a Jew, does not bow down to Haman, who is the number two guy, And the reason Mordecai doesn't bow down to him is because he is a Jew and he will not bow down to anyone but God. It enrages Haman. Verse 5, chapter 3. When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage to him, Haman was filled with rage. But he disdained to lay his hands on Mordecai alone. He thought it beneath him. I don't want to demonstrate that. I don't want people to know this little guy got the best of me. For they had told him who the people of Mordecai were. Therefore, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus. It really is amazing that this man was so obsessed with his honor, pride, and promotion that one man not bowing down to him made him ready to commit genocide. But there was a little bit more involved than just his pride. Now, that clearly was in there and his need to be honored, but there's some history here in chapter 3, verse 1. The writer introduces Haman to us as the son of Hamathath. That word there, the Agagite. Let me tell you what this is about, where this historic hatred came from. Tucked away in the recesses of 1 Samuel is a story of the time that King Saul moved against the Amalekites and destroyed them. The reason he moved against the Amalekites was because they were the historic enemy of the people, the Jews, the Israelites. The reason they were historic enemies was because even in the context of their leaving Egypt, the Amalekites had attacked the Israelites, tried to obliterate them. So the Amalekites attacked the Israelites. A thousand years later or something, many years later, Saul attacks them back and so on and back and forth and no forgiveness and constant retribution. The cycle continues. When Saul attacked the Amalekites and pretty much destroyed them, they pretty much killed everybody, he spared a king, the king of the Malchites was named Agag, who ultimately gave birth to or from Agag came the Agagites. Haman is an Agagite. And it is out of this historic battling back and forth, no forgiveness, no grace, you hurt me, I hurt you back, you hurt me, I hurt you back, out of that historic hatred, there came what ultimately issued a racial prejudice so that when Haman, who hated all Jews, saw Mordecai, who was just one Jew, All of the hate he had for all Jews landed on this one guy. And it was intensified by the fact that he didn't know his place. Full of this ancient hatred, Haman goes to the king with a plan, verse 8. Then Haman said to the king of Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Didn't name who they were. Their laws are different from those of all other people. That was true, the law of God, the law of Moses. And they do not observe the king's laws. That was not true. They were good citizens. So it is not in the king's interest to let them remain. He's the number two guy. Ahasuerus trusts this guy. He shouldn't trust him, but Ahasuerus has lost his ability to discern who speaks to him the truth because people who speak the truth to Ahasuerus don't last very long. So he gets left with Haman, this manipulator. If it is pleasing, verse 9 to the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver into the hands of those who carry on the king's business. That is, into your hand, and put it into the king's treasury. Fundamentally, what he's doing here is bribing the king with money so that Haman can do what he wants. 10,000 talents of silver is a lot of money. 12 million ounces of silver, virtually the entire revenue, the entire annual revenue, the gross national product of the entire Persian empire. A good question at this point was how on earth would Haman have that kind of money? Well, that was part of the plan. If his plan was approved, he would literally annihilate all of the Jews in the land, and he would take their property. And from the property he was going to confiscate, he would have at least that much money to put into the king's treasury, and he would be rid not only of Mordecai, but the hated Jews. The king's response is, verse 10 and 11, Okay, then the king took his signet ring from his hand, gave it to Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And the king said to Haman, the silver is yours and the people also to do with them as you please. Now, back in chapter 3, verse 7, just this other little thing I want you to know about and keep in mind even for next time. It says this, that Haman cast lots to determine the best day to pull off this execution. Let's look at that real briefly. in the first month, verse 7, which is the month Nisan, in the 12th year of King Ahasuerus, Pur, that is the lot, P-U-R means the lot. Purim means lots. The festival of Purim, which Jews celebrate, I'll explain in a minute, is the festival of the lots. The lots are going to be cast before Haman from day to day and from month to month until the 12th month, that is the month of Adair. Now when it says in verse 7 that they cast these lots from day to day and month to month until the 12th month, it does not mean that they did it every day for a year. It means this, that they cast lots, without explaining what the lots are, just kind of featured as rolling dice and looking for the best number, the lucky number. It means that they cast lots or rolled dice for every day of the year, and if a lucky number turned up on any particular day, they would note that as a lucky day, and then they would roll the dice again, eliminating more and more days until they came up with what they thought by the casting of the lots, the rolling of the dice, the luckiest number of all. And that was the day that we're going to execute the Jews because this would be their lucky day. It would be as if today they called their little psychic hotline person to figure out which day would be the best day to ask her to marry me or do this dastardly thing I want to do. So all the force of karma or whatever force there is in the universe is going to be with me. whatever else it reveals it reveals this that what they trusted in was fate luck and chance it is interesting it's powerful to me that the Jews still celebrate what I referred to just a moment ago the feast of the Purim that was instituted in Esther chapter 9 by Esther herself and the fact that it's called the feast of Purim or Purim is interesting because what Esther was saying by that and what Jews today are saying when they celebrated, and it's one that maybe we ought to be involved in celebrating ourselves, is this. Haman trusts in fate. Haman trusted in luck and chance. And I want you to know, says Esther, and every time this thing is celebrated, it was not chance, it was not fate, it was not luck, but God was in control. for on the day that Haman thought was his lucky day by the rolling of the dice that he chose to execute all of the Jews and Esther as well along with Mordecai on that very lucky day that is the day that Haman got executed. We do not trust in chance or fate or luck but in the living God says the Jew, the people of God every time they celebrate the feast of Purim or Purim. Chapter 4 verse 1 Mordecai gets the word about the plot. And the queen writhed in great anguish. Then Esther summoned Hathach from the king's eunuchs, whom the king had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was. So Hathach went out to Mordecai to the city square in front of the king's gate, and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him. Verse 8. He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict which had been issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show Esther and inform her. And now catch these words. And order Esther, order her to go into the king to implore his favor and to plead with him for the people. Stop right there. Those last few words, order her to go into the king, implore his favor and plead with him on behalf of the people, brings me to the first thing that God uses in Esther's life. to begin the forming of the necessary character to develop heroic, defiant faith. It simply is this. He used the strong direction and challenge of a devoted, tough, loving friend. Now, in this case, this tough, loving friend was her cousin who was acting as her father. So fundamentally, her father is the one speaking to her these words, who on no certain terms says to Esther this, Esther, it is time for you to step up to the plate. This is your day. You are to go to the king and tell him not to do this. You implore his favor. You use your position as the queen. I want you to leverage your power. And you speak to him on behalf of the people. He says that in verse 8. Not surprisingly, nor without reason, Esther hesitates. As if to say, dad, cousin, whoever you are, I'm sure it all looks very, very clear to you from where you sit what I'm supposed to do. But you need to know there are some things about this situation that you do not understand. Which, by the way, just a little side note here, is something you need to get ready for if you decide to be a direction giver or a challenge caller to anyone. And I hope you do become a direction giver and you're somebody who God uses to challenge people. But just be ready for the fact that when you bring direction, you might bump up against somebody else's strength who says, Wait, wait a minute. It's real easy for you to figure out what I'm supposed to do with my life from where you sit. There might be some things you don't understand. Just get ready for that. It's not a bad thing that they're saying that. Verse 11, Esther gives him some perspective. You need to understand, Mordecai. All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that for any man or woman who comes to the king, to the inner court who is not summoned, he has but one law, and that is to be put to death. Unless the king holds out to him the golden scepter that he may live. It's a capital offense, Mordecai, for me to just walk into his presence. You just can't do that. I'm sure it looks real easy from where you're sitting for me to do what you say. Furthermore, there's something else you don't know about. I have not been summoned to come into the king's presence for 30 days. Get the picture relative to what Esther really is facing here. It is a capital offense to come into the king's presence unsummoned. If she makes it past that and he does extend the royal scepter, she's supposed to tell him that she doesn't like what he's doing. Well, the last time anybody confronted Ahasuerus about what he was doing was Vashti and she got banished. On top of that, she hasn't been summoned for 30 days. So she has no sense of the king's favor. She has good reason to wonder how he will respond. Good reason to wonder, where do I stand? She has legitimate reason to fear. The danger is real. The risk is enormous. There might be times when you are being pushed or called by someone else to stand up and do a certain thing and maybe the thing that you're going to risk is real embarrassment, way past embarrassment. The danger physically for Esther is legitimate. Mordecai, you don't understand. I can't just do this. The answer is no, verse 12, and they related Esther's words to Mordecai. Now, I suspect that most of us at this point think that a good friend at this point would back off. Respect their boundaries. Accept the answer. We don't want to pressure anybody. We don't want to manipulate or push anybody. We don't want anybody to do anything they don't want to do. Because if we push you, that would be so abusive, and we would never do that. Mordecai pushes anyway. It is true that Mordecai might not have seen everything that needed to be seen, but the fact is this. He knew enough. And he saw enough to know that this time the stakes were way too high to worry about Esther's comfort level. And so it is, Mordecai pushes Esther hard. Verse 13. Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther. Esther, do not imagine that you and the king's palace can escape any more than all of us. I got news for you, Esther. Mordecai is saying. You cannot afford to be naive about everything that's going on. You can sit up there and be the queen and be pampered and have this wonderful life, and it would be wonderful if you could just close your eyes and close your ears and close your mouth, but I've got a news for you. Something's coming down right now that you cannot afford to be naive about. And the consequences of what you are either about to do or not do are going to ripple out, affect many, many people, and boomerang back on you as well. verse 14 he goes further for if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance will arise from the Jews from another place God's in control you've been penciled in we don't just have to have you Esther but I promise you this you and your father's house will perish that's a huge word right there amazing wisdom big picture kind of stuff Mordecai is giving her you need to know something Esther you need to know something anybody here who's being called by God to do something that they know they're supposed to do if you don't do the ministry God's called you to I got news for you God in heaven is not going oh no what am I going to do my plans are ruined now the kingdom's not going to no no I promise you the kingdom is going to go forward and the gates of hell will be dispersed by the power of God. God, if you are obedient, God will raise somebody else up. But make no mistake about this. That that which you have been called to do, if you are disobedient, it will perish. There will be consequences for you if you say no, Esther. And I know you think I'm being real mean for getting in your face about this, but I right now, I am your best friend. and then at the end of verse 14 this real heavy stuff changes and I even think the light in Haman's eyes change a little bit as he begins to get in touch with possibilities wanting to ignite in Esther's heart of vision because he brings to her the challenge the glorious, God-honoring, life-saving possibilities Oh Esther just think Wonder and dream with me About this possibility Maybe the real reason You have been raised To this position of prominence Maybe the real reason You won this incredible beauty pageant Which you thought was the end of it all I have arrived Maybe that was nothing Maybe the reason you won that beauty pageant Was for such a time as this Verse 14 And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this. Let me paraphrase all of that this way. Esther, you were chosen as a beauty queen, and that's a good thing. I was delighted. I was so proud of you when that was announced. I supported you when that happened. But I want to infect you with another possibility that maybe God is calling you, young lady, to something bigger. And you need to discern and decide right now what that is. for here's what I believe about you. You are my cousin, but I have treated you, and I consider you my daughter. My beloved daughter, here is what I believe about you. You have not been given what you've been given. You have not been brought to this place in your life just so you could accumulate more precious stones, a great wardrobe, exotic fragrances, so you could become the most beautiful, desirable woman in all of the empire. You have not been brought to this place for reasons that the king thinks you've been brought to this place. You are where you are, young lady. I believe to work for justice, to fight for truth, to stand up for people who cannot stand up for themselves, to oppose an evil man, vile and supremely powerful, and to be part of God's plan to redeem and save many, many people alive. And by the way, that fact is what every one of us are being called into whenever we're called into the work of the kingdom. God's plan to save many, many people alive. Esther if you miss this I will love you but I promise you you will miss the whole point of your existence for you were not given what you have been given just for you and if you have been gifted by God you have not been given that gift that resource, that money, that time, that talent just to spend on you this was never about a beauty contest ever. Oh, Esther, will you do it? Will you decide? Ultimately, he can't make Esther do it. He'd probably like to try, probably like to control him, but he can't. Esther's response is thrilling. Verse 15, then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai, Go assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maidens also will fast in the same way, and thus I will go into the king, which is not according to the law, and if I perish, I perish. Among the first things that I believe God uses to help develop defiant faith in ordinary people like you and me is the strong challenge of a devoted, tough-loving friend who has both the care and the courage to push past what you think are your limits and call you out to more. Sometimes that person is a mom or a dad. Sometimes there comes a point in a child's life and in her development when they're not hearing dad or mom anymore. I've experienced that. So have many of you where dads and moms' voice, true as they are, it just doesn't have the power anymore and it requires another person's strong voice to call these things out. Sometimes it's a teacher. That's why you just got to bless that profession. Sometimes it's a coach. Sometimes it's a pastor. Sometimes it's a boss at work. Sometimes it's a best friend. Sometimes it's a husband or a wife. I was thinking about this on the way to church this morning, how incredibly blessed I feel to be married to a woman who loves me from the depths of her soul but has never from day one been afraid to speak to me the truth. That makes my time with my wife the safest place on earth for me. someone who cares enough about me to speak to me the truth she sees sometimes it's an accountability group sometimes it's even a good counselor who cares about us and has the courage to speak to us the truth and not have a need to make us feel good all the time someone who has both the care and the courage to every once in a while say you know what you're really full of it right now you know what, what you're doing is wrong and you need to quit blaming everybody else and go look in a mirror or on the other hand, positively, you know what I love you and I think God's hand is all over you and you are capable of so much more you have tremendous gifts and I'm here to tell you, it is time for you to start putting what you have into play and quit sitting on the sidelines I'll never forget when I was a sophomore in high school I was invited to a youth for Christ camp and it was for leaders and I was surprised I got asked because I wasn't living for God at all at the time and why I was asked I have no idea there was a youth guy there who was obviously older than me that I had tremendous respect I really thought this guy was the coolest guy on earth and he met me as I was unpacking my bag by my bunk and he kind of asked me what I was expecting from the week and I told him that my chief goal of the whole week where we were supposed to meet with God was I wanted to meet with girls. I had a bunch of girls I wanted to meet and I thought that would put him off and scare him. I got a rough guy here. Well, he was a guy, I'll never forget it, who cared enough about me and had enough courage and had enough sense of his own value, I suppose, to risk me being mad at him all week, but he got in my face about that. And he'd just say, you know something, Dave, I think you're a great kid, but I sure expect a lot more out of you than that. That's a pretty insignificant goal for the week. And I just hope you change your mind by the time the week is over. And I just expected him to need to be my friend. You know, you go, oh, that's funny, Dave. You're such a guy. He didn't do that. He got in my face. And you know what? I still remember that. You know why? That was a catalytic moment for me. It had transforming power in my life. That week was a critical week in my life. Part of it was because he cared enough about me to get in my face. But here's the problem with the Mordecai's of our life. If you are not humble or wise, when the Mordecai's come into your life to speak truth into your life, you will very often not see them for who they are, a friend. Instead, we have a tendency to see these people as an enemy and push them away. They speak to us the truth. We go in our room and pout. Sometimes it's worse than that. They speak to us the truth. We find a way to very subtly sometimes punish them, at least avoid and ignore them. And the value of the Mordecai goes right down the drain because we do not have wisdom or humility to hear a word that might make us feel uncomfortable for a while. But that word is the key to life and the development of heroic faith. By the way, this was King Ahasuerus' problem. It really is amazing. You can kind of contrast Mordecai with Esther and Haman with Ahasuerus. You know, when Ahasuerus had somebody get in his face like Vashti when she said no, he just eliminated him. You know, Mordecai to Ahasuerus would have gotten nowhere. You don't talk to the king that way. the results of that for the king was he probably felt good all the time bunch of people always say yeah you're the man you are really cool and that is exactly what happens if you eliminate the mordecai's of your life by simply ignoring here's the good news you ignore the mordecai's of your life they will go away they will not keep speaking to you they will let they're not going to try to control you they're going to say their work and go pout fine they'll let you go and you'll be left with yes people who just nod their head. Oh yeah, you're the one. Oh boy, you're so smart. And you'll feel real good and you are in mortal danger. For yes people surrounding you ushers in then the possibility for evil people surrounding you. Enter now Haman. Haman now Ahasuerus is his right hand person. I think all of this evil in Haman was allowed to rise to the surface in a system where the leader needed yes men around him and now an evil guy is there who knew just exactly how to stroke him and bribe him and coddle him and manipulate him now to his own agenda. Mordecai with Esther confronted Esther like crazy. He said hard things. But Mordecai loved Esther and his agenda was the people of God. Haman didn't give a rip about Ahasuerus. He had his own agenda He just manipulated Ahasuerus. Critical question, who's your Mordecai? Who loves you enough? But I have to add this part. Who do you allow in your life to push you when you're shrinking back, to inspire and challenge you to courageous and obedient faith, even when it costs you to expect more of you than you think you can give? Some of you, when I ask that question, who's your Mordecai, you start to lament, I don't have a Mordecai, nobody in my life. And you know what, that may be true, but I don't believe that. I don't believe that you don't have a Mordecai. I think it may be true that right now you don't have a Mordecai, but I think everybody here has had at one time or another a series of Mordecais. I think what's far more likely, if you don't have a Mordecai in your life right now, it's this, that when the Mordecais that God has sent into your life have come into your life and spoken to you a truth that didn't make you feel warm and gooey, You blew them off. You went and pouted. You got mad. You didn't receive the word. And you know what? Mordecai's go away. Let me speak this plainly. I do not believe that we will ever grow to have courageous, heroic, defiant faith. Unless we have at least one, maybe two people who you, who we allow to speak truth to us, to challenge us, push us, and call us. And if you are surrounding yourself with people who are controlled and intimidated by you, who tell you what you want to hear, who make you always feel good, you will always feel good, but you will never grow defiant faith. Proverbs 27, verse 17 says, As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another. It does not say as silk sharpens silk. You know why? Because silk doesn't sharpen anybody. It just feels really good. But when you strike iron and iron together, sparks fly, heat is generated. And if you can't handle the heat, you will blow off the Mordecai's in your life. And some of you, if you're honest, one of the real, the major breakthrough of this sermon for some of you would be to just step back and let yourself feel the weight of a history in your life of pushing everybody away, whoever tried to tell you the truth about what they see in your life. And now you think, I don't have a Mordecai. You've had Mordecais all along the way. Time to repent and find out who they are. God will give them to you. You know, we talk about accountability a lot. I think it's a huge issue. And we even talk in our church a lot at staff levels and elder levels and all of our small groups about accountability. And we need a system that's accountable. But one of the things I've learned is that I don't care what your system of accountability is, so we're checking up on each other. Nobody's accountable who doesn't let themselves be accountable. And if you blow off your Mordecai's, you will, in that process, abort the process of heroic faith that's being formed in you. The big loser will be you, so who's your Mordecai? Maybe it's apparent. Maybe there was a time in your life where your father or your mother were speaking some truth into your life, and because of where you were maturity-wise, they weren't abusive. You even labeled them that. They weren't abusive at all. They were speaking some truth into your life, and maybe they didn't do it exactly the right way, but they spoke some truth into your life that if you had even a little bit of humility and wisdom, you could have grown from that. They were your Mordecai. You blew them off. Some of you, your Mordecai was a best friend who isn't a best friend anymore because they dared to tell you the truth about what they saw in your life. for some of you it's a spouse maybe a spouse who said you know what what's going on in your life right now is not okay with me and it's not okay and so he or she says well I'm going to go with somebody else who says it's okay and the person who goes away is going to feel a lot better because they're going to get hooked up with a guy or a man or a woman who doesn't care about whatever that behavior is they'll never grow who's your Mordecai value them listen to them don't run for them second question who's your Esther what do you mean by that here's what I mean to whom are you very possibly being called right now to be a Mordecai you being the Mordecai this time who do you love enough to say to them from time to time, you know what? I think you're full of it right now. You know what? What you're doing is wrong. You know what? Why don't you quit blaming everybody else? Why don't you quit blaming your wife and blaming your husband? Why don't you take a real long look in the mirror? I'm tired of hearing about everybody else. Or, positively, you know what? God's hand is all over you. And you know what? You are capable of so much more. You have tremendous gifts. It's time for you to put them into play. The second thing God uses that we see in the story of Esther to help develop heroic faith, and this is all we're going to get to today. There's four in all. We'll do the next two next time. The next thing he uses is crisis and hardship. When Esther got pushed to the wall, that's what called it out. by the way this is not to say that God causes crisis or hardship God did not cause Haman to be evil but God sure was going to use it let me illustrate this real simply I am reasonably confident that if right now in this service we did a survey of everybody here where we asked this question what are some of the catalytic events of your life that jettisoned you into major growth spurts in your character development I believe undoubtedly that high on the list would be times of crisis, hardship, and loss. That over and over we would hear from you things like this. There was this period of my life that I never ever want to go through again but I wouldn't trade it for the world. Because it was in that crisis that God called out of me a vitality of faith and dependence that I had never had before and quite frankly I don't know what else would have produced it but that hit the wall experience. And some of you, if you were to give your testimony of your faith journey, whether it would be how you got redeemed or how you moved into deeper things, your story would often be starting with or at least being laced with the time I lost my job or the time I went through the divorce. I would never want to go through that again. But when I went through that divorce, the worst thing in my life, it called out of me faith and dependence and deeper things of God that I had never seen in my life previous to that. And some of you would talk about the time you got kicked out of school or when your best friend died or when you filed bankruptcy or you got busted in your sexual addiction or you actually went to jail. Painful circumstances that force us to decide, who am I really? What do I think really? What do I believe really? What do I want really? And who do I serve really? The glory for Esther was that when she got pushed to that place by this crisis, her answer was this. And thus I will go into the presence of the king, which is not according to the law. And if I perish, I perish. And I promise you, anything less than this kind of crisis would not have pushed this beauty queen to that kind of statement. notice now by the way as we kind of wrap this up for today and even consider next week that from here on in it's no longer going to be Mordecai pushing, challenging or calling Esther to anything more because after she got pushed and this crisis called her now this thing is inside of her, look at verse 17 so Mordecai I went away and did just as Esther had commanded. That's real significant there. Easy to blow over that. She begins to direct Mordecai. He does everything she commanded. Why? She's grown up. She's developed character from which comes heroic, defiant faith. Let me close with this. Do you remember Jeremiah 48? I touched on this story when we were going through Philippians. It's an intriguing story about a city named Moab that was just about to come under the judgment of God. And in the writing, Moab is referred to as if it's a person. It says in verse 11 that the reason judgment was going to come on Moab was because he has been at ease since his youth. And the result of being at ease since his youth is that he has no character whatsoever. It goes on to say in verse 11 this, He has been undisturbed in his lees, L-E-E-S. Neither has he been emptied from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into solitude. Therefore, he retains his flavor. His aroma has not changed. Very interesting words. What this is is an analogy to the preparation of wine. Lees, L-E-E-S, refers to the sediment that settles at the bottom of a wine flask or a wine skin. And the sediment, these lees, are bitter. And so in the preparation of the wine, evidently, what you do is you pour it from one flask to another. You pour it out, and then you let the leaves settle, and then you pour it out again, and then you let the leaves settle. And every time you pour it out, a little bit less of the bitterness goes into the next one. But it needs to be poured out and poured out, and it needs to have crisis and another crisis, and that's the analogy here. And the problem with Moab was that it never got poured out. The result was he smells and tastes like himself. He is self-absorbed. And his taste is this. Bitter, undrinkable, no character, useless. And more than useless, he became a target of God's judgment. A.W. Tozer said all of this this way. God rarely uses a person greatly until he has been wounded deeply. Why is that? it's because deep woundings and crisis can make you or break you but fundamentally in the hands of God received by people who are wise and humble those crises develop character and character produces heroic faith defiant faith, risk taking faith two things we've seen so far through Esther that God uses to develop heroic, defined faith. First, he uses the strong challenge of a devoted and tough, loving friend. Second, God uses crisis and hardship, issuing in statements like this from a young woman who we just thought was a superficial beauty queen, if I perish, I perish. I will obey God. Two more things we will see God uses to develop this kind of faith next week as we come to the conclusion of this amazing, exciting story about Esther. I'd like you to stand as we close. I'm just going to close in prayer, and I'm going to ask the altar team to come, even as I pray, and take their position in the front and receive any of you who need prayer for anything. And I encourage you to do that before you leave if you need anything for prayer to come forward and receive that. Let's pray as we're dismissed. Father, I just thank you for the life of this young woman. thank you for Mordecai who stands as a model for us of a good friend a father who who cares and has the courage enough to speak truth into the life of somebody they care about and thank you for the humility and wisdom that we see in Esther who didn't blow Mordecai off which is our our first instinct almost every time thank you father for for stories like this that exhibit for us what living faith looks like. Call us to this. Work these things in us, your people. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
