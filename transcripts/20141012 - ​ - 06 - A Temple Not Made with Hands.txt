Our scripture reading for today is from 1 Peter 2 verses 9 to 10 and Ephesians 2 verses 19 to 22. But we are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession. For we once were not a people, but now we are the people of God. so then we are no longer strangers and aliens but we are fellow citizens with all the saints and are of God's household having been built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the cornerstone in whom the whole building being fitted together is growing into a holy temple in the Lord in whom we also as living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, the dwelling place of God in the spirit. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Thank you, Vicki. For you once, we once, were not a people, but now we are. The people of God who Peter then identifies, Vicki just read it, as living stones. Living stones is who we are. And these living stones are being built up into a spiritual house. The whole building being fitted together is growing into a holy temple, which is the dwelling place of God, a temple not made with hands but made up of living stones, made up of living stones, and that is who we are. So who are we? This is the question of the day. We've been asking it for a couple of weeks now, born of our decision some weeks ago to take a break from our study in the book of the Acts in order to invite you, to invite all of you to join us as a church on a journey of becoming. And what it is we want to become is a people who are in fact becoming more and more alive. Indeed, to become fully alive. Fully alive is our desire as a people. But we think that becoming fully alive involves a process. It is, in fact, a journey that sometimes is a difficult one involving what we think is the struggle. The struggle, the particular struggle of, among other things, laying aside some things and putting on some things and even putting to death some things in order to become fully alive to God. And that putting to death and laying aside and putting on is, in fact, we think a struggle. Colossians 3 verse 1 says it this way, since then you have indeed been raised with Christ. In other words, you were dead in your transgressions and in your sins, but God has made you alive together with Christ. You've been raised with Christ. Keep seeking those things that give life, that give more and more life. And the things that happen to give life are those things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. And then the rest of Colossians 3 kind of unpacks that. Because he says the way you enter into this life, more and more life, is to lay aside, therefore, things like anger and wrath and malice and clamor. To put on, therefore, humility and kindness, compassion and love. Put to death, therefore, immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which just happens like that. No, it doesn't. It's a journey. process and we think this journey is worth it. So we want all of you to come, which is why you're all invited. But in order to take this journey, there's some things we think we'll need to know. There's some things we think we'll need to discover, first of all, about God. So who is God was the first question we began to ask several weeks ago, followed by second question, Who am I? Who are you as an individual? Who are we? Turns out we're the beloved in God in Christ. Vicki Degner kind of unpacked that for us, followed by a question that we've been dealing with. This is the third week now. Who are we? Not individually, but corporately, as a people, as a group, as a church, who are we? Because if there's a we in this journey, it changes the journey. Because now, I don't take it alone. I take it with you and you take it with me. There's a we which raises the question, who are we? It's the question of the day. What is the church is another way to ask it. Not just our church, but the church. Why are we here? What is it that you're going to? When you're going to a church, do you go to church? What kind of church is a question you might ask. might even be asking it of us. Are you a seeker church or a missional church? Conservative or a liberal church? A megachurch? Or are you a small group church? Are you a friendly church? An evangelistic church? Contemporary church or a traditional church? Are you a good church? I'm going to a good church. Are you a good church? Because I'm looking for a church, just the right kind of church so what kind are you who are you so who are we is the question of the day what is the church why are we here well as it turns out it depends who you ask what is the church because peter seems to think that we're a people and while it's true that once you were not a people. Now, he says, Vicki just read it, you are a people. Indeed, you are the people of God. You are a chosen people. First Peter 2.9, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession. Paul says it a different way. It's not that he disagrees with Peter, but he says, we're a household. We're like a house. Indeed, we're God's household. Ephesians 2.19, Vicki read this also, no longer strangers and aliens. We are fellow citizens with all the saints and are of God's household. We are of God's household, which as I thought about that on kind of a superficial level, it sounds like something that you're in. We're all in the house, the house of God, which is nice to be in, you know, the house. I wouldn't want to be outside the house. We're in the house, But in verse 21, the text Vicki just read in Ephesians chapter 2, it says we're not just in the household. And this is very important. We are. This is weird. We are the house. The household, if you will. And as this whole building that is this household is being fitted together by the Spirit, verse 21, it's actually growing into a holy temple. which is a weird kind of thing to think about and actually if you're going to think about this you've got to activate your imagination. I want you to do it right now. Kind of picture this thing because the building that we're talking about today in these texts is identifying who we are is somehow alive. It is a living thing. Indeed, like a living thing this holy temple, this household of God is growing. It is a temple, a holy temple, made up of what the apostle Peter refers to as living stones. Activate your imagination there. There's a building, and it's made up of stones, and all of the stones are alive, which is, I'm just saying it's weird. Made up of living stones in whom we also, as living stones, 1 Peter 2.5, again, Vicki just read it, as living stones, we are being built up. This building is being built up by living stones, which is who you are and we are. And they're all being fitted together. And as it's being built up, what's being built is a spiritual house. And that spiritual house is the dwelling of God in the spirit, a temple. Picture it. Not made with hands, made up of living stones. You got that in your mind? Now let me spin it just a bit. Because several years ago when we embarked on a building program to build this physical building that we're all sitting in this morning, the whole building, several years ago, I remember the process. And maybe if you were here, you remember it too. The whole building was being fitted together physically with all of its various parts by very skillful people. And if you remember that process, it was a fascinating one and a whole lot of fun. as we watched this thing, this physical building, in some sense, I don't know, grow. It kind of became. It wasn't, and then slowly it was, and it became, and it grew like living things do, but it's not a living thing. It's not a living thing, and it's very important, because I'm spinning this on purpose. It wasn't growing into a holy temple, Because this isn't, this room is not the dwelling place of God. And I mean no disrespect to the building. Sorry. Because we value it and we appreciate it and we're grateful for it. But this room isn't the sanctuary of God. And it's an auditorium. And some of you refer to it as an auditorium. Or we call it the big room. What's going on in the big room. And some of you, when we talk like that, might think, well, they haven't thought much about that. I've thought a lot about it. It's why we don't call it a sanctuary on purpose because it's not. This room is not the dwelling place of God. It's not what God is building. It's not a living thing. And it's not a particularly holy place. Though good and holy things happen in this room, The presence of God is experienced in this room by you and by me, but the presence is only experienced when we're here. Because we, very important, are the dwelling place of God. We are a temple not made with human hands. We are a temple made up of living stones who are being built up and fitted together as a spiritual house, a dwelling place of house. And now add this, as we are being built up, as this temple is being built, fitted together by living stones, which is who you are if you are alive in Christ, and then becoming fully alive in Christ, these living stones individually are growing, which means the building is growing, especially when you add it to other living stones. And as this temple is building, what it's creating is room. Think about this. The holy temple that we are is creating room for what? it is the dwelling place of God. It's creating room for God is what it's creating room for. It's creating room for the fullness of God, for the life of God, for the breath of God, for the power of God, for the voice of God. And as I got this picture, it just pushes this whole thing out about who we are as a people far beyond these physical walls of this physical building. Let me tell you what I see. In fact, I didn't have this last night. It came to me kind of during worship. We think of open door, open door church. I go to open door church and that's fine. And it's made up of living stones, you and you and you and you and me. And as these stones are coming alive, the stones themselves grow. So there's something bigger about us, not size wise. There's just something bigger about us creating room for God among us. But here's the picture I got as it pushes out beyond our walls. What if our open door, whatever we call open door, is what if it's one, we're one stone. What if we're one living stone? And what God is doing in our city is fitting together other living stones, other living stones. And as the building or the temple is being built by God, all these pieces fitted together, something is being built, a building, a dwelling place of God that in this city is creating room for the life of God, the fullness of God, the breath. I don't know how you like that picture. What is God doing in the nation? It's living stones who could be singular expressions of the spirit of God where there's life in a church that is a stone. And I don't know if you can see that. I don't even know I'm right. And all of a sudden there's room in a nation for the moving of God, life of God, power of God. This is who we are. dwelling place of God made up of living stones. If there is no life, then you're just a stone. If you've come to life in Christ, then you're becoming more and more alive in Christ. You're becoming a bigger stone because this living thing is a growing thing being built. You're growing into a temple. Wow. And all of that stuff gets my brain moving and my heart stirring, actually. It kind of makes me wonder, some things that I think we think we know, like what exactly are we building? It's a very important question. What exactly are we building when we're building a church? Turns out it isn't this. It isn't this. And if you think about it, you know that already. I don't need to tell you that, but we kind of do need to think about that because sometimes I think, we think, Sometimes I think it is this, it isn't this physical stuff that we call a church. Because as it turns out, we're building, oh yeah, a people. For God's own possession, Peter called these people living stones. So these living stones are a people who as they individually grow and are built up, are actually then fitted together. And as they're fitted together, they, we are actually becoming. This is bizarre. I love this. We are becoming the dwelling place of God in the Spirit, says verse 22. We're actually growing into becoming a holy temple in the Lord, verse 21. But we're a temple not made with human hands. We're a temple made up of living stones. It stirs up all sorts of pictures for me. One that came to me while I was writing this this week was a fascinating picture of this. Because now just kind of picture yourself. I just volunteered to work in a nursery. I just volunteered to work with the kids. I'm going to be a mentor in Next Gen. And I love that. But now just add this. Add this to what you just said yes to. Because when you hold a baby in the nursery and you mentor a student and you work with some kids, then 10-year-olds and 8-year-olds and whatever-year-olds, you wonder if they're getting anything you're getting. They're not just a kid and they're not just a baby and they're not just a student. They are all that. They are living stones. They are living stones. And it matters that they grow. Because we're building something. We're building a dwelling of God. Really. So it's not just, no, it's not just, it's bigger, it's better, it's richer. Living stones. Living stones who when they do in fact get built up and not all do, but when they are built up, when they're nurtured and cared for and taught, they will do what living things do. what living stones do they will grow and then as they continue to grow in I don't know the grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ and are then fitted together as a spiritual house says 1 Peter 2 what happens is this that the whole building grows thus providing more and more space as I've already said for the dwelling of God for the life of God for the fullness of God, for the power and kingdom, for the moving of God among his people. And the reason God's moving is because living stones grew and they were fitted together with other living stones and it created a building, this dwelling place of God where God was free to be God. Which puts a whole new spin, at least it does for me. I think you can see this. Puts a whole new spin on a question that we sometimes ask and I get asked it from time to time, how's the church going? Is it growing? And I often get asked that question by people who I haven't been with for a while. I was at Bethel football game a couple of weeks ago and at those places, at games like that, I always run into people I went to school with, played ball with, stuff like that, and we're kind of catching up. And invariably, they ask this question because they knew me in school and they're still kind of reeling from the fact that I'm in the ministry at all Yeah, I know. There must be a God. Anyway, how's your church? How's it going? Are you growing? That's a legitimate question. We're making conversation here. We don't get all theological on them. But I don't always know how to answer that because I can't always tell how it's going, how it's growing. So let me spin it this way. Let me ask you. What do you think? are we growing are you as as a living stone who has been made alive in christ are you becoming more and more alive in christ are you growing do you as an individual as a living stone do we it's a bigger question because this isn't just about you and it's about we do we as a people made up of living stones, and this is the way you can determine this, or at least think about it, do we have an ever-increasing capacity? Are we experiencing this as a people? An ever-increasing capacity, more and more room for the life of God, for the breath of God, for the fullness of God, for the power of God, for the voice of God, for the kingdom of God, for the moving of God among so how's the church and is it growing are we growing in the grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ are we learning how to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God are we submitting one to another in the fear of Christ are we willing to enter into and be honest about those things that need to be laid aside my anger and my malice and clamor and slander? Are we willing to be honest with each other even about what needs to be put on because I don't wear humility well or compassion or kindness or love? Are we honest with each other about what needs to be pressed into because some things in us really need to be put to death like immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed? Are we honest with each other about those kinds of things that actually need to die for us to become fully alive? And are we expanding in our capacity to love like a flawed human being, like the person we married may be? And to forgive, are we learning to serve even when the water is bitter? Remember that last week we talked about the people of God? There's stories so much like ours in the book of the Exodus, when the water is bitter and the manna is boring and the leaders are stupid and the people are prickly. Are we learning to forgive and to serve and to love? So I'm telling you, it's a really good question. Are we growing? It really is a very good question. But as I asked the question and as I posed the question, I did it on purpose because I know that that's not what people are actually asking me. When they're asking me, how's the church, is it growing? Because generally what they're asking is about size. It's about numbers because we're obsessed with numbers, so are you growing that way is the question of the day. It's the real question at times for some. David Fitch in his book entitled The Great Giveaway says this about that. David is a pastor of a church in the area, in Chicago area. says this, that over my years in ministry, whenever I get together with other evangelical pastors and denominational leaders, we inevitably talk about numbers. We just can't help it. It isn't evil. We just can't help it. No matter how hard we try, we simply can't avoid it. It's just too simple a way to measure success. Numbers there? Okay, good. We know. You don't need to tell me anything more about your story. I know that. I know what's going on. But even as I say it that way, his warning is clear because those numbers can deceive and mislead and often they do because numbers alone, he says, don't reveal. This is kind of obvious. They don't reveal how people are actually being formed, how they're growing, maturing, and becoming. They just don't and this is regrettable, he says. And this is where it gets like it has an edge to it. It is regrettable particularly, he says, when you consider the proliferation of statistical data purporting that evangelical churches, despite growing numbers, show a constituency with higher rates of divorce, higher levels of materialism, more ministers having extramarital affairs, and a general lack of any real effect on their immediate surrounding culture. He called it a general lack of any real effect on the surrounding culture. So maybe this question is a good one. And we need to ask it. So how's the church? Is it growing? Are we growing? Not just numerically, though that matters. It tells us something. But I mean as living stones, are we growing into? Are we becoming a house? Are we becoming a spiritual house, a dwelling place of God, a holy temple in the Lord? Is the whole building growing? A very important question to ask. Ephesians 3 verse 21. Because as the whole building is growing, it provides more and more room, more and more space for the life of God, the fullness of God, the power of God, the reality of God, the breath of God, the kingdom of God. Because we are the dwelling place of God. It's not this room. We are the dwelling place of God. And that is who we are. A temple not made with hands, made up of living stones, so are we growing. Are you growing? Having been raised up with Christ, you are alive. Are you becoming more and more alive? Which makes our mission statement much more than a slogan. This is like life and death to me. Are you becoming fully alive, a living stone that if you are alive needs to grow? That's what living things do. So are you. are we? Back to David Fitch, because into that he says, the problem is that we are irresistibly drawn to big. As attendance at megachurch seminars of all shapes and sizes indicates, it's always the biggest churches that get the attention, so inevitably we ask, how did they do it? What is their secret? How can we model and duplicate their success? Mike Lucan, in a book he wrote with our friend Carlson Kent, who was here this summer, is a friend of our church. And I think you felt that when he was here. He met with our elders and our lead team and me. He's nice to me. I'm easy. That's all you got to do. Mike and Kent wrote this book called The Renovation of the Church that all of our elders and most of our staff have read. And it kind of wrecked us in terms of, in a really good way, making us think about this kind of thing. Mike says this. Periodically, a list of the fastest growing churches in America is published. I suspect America is one of the few places in the world where fastest growing is the unquestioned metrics of success. If the attendance graph is steadily going up, then God must be on the move. If the attendance graph is steadily going down, then we must be doing something wrong. The leaders of the fastest growing churches are the ones invited to speak at conferences. They are the ones we want to hear from. They are the ones who have figured something out that the rest of us need to discover. But, he then says, and this is true, there's a growing, this is a growing thing that I'm about to describe through Mike's words. A growing number of these same successful leaders are beginning to recognize something. And it really is all over the place. I talk to people all the time about this, and it's this, that some of this church growth success that many of us have experienced has been largely superficial, and that it's time to introduce the harder edges of the gospel, but how, Mike asks. How do you get comfortable people to listen to a gospel that might include suffering, that might not be comfortable? How do you deepen discipleship without introducing despair? How do you call for discipleship and insist on things like fidelity to God, faithfulness to God, without becoming legalistic. But most important, Mike says, and this is speaking as a pastor who lives in the real world. How do we manage the loss of attenders? Because that will happen indeed, he says, the more clearly you teach the ways of Jesus, the smaller the church may actually grow. The smaller the church, whoa, this is weird, may actually grow. So, this is not for the faint of heart, Mike says. Evangelicals have become unmatched experts in organizing church growth, but often end up with a truncated gospel if we are to live into the full counsel of God in the years to come for the next generation. I believe, says Mike, we'll need to find a few experts in the art of church shrink. Hmm. Ooh. but come with me here now think think think think what if in the shrinking of the church the church made up of living stones who are in fact being built up and not all but let's just pretend they're being built up actually what if this church shrunk actually begins to grow into and to become a house, a spiritual house, a dwelling place of God, a temple not made with hands made up of living stones who themselves are growing, who themselves are becoming fully alive by putting off some things and putting on some things and doing it in community and being honest about the things that need to be put to death for other things to come to life because if that is happening, what happens is the whole building is growing but it isn't this building you gotta see this other thing and it kind of takes imagination and eyes that can see into things of the spirit and as the whole building is growing and we're that thing that is the building this house what it's doing without us knowing is it's creating more and more room for the dwelling of God, for the life of God, for the breath of God, the power of God, the kingdom of God. Right? Among us. And that can happen in a city, in a nation, and it can happen in the world. One more picture. To leave you, I got the temple thing, and maybe, I hope you think about it all day. I mean, it's just, wow, wow, wow, if that means that, it means that. Keep thinking like that. But let me move to another metaphor. Because Paul switches metaphors in Ephesians 4. In Ephesians 2 he's talking about us as a temple. It's who we are, living stones. But in Ephesians 4 he changes the metaphor from a temple made up of living stones to what you know is a body. We hear that one a lot. A body also made up of living things that just like living stones are being fitted and held together. It says verse 16 of Ephesians 4. Verse 16, Ephesians 4, you'll see it on the screen. We're fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies according to the proper working of each individual part. And the proper working of each individual part is not us programming this well. The proper working of each individual part is that each individual part really is beginning, entering into this process of transformation. And as you enter into the process of transformation, becoming more and more who God made you to be, fully alive, That is the proper working of each individual part. And as that happens, it actually causes, look at the rest of that verse, it actually causes the growth of the body. For the building up of itself in love. And as a result, says verse 14, this amazing thing happens. You know, I just kind of thought, it could never happen. We're no longer children. Are you kidding? Really? We're no longer children. I mean, my mind just goes, and I love the church. I love the church. I grew up in the church. Immature, selfish. We're all going to heaven? Wow. What a baby. Oh, my goodness. And it says, it says, they're no longer children. No longer tossed here and there by waves, and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by the craftiness of deceitful scheming, by the trickery of men and women, by the way. I hate this sexist Bible. Anyway, yeah, women are doing it too. So anyway, but guess what I love, here's what I love, the very next verse. Guess what has the capacity to expose this craftiness and deceitful scheming? What has the power to kind of dispel the fog of that verse 15, speaking the truth in love is what does it? Yeah, it does. Have you ever experienced that, the truth in love? Because we've a lot experienced truth without love, and some of you have experienced love, which is just so wonderful, but nobody ever tells you the truth, so guess what? You never grow up. If you ever have actually spoken the truth in love to someone, you'll know that it's one of the most vulnerable things you've ever done because especially if something needs to be confronted because you're going to say something that usually you don't say until you're angry enough, which means you let go of love. You're tracking with me, are you? And then you know, I mean, it's the truth. But you didn't hang on to love. If you ever held on to love and said, you know, here's how I experience you. Because, I mean, you're, so, because that's hard to do. Because they could just fillet you. speaking the truth in love because apparently you need both of those things to pull this off so in your strong declaration of the truth which evangelicals are really into truth okay fine I know you got to hang on to love and in your passionate embrace of love problem is I just love you I just can't tell them then you're you're no help at all you're no help at all at Open Door here we call this the third way it's kind of a big deal it's kind of part of who we want to be as a church and the reason we want to be it is because truth without love you know it's like a broad sword and I use it to cut people in half, I use it to win and you know what that feels like but love without truth is mush, it's mush and it's the kind of mush that never provides the kind of strength that you and I need to stand in the evil day and guess what that's the day that we live in right now but guess what happens when you learn how to do this and it's not easy to learn how to do it it's not automatic at all this takes practice and guts but guess what happens when people learn how to combine both truth and love, verse 15 says, rest of verse 15 says, it's amazing, people actually grow up. Who knew that that could happen in a church? Because somebody with incredible love for this person said, oh man, I do love you, but you are so selfish. And or whatever. And if people can receive that because they really are wanting to lay aside what needs to be laid aside and put on, what needs to be put on and put to death, what needs to be put to death so they can fully come alive, you receive that. Guess what happens, people? They really do grow up. Rest of the verse. Grow up in all aspects into him who is the head, even Christ, So here's the picture. This time not a temple, but a body. A body that is being built up and equipped. And by their being built up and equipped, becoming fully alive, is beginning to grow. This body is beginning to gain strength into a mature person is what the verse earlier said. and what we grow into as each individual stone begins to grow up, what we grow into, it says in verse 13, I love that, look at this. What happens is we grow into the measure of the stature that belongs to the fullness of Christ. I can't hardly get my head around that. As each living stone begins more and more to come alive by putting aside and laying aside and putting on and putting to death. Not me. This is not me becoming like Christ. It's we, as we do, that we grow into the measure of the stature that belongs to the fullness of Christ. Think about the fullness of Christ. It simply means who he actually is in his fullness, not a distortion of Christ. And the fullness of Christ is being made visible in the world through an organization well run organizations need to be well run I'm not demonizing that it's made visible this Christ reality through a people not just an audience but a people a people that Peter identifies as living stones who as they grow are actually becoming a dwelling place of God. They're actually growing into a house, a spiritual house, a holy temple, a temple not made with hands, made up of living stones, living stones who actually grow. I mean, picture physically, I physically embody. I mean, it's so weird, I can see one coming out of our stupid building here. This building is not it. But what if there was this body that was growing into the measure of the stature that belongs to the fullness of Christ so that now his body, who he actually is, is being made visible. Really? Yeah. In the world. Through a people who are his church because they actually grew into the dwelling place of God and that is who we are. and that is why we're here to try and grow that and we don't always do it but that is why we're here and that is why we're doing what we're doing and trying to do what we do and that is why we have this goofy mission statement it's kind of cool actually I mean everybody I've given it to That's the best one I've ever heard. Great. But it has the gall to invite people into a struggle. Because we think it is a struggle to lay aside and put on and put to death. We don't think that's easy. So to invite people into the struggle of becoming fully alive in God, that's why we have that mission statement. Because all the stuff I'm saying today, we believe it. Because it's why we're here. It's why we do what we do. Our purpose for existence. It's why our purpose, actually, as a church. And by the way, this time I actually do mean our church as an organization that calls itself a church. Church of the open door. Church of the open door. Our particular purpose for existing is to become a community of people. And you know our purpose. We've memorized it, I hope. I don't care. To become a community of people who have a radical commitment to spiritual formation for three reasons. The glory of God. The abundance of our own lives. And for the sake of the world. And I know that it's grandiose to think. That what we do here. And how we live here. Could affect the world. But what if we believed. That living stones like you and like me. Ordinary people stone. You're just a stone. Seriously. How insignificant is that? That ordinary stones. Living stones like you and me. who have indeed been made alive by Christ. You have been raised with Christ. The stones that are being built up and becoming fully alive together, who would have thought that we could grow into a house? I'm not talking about this one. A spiritual house. Who would have thought we would grow into a dwelling place of God, a temple not made with hands, made up of living stones, and that is who we are. Who are we is the question of the day. That is who we are, and that is who we are becoming. That is who we want to ever be becoming, and that is why we want you to join us, all of you. Paul said it this way to the church in Philippi. You guys, you need to work out your salvation with fear and trembling. What he meant by that, I've done this verse with you before, this salvation that's already come to you, it's not working for your salvation. This life, this life that's come to you, you need to work. You need to work at getting that life in you out here where people can see it. In fact, you need to be a little bit afraid of not doing that, of not becoming a living stone that's becoming fully alive. You should be a little afraid of not doing that. Why? two verses later because in a crooked and perverse generation, people who actually are becoming fully alive, they are working out into their living where people can see the life of God they have. People like that are a crooked and perverse generation's only possible hope of ever seeing the light of who God Jesus really is and that is who we are and that is why we're here. Why don't you stand with me as we close? Living stones is who we are. Living stones is who we are. Raised up with Christ are we. We've been made alive in Christ. Give us the courage first of all. And this would, I guess, be individually, yes, to be honest about, to lean into those things that need to be laid aside, put on, and put to death so that we can become individually full of life and then fitted together. Would we be as our request, God, by your spirit, fit us together into a building that is actually growing into, as every one of us continue to grow, growing into this dwelling place of God, creating more and more room for God becoming a body that is actually demonstrating the full stature of the measure of the fullness that belongs to Christ and all these things we pray Holy Spirit come all these things we pray in Jesus name and all the living stones said Amen God bless you as you leave you are dismissed Thank you.
