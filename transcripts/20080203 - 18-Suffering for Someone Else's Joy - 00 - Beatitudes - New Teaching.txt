Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community. Father, that we would be able to hear your voice and experience your presence through the ministry of the word and through the ministry of worship, but more particularly this morning through the ministry of your table. As we come, your people to the table, this precious and powerful reminder of who you are and all you've done, help us to get maybe even quiet enough on the inside to hear your voice and experience your real presence in this place and at the table. I pray in Jesus' name, amen. Last week, as most of you know, in the broader context of this eighth beatitude, which we've been in for about four weeks now, where Jesus is making it clear to his fresh-faced, eager-to-please young disciples that among the things they should actually expect, if they were serious about following his way of living and loving and being, was suffering and pain, persecution as well. We press past noticing the inevitability of all that to noticing and then being intrigued by even struggling with this apparent connection that Jesus makes between suffering and joy. Because there it is, Matthew 5 verse 12, rejoice and be glad when you're persecuted for righteousness sake, when people cast insults at you and lie about you, saying all kinds of evil things about you falsely on account of me rejoice and be glad. My first reaction, remember last week? No. You can't make me. It isn't normal. It isn't real. It isn't possible. But part of the problem with my resistance to this, and ours as well, is that Jesus isn't the only one who presses this theme, who makes this connection between suffering and joy. Indeed, James, in the epistle that bears his name, we talked about this last week as well reiterates this same theme that Jesus began in Matthew 5 verse 12 when in James 1 verse 2 he says to a group of people who knew a little something about suffering and loss, disappointment and pain, persecution as well identified by James in verse 1 of his epistle, chapter 1, as being the dispersed ones. They were the scattered ones, a lot like the people we met a couple of weeks ago in Acts chapter 8, who under this great persecution were driven from Jerusalem, driven from their homes. It is two people like that that James is writing these words. They'd lost it all. First thing he says to them is this, consider it all, all of this pain you're in, joy. Rejoice and be glad. A ludicrous thought to us, but not to them. Primarily because, and this was the sermon last week, there were some things they saw and knew, allowed and valued, that sometimes we can't see and don't know, won't allow, and don't value. Indeed, that was the way I put it together. if we ever hope to make this biblical connection, understand it, hopefully even experience this connection between suffering and joy, there's some things we're going to need to see and know. Allow and value. James put it this way. James 1 verse 2. Consider it all joy, my brother, and when, not if, but when, you encounter various trials, knowing. Because there are some things you need to know. And what you need to know is this. that the testing of your faith produces something. In this case, what it produces is endurance. And if you let endurance have its perfect result, if you allow this painful thing to run its course, if you don't abort it, run through it, press through it instead, it will have a... and let endurance have its perfect results. It can produce in you a strength of character such that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing, which does not mean sinless perfection. Again, reiterated, we're reiterating what I said last week. But to someone who is fully grown, well-rounded and whole with all the necessary parts to do life and handle adversity. But if you don't value the product that these various trials and sufferings have the potential to produce in you, like character and endurance, integrity and depth, then you'll never understand, much less experience, this biblical connection between suffering and joy, all of which is why I'm not sure it's wise to do what I want to do today, but I'm going to do it anyway. And that is to take this whole thing and push it even further, maybe beyond credulity, as I ask you to wonder with me about this. actually moving beyond simply enduring suffering and considering it joy to choosing suffering for someone else's joy. Let me say it this way, before your eyes glaze over and I lose you altogether, because what I'm talking about is actually not as foreign or bizarre as you might think on the front end. I'm not talking about some bizarre masochism here. indeed what I'm talking about is simply choosing to do something for which you may pay a price. You might suffer. Something that you would choose to do so that someone else might be benefited, that someone else might experience joy, something that you might choose to do, indeed a way that you might choose to live so that someone else might be healed or helped, housed or fed, maybe closed or encouraged, given hope just in the nick of time, or maybe even redeemed. There's a name for this. I didn't make this up. It's called redemptive suffering. It's embodied clearly in Christ, who for the joy set before him, Hebrews 12, verse 2, endured the cross. It was for joy. He endured the suffering of the cross, which means he chose suffering for joy, but not his own. He chose it for ours, for you, and for me, thus establishing a pattern into which we have been called as followers of this rabbi's way of living and loving. Paul said it this way, indicating that he got it. In Philippians 2, verse 5, to followers of Jesus, he says this. Here's the deal. We need to have a different attitude. indeed have this attitude in you, which was also in Christ, who, although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be held on to, a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself, which meant, among other things, in the emptying of himself that he would suffer, to the point even of becoming obedient unto death, even death on the cross. And then in Philippians chapter 3, verse 10, Paul reveals that on a very personal level, he's embraced this fully in his life as he identifies the overriding passion of his life. Philippians 3 verse 10, it's this, here's what I want more than anything that I might know him in an intimate kind of knowing, but let me just dress that out. What I want to taste in this life is the power of his resurrection, but also a passion to experience the fellowship of his sufferings, which just sounds weird. And not just the sufferings that came to Paul, like they come to everyone, because life is hard and evolving various trials, which we talked about a lot last week, but sufferings that came to him because he chose to do a certain thing, to live a certain way for someone else's joy, so that someone else could be healed and helped and housed and fed and encouraged and given hope and maybe even redeemed. The fellowship of his sufferings. Word about the fellowship of his sufferings because, again, like a lot of things in Scripture that we hear maybe and even become familiar with but don't really get what they mean, this is one of those words or phrases that feels a bit inaccessible and weird, but it isn't. It really isn't. In fact, at a very human level, I think we understand this better than we know because the fellowship simply refers to a group of people, take it away from this suffering thing, a fellowship refers to a group of people who, because of shared experiences and common passions, are in the fellowship. I wouldn't want to use the word club. It's something to me more reverent than that. It's a fellowship. It's something that, because we have the same passion and have the same experiences, we know this thing. We've experienced this thing together, and that's the fellowship. Let me explain it on a level that I can understand. Sometimes at the halftime of football games, they'll have the ceremony honoring a group of old players who symbolize an era of excellence or success. Sometimes at the halftime of Viking games, they bring out these players who played in the Super Bowl, didn't win it, but they played in it. And those old veterans, you know what they look like? You can picture it in your mind. You don't even know who they are. You know who they are. But they're in a fellowship. They have a fellowship. And in the fellowship, among those guys, there is a knowing of what they did and what it cost them to do what they did that others can only look at and admire because they don't know. You see it in the military, too. There's this knowing of men and women who've gone through something and they know this thing that others just don't know. And when the fellowship gathers, if you can loosen them up a little bit, they start to talk, and what they talk about is they sit around together and tell stories of what it felt like to play that game and what it cost them to play that game. And if you didn't play, if you didn't go, if you didn't experience what they experienced, then you have no stories to tell. You might admire them. You might even cheer for them. But you don't know. See, here's the deal, and it may sound weird at first when I say this as I bring it back to this fellowship of suffering, but the only opportunity that any of us will ever have to willingly choose suffering for someone else's joy, for someone else's healing, housing, hope-giving, redeeming, is this side of eternity. Because on the other side of eternity, obviously, no more suffering. not even for joy, but there will be a fellowship on the other side. A fellowship, in fact, now I would just encourage you to open your mind and your heart to what I would call a sanctified imagination as you can just wonder what it will be like in that day, because there will be a fellowship of ordinary men and women just like you and just like me, who in a variety of ways, in their marriages, and in their families, in their communities, in their friendships, in the context of their workplace, said, I will go further, and I'm going to give more, and I will serve again, and I'm just going to care. And you maybe wouldn't use the word suffer, but in ways you have a tendency to discount. You did suffer so that someone else could be benefited, so that someone else could have joy and help and hope and healing. It's a fellowship of people who know because they did it. The Apostle Paul will be in the fellowship, but many of you will be as well. And in the fellowship, you'll be doing what people who are in the fellowship do, if you can loosen them up a little bit, Like old army buddies who went through the war, will start to tell stories of the things you suffered. But it was all for joy. And not all yours until you sense it now. But like a lot of old army buddies, most of you will be too shy to tell your story. With a tendency to discount any sacrifice that you made, tending to look at everyone else, go, no, they did, but I didn't. I'm just going to shut up about mine. So we'll tell stories about each other. Because we were there and we saw. See, I was there and I saw in this community of faith how much it costs some of you to stay in that marriage. So I was there and I saw how much it costs some of you to raise that child who was sick from the very first day he was born. And I was there and we were there in this community of doing our life together. And we saw how much it costs you to care for that aging parent. That aging parent where so strangely did not handle it because the roles were reversed. Because now you, and this is indelicate, but it's just the life that we enter into at times. Because now you're changing their diapers. And they're not very grateful. But we saw how you pressed through that and you stayed. See, we were there and we saw how much it cost you to love that neighbor. And work with those kids for all those years and every once in a while you saved one. see we were there and we saw how much it cost you to love that person who never loved you back but you kept praying for them and blessing them and sometimes even from afar you were learning to love an enemy we watched you do that see I think of parents and teachers of coaches and counselors of just people ordinary people like you and like me who often at great personal expense literally give themselves away in trying to create environments where other people can live and learn and grow and succeed and sometimes provide just a glimmer of hope. Remember last week this verse I read that sounded so weird because it is weird until you unlock this treasure of redemptive suffering. Philippians 1.29, Paul says, for to you it has been granted. Remember this? This wonderful privilege. It's been granted to you. We had to get special permission, but it's been granted to not only believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake. So weird. Just so strange. but can you smell it? Can you just, can you just smell it? Because it smells really good. And here's the deal. If you can't smell this, God can. A fragrant aroma to him. Happens in ways that I think are broader and more realistic to us than we know. One day, an angel came to a young girl named Mary and said to her these words, familiar to us, Blessed are you, young lady. Blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. For to you it has been granted to have the life of God come to you. And kind of in your imagination here as you apply this and hear this, see it coming to her physically, but also the spiritual analogy as well, to have the life of God come to you, be planted inside of you, begin to grow in you, stretch and scare you, and then come from you. But Mary, you will suffer if you receive this life. Because this life in you will stretch you. Again, physically it would, but spiritually as well. This life in you will change you and mark you and scare you and hurt you, sometimes embarrass you. It might, in a very human way, cause Joseph to leave you. It didn't, but it might. Her response? It was a kingdom response. It's been the response of many, many people who follow the rabbi's way for centuries since and even before. Here's what she said, be it done unto me. just like you said she chose suffering for joy but not just her own joy she's in the fellowship I'm pretty sure she's going to have some stories to tell we'll probably have to pull them out of her come on Mary tell us indeed it was because of her personal yes to God I will receive this life and bear the ridicule if there is any. It's because she said yes to God that we get this thing, joy to the world. The Lord has come. But here's the deal. We have some stories to tell too. You do too. Though many of you discount those stories. I think it's important today, this morning, even if you can only do it for a few minutes, that you don't discount this. indeed I think it's important today as we come to the table that you allow yourselves to hear um three very powerful words that we've been hearing over and over again in these beatitudes blessed are you it's our desire this morning as you come to the table that whatever else you hear you hear this blessed are you but then even as you hear those words from Jesus to you blessed are you, begin to wonder, begin to wonder, what would I be willing to suffer today, next week, as a way of life for someone else's joy. You know, sometimes in our announcements here at church, among the things we announce would be calls for people to serve in areas of ministry need here at church. And you always respond, we tell you we need some help here, we need some help here, people always respond. But it's weird because we almost always try to sell it a little bit. Kind of try to make it look really like it'd be a lot of fun if you would work with our kids and clean up their poop. You know, stuff like that. It's just so much fun. It'll be a blessing to you and it's true. It will be a blessing to you. I can't believe I said that. Anyway, anyway. And we'll have testimonies. I mean, we've had videos with people wanting to be involved in various ministries, and I think it's a good idea. And you'll hear them say, man, it was such an incredible experience for me. And that's the blessed are you part. There is a blessing. So we're not going to stop saying that because it's true. But what if we changed all that? I mean, I don't know what other church we could do it in, but maybe we could do it. I don't know if we will. But what if we changed all that such that the appeal became, here's some, you know what? We have four opportunities to suffer this week. Sign up sheets are in the gathering place. A little sign, Opportunities to suffer. Big banner and sign-up sheets right there. A more serious note. We really need, and I don't mean to run our programs. This is a kingdom thing. We really need people who'd be willing to suffer for other people's joy. We really need some people so committed to follow the rabbi's way, so full of the Spirit of God that they'd be willing to suffer for other people's healing and other people's help and other people's hope and other people's housing and other people's redemption. But who would live like that? And if we wanted to live like that, how would we learn? Well, maybe we'd learn by following the way of our Rabbi Jesus. who for the joy set before him endured the cross. He chose suffering for joy and not just his own. And it's all right here at the table. Everything I just spoke of is at this. The bread is his body broken. The cup is his blood that was shed. So this morning as you take the bread and you take the cup, remember that his suffering was for our joy. And as you take this, do two things. Number one, let it bless you. Blessed are you. And let it call you to live a different way. Let's go to the table. Thank you.
