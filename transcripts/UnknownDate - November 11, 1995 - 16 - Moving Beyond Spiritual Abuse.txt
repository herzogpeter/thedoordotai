My name is Mark Matthew, and I'm a good friend of mine, and I'm a family therapist. The topic of this afternoon is really beyond spiritual use. In this seminar, we're not going to talk about the last things. We've got the last thing in the day of this life. We're not going to talk as much about the details of spiritual use. We're going to talk a little bit more about spiritual use. We're not going to talk about the layers that people have put us. And look at us. We hope today we're going to talk about ways that we can move beyond those experiences. Not because we're going to see this, but because we honor these experiences. And the impact of this that is, the feeling that we've had up to this point already. It's like meeting an abusive family, like you said, dysfunctional family, and then spending the rest of our lives trying to figure out what was wrong with that family. That works for a while. It's about a dozen books and maybe a couple of support groups. But after a while, it's kind of boring. It's necessary to help him. But it actually will say, no one. It really was in the past. And I really want to see if those experiences are not tied to those experiences. Now, if someone tells you that too early, hey, that was in the past, just move on, it sounds like abuse all over again. As I said, life experience wasn't all that important. But several years down the road, after you've read the books, you've talked to a therapist, you've talked to some friends, and tried to worship in another church or two or three years, then you realize, you know what, I've gone through this feeling, reacting, growing, feeling conscious, and now, really, I do want to let go of some things in the past. And yet, I'm not avoiding it, but having faced it, I'm ready to let go and actually move on to the future. Some of you may not hear that, but I'm not sure. Although, when you come into this seminar, So, take everything I say and get it from you. It's not the time. I don't understand why it's not. I had the first hand out of the people who are standing outside. From the Senate, I want to speak out to you. Thank you. this subtle parable of what the church is like. And he did by comparing what he called settler and pioneer kind of theology. And the settlers are the ones who are the institutional people. The ones who said, this is the place, this house, here's the Muslim world, here's how we act, this woman's better not fit in. Don't make those known form. That sounds familiar to some of us. The pioneers, however, were the ones who were saying, you know what, spiritual life is a lot more dynamic than the site of the night. It's not boring, and it's human in Christianity, it's not conformity, it's the spirit of how I live and how I live in my life. So he took some basic theological, basically, there's a Baptist theology, and so I think there's a church. In the central theology, it's like the church, it's a place where the laws are closed, the laws are dismissed, and we are told what's right and what's wrong, and we are charged and we are criticized, and we measure up and we understand standards and stuff. It's a symbol of security, law and murder, and this is not law and murder. In the pioneer theology, This is the movement, this dynamic theology, though, that the church of Mark, of inviting you, you know, on the road. And this image of Christianity, the relationship of God being a change, is a student called God. It's really a role for this on the field. It's not static, it's not always changing. It's not a destination, it's moving to life. It's a process of moving to life, finding that God is with us. So it's a house on the moon. There's some marks of life that creeps. You're scarred with arrow marks and bandages. You feel like the covered wagon is only the reaction is. If you are bored of your face, you're probably in a wrong place. The sand is absolutely nothing more. Sometimes it's angry. Sometimes it's frustrating. Sometimes it's exciting. Sometimes it's confusing. Sometimes it's so much. So, a covered leg. In some of the theology, God is like a mare. He smokes big scars, and he's comfortable. He's always stuck a chair in the Lord's office. You know, this kind of bigger-than-life, unapproachable kind of person. That's what God is. Some people find it. No one dares approach Him. People fear Him, Christ, and control them. is that everything in the image of God kind of distant, unapproachable, controlling, he has the last say in everything, and we don't have anything in the image. The same was the answer. That's the institution of the second reality. The final reality of the most is when God has a cell box, God on the move with us, rock and rock and fall out life. He lives and fights with his people. He works with. his people. Without him, the pioneers become fabulous. He often gets down in the mud of the pioneers to help push the light and he's brought up. Very, very much interaction, working together with God is involved in our lives and is involved with him. What is Jesus Christ? Well, several theologies used to share him. He enforces the rules. Where's a white hat and all these outdoors and bad guys? He also decides to this king of the jail. You know, you don' keep the rules and the punishment in the night of the jail. In the pioneer theology where Jesus is more on the scout, he writes, he writes, he writes, he writes, he writes, he writes, he writes, he writes, he doesn't ask the players what he did first. He knows why he's in his life. Who's a Christian? Assembly of theology, their concern is to stay on the issue of the law. We tend to small garden. They and the small garden, their model is the same. And then the courthouse is somewhat secure. And the court is not my case. Life has just been in my corner. I've been in seeing things. This works for the last 20 years, and I work for the next 20 years. It's a lot of new ways in these typical cultures. Let's not disagree with this. That was the thing. In higher theology, Christian dialogue, there's a lot of people who are listening. They're hungry for adventure. They're like, they're tough, right? Tough, you know how to handle themselves.... Thank you.. I know. I'm going to turn back. Just say, no, people are a huge one. Someone has written me enough that I'm just going to be left on this. I need to answer the answers. Maybe someone else is asking for telling me whether or not I'm going to be a problem. It's a problem. So keep that in mind. I'm just somewhere in the corner. I suspect some of the places that you come from, the people and the staff and the leaders, actually, by the subject, the artist of yours and others of your community, they're going to be able to do something else. They need it because they're just going to be able to do something else. Actually, what's needed is not to get back to that. I've lost a lot already anyway, so I may as well just be asked. But I'm not being settled in the moment. I'm not being settled in the moment. I'm not being settled in the moment. That's kind of my second. It's kind of my second. It's impossible for us to actually move into the future. I'm down by the past. I'm just going to be fast. My style of doing is really isn't just a lot of time. Even though some of you are listening to this on the table, you guys are seeing what you're doing. Now, I'd still invite those people to ask them to ask a question. Which time you're going to tell a story or whatever you'd like to do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. affirmations yeah there's things that have to there are things I want to let go of I'm just going to so much there's always a center in my mind and actually I want to continue to let go of those things and say well if I'm going to let go of those things then what am I going to do and that's what the other is things I want to do before affirmations I want to do before The first one, I want to let go of having a blind loyalty. A blind loyalty is, you know, you say, I'm loyal, and you're not disordered, and you're never speaking loyal, and you're always, you're wrong with what any other person says. So, is there a good time in the world? That's a good one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And some of them are being seen as difficult as they say. And if you can't do that in any place, then you may decide if you're seeing things like that. Some of us, as a kid, ask a message because we expect that kind of response. Thank you. So what we do is move toward, and I think it's all at once, and I think it's a change from one way of being free, and eventually all of a sudden it starts to be different. It's not a case. It's not a case. But it's a process of moving toward thinking about ourselves. Not in a selfish way, not in a stubborn way, not in a criticizing, sarcastic way, Thank you. Not saying, you know, the Bible says that one of you is God. You know, yes, Jesus Christ. God, you can't believe in God. It's supposed to be God. You know, God, you're not. You know, God, you're not. Our conscience, God's spirit speaking to us, is exactly right. Amen. So we take responsibility, we take for ourselves, we make decisions, and so on. You know, this functional family, you know, all the literature says, you've got to find your personal fear. And in a functional healthy system, you can find everything you can learn and trust. You can wonder, question, and come back to disagree. and respect and love. We don't have to focus on what we want. So let's go blind loyalty. We'll start thinking for ourselves and deciding something about responsibility. And secondly, we'll move away from the anger and the blame and the focus on that judgment. We'll move forward taking responsibility for our choices and actions. The name is about intimacy. It's about you and what time you're going to do in that place. Now, what words would you describe in a Christian here? You're a Christian. What words would you describe in a Christian? You're a Christian. In some words, like sad, I'm trying to put my word to be short. Self-centered, or sometimes self-impressive. I like to see it. You know, all those kinds of words you can use to say, I'm just going to use that as well. And this one's about all kinds of words. There's no kind of words that I'm just going to use. You can be angry at people. You can't be angry at a person. Because when we're angry at our church, or our denomination, or our community, our institutions, we're going to let it come and pay. We're going to have this new relationship. We can't talk to a church. We can't talk to a Christian. We can't hold a church now, but we're going to have a people. So eventually we have to identify how they're seriously treated. What people, what people do tonight? Thank you. is Thank you. We aren't born down here. We are now born here. We are now born here. It's not that we don't have a voice, we know we're seeing this. We are seeing the body in the future. We're seeing the crowd. We're seeing the crowd. The anger is a very important thing. But not to stay stuck, to stay tied to that anger. Thank you. Thank you. What has been going on? They say, well, just turn it on. Well, just move on. I mean, you've got to just look. Just, just, anytime someone gives you advice, you're just in front of them. Then I know that there's a different thing. They want to ignore something. If on the other hand, they say, well, yeah, something's going to happen. What's going to be a bad thing? How many of you have? Now, it's going to take a while, but God can heal these things, but that's going to be done. That kind of is the answer. When you say just do this and just do that, it probably isn't going to be something I'm going to do. So it needs to anger and blame it. It's a responsibility for Jesus and all the time. The first step is analyze the message. Thank you. I'm not going to miss you. Because if I can miss you, then I'm going to go down my feet. As a teacher or a leader or whatever. It's more of a team. I'm not even going to miss you. I want to just see it my way. This is where I have a monologue where I'm talking and you're listening as long as you're not going to get the next day. But if you start missing and questioning, Then I call you unspiritual. Then I say, you know what? Maybe it's not a way to do this. It's subtle and not too subtle. I say, no, I'll do the thing. I think you're listening. You do the performing and you're just canalizing. In contrast, I suggest you move toward developing a perspective. Recognizing that sometimes life is something. Sometimes I'm very sure. Thank you. I said, I'm not a college. Life is sometimes simple, sometimes complex. I don't know if you're in quotes. I'm not a person. I'm not a person. Life is a mystery to me. I'm not a problem. I'm not a person. I like that because I always see this life as a problem. What's my problem or what's my solution? How can I fix me? And I realized in a few years that, yeah, that's what I wanted to see. Life is something mysterious. God does sometimes see you in the same way. There are questions about God that, you know, there's anything you can do in the same way. Sometimes life is mysterious. And I'm 17, verse 11. Paul is talking about some people that he has to do. It's thinking of Michelin Jeremy. This is this town, this town, this town, that town, that town. One of the places he's into was in Korea. It makes the comment that these people here were more noble than those in Tesla night, which is the last place. It's because they've searched the scriptures in the area to find out whether it's in the center of the center. And to me, that says they not only give the light on a Bible site, But actually, we can check it out on the inside. All right, Paul, that's what you said. Now, they understand. They search this thing day by day. They find out whether or not they agree with them, whether or not they accept what they say. They don't themselves. They didn't just say, well, he's going to know the way down. I guess he must have. They're going to say, all right, you have your skills. You're going to push me in this. You're going to do it, guys. You're going to do it. Thank you. We need to develop a new cycle and somewhat disruptive from a new cycle of searching out to a certain decision of being a self. We can move away what we can self-doubt to. Some of us said yes to safety. If it was a risk to leave a place and put ourselves off by a certain decision or a certain person, there are moments, and then we can just show up on the morning where we can. Thank you. How could I cut myself off from that? Am I? Am I just going to know it's much better said? Maybe I'm going to know it's never easy to do. I don't know if I didn't know it. When it was a second-dance decision, it was always supposed to be a good thing. That's not a good thing. It's frustrating. It's frustrating. It's confusing. It's trying to do it. I didn't do it right. I didn't do it at the right time. I didn't do it in the right way. I couldn't set it better. I couldn't do it. I don't sell it so much. I don't do it right. I'm assuming it is me. Something with that is self-continuation. And this is why I showed myself that I didn't see you so long. You see, at one moment I could say, oh, maybe I shouldn't have left. And the other moment I'd say, oh, I don't know, you probably should have left. I can share, I can really create my eyes, I can say. Maybe you'd have to. Right, it's a lot. How can I then solve this one again? It's a good idea, value, gullible, passive, all those kinds of things. How can I make this happen? Well, as we let go of that self-planetation, we're going to have certain kind of self-excepts. In the present, in those sense of the past, in the present, I can learn to live inside the building. We want to get close to the building. Thank you. Again, the affirmations are really important. You're right. Sometimes for themselves, people are looking at the past and say, Oh, I'm in this picture. I said, well, I'm in this picture. I should have done this. I should have done that. And they always think of the changes. They're totally sure they're not even saying that. In spite of all this, I'm still here. In spite of all this, I still choose to be here. You can choose right now. In spite of all this, I have found some people that really didn't hear about it. And in spite of all this, you will still see something wrong. There's nothing here. You know, the Christ in the future, as you can see, I've been blessed with you, and I'm blessed with you, and I'm so glad to see you in this world. And I'm really glad to see you. You have a great day. And I have a sense of celebration, and I'll miss you in your future. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I want to show you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I find that it's a lot more energy when I'm able to do it. And I write it down, find it when I do that, I'm not just a lot of energy. When I say close, and because it's a good time, I'm going to just have to do it. But when I'm able to say it, I'm not going to ask a question to me. So I can use it for a week on a mobile system. I can take your shoes and get them from that. I can stay stuck in the past. But you can only see people in the cloud. One of the most I've ever seen is really, obviously, there's a part of the set of people who are not here. I'm sure she's saying that they're not here. They're not here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. When we're moving behind the stairs, we can go back to some of these things. And so when we're sitting by motion, five billion more people have a good feeling. And besides this time, we're sitting by the ocean. We see the wall of the ocean. We see things changing around us. It's hard to think in terms of denominations. It's hard to think in terms of labels that we often attach to worship or theology. It's easy, it's more natural to think in terms of, God, this is fantastic. This is beautiful. This is overwhelming. This is awesome. This is beyond me. You are beyond. You created this sound and reading and experience and wind and whatever, and worshiped one another. So a sense of awe and a sense of need. The second phase of a person's faith journey is a sense of belonging. We're not meant to be in relationship with God alone. We're meant to be in relationship with one another. to listen to that. Not to take away our individuals, but we want to do it, because we need one another. We are created to meet one another. We are created for one another. We find a group, we find a cause, we find someone to teach us, someone to help us, someone to encourage, someone to guide, and so on. We need to belong. This is just like the promised people, you know, the 60,000 men in one place. We belong together. This is great. It's the same feeling. About a half dozen of my friends come to the guys, live together almost every day in the class. Most days we talk about football, weather, and this and that. And everyone's going to have a conversation with us. Not often enough to provide questions that they don't understand. Because they know that it's interesting almost every day a few of the others can do that. They have the rules, they have the ways of doing things, they have the friendship that spans the decades. Every day, every day. Assess people on the unique part. The third stage in their journey is psychoship. This is where we are learning and doing. Learning and doing. Now, this is sometimes the place where spiritual peace comes out most clearly. Because as we're learning, someone else is teaching, and what they're teaching is their own thoughts, their own ideas, and they need us to do it then. And so forth. As we look for a mentor, for a guide, Sometimes it's a mentor who is abusive, is controlling, is manipulative. And so this is where it's, uh, if I'm going to go to church, I'm going to go to church. If I'm going to select someone to disciple or to mentor or to help me, how do I need you? I can trust you. And that's what you've been talking about this last couple of days. The fourth stage is a questioning stage. It's kind of like a liberalized crisis. It's kind of like a crisis in case. I've been in this in 35 years now. I wonder, just maybe. I mean, this is incredible. This is true. This is where I was a few years ago. I'm a musician. I was going to come back to the back. I was going to take me some counseling place. I was going to come back to the back. It wasn't from a spiritual, wonderful time of view, it was, you know, it was about reality, reality, and how you lost your world, it was really confusing, right? And I don't know if I knew or lost my faith, or if I actually found this, I could just have found it, like, before it was. It's more assured now. You know, I've started explaining all the things to you. But your questions make signs. So it's going through a kind of questioning. Are you too fast to come to set all the things that seem so safe and secure? They're all turning aside. It's not just stating the coming to the world. Those questions. Well, the challenge here is to say, once we're stuck in the past, we're going to save, we're going to save, we're going to save, we're going to move into the future. See the modern future. See how even the spiritual abuse fits into the timeline of your generation. Because God can redeem even those that are in the future. And even through the hurt, and the pain, and the bitterness, the betrayal, whatever it is, as your journey of faith goes on, can heal us, can hurt us, and then can move us in other people's lives. In a way that we probably couldn't have enough us to live in our lives. Thank you. Thank you. I don't see that. I couldn't actually believe that. I believe it's a good sense of isolation. For me, this is one of the most intense aspects of this. This thing, you know, I must be alone. I really don't think anyone else would understand what I have experienced. Therefore, I can't talk to them. Therefore, I don't know who I can bring on the subject, but I won't tell them what I have experienced. I must be alone. What must just be mean, God? Well, but I'm angry at God. Well, now I'm really alone. I not only can talk to people, I've got to treat God like it. If you feel alone, I treat him as if you didn't know it was in my heart. I didn't know if you had an awesome idea of this. I remember the experience I had when I was 46 this year. This was when I was about 22 years old, 21, 22 years old. I was in the backyard of my car. I'm in front of my car. It must have been about 11 times. I feel so still. And I remember looking at the stars. The stars from there have always been that kind of, oh, they represent God. They're so distant and so brilliant and so beautiful. and eating all the time. Here's my prayer. God, tell it all is a good deal. I am so sick and tired of trying to pay this group and that person and those people and this group. I don't know. I'm so sick of it all. You know, God, what I really want is no deal. And frankly, God, I don't even know what I'm going to do. I am so sick Yeah, I don't know. I suppose things won't change soon, but you know, someday eventually I want to be able to talk to you. Yeah, do you need to? It's not all of you. So that I can feel, yeah, I do what I ought to do. But here's my life. I haven't heard the peace. I don't know if those are the exact words I used, but that was some of it. You see the broader picture. not feeling as isolated what do you need to do? You need to make connections with other people. Scott Texts wrote community and all that control is a problem. He says the first step in having no community, meaning fellowship meaning being close to the people whatever discussion is the first step is being in a safe place where you can find it. If you don't have that, you probably won't have anything. and if you have that you have incredible potential to be understood and understanding and to move into heaven with faith a place to talk a place to tell the truth a place to say what's really on your mind without apology without embarrassment without judgment without criticism without sadness without forgiveness a place to say you know what you know what you need to know and then just what I am I need to say Here's how I feel about it, what you just said. I think I'm able to talk to you and listen. It's not that you're speaking. Isolation, moving away from the isolation, makes it anxious. Number nine, escaping the past. For some people, it's an all-nothing situation. And both extremes are way of trying to escape from the past instead of living in the past. And so if it's all for nothing, we want to either find a similar group, or we end up in a similar relationship, or we end up doing the same kind of things because we haven't changed either. But being one dysfunctional family for another dysfunctional family, because that's familiar, but we think some of our changing families might work. Leaving one church or group that's abusive and controlling and manipulative and shaming, and we go to another one, you think, well, these people are sort of nice, but it's the same dynamics. We haven't changed anything. Most of all, we haven't changed inside ourselves. So going from one place to another, to another, to another isn't the answer. And dropping out completely isn't the answer either. You say, I've been hurt. Therefore, I just won't get in a relationship. You've heard that on a personal level. You know, she really hurt me when she left. Therefore, I will never date again. You know, I've had one relationship, and that didn't work out, so I'm just not going to risk any closer than that. So you take that and apply it to a person's thing. I was in a church before, but they were so rigid and so on. I'm just not going to go to church. So you don't. You drop out. Both of those are kind of avoid. I'm in a church now. There's no church. There's no church. There's no church. There's no connection with people anymore. I'm trying to skip the past. Rather than a statement of past, I'd like to encourage us to move toward the future. We define who we are by the choices that we make and the commitments that we make. So we can attend another church and be involved in another group, but we don't have to sell out to do that. We can say, well, I'm beside you. I want to visit here for several weeks. before I decide if I'm going to change it or so long. And then after a while, then I can decide if this can be for me and my dreams are going to happen. And over the months and over the weeks, we will have a sense of whether it's a place for us or not. But we can practice doing things in a different way. Rather than to do our minds, not all the time, not saying anything, not making noise, but you say, you know what, I'm learning to touch these things I don't understand. I know the same thing is that it's really important in me. Not in a conanxious way, but in a temporary, honest way. Moving toward the future. Not trying to find places perfect. Not trying to avoid meeting me at all. Let's leave this in the end point. We sometimes want to find the perfect view. But if you find the place, Thank you. That might be a group of other providers that we do for a church. A small church or a large church. Because a large church is probably the few people within that large church in. But finding a place where we're humble, where we're encouraged, where we're prayed for, where God is real. Where we can talk about open language. And then number 11. Focus on a counterfeit of what's false. you've drawn the negative, you've drawn the false, but not to believe, we can stay focusing on that, or we can say, you know what, for every falsehood, for every lie I've believed in the past, what is the truth of the person asking me? And I can begin to focus on those truths and move to show that and positive and especially with rather than just staying stuck on what I don't do. The gospel is most true, not a list of things around you. so we need to move forward focusing on the genuine truth what is my fresh understanding of the truth will I allow that to bring you life let me just take a minute and go through this last section the action stance he's actually spring out of that there's a point I said earlier from the critical journey action steps. Five of them I have in mind. One of them is being in touch with my own personal needs. Where do I need forgiveness? Where do I need healing? What trauma have I experienced in these last few days? What do I need to take into account with myself? What do I need to do with my own personal needs? Secondly, we experience a sense of awe in that situation and presence, whether it's by the ocean or by the way or wherever it is. That's the only way I've got to do it. I think it's one thing where they can appreciate God's creation, beauty, sense of order, sense of power, presence. What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? For me, it was just last year walking on the beach. Now, I don't have a real good speed voice. Part of it is I'm unfailing. Part of it is when I don't have a river, part of it is I forget the words, songs. But on the beach that morning, the ocean right next to me, no one around for miles. I could sing. I could sing songs from childhood, worship songs, praise songs, even the seven verses, la la la la. But it was worship. I think God enjoyed that. Just as much as if I had done a favor on the machine, it's an extraordinary and difficult time. Find a place where you can talk to God. Yell at Him, praise Him, just go to Him, and live with you. Fourth, select a place or source from which you can learn. Select a mentor or guide that will both challenge and affirm you. And you know, find that person at this point. The best kind of person can play for you in the world. Some find a spiritual director, isn't more called, you know, a discipleship leader. You know, someone who will listen and reflect and suggest and offer some guidelines, but won't try to tell you what to do or how to do it. I'm going to try to ignore them as a different way to pay attention to them. I'd like to finish today with a prayer. Get in touch with my personal needs, experience a sense of awe, find a safe place to belong, group, some relationships, and church, and whatever it might be, a safe place, but I can find a sense of belonging and express my new promise of faith. And then a place where we're talking to learn, I'm going to see a teaching on health and guidance, and then embrace my real questions about stuff. Related to God's prayer I did a class several years ago. That's by Thomas Merton. I'm listed among the Catholic faith. What do I call the prayer of abandonment? These are for the times when I'm a special. I'm right in the middle of a change that I have no idea. where I'm going and what's going to happen but here it is. He says, My Lord God, I have no idea where I'm going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where I'm going. Nor do I really know myself. And the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you doesn't have to please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I've been. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this, you will lead me by the right road, though I may. Therefore, I will trust you always, though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never lead me to face my world. you can be so confused in the new transition of minds and actually the culture is dying somewhere you can't do without it all you can do recovery from spiritual abuse is sometimes going to live your gut trust and live by that grace that God has sent you well before I can get that reaction well before I can get that Thank you.
