Let's pray as we go to the Word. Father, I ask that by the power of your Spirit, this arena of our lives that we're going to be speaking of today, our sexuality, which has been so, by our culture, turned upside down, would, by your Spirit's power and the clarity of your truth, be turned right side up. I pray these things in your name. Amen. Over the last couple of weeks, stimulated to some degree by the obvious physical journey that we are on together as a church, we have been talking about where we believe we are on our spiritual journey as a church, and have likened it to that of the people of God, as recorded in Joshua chapter 1, on the shores of the Jordan River, about to enter into the land of promise. For like them, we kind of see ourselves as a church on the threshold of and about to enter into an entirely new era of life and ministry together as a church. It's an era that will be marked, we believe, by incredible opportunities for success, but dangers as well. So the word that we have embraced as being right for us during these days of transition is the same word that God gave the people of Israel just before they crossed the Jordan River. The word was this. Prepare yourselves. Chapter 1, verse 11. Consecrate yourselves. Chapter 3, verse 5. Examine yourselves. Particularly in three vitally important arenas of life. In the arena of your money, your sex, and your use of power. And the reason we focused on those three was because when the spies went out to view the land, talked about this last week, chapter 2, verse 1 of Joshua, they came back from having viewed the land with this report. that the God these people serve in the land in which we are about to go is the God called Baal. And the worship of Baal, we learned last week, is marked by a disordered relationship with those three things, money, sex, and power. So people of God, church of the open door, the word to us is this these days, prepare yourselves, consecrate and examine yourselves, particularly as it relates to how you relate to money, sex, and power. Today we begin to talk exclusively about sex. Today we have the sex talk. Now, it really is the beginning. We're going to deal with this for several weeks. In fact, partly I want to tell you that so you just kind of know what to expect. It's going to be broken up. There's going to be some weeks that I'm going to be gone and other things that are going to be going on. but it's going to be spread out. And one of the reasons I'm saying it is for me, because to kind of get off the hook of feeling like I need to say everything there is to say about this incredibly involved issue for us. It was about nine years ago that here at Opendoor, I did a series of sermons entitled The Pain of Pornia. It was born of our study at the time in the book of Acts. We came to chapters 15 of Acts, and the instruction to the people of God there was very clear and direct. was simply this. People of God abstain from, among other things, fornication. The Greek word fornication is the word porneia, thus its use in the title of the series. Acts 15, verse 20 says, abstain from that. Verse 29, same thing, abstain from that. For if you keep yourselves free from such things as porneia, sexual immorality, you will do well. And I am trying to spare you, in particular, the pain that will come in pornea. Because while rightly ordered sexuality is a wonderful thing, a gift from God, revealing in some wonderful ways that we will speak of in a few weeks, the very image of God, disordered sexuality, can be a very painful thing. A part of what gave energy to that series of sermons nine years ago was a growing concern I had at the time that has not entirely gone away and probably never will. The concern was this, that a significant number of people in our church had come to believe or at least live as if they believed that freedom in Christ meant freedom to pretty much do whatever we felt like doing. and that calls to abstain from anything were kind of seen by some, not all, but some, as legalistic violations of that freedom. The amazing grace of God had come for some to mean that obedience was optional, because nothing can alter God's yes toward us in Christ, or separate us from the love of God which is in Christ, that it meant we could pretty much live any way we chose. It's no big deal. There are no consequences. so crossing sexual boundaries with my boyfriend living with my girlfriend dabbling with pornography visiting strip bars just doesn't matter there are no real consequences isn't grace amazing and it's a mentality to which I said at the time to which I say today this that if you believe that because of God's amazing grace there are no consequences for wrong choices or sinful behavior, you are wrong. And in our day and age, with the proliferation of sexually transmitted diseases, some of them being fatal, you could be dead wrong. Indeed, I liken the consequences of our sexual choices to the law of gravity. And like gravity, it applies to you. It applies to you, gravity does. I don't care who you are, black or white, rich or poor, tall or short. Redeemed or not, gravity applies to you. You jump off a cliff, you're going to fall. If you fall, you're going to hit. If you hit, it's going to hurt, which is why a loving parent to his child says, don't go near the edge of the cliff. You might fall. Don't play in slippery places. You might stumble. Don't sit in the middle of the road. You're going to get hit. That's why loving parents in faith say to their children of faith, Abstain from fornication. Abstain from porneia. Why? Because with porneia, there is great pain. The price is very high. The consequences are very real. Among the consequences of porneia are these. 16-year-old children who, instead of worrying about whether they're going to make a volleyball team, are worrying about how they're going to deal with a new baby. Husbands or wives not being able to sleep at night because they're wondering how on earth they're going to explain to their spouse that they've contracted genital herpes. Spending enormous amounts of time and energy lying and hiding and covering fearful secrets. It's very expensive for porneia. People have lost their marriages, their families, their money, their reputation, health, and sometimes even their very lives. Some people in this room have experienced the pain of pornea not because of anything you did, but because someone else decided to use you to satisfy themselves. So they took what they wanted from you, and I'm speaking there of the entire arena of sexual abuse and incest and rape. The pain of porneia includes everything from sexually transmitted diseases, to broken relationships, to shattered marriages, to wonderful friendships that are gone awry, to long-earned trust being lost forever. And if you think you've escaped all that, sometimes the pain of porneia is simply manifested in that you're left with a distorted view of sexuality that on one hand is obsessed with sexuality and on the other hand can't stand the thought of sexuality, both of those perspectives and lifestyles are disordered. Now, to this pain that I'm describing, the culture we live in basically says this. What you really need to do around all this is just lighten up. You see, says the culture, the real source of pain here is not in our disordered sexual behavior, but in a disordered value system that's unrealistic. In other words, the culture tells us, that people have tried to put such a high premium on things like fidelity, chastity, virginity, and purity that when those things are lost, the pain in the loss is much greater than it needs to be. Therefore, the solution around all this to remove the pain is this. lower your expectations. Change your values in a phrase, lighten up about all this. See, the fact is this, says the culture, everybody's doing it. Everybody will. In fact, if you're not doing it, something's probably wrong with you. It's just a normal biological necessity. It's an itch you have to scratch. So, says the culture, what we need to understand and accept is this, that the best help we can give, the most hope we can offer to help people avoid the very real pain of pornea is to give them a condom. There's your protection, says the culture. There's your safety. We call it safe sex. There's your sanity in the sea of pornea. Wear a condom. Let me say just this thing about that. If, in fact, you are determined to express your sexuality outside the boundaries of what is healthy and holy, then I'm going to say something that may shock some of you. By all means, wear a condom. You know, some of you are health care professionals, and you're nurses and doctors, and you meet people at a level of some of their physical issues of life. Some of you are social workers and things like that, and I really want to respect you. You hear me kind of blasting this, you know, the protection we offer people as a condom, and that's not enough, and I don't think I'm going to make that clear. No, actually, I think for sure I'm going to make that clear. But some of you, but I don't want to be undermining what some of you do. The fact is this, if you're a healthcare professional, you're meeting people at a level where the influence you have on their lives is not going to be much more than that ability to do that. And so what I want to say to you is give them a condom. I mean, if you're going to save their life, do that. If you are bent, if you are determined to express your sexuality outside of anything that's healthy or holy, then for heaven's sake, protect yourself, protect the whole community. We're a condom. But don't you think we can offer a little bit more safety than that? Don't you think that maybe there's a little more protection than that? See, this isn't a doctor's office, and this isn't a school, and this is a church. So we're going to talk about a deeper level of protection and safety around our sexuality. 1 Thessalonians 4.3. The Apostle Paul says something, and by the way, this verse isn't what I'm going to just teach for several weeks, but this verse is kind of the verse that I want to lay over everything we're saying about sexuality. I would like to be leavened by this verse. It is a verse that I do not expect, quite frankly, to get much of a hearing in the culture. It is a verse, however, that I do expect to get a hearing here. Here's what Paul says. That this is the will of God concerning you, church of the open door. Young people, old people, whoever you are. This is the will of God concerning you, your sanctification. Let me tell you what I mean. That is that you abstain from sexual immorality. Let me clarify that. that you would learn how to, that you would know how to possess your vessel. Possess means to control. Vessel means your body. To control your body in sanctification and honor, not in lustful passions like people who have no knowledge of God. One of the things that caught me about that verse was the fact that he clarified. This is the will of God concerning you, your sanctification. Well, what's that? That you abstain from sexual immorality. Well, what is that? And, yeah, I mean, we live in a culture that would hear that. Abstain from sexual immorality, and we're all hearing that. And some could even sit here and go, well, yeah, I think that is really true, but what is that? And then Paul is clarifying, and he's cutting through what I think is all the baloney around this stuff and saying, here's what I mean by that, that you would learn to possess your body in honor. We need to do the same kinds of clarifications in our day as well. I'm a father. One of the things that I think about every once in a while is just the culture that my children are growing up in. And my children grew up at a time when in their lifetime they heard with their ears and saw with their eyes the president of the United States of America, Bill Clinton at the time, looking to the camera one day and in his most earnest, you can believe me look, said to the American people these words that I will never forget. These are the words he said. I did not have sexual relations with that woman. In fact, he said, I did not have sexual relations with that woman. You know, there are certain things in my life that I remember where I was, what I was thinking. I will never forget where I was when I heard that come over the TV. I can remember the smell in the room. I did not have sexual relations with that woman. But we found out, you know, just a little bit later that what that really meant, translated from the Greek was what he meant was I didn't have intercourse. And you know, in his own mind, in his mind, the way he had fixed that, sexual immorality, I did not have sexual immorality, what he meant was intercourse. And so in his mind, he was telling the truth. And so we need an apostle Paul to cut through the baloney and say, okay, sexual intercourse, it's not just about that. Are you possessing your body in sanctification and honor? Learning to possess your body in honor cuts through all that baloney. Because however you vaguely, broadly, or narrowly define sexual immorality, holding your body in honor raises the bar. So, okay, you didn't have intercourse. Are you possessing your body in sanctification and honor? One of the sad realities, I've been aware of this, for quite a while, and I even got a call this week from a friend who just kind of put this perspective on it. And I don't know how widespread this is, but I know it's there, and it certainly isn't everyone. But among many Christian young people, there's this perspective, and it's fairly widespread on some Christian college campuses that around their sexuality, that intercourse, oh no, we'll never do that, we won't cross, that's the thing you don't do, but oral sex, that's okay. do you hear the apostle paul saying you don't get it i need to clarify in this culture just like i did then are you possessing your body in sanctification and honor see i think every once in a while we would do well to see god high and lifted up holy and and majestic and like beyond our ability to describe but we would also do well every once in a while to bring our perception of God down to something rather human, like a no-nonsense, loves-you-to-death parent who responds to our slippery, slimy redefinitions of what sin is and morality is by taking off his glasses, looking us right in the eye and saying, do I look stupid to you or what? This is not just about intercourse. It's about possessing your vessel in sanctification and honor. It's about you controlling your impulses, not them controlling you. Now, I'm going to assume that the majority of the people in this room, certainly not all, but the majority of the people in this room, by virtue of the fact that you are here, have a relatively high interest in learning how to, and that's the phrase he uses, that we would learn how to, that we would know how to possess our bodies in sanctification and honor. Well, in order to do that, I think there's some things we need to know about our sexuality. I think there are some lies we need to expose and dismantle as well. There are three lies in all that by the time we're done with this series, I want to deal with just one today. The lie I want to deal with today is this. That the essence of our sexuality involves nothing more than a biological urge, a physical function, or a genital expression. That's a lie. for at the root of our sexuality is a spiritual dimension of which we must be aware if we hope to authentically possess our bodies in sanctification and honor. Now, let me clarify something about what I just said. It is obvious. I mean, I'm not blind to the fact that the physical expression of our sexuality is or does have a biological genital component. I'm not blind to that, but I want you to get this. And you may not even buy this right away because we're so, I think, distorted in our thinking. Just kind of come with me and make your decision at the end of the talk. In its essence, at the core of our sexuality, it is not a physical thing. At its core, it is a spiritual thing. By that, I don't mean it isn't physical. By that, I mean it isn't only physical. Let me say it this way. The physical expression of our sexuality is only one of the flowers that makes up a bouquet of what our sexuality fully entails. That's a picture I'm going to kind of hang around a little bit and see if it works for you in your thinking. W. Paul Jones says that this way. Sexuality is not just what we do, it's who we are. has to do with our identity as a masculine person, our identity as a feminine person. Let me say it this way. Created by God as a man, I have gender. My gender is part of my sexuality. I am male. Now, one way to express my masculinity, my gender, is physically. But it's not the only way. Indeed, this might sound weird to you, I don't even think it's the primary way that my sexuality gets expressed. Indeed, when that one flower that is part of the whole bouquet becomes the primary way or becomes the primary thing that you think is the definition of your sexuality, I promise you that if that one flower is all you understand about your sexuality, that that one flower will become very, very distorted. In fact, after a while, I think the leaves are going to fall off of that thing, and you're going to be left with not much. See, there's more than one way to express my sexuality and yours. Another way to express our sexuality is in creativity. Another way is in intimacy, when with my best friend, one way would be to do this with my wife, or just with a friend, to open up the deepest recesses of my soul and share my deepest, darkest secrets and to let someone I trust into that frightening place to then watch them as they open their soul, the deepest, darkest secrets of their soul, and allow me to walk in there. And emotionally, we find ourselves in a place where emotionally we are naked but not ashamed. You are experiencing intimacy. It's incredibly exhilarating. At certain levels, it's frightening. It's incredibly fulfilling when you open up and enter in to the soul of another human being. And that is part of your masculinity. It's part of your femininity. It's part of your identity. It's part of your sexuality. It's another one of the flowers in the bouquet of your identity as a sexual person. Male, female. Let me kind of just keep walking around this a little bit, give you some more examples of the flowers that are in the bouquet. My sexuality and yours is expressed in how I see things. I see things through the grid of who I am as a masculine person. It's expressed through how I respond to and enter into life in the context of my masculinity because I am who I am, wired the way I am. I see things a certain way. I respond a certain way. We had a staff meeting this last week. Actually, it was our message team meeting middle of the week we're talking about a number of things in the course of conversation scott bernstein used this phrase that that triggered a very energetic conversation he simply made reference to and now i'm quoting him a woman's way of knowing and what he was talking about was a woman's way of seeing and hearing and responding and we were talking about different ways even people view the text and and how you would go at it and how maybe a woman would preach the same text a different way. We're just talking about a woman's way of knowing. Well, when he said the phrase, my eyes glazed over. A woman's way of knowing. Immediately, when he spoke about a woman's way of knowing, I was plunged into mystery. It was like, what is that? But I'm going to tell you something else. You're all laughing. I was also plunged into wonder. There is a wonder I know about a woman's way. And by the way, I'm not talking here about roles or you do the, this has nothing to do with that. But a woman's way of responding and seeing and hearing, quite frankly, things I don't hear. And I love to hear. So I'm plunged into wonder. And I'm around some wonderful women, quite frankly, in my life and in our church. And so I'm plunged into delight. I love to hear a woman's way of seeing. But after I think about the wonder and delight, I come back very quickly to the mystery again. Can I tell you something? You need to understand something. That all of that is part of her sexuality, but I am not talking about the expression of sexuality involving genitals at all. It's another one of the flowers. It's part of identity, femininity, masculinity. You know, the way I prepared this sermon in my office, the way I write, the mess I make, the way I think, the logic I use, the way I see things and end up writing them down, the very way I am preaching it right now, with all my movements and all that stuff. I mean, you never see this normally, that it's part of my sexuality. No, I'm not coming on to you. Don't worry. You know? Ah! You know, you don't know why I'm laughing. I remember things when I talk like this. You know, in a church our size, thousands of people not only come, but they go through our church. And so you have stories after 20 years. And I just remember getting a letter once from a person, and she said, You're looking at me. You're looking at me. Oh. You okay. But you know, one of the things about our laughter here is that we, whenever I even say the word sexual, we only think of the one flower. We only think of the one flower. We don't understand the whole bouquet at all. See, the physical expression of my sexuality and yours is only one of the flowers that makes up the bouquet of what our sexuality fully entails. Which means some really good news. Here's the good news. It is entirely possible, beloved, to be a very healthy, entirely balanced, fully alive and present to your sexuality as a man or a woman and not be expressing that sexuality in a physical way. Yeah. That's good. I'm glad that got an amen. I wasn't sure people would even understand that. because we see it one way most of the time. In fact, I want to push that a little further. I'm going to tell you, and please just kind of come with me on this, if you don't develop or allow to develop the other aspects of your sexuality, like issues of intimacy and creativity, integrity and personality, which, by the way, are wonderful things for you to develop in a marriage, but also in a courtship, to hold off the physical relationship while you develop things like trust and integrity and intimacy. If you don't develop those aspects of your sexuality, you may never enter into a healthy, holy, whole experience of your physical expression. They get disordered. All of a sudden, the only flower you have is the one flower of sexual expression. And if that's the only flower you have developed in your bouquet of sexuality that makes you male or female, I promise you that your sexuality is disordered and ultimately will cause you great pain. You know, I don't know how many of you married couples. It's just not the kind of thing we talk about much, but sometimes you get with coffee and you start talking about the real things that are going on in your life and the places you've needed healing and gotten healing. I wonder if some of you know that when your sex life was faltering, and by this, by sex life here, I do mean the physical expression of it. And you went through that season in your marriage when you actually became obsessed with that dimension of your marriage, and we're not doing it right, and we're not doing it enough. How many of you remember that sometimes the answer you were given from maybe a professional or somebody who really knew how to give you some help was to get some healing there. What you actually had to do maybe for a while is to pull that flower out. Quit being obsessed with this. Abstain for a while. And you know what you really need to do? In order to really enjoy that, you maybe need to allow some other aspects of your sexuality like intimacy and other things develop and grow and then maybe pull that one back. And I'm talking about married people. Richard Foster in his book, The Challenge of the Disciplined Life, says this, the problem with the topless bars and pornographic literature of our day is not that they emphasize sexuality too much, but that they don't emphasize it enough. They don't get the big picture. They totally eliminate relationship and intimacy and thus reduce sexuality to the narrow confines of the genital, meaning they only talk about the one flower in the bouquet. They have made sex trivial, thus ultimately rendering it less enjoyable. How much richer and fuller is the biblical perspective to chat over coffee, to discuss a great book, to open your soul to the soul of another. This is sexuality at its best, for male and female are in intimate relationship. To be sure, he says, genital sex is part of that total picture, but human sexuality is a far larger reality than merely intercourse. He goes on. Human sexuality has many aspects, only one of which is the physical expression. When single persons, for instance, begin to nurture and cultivate the many other aspects of their masculinity or femininity, the physical drives often come into perspective. In fact, what we call sexual needs are not really needs at all, but wants. Now, that is a huge statement, and it's one in a couple of weeks I want to come back to, and we're going to revisit this one because it's very important. It's another lie we believe. I think a lie we believe is that sex is a need. What he says is it isn't. The body needs food, air, water, things like that. No one has died yet from lack of physical sex. To understand this, he concludes, can be tremendously liberating, especially for singles. You are not half people, unfulfilled and incomplete. Single people do not need the physical expression of sex to experience wholeness in their sexuality. But I would add this, unless they believe the lie that the one flower is the whole bouquet. Now, I've been trying to put our physical expression of sexuality into a larger context. Let's now begin to talk about the one flower of our physical sexuality. While physical sexuality is only one flower in the bouquet, when we are talking about the one flower of the bouquet, even then, what I want you to know is that it is not merely a physical expression. It is a spiritual union. It has a powerful spiritual component. I have said it this way to you before. Sexuality involves more than skin to skin. Something deeper than the skin is being touched when we engage in physical expressions of sexuality. There's many places in the scripture we could go that this is made clear. Among them, it would be 1 Corinthians 6. Maybe the clearest is this. And it gives strong evidence to this. Just some context here. Paul is writing to a culture not unlike our own that is sexually charged. So much so that sexual immorality was no big deal to the Corinthians. Not much different than eating or drinking. It was perceived to be just kind of an appetite like other appetites. If you're hungry for food, you eat. If you're hungry for sex, you satisfy. Reminds me actually very much of the video we saw last week where that 17, 18-year-old girl was talking about sex and said it's just like going to school, remember? Meet a guy, have sex, it's just the way it is. It's like eating, it's like drinking, it's like going to school. Well, into that mentality, the Apostle Paul says this, 1 Corinthians 6, verse 15. And quite frankly, let me just preface it again. I don't think this verse is going to get much of a hearing in the culture, but I expect it to get a hearing in the church. Listen to what he says. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot? May it never be. Or do you not know? And they didn't know. They hadn't been taught about sexuality. That the one who joins himself to a harlot is one body with her. For God's design in our sexuality is a wonderful thing. It's more than skin to skin. It's about two becoming one flesh. It's more than a physical expression. It's a spiritual union. Beloved, when we engage in our physical expression of sexuality, more is involved than skin to skin. Back up in verse 13, same chapter, he draws this analogy, and this one's especially geared to those who had reduced sexuality to nothing more than a physical appetite like eating or drinking. Here's what he says to them. It is true that food is for the stomach and stomach is for the food, but God will do away with both of those. Your body, yet your body is not for immorality but for the Lord. Now let me untangle that for you. What he's saying very simply is this. Your stomach and food were made for each other. That is a biological truth, which means that consistent with the design of your stomach is food. You get that? So eat. It is also true that consistent with the design of your body is sex. It's just the way you were made. But your body was not designed for immorality. Your body was designed for ordered, rightly, sexuality, but not disordered sexuality, not pornea. Your body, your life can't run well on pornea. It fouls it up. It defiles and wounds us. Why? Because more is involved in our sexuality than a physical expression. It's a spiritual union where two become one flesh. One of the things we talk about around here is the reality of what we call soul ties. And there are many people who come into the church and come into faith and at some time in their life would recognize. In fact, this often comes in our Before You Say I Do classes. And people come in and they're wanting to get married and they really are in love and all these kinds of things. And we begin to just identify sometimes when there's been soul ties. And I'm talking about multiple sex partners with other people. And that by the grace of God and by the power of the Spirit, those soul ties can be broken. And wonderful healing can happen. But you know what? They really need to be broken Because something deeper than your skin got touched We are fearfully and wonderfully made You know, we live in a culture That knows a lot about the physical dimensions of sexuality Our schools offer sex education, and that's a good thing Responsible parents talk to their children about the facts of life If you have kids, if you're a parent, you all know about that I mean, you know, when our kids were that age, we were always around parents often who had kids around. And it was always this, oh, I don't know how you're going to do it. How are we going to do it? We were buying books to do it right. I'll never forget taking Caleb on a trip. And often when I would speak someplace when the kids were younger, I would bring one of the kids with me. And on this particular trip, I was going to bring Caleb. And I told Bonnie before, he was 12, 13 years old, something in there. And I told Bonnie, I says, I think the time is right to do this. sex talk with Caleb. We'll kind of sit down and do that. And the whole time I'm kind of praying about, you know, when it's going to happen. And I'm saying, God, just kind of make it come up in the course of conversation. And, you know, somehow just kind of come up. And he'll, Dad, what about, you know, it never happened. So I don't remember exactly how it happened. But I sat him down finally and I said, Caleb, I think it's time we talk about sex. He said, great, Dad, what do you want to know? Oh, boy. See, he had sex education. He had all that stuff. You know, I really do remember those days. And as parents, we were always reading the books. And I'm sure if you have kids that age, you're kind of reading the books and how to, and here's what you should say, and here's what you shouldn't say. And a big thing, the big thing in those days, maybe it still is. I'm not in tune with it right now. But the big thing is, tell them the proper name for all the body parts. So I'm sitting here telling Caleb, okay, and this is a, And that is a hot eye. I'm telling them all the proper names. And all the proper names. And every time I used the proper name, it was like throwing water on the Wicked Witch of the West. I'm melting. Oh, I hate that word. So I'd say it over and over and over again to them. But I actually agree with our family. You just got to know we're a little demented, a little bent. This is coming from a father who suggested to Bonnie when our kids were real, hey, why don't we teach him the wrong colors? You know, just so people know they're a Johnson. You know, then they'll know. Well, actually, Caleb and I, we started making up other names, all sorts of names. He shared with me some I didn't know. I shared with some he didn't know was a real bonding father-son thing. I have no idea how to reel this back in now. No, here is the point. Our culture knows a lot about sex. They know the body part. They can say the right word. But what our culture knows little or nothing about is that when we express our sexuality physically, something more than our physical essence is being touched, something more than the genitals are involved, it touches our spirit, It touches our soul. It involves our very essence at the core of our masculinity and our femininity. And that is why adultery is so devastating. That is why premarital sex is so inappropriate, why sexual abuse and rape are so horrific, and sex in general is so very complicated. Why? Because more, beloved, we are fearfully and wonderfully made, and more is involved than skin to skin. I've used this illustration before. I think it works for me. It gives the perspective that's necessary. No one doubts that rape is horrific. But have you ever wondered why? Why is rape worse than assault? If I got a phone call tonight that a buddy of mine got assaulted in downtown Minneapolis and was in a hospital, I would be horrified. I would go and visit him, and I would be sick to my stomach that he had to endure this kind of invasion on his personhood. But if I got a call tonight that my daughter was raped, I can't hardly say the word. Something deeper inside of me relative to a desire to murder, whoever did that, would be touched inside of me. Why is that? And why is that even the consistent response, even in our culture, that doesn't know much about the spiritual dimension of sex? I'll tell you why. Because instinctively, we still know that something deeper than the skin got touched. By the way, when this truth is either not known or denied, the truth that more is involved than skin to skin, All you have left is skin to skin. All you have left is the one flower. Genital sex, physical expression. And if that's all you have left, then that explains obsession and preoccupation with the ultimate experience, with the best technique, with the lifelong quest for the perfect partner. And if it isn't you, then maybe it's you. And if it's not you, then maybe it's you. And if it's not a woman, then maybe it's a man. and if not a woman, then a child, then not a child, then an animal, and how far we have fallen from the glory of what God intended when he made a man and he made a woman, and he said the glory is they will become one flesh, and there you will see the image of God. With much more to say. Let me close with this question. what if you've already gone too far are these things these spiritual ties even are they irreversible beloved if all I had to do was uncover what's wrong I would be in despair and quite frankly I wouldn't even uncover it but the truth is this these things are reversible But the other truth is this. For these things to be reversed demands nothing short of the healing touch of God himself. Why? Here's why. To engage in a life-uniting act without a life-uniting intent wounds the inner spirit. It just wounds you. Such wounds often fester and become infected so that they poison the entire spiritual life and at best they leave an ugly scar. The good news is that healing is possible. Things that are lost can be restored. That is the glory of the gospel that we preach. The grace of God can flow into the wounded spirit, healing and restoring. But there's things you need to know about this healing. First thing you need to know is it's a process. You know, we look for magic wands. I talked about that just a few weeks ago in our whole spiritual lives. We're looking for magic wands. And I want to be able to come forward today, be done. It doesn't work that way. Could you come forward, get a wonderful gift, a huge deliverance of sorts in certain areas and a movement in a whole new direction? Absolutely. Could you experience today amazing weights lifted off of you and forgiveness imparted you? Absolutely. Are you done? Absolutely not. These kinds of healings are a process. You take a step, you take another step. Sometimes the step you take doesn't feel like it even did any good. You know, one of the analogies we're using these days, crossing the Jordan River, they go into the Promised Land. The first city they hit was Jericho, remember? That was a fortress city. The walls needed to come down. They were given some strange instructions. And imagine being part of the group that had to do it. You're going to go around it. I just want you to circle the city. Just sit there. I don't know if they were supposed to hold hands, but I picture them holding hands, looking at the city. They walk around and look at it. And don't say anything. Just circle the city and then go home. And then go back the next day. Circle the city. Don't say anything. Then go home. Third day. I mean, I don't know if anybody else was there, But if I was there, Dave Johnson, there around Jericho, I'd go, this ain't working. This is stupid. I'm not much of a processed guy. I want a magic wand. How come the walls don't come down the first time I pray? It doesn't work that way. So just keep obeying God and go around it again and go around it again and visit it again and ask God again. And then one day, by the power of God, those walls came down and they can come down for you. it's a process, sometimes it's a long one often involving the breaking of soul ties something we do here at Open Door in discreet and respectful and compassionate ways usually under the care of a wise and caring physician of the soul it's a normal occurrence in our ministry called restoration through prayer and maybe even as some of you would become aware of soul ties even as I'm speaking this and are at a point where I really want to deal with that I would encourage you to call and get with someone in restoration through prayer and they can maybe walk you through some of these things it's not the kind of thing that can happen oh yeah I'm going to do it now something that you've been maybe dealing with and having inside of you for 30 years it's not going to be today maybe what you could come for prayer for today would be to say to another human being you know what I have some soul ties I need to break would you pray for me I need to repent of some things and we want to be with you at that level. That's step one. It begins, beloved, by bringing out into the light what we've been hiding in the dark and for some of you that first step, the first step in walking out of your pain and disorder is walking into truth to confess and repent and as you confess and repent, I can tell you some really good, we have authority, we have authority with each other to in Jesus' name pronounce you forgiven. to absolve you of sin so you can take your next step after that and your next step after that and your next step after that and all of that is called amazing grace. And I'll tell you what, to take the first step and then the next step and the next step, you know what it takes? Strength and courage. And what did God say? to Joshua and the people of God on the shores of the Jordan River? He said this, be strong and courageous. If you think these walls are going to come down, you are going to need to be strong and courageous. Don't be timid or afraid, for I am with you every step of the way into your healing. And out the other side, rightly ordered people who hold, possess their bodies in honor. Honor restored. That's amazing grace. Amen. Amen. Let's stand and be dismissed with prayer. Dear Father, as your children, many of us wounded and disordered in this area, we are your children. We declare to you today our desire. Our desire is this, to be a people who are learning how to possess our vessels in sanctification and honor so that what has been turned upside down can be turned right side up. I pray that you would give us strength and courage as we put one foot in front of the other, one step in front of the other, as we move further and further into you and into our healing and out the other side with rightly ordered vessels. that honor you and bring wonderful joy to ourselves. I pray all of these things in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen.
