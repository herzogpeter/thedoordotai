We're talking about the Kingdom of God and it being a spiritual reality, and that means a person acting. It's so important to distinguish the kinds of things that we teach about the Kingdom of God from a system where you're not interacting with a person, you're acting with some sort of mechanism. because that's what distinguishes the teaching of the kingdom from things like, for example, the standard teaching of Christian science. And I certainly hope I won't offend anyone by mentioning that particular group, but you see the point of the science in the name Christian science is that you are able to identify laws and you just tap into those laws. and so then prayer or meditation or other spiritual disciplines we might call them are ways of working a system and that is not true for the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God is not a system it's a person and so that changes then prayer for example is a conversation. And it isn't a matter of just learning how to hold your mouth right and then you get the goodies. It's living in a relationship with a person. And of course, Jesus is the center of that. And through Jesus, we relate to the whole trinity. And then the trinity relates to this. Now, there is a difference between filling with Spirit and baptism of Spirit. And you can see that if you just take a glass, and if you have a dishpan, fill it with water, and turn the glass upside down and submerge it, the glass will be baptized in water. But it won't be filled. or another helpful metaphor suppose you fill the glass with stones or sand and you submerge it in water the baptism means to be surrounded in to be immersed in and that's extremely important to understand when you read the scriptures because for example in 1 Corinthians 10 it talks about how the Israelites were baptized into Moses. And baptism of the Spirit is a natural way of thinking about things, but you do want to recognize there is a different emphasis in filling. And one of the things that might help you is this, that we are commanded to be filled with the Spirit. We're never commanded to be baptized with the Spirit. In being filled with the Spirit, there is an initiative on the part of the fillee. There's an initiative. And that means that we are to take... Now, this means exactly the same thing as grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. And I put up here 2 Corinthians 4, 16 through 18, because this gives us some teaching on how we proceed to bring the spiritual reality of God into ourselves. Here's what Paul says. He's talking about, he says, Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying... Anyone here have an outer man that's decaying? That's why when you have plastic surgery, it's always lifting. Because everything is falling. That's decaying. And that's a natural process. And Paul had led a pretty tough life, and he's wearing out his body. But now watch what he says. We do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being... Now, the inner man is the spiritual person, the spiritual side of the person. And I'm afraid I won't have time to begin to try to straighten all that out, but I hope it's intuitively clear. Our inner man is being renewed day by day. For momentary light affliction, those are temptations, is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all corruption. Because when in temptation you allow yourself to trust God and you allow God to act and you don't short-circuit the process and try to fix it up in the way you think it should go, you invite God into the life, then that adds spiritual substance to your history with God. And you see, your eternal life is essentially what you're doing with God. And if you will look at John 17, 3, I think it's going to come up here in a minute, you'll see the only definition of eternal life in the Bible. And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God and Jesus Christ. Now, know doesn't mean what we call head knowledge. Know, in biblical terms, is always interactive relationship. So, now one more step here that we need to tie up is with grace. Because we want to put grace now in this circle of interactive relationship knowledge. Grace is God acting in your life to accomplish what you can accomplish on your own. Grace is God acting in your life. It is the action of God in your life. And it will really help you if you have the time to just do an inductive Bible study on grace and look at all the connections in which grace is mentioned. And you will find that grace is not just for guilt. It's for life. It's what God meant us for. And to go back to his image in us, just think of how we have to have grace in human life. Giving, receiving, acting on behalf of others. Parent with children, children with parents. Just people working together. We have to have grace. What do we mean when we say someone is persona non grata? We're saying there's a person who gets no grace from me, from us. That's like being cut off, put outside the camp, marked as someone who is to be alien. And now grace is precisely when the filling of the Spirit refers to the inner dimensions of the self all proceeding in conjunction with God's action, and that's grace. So you're told to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Well, how do you do that? How do you do that? See, that verse, grow in grace, is another way of stating the same thing by saying, be ye filled with the Spirit. it's very important we have a real problem with this in our religious culture and it's caused by identifying the filling of the spirit with manifestations of the filling or the baptism but the reality is the action of God around us and within us. The around us may come in a way that we don't do it. Well, it will come. It may come through ministry. It may come through a special act of God, such as you see in Acts 2. But we don't do that. No one is commanded to be baptized with the Spirit. But they're commanded to be filled because when you have come to life in the Spirit, then you're now in a position of acting. And so it is then appropriate to say things like, be filled with the Spirit. Now how would you be filled with the Spirit? You'd be filled with the Spirit by surrendering every aspect of your life to the action of God. And that will go back to Colossians 3.17. Whatever you do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father through Him. So I don't think we have time today to talk about all of the things that you might do in response to the command to be filled with the Spirit. But basically that's it. You turn it all over to God. You don't hold parts of your life back and say, Well, I run that. You're willing to trust God with everything. and when I'm sure that there are degrees of this but because we learn and grow progressively but in the degree to which the spirit moves with all aspects of our life because we have surrendered that to it we are filled with the spirit and that may I'm sure I'm sure that it involves special experiences but we don't want to confuse it with those special experiences. Just like salvation is not the same thing as a conversion experience. Salvation is the larger life you move into through a conversion experience. And it's hard for some people to hear this but let me just say that some people move into that without a distinct conversion experience. And some of the greatest evangelical saints of the last two centuries could never tell you when they were converted. But you look at their lives and you see that they were converted and more. I'll give you just one case in case you want to chase this down. Robert Murray McShane, a great minister, Scotland missionary, and he's only one of many. And these were characteristically people who were raised in families that simply didn't breathe any other air than the kingdom of God. Now that doesn't mean that they got their salvation because they were raised in that family, but it does mean that being raised in that family brought them into faith in Christ in a different way than a person who's never been there in such a surrounding, and then they have a conversion experience. Now, why would I bring such a troubling thing up to you? See, because many people are troubled about this. They don't quite say well can that be right don't you have to have kind of a definite moment when you say yes and we have overdone experiences and underdone growth and there is a process of coming to conversion when that occurs and then there's a process after it. Let's see on the salvation side you have people who say, well I've had that experience so what's left? This turns out to be really important now for what we'll be talking about the rest of our time here. And you have other people who say, well I've been baptized in the Spirit. Well the experience experience of it is not the same as the reality. To live in the environment of the Spirit is what we would think would come out of an experience of baptism or conversion. So when we think about this matter of living in the kingdom of God, we want to think about it in a way that allows for growth as a natural part. Now, so, I want to just mention this a little more because I got the part about the old man decaying. But you notice in verse 17 of 2 Corinthians 4, for momentary light affliction is producing the substance of our spiritual life. And then how do we do it? Verse 18 is the how do we do it part. While we look not at things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal. The kingdom is not seen. The spiritual side of you is not something that is seen. Paul is saying we take our thoughts, We take our affections, our will, and everything that is in us, and we focus it on God and his kingdom. And as we do that in going through life, temptations, troubles, and all, we become increasingly substantial, growing into the fullness of what God intended us to be. then issues like baptism and filling become ways of understanding a part of that growth. Not the only ways, because we still have to talk a lot about learning, discipleship, disciplines, and so on, because that also, and indeed those are essential to this practice of what Paul says, we look not at things which are seen, but at things which are not seen. How do you do that? Well, for example, scripture memorization is a way of doing that. Fasting is a way of doing that. See, when you fast, you're looking away from those biscuits and gravy. That's seen. You're looking to something that is unseen. Jesus called it the Word of God. You remember he said, man shall not live by bread alone, that's seen. But by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, that's unseen. You go back to Hebrews 11, you find out that everything that's seen is made out of what is not seen. The Word of God. Not quarks and strings and atoms. That's not the ultimate level of reality. The ultimate level of reality is the Word of God, which again is God in action. It's what God is doing. So, now, out of this comes a community. Because this is not something that is done just to individuals. A community comes out of it. Jesus came into the world, and he collected people, and he trained them. And he said that he was going to build his ecclesia. He built his ecclesia, and that passage that I quoted a moment ago from Matthew 16, where he's saying, you know, he gave them a little pop quiz. Who do people say I am? Who do you say I am? That's the biggest question on earth. Who do you say I am? Boy, now that's a really big part of the growth that comes from looking at what is not seen. And what we really believe about who Jesus is, is the single most significant about us thing about anyone about us. And Jesus put these questions in various ways. But in this one, of course, Peter responds, you're the anointed one. You're the one, you're God's man. You're God's leader. You're David all over again. you're the one Moses said would come you know all those ways of identifying in terms of the pointers that came out of Jewish history and Jesus says you're it you're the one you're in charge you've got the goods and that was all true and it didn't mean exactly what Peter had in mind because he thought he was on the short trip to glory his man just won the election and so Peter got it right and this was important of course in the process of revelation and Jesus said to him you know flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you God revealed it to you you got the answer right and then he immediately proceeded to show he didn't know what it meant but that's another story that's like that's how we grow isn't it I mean, sometimes very important things we say, but we didn't know what they meant, but it's important that we said them because we're going to find out, like marriage vows, for example. So, Peter, and now Jesus says, very interesting, because you see in Matthew 16, 16 through 18, the kingdom and the church come together. In one of the passages where it most explicitly comes together, is you may have said that I'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom. What do you do with keys? You go in. I'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom. And I'm going to build my church on this rock of confession. That Jesus is it. And then out of that comes a community which he is building. And this is something that we need to apply in many ways. One is, we can count on him for that. So what happens in a community of believers in Christ is what God is doing. We still act just like we act to grow in grace. We act to be filled with the Spirit, even though that's not something that we can do on our own. You can't grow in grace on your own, but you still have to do it. So you don't have to do it on your own. The combination of action and passivity is what defeats many people. So we have a church, we have to act. We have a local congregation, we have to act. But the question is, who are we trusting? And if we're trusting what we do, we're running our kingdom. But if we act with confidence in God and trust Him, then we get to see His kingdom. We get to see Him build His church. And we get to see people in that church who have the keys of the kingdom walk into the kingdom and receive what they need. And out of that comes the glorious community of the body of Christ, stretched out in space and through time. The purpose of human history. That's what it's all about. It's the church. Now, it's probably a good thing that we don't get to see that very clearly. because we might have trouble with remaining humble. But in fact, the church is this glorious creature of God, of redemption, of Christ's work, and it consists of people just like us. Just like us. Look with me at John 15. This is a sweet passage. Jesus is talking to his friends. And there's a special tenderness in all of this because he knows he's going to die in just a few hours. And he wants to say things that would, they're probably incomprehensible, but he's maybe one of the reasons why he appointed John as an apostle was to have someone who could get this down right. And so he's telling them wonderful things, like how he's giving them peace. In John 14, 27, peace I leave with you. My peace I give you, not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, don't be afraid. And then in verse 11 of chapter 15, these things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full. Now he's addressing here the emotional side of human life. That's one aspect that we have to have growth in. Because instead of peace, most people have turmoil, fear. Instead of joy, most people have depression, sadness, sorrow, hopelessness, and so on. But you see, when you begin to step into the kingdom of God, one of the dimensions of your growth is the transformation of your emotional life. I think I'd better say that again. And we're going to come back to that now and spend some more time on it. But when you come into the kingdom of God, one of the things that happens is the transformation of your emotional life. And in this day and age, you have to say quickly, like, I don't mean you're a bad person if you're not joy. I don't mean if you have to take Brozac, that you're a bad person. Please, don't say anything. It isn't like that. But we want also to say that there is a joy and there is a peace that comes with life in the kingdom of God. And then, of course, love. So let's move on down to verse 12. of John 15. This is my commandment, that you love one another just as I have loved you. And you notice the difference between that and what people like to say when they say, love your neighbor as yourself. Well, Jesus said that. That's good. But that doesn't define the quality of love. It just says, whatever you've got, love other people the same way. and maybe maybe you don't love yourself will that mean you don't have to love your neighbor? well if you love your neighbor as yourself and you don't love yourself then you don't love your neighbor see love is a word that gets bandied about a lot one reason why the word charity was inserted in the old King James actually not in the first edition of the King James instead of love in 1 Corinthians 13 was because the word love had become so degraded and it very largely has happened again. You know, when people sing what the world needs now is love, sweet love, they mean lust, sweet lust. Now you may not be old enough to remember the movie that that song came out of. Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice. I will go no further. Let's see, what is love? Well, I said Jesus redefines love. And that's what forms the community. Listen to what he says. Love one another just as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. Now, shocking verse 14. You are my friends if you do what I command you. And you know, you have to keep that out of the way that people try to manage one another by saying, well, if you love me, you'll do what I say. No, no. That's not his point. Just like in John 14, where he's talking about in verse 23, if anyone loves me, he will keep my word. If he does not love me, he does not keep my word. the keeping of the word comes out of the love it isn't you keep his word to prove that you love him see that's the way the human beings would do it well if you love me you'll do what I say no no Jesus is saying that your love is what produces the action not you have to prove that you love by doing it, but rather loving is what explains why you do it. And you need to carry that back to what we said about the law earlier, but we can't go there now. So now, that's a community of friends. Actually, one denomination took that as their name, if you remember. And, boy, that's a wonderful name. Sometimes, if it's appropriate, I might witness to someone by saying, are you a friend of Jesus? Try it. You will notice it is very hard for anyone to say, oh no, I'm not a friend of Jesus. You know, Jesus really, it's hard to find anyone, even on a university campus, who has anything very bad to say about Jesus. They talk endlessly about religion. But Jesus has a way of standing out there, and it's extremely difficult to find anyone who is prepared to say, no, I don't want anything to do with him. If they think you're trying to finagle them into something, they may say that. but if they're just thinking about Jesus, see, he brought something into the world that no one else brought in. No one brought this in. We today cannot understand how shockingly revolutionary the teachings of love in the New Testament are. Actually, even in the Old Testament. Read Leviticus 18, which is where the saying, Love your neighbor as yourself first emerges. But that also contains the verse that says, You must love the alien. You know, that's your undocumented worker or whoever. Or perhaps someone in Afghanistan. That you should love the alien as you love yourself. And then the teachings of Jesus about love. I mean, search the whole world of literature. Even since Jesus, you won't find anything that gets there. You see, that's why Jesus said, By this shall all men know you are my disciples, because you have love one to another. Now, he wasn't talking about sort of dancing around in Fellowship Hall. See, he's talking about love like he had for one another. And that's the call for the community that comes out of life in the kingdom under the administration of the Spirit, was the kind of love that Jesus actually had. Now that love then translates into doing the things that he said. So, for example, the Sermon on the Mount. All the things that he said there are natural expressions of the love that is in a person who has come into the kingdom of God and has learned as Jesus' disciple and gradually been transformed so that, for example, if it comes down to something like anger, they don't have any problem with it. They're not governed by anger. Maybe don't even get angry. They may have found out that everything you can do with anger, you can do much better without it. That's true. But now we've kind of lost that. And there's a kind of righteousness about anger. And that actually turns out to be one of the things about anger that is so seductive, is that it's always, in the moment of anger, you always feel righteous. Have you ever noticed that? In the moment of anger. It's just like, you remember old Jonah, he's out there on the hill waiting for God to destroy Nineveh, though he knows it's not going to happen. And the little vine comes up and provides him a little shade, and the worm comes along and clips the vine, and now Jonah's mad. God says, Do you do well to be angry about that? And what does Jonah say? You bet your booties. I really do well to be mad about that. See, in the moment, now some of us quickly begin to realize that that's not right. But anger is very troubling because it is so righteous. That's what enables it to move to unrestrained wrath. And that's why Paul says in Colossians 3 there, lay aside anger. Now, anger isn't a sin, but it's not a big blessing either. And you actually find that you can do much better without it. But that's a learning process. That's something you learn. So now then, Jesus says, it was said of old, this is Matthew 5, 22, it was said of old, thou shalt not kill. But I say unto you, and then he goes through a teaching there about anger and about contempt. And if you remember the teaching there, It talks about saying words that express contempt. Don't call people fools. Don't say racha to them, which was a term of contempt. And of course the legalist will jump on that and say, well, okay, I won't call anyone a fool anymore. My grandmother wouldn't let me call my playmates fools. So I just said, I'll just think it. That's legalism. But children are so good at that, aren't they? See, they figure out how to deal. And of course, any explicit teaching like that can be defeated by the ingenuity of a human will. And so that's why you must understand when Jesus gives these illustrations like, don't call people fools, don't say raka, he's not giving a law, he is illustrating a life. and now of course we would never do that sort of thing around church anyway but what he's saying is that in the community of his friends they keep his commandment anger doesn't run the show can people disagree? of course can they be distressed? about what others are doing? Yes. But they don't have to be angry. And they can still act in love. So, now this is the point where we need to say explicitly what love is. Because love is a certain set of the will. It's not a feeling. If it were a feeling, you wouldn't be just told to do it. Though we can improve our feelings by efforts of will, still, here's what love is. Love is willing the good of what is loved. that's what love is now so let's test this now that's what it means to love God to love God is to want what God wants now love can have a dimension of delight but it may not and at a certain stage in your life you may not even delight in what God wants. You may think it's too hard. But if you're able to respect what God wants, you can probably move towards delighting in it. But love is basically willing the good of what is loved. So you don't love chocolate cake. No matter what you say, you don't love chocolate cake. because you do not will the good of chocolate cake. You want to eat it. That's different. That's different. And that's okay too. There's nothing wrong with that. That's perfectly appropriate. But when it comes to persons, of course, then it's different. And in that case, I have to watch out for desire, not just mine but theirs, because they may say to me, well, if you love me, you'll do what I want. And you have to say back, well, it depends on what you want. Because if I love you, that means I will your good. And if you want something that's not good for you, then I won't will that. See, we live in a culture that is largely incapable of distinguishing desire from love. And many people don't really know there is a difference. And that's one reason why we have problems with some of our social issues, things like homosexuality and so on. It gets us into confusions about desire and love. So when Jesus says, love, like I love you, he's saying something that's got a tremendous amount of power in it. And now then you can think, well, here are two thoughts. One, what would a community be like if that was really there? And then secondly, how do you get a community there? See, those are questions that we need to ask. And what kind of fellowship would have to be in such a community? And I mean very practical questions like, do we in our congregation do the things that will help people come together in such a way that love of this kind will be the bedrock reality. See, many of our fellowships, we just kind of test one another, want to check out their beliefs, see if we've got any bad habits or whatever. And that's about the closest we get to really coming to know one another. And that's partly due to the fact that we're scared of being known because we're not sure people love us. And if they don't love us and they get to know us, they could hurt us. And also then we may be worried about, if I love my fellow folks in the congregation, if I love them, it might require me to do things that I wouldn't want to do in terms of helping them. And so then there's a lot of guardedness that keeps us back from the test in John 13.35. The kind of love that Jesus had was so remarkably different that he was prepared to say, it's a dead giveaway. If you've got that kind of love, you must be my disciple. What does that say? By this shall all men know you're my disciples if you have love one for another. and I want to inject here we come back to it later this kind of loving requires tremendous strength in fact it isn't possible for human beings apart from their relationship to God because it will pull you in so far that unless you're anchored in God you'll not be able to stand it but of course that's what Jesus came to teach say, well, okay, you're going to be living in the kingdom of God. I've shown you how that's done. I've set you an example. We've seen something of the character and power. We're going to talk more about that later. The character and power that go into life in the kingdom of God, those two dimensions. But Jesus says, okay, that's going to be made available to you. And with that, as a support, it's possible to step into the kingdom of love and manifest. It's so hard not to just be shallow in talking about this. See, what that really means is it affects the interactions that we have with one another. Like, for example, well, let me talk about me and you can make your judgments. You see, if someone wants to talk with me, now, that is a radical relationship because among other things I'm going to want to I'm going to have to listen I have to listen I'm going to have to pay attention and I think you can say with considerable assurance that the first act of love is attention they used to say of Dick Halverson who was, you know, a really wonderful man and was chaplain of the Senate for a while. They used to say of him that when you talk to him, it's like the only person in the world was you. Man alive. Just think of what that means. You see, we have to really go down deep. We have to go down deep where, for example, as I listen and I'm thinking now about perhaps a need that you've presented to me. I have to approach that need with my hand in God's hand. Right? So that it doesn't matter what it is. How trivial or how profound. With the realization that I can't meet that need. But I'm the one who's on the spot. And God has to come in where I am, and I have to allow that to work and not take control of it. I hope that's making a little sense, because, you know, so often we just don't get down to the level of concreteness that we have to have if we're really going to talk about love. now we have these great gifts in our lives our children other love relationships and of course grandparents and one of the things about grandparents is they are given a great gift of love for their grandchildren and it's an amazing thing to watch I don't fully understand it but I'm so thankful for it because there is a level of attention because that's what a grandparent really does for a grandchild is they really pay attention to them and now it doesn't always go that well but that's just an illustration I think as if somehow we really were paying that kind of attention to one another in our fellowships and then we're getting there. We're getting down to the place to where we can talk about doing His commandments. We go to 4? Is that what the schedule is? 4.30. 4.30. Oh, good. Okay. Okay. So, the second thing now in this passage from John 15, a great shift now happens. so you have two things now in this passage about the people, the friends of Jesus as they come together to form a community and the second thing is no longer do I call you servants or slaves and he gives a reason very interesting the reason is that the slave does not know what his master is doing. Have you thought about that difference? A slave is not identified with the project in the way that a friend is. A friend has thought it through committed themselves, understands what needs to be done, among other things, they may not stand around asking, what do I do next? Because they have entered into the project of kingdom living, of bringing their life in, of living with others in that context of the kingdom. And so they are now active in trust of Jesus and trust of God. He says, all things that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. Hmm. So now, maybe I can illustrate it like this. One of the things that's wrong with the idea that you just ask, what would Jesus do? is Jesus would not be in a position of having to ask that question about most things. He would know. Sometimes people come to me and they say, what do you pray for? It's hard. That's where you have to listen lovingly and try to elicit what they're thinking about. But you can almost say any good thing. Any good thing you can pray for. And it really is better to start with small things if you're a beginner. Don't start with something that's very big because praying is a kingdom interaction and you really count. Now, many people have the practice of letting God off the hook when they pray by saying, if it be your will. But see, what this passage is challenging us is to realize that sometimes, indeed much of the time, we should know what would be a good thing for God. Now that doesn't mean He's going to do everything we say. See, that's an error that people get into. If you just get it right, then it will always happen. But it does mean that we take our initiative into the prayer. And we pray for what is good, and we ask for it to glorify Jesus, and to allow us to know the kingdom of God. We don't just stand around and say, What shall I do? Now that's a part of being responsible in God's image, is stepping out towards what is good, trusting God to go with you. That wouldn't be just in prayer. That would be in your plans for a business or for your church or whatever you're involved in. And this is a large part of what's involved in whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now sometimes God will speak to you. And sometimes He will not. But that is because He wants you to count for something and not just be a little person who tries to find out what the orders are and does them. Did you ever work with someone who was new on the job and they had to be told everything? And that's okay for a few days. But if that person stays in that position there's a problem. And I'd like to get you to thinking now that when we are living in this world out of our center, which is in our community of kingdom friends, shall we say, when we're living in this world, there is a large range of initiative that we are to understand the purposes of Christ well enough to begin to act in faith for what we know to be good. Now, since it isn't a mechanism, there will always be the cases where we make a mistake. We're not infallible. But since we know our Master well enough, and He knows us well enough, we know that that is not something that we have to avoid at all costs. See, many people want to hear God so they'll know what the will of God is, so they won't have to be responsible. And this is one of the things that Jesus, in all of his teachings brings about to us is that we're to be responsible. We have to make a judgment. So when you take his teachings and you turn them into laws, you run into areas where you don't know what to do. Like a case where, for example, he said, Give unto him that asketh of thee, and him that would borrow thee, turn not away. Well, what if you have money and you have other obligations. I'm not talking about trivial things like I promised my friend I'd go to the movie with him. But suppose you already owe the money on an electric bill. Do you give the person who asks you the money that you owe to another person? Well, you see, if you simply think in terms of Jesus giving you a set of rules to apply so you won't have to be responsible for judgment, you won't know what to do with that. If, on the other hand, you understand that Jesus is expressing a kind of life that will, in the appropriate conditions, have the effect of you giving to someone simply because they ask of you, which would not happen on the human way of doing it. The human way of doing it is, why should I give you any money? Why should I help you? The kingdom way is, maybe I should. And when it is appropriate, you actually do. Give what you're asked for. And you don't say things like, as in general, well, what's going to happen to me? That question is in the back of the mind when you look at all of the kingdom teachings. If I don't get angry, if I don't verbally mislead people, if I don't get a divorce, or whatever the issue is, I'm just referring to a number of the teachings in Matthew 5. So if I don't do that, what's going to happen to me? And the general answer to that is, you will still be alive in the gracious kingdom of God. So you don't have to run the world. You don't have to. But you still have to make decisions. You still have to make judgments. Now, in a community of love, you're free to do that. Not only free, you're expected to. You make decisions. And you make them in a framework of people who understand what their master is about. Now this is one of the more difficult points, I think, to get over, and that's why so often, almost with very little exception, when people get serious about the teachings of Jesus, they turn them into laws. And then that kills the whole operation. Because they will not do as laws. They're not meant to do as laws. That's why, for example, if you read Ephesians 4 and you read 1 Corinthians 13 and you read the Sermon on the Mount, they don't say the same things. You recognize that. Now the reason they don't say the same things is precisely they are not laws. If they were laws, they would say the same thing. It's because they're not laws that Paul and Jesus and Peter and John and the rest of them feel free to just express it the way they do, because they know that any one of those descriptions will be true of the person who has learned to live in the kingdom of love. So, for example, I mean, people often talk as if there was some great contrast between what Jesus taught and what Paul taught. But look, if you can do Colossians 3, you can do the Sermon on the Mount at a walk. And conversely, right? That's why, especially in our churches, we don't need to worry about the whole range of those things. Just take some of the central things and concentrate on teaching people how to do them. And if they learn how to do one of them, that will carry over to most of the rest of them. But we're talking about a life, an organic life, not just individually but of people together, learning to live together in love, letting others be free, learn, speak openly, be candid with one another about your life and about their life. And now this is going to require a different kind of covenant in most churches. I understand that. It is the covenant of discipleship together to Jesus. But we can move towards that. We have a form of non-disciple Christianity that has settled into the churches generally over the last 150 years or so, not to be precise. And so now we don't have a way of understanding faith in Jesus Christ that automatically leads to discipleship. We don't have an understanding, a teaching of grace that genuinely liberates us from legalisms. And so one of the things that goes on at a certain cut of Christian, and it goes also in politics, A certain cut is you have people who are angry at one another, disagreeing about things, writing books and articles that attack one another. You know, we just oughtn't to be in that business. A part of what it is to love is not to attack. Thank you.
