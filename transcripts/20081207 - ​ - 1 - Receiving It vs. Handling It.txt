Have you ever reflected on the fact that the single most life-changing event in Mary's life, the one that resulted in the birth of the Savior of the world, was at least to her an unplanned pregnancy? What was undoubtedly the most planned event in the history of the world from God's perspective was a complete surprise for Mary. And there must have been moments, maybe even entire months, when Mary wondered if God had picked the wrong woman. Because the life of God that was growing in her must have felt like the death of everything she knew. And yet her response amazingly was this. I am the Lord's servant. May it be to me according to your word. May it be to me. May it be. Now most of us know what to expect this Christmas season. We have our lists made and our plans laid out, even if our presents aren't bought yet. But during the first Christmas season, Mary's story revolves around an unexpected announcement. And she was invited by God to make room for it inside of her. So we're going to spend our time together in the weeks leading up to Christmas, taking a break from the way of the rabbi, and making room in our hearts for the king who still invites us into the unexpected. Because this king is no longer a baby. And this king is always inviting us into the unexpected. Let's pray together as we start. Now God, we consider it a great honor that you would invite us along on the journey of you making all things right. We consider it a great privilege that as you do new things in Maple Grove and the Twin Cities and around the world, as you go about your business of making things the way they should be, that you would consider us as partners. And so it's with fear and humility that we say yes. May it be. May it be to us just as you say. Right here in our hearts and right here in the world. Amen. Well, the first thing I notice about Mary's story is that God asks her to do something that she's completely unprepared to do. If you're 14 years old, you're about the age that Mary was when Mary got this announcement. It's way more than she could handle. Now, somewhere along the line, Christians began to believe a heresy that God would not give us more than we could handle. In fact, there's probably a bumper sticker out there somewhere that reduces what God does to that pithy little statement. And that's why I generally don't like bumper stickers that have to do with Christianity. Except for one I saw this week that went this way. It said, Jesus called. He wants his religion back. I love that one. But it's ridiculous to think that God won't give us more than we can handle. Of course God will. Of course God will. In fact, I think that one of God's most difficult jobs, at least in my life, is to get me to sign up for something that I need help on, that I am not completely capable on my own for. And some of you are thinking now, hold on, because I'm pretty sure there's a Bible verse that says that exact thing, isn't there? Well, in 1 Corinthians 10, 13, we read this, God is faithful, he will not let you be tempted beyond that which you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it. And if you've been at Open Door for any length of time, you know that way out is usually through. See, the context in these verses is temptation. Not the invitations that God invites us on like he did with young Mary. I know of nothing in scripture, in fact, that would indicate that God only asks us to do that which we can handle. In fact, it seems quite the opposite, that God invites his servants very frequently to do things that they are entirely incapable of. God asked Moses to demand that Pharaoh, who was the leader of the world at that time, to let the children of Israel simply go free, even though they were the slave labor force that sustained the entire economy of Egypt. Gideon was asked to defeat an entire army of enemies with only 300 soldiers at his side. And Esther was a woman with no power, who by her words and her courage prevented a holocaust in her time. In Luke 9, 1 through 3, we see what Jesus asked of his disciples. We read this, When Jesus had called the twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and cure diseases. And he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. And here comes the interesting part. He told them, take nothing for the journey. No staff, no bag, no bread, no cell phone, no iPod, no money, no extra shirt. Do not take anything with you. Now, there's a part of me that thinks that that's just mean. Go confront the very forces of evil. Heal the sick, but don't bring a thing with you. But then we read in verse 6 these amazing words. So they set out. Do you think they feel prepared for that? Do you think they felt like they could handle that assignment of going and taking on the forces of evil and curing diseases? No way. So how do you become the kind of person like Moses and Gideon and Esther and Mary that responds the way, again, that Mary did? May it be to me, according to your word, when God invites you into things that you feel utterly unprepared to do, how do you have that kind of posture? May it be to me, just like you said. Now maybe you're like me, I really don't like things that are unexpected I don't like the feeling that I might be unprepared or incapable of anything I like to feel like I am in control of the situation And I like to be prepared even for the unexpected But lately my life has been filled with all kinds of unexpected surprises That are literally keeping me up at night wondering how in the world that I'm going to handle them. So recently I journaled out some of these fears as a sort of prayer, and I'm not actually sure if what I did was prayer or just worry. Maybe you've been there, but in the middle of it all, I felt God inviting me into something. In the middle of my fear and worrying and can I handle it? And so these are the words that I wrote down. My impression of what God was inviting me into. I felt like God said to me, I know you're afraid. And I know that you really are very capable. But you are limited by your capability. You are limited to what you can do. So let's put you in some situations where you're not so capable. And let's see what we can do together. those are the words I wrote down and I made this terrible mistake I said yes to that invitation here's the problem though ever since I spent most not all but most of my time trying to figure out how it is that I can handle these new unexpected invitations I am a slow learner but Mary Mary's story anyway is helping me to learn because I'm coming to believe that in order to engage the unexpected things that God invites us into we have to change our question we can no longer ask how can I handle it we must start asking how can I receive it we have to switch from how can I handle it to how can I receive it because how can I handle it is all about management and control. It's actually making sure, if we're focused only on this question, how can I handle it, it's making sure that we are protected from the unexpected thing. And when we focus on this question, hear this, I believe we are practicing a form of spiritual birth control. Because we are protecting ourselves from the unexpected life that God might want to bring into us because we are so afraid that we can't handle it. Now I'm not saying don't have a strategy for how to deal with difficult situations. I'm not saying don't have a plan or don't be planful about things. What I am saying is that when your planning becomes a kind of obsession where you have to be on top of every single thing that comes your way, I think you end up rejecting, without even knowing it sometimes, rejecting invitations that God has. Because God is always trying to do something that you can't do. That's why God's trying to do it. See, I'm coming to believe that in order to receive an unexpected invitation like God gave to Mary. And to faithfully carry it to term, we have to remove our need to control it. We have to move from how can I handle it to how can I receive it. Now it's interesting, when the angel Gabriel, as you saw in the video, approached Mary, I want you to notice what he said. These are the first words that come out of his mouth. He says this, a message from God to Mary. He says, greetings, you who are highly favored. The Lord is with you in Luke 1.28. First thing he says, greetings, you who are highly favored. The Lord is with you. Notice what he did not say. He did not say, greetings, you who are highly capable. What I'm about to say to you will be no big deal for someone as fantastic as you are. You can handle this. But if I'm honest, there's something in me that would prefer that message. When God invites me to do something that I feel like I can't do. Because I want to know that I can handle it. That I'm capable of it. That I can do it all on my own. It's very interesting that when Jesus was baptized by John in the waters, a voice came from heaven saying very similar words. this is my son my beloved son in whom I am well pleased interesting the message that Mary got was this you are favored by God Mary and God is with you in this God is with you in this and that's what I need to hear in order to receive the unexpected invitations into which God calls me. Amen? It's what carried Moses into Pharaoh's presence even though he was terrified. It's what enabled Gideon to blow the trumpets and break the jars and start the battle. It's what gave Esther the courage to say what she needed to say for such a time as this, as she was in, even though she knew that her life might be ended as soon as she uttered those words. It's what enabled the disciples to set out without money or even a change of clothes. It's what enabled Mary to say to God, I am the Lord's servant. May it be to me according to your word. And I wonder if Mary didn't teach this to her son, who years later sat in a lonely garden, his friends asleep. And he prayed this desperate prayer, God, may this cup pass from me, but not my will. May it be to me according to your word, because I am your servant. And it is what will enable you to enter into and receive the invitation that God has for you, that you feel completely and utterly unprepared to do. When God calls you into the unexpected thing, and when you wake up in the middle of the night with worry, you do not need to know that you are capable of doing it. God's message to you is not greetings you who are capable. It is greetings, favored one. I am with you. Because wherever I call you, I'm already there. Whatever it is that you need to do, I am there doing it. You need to receive that truth. But even as you do, even as you fearfully receive the invitation and say, may it be done to me just as you say. There's another misconception that we have that all of a sudden everything will be fine and easy, and it won't. Saying that will not magically take away all the risk or the pain. I'm pretty sure Mary experienced morning sickness and had to wash throw up out of her hair a time or two. And at 12 years old, little teenager Jesus went missing for three days. He was in the temple talking with religious leaders. Three days. Can you imagine being gone from your son for three days? When they finally found him, in the Greek, it's kind of like, what's up, Jesus? And Jesus said, well, kind of a sassy teenage response. He said, you know, I'm just doing my father's business. When Joseph and Mary took Jesus to the temple as a newborn, the blessing Mary got was this. Now think about it. This is dedication day. Jesus is probably dressed in that one little white dress that's been passed down for generations, you know. The relatives are all around with their cameras and everything. It's a joyous day. And then the pastor prays this prayer. Everyone gets real quiet because the prayer is different than all the other prayers of dedication. In Luke 2.35, we read this blessing. This child that you carried to turn, Mary, this child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be spoken against so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And Mary, you need to know that a sword will pierce your own soul too. So happy dedication. With the shudder, Mary must have realized suddenly that carrying Jesus in her womb and delivering him on that cold night was not even going to be the hardest part about it. She was going to have to share in the pain that Jesus would have to endure. Now next week we're going to talk a lot more about what it means to receive an invitation from God and to faithfully carry it to term, carrying the life of God in us that we've received. We're going to talk about the price that we pay for that. But as we come to the table in a few moments, as you receive the bread of life into you, as you take the cup of salvation into you, I'd like to invite you to take a moment to make room inside of you for an invitation from God that might be unexpected that God wants to carry out with you. That invitation might be something simple, like one word. It might be simply, stay. Stay. Stay. Right now, you are tempted to run. And the invitation might be to stay. A couple friends and I were talking about being fathers and what do we need to do for our kids and talking about all these things, what do our kids need and what kind of words they need of blessing, what kind of other relationships do they need. And we were worried about maybe we're going to mess them up. One of our friends told us that his dad left when he was very young. He just never heard from him again. and he looked at us and he says, you guys are going to be great dads just because you're just going to stay. I know it's complicated. I don't know your story. But some of you may hear the invitation from God today to stay. Others of you might hear a word to give. As you look at your checkbook and the balance might not be where you want it to be. And you hear of a need of a friend. And you think, how in the world can I do it? And then you might think, how in the world can I not do it? When God is inviting you into something that is completely unexpected and that you are unprepared to do. You also might have to deal with something that's unexpected that did not come from God. Something that was a result of a terrible accident or a terrible tragedy or misfortune. And as you take the bread of life in, and as you take the cup of salvation in, my invitation to you is to ask God where the invitation might be in this. Even this. Even that. Well, how am I receiving the bread of life and the cup of salvation into you, enable you to receive these words, to hear these words from God. Greetings, you who are highly favored. The Lord is with you. Yes, you. How might receiving the bread of life and the cup of salvation in enable you to hear the unexpected invitation that God might have for you today in this season? How might receiving the bread of life and the cup of salvation enable you to echo the words of Mary who said, I am the Lord's servant. May it be to me according to your word. And how might receiving the bread of life and the cup of salvation into you enable you to change your question from how can I handle this to how can I receive this? Amen. Thank you. Thank you.
