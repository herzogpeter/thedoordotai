a part of what it is to love is not withdraw. But we in our self-righteous concerns with correctness, because we haven't got past legalism, can justify attacking and withdrawing within the fellowship of believers. This is, you know, this oughtn't to be something that we even need to talk about. Now, since Christ is building His church, we can speak the truth in love, as Paul says in Ephesians 4, the body building it up, speaking the truth in love, everyone contributing. We can do that because we're trusting grace. God's action in our life to accomplish what we can't accomplish on our own. So, suppose someone has the misfortune to disagree with me. Well, what should my approach to that be? Love. I should will the good of that person. Now, if there is some manner that I can act in relationship, then I should do that. It may be that there's not something much that's appropriate for me to do, but nevertheless, my will should be set to bless and love that person. And now, if we've been in a setting where someone has taught us how to bless people, then we can do that. but we may not have been in that context. See, I mean, just take the great Aaronic blessing, the Lord bless you and keep you. Lord make his face to shine upon you, be gracious unto you. The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Wonderful blessing. That's one of the things that we can keep circulating in our mind as we go through the day. And that isn't even for people who are cursing us. Jesus teaches us how to bless those who curse us. See, that response is a response of love. Now, if that's the heart of our fellowships, then we can be intimate with one another without fear. And we can accordingly give and pray more effectively for those who are around us. And we learn to look upon those who are really around us in our fellowship as fellow pilgrims full of glory on their way to glory. And that transforms everything. Now then, we're getting towards a community which can stand in the earth and bring forth the blessing to mankind of the Abrahamic covenant. For God said to Abraham, In you and in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. And when you think about Jesus, that's what you want to think about. That's the blessing that comes through. How does it come? It comes through you and me. We're the ones. We are the salt of the earth. We are the light of the world. That's what God intended for us to be. Actually, that's what He intended for every individual human being to be wherever they are, was to be the light and the salt in that place. And we can be that as we learn to live in the kingdom of God. And the world, instead of struggling around in darkness, would have a light to look at. And we wouldn't have to keep apologizing for not doing the things that Jesus said. because we would just do them. So now go back to the first thing I said to you was all the things that are present in the Scriptures about the kind of life that God gives to us are within our reach. And now we add that will only be fulfilled as we trust Jesus, step into the kingdom, and learn to live with others in the kind of love that he had. Well, I just have a few more minutes before let's have questions. but I should emphasize that you only get this through a decision to be a disciple of Jesus. That's the only way it comes. You can't get a community like that unless they are disciples of Jesus. And so let me just take a moment or two to say what a disciple is. A disciple is a student. it's a student it's definitely not someone who subscribes to a program or the beliefs of somebody it is someone who is a student and a student of course is a person who is with someone learning what they know so now Now as a disciple of Jesus, I have stepped into the kingdom and I'm learning from him how to live in the kingdom in the way he does. And in particular, I'm learning how to lead my life in the kingdom of God as he would lead my life if he were I. I'd better write that down. There's little involved here. It's one reason why people run when they hear a philosopher. I am learning from him, from him, from Jesus, how to lead my life. And see, that's the life we're interested in. It isn't actually Jesus' life. He led his. Now, it's our turn. So, how to lead my life as he would lead my life, again, if he were I. So, a disciple, as a disciple, that's what I'm learning. and we'll have to talk in more detail about what that involves but that would mean that I would be taking his teachings and I would recognize where they apply in my days and hours as I go through my life and then I would open those days and hours to him and listen. I would read the Scripture because he's told me a lot already in there and isn't really going to set any of that aside. So I would take his teachings in Scriptures and then I would go beyond that in the affairs of my life. For example, the Scriptures don't say anything about committee meetings. I have to sit through a lot of committee meetings. How would Jesus do that if he were I? What would be the way that he put himself into that? How would he pray about it? What would he try to accomplish? How would he listen to other people? How would he try to clarify issues? Because you know how committee meetings are. It's very hard to get people to stay to the point. And one of the main tasks of a chairperson is to keep people addressing the question and not wander off to other interesting things. How would Jesus do that? I have to learn that. That's what goes into discipleship. And then all the other things that you might be doing in your life, you would invite Him to be with you, to act with you, to speak with you as you go through that. And then you will face choices like, well, if I do that, what's going to happen to me? That's the temptation. And so then you learn to answer that, well, this, I believe, is right, and so I will do this in love and God will take care of me. Now then, is that going to be true? See, that's the acid test, if you wish. And I have to live through that to see how that is true. How will God take care of me? Now, if we stay with that and we receive ministry from our fellowship, the leaders and others, If we stay with that, we receive ministry, we receive the Spirit's movement in ways that inform us and direct us, then we test it out and know the reality of the kingdom. No one can tell you about this in the sense that it will convince you. You have to come to it by experience. I can tell you that, but that isn't what will bring conviction. What will bring conviction is you acting in that way and finding the reality of the kingdom present with you. And some ways are more forceful than others possibly. For example, if you're praying for someone's healing, that's a typical place where you're setting yourself right there in the midst of kingdom reality, and now what's going to happen? Well, you have to step into it. I mean, there are stages, like, for example, stopping saying, I will pray for you, and saying, let's pray now, is a big step. Involves some faith. Use the faith you have. Then, I am sure that if you do that, your faith is going to grow. And you will learn more and more about how to pray for people. That's the path of experience. You do it by learning from Jesus how to do that sort of thing. So He's our teacher, and we enter the kingdom and surrender our life to Him as much as we know how. It'll grow. You can't do it all at once. We couldn't stand it. And maybe if we could, our relatives couldn't. So you step into it. The way it works is from faith to faith. you act on the faith you have and the experience of the reality of the kingdom gives you more faith. And then a community of love grows out of that and you have people who are actually in their relationship to one another able to obey Christ and do what He said. Well, I think I've probably loaded enough off on you for this afternoon But we do have some time for questions and comments if you have something you'd like to add in. The danger is if you don't say something, I'm apt to start talking again. So we really do need to have the interaction. You've got to take him up on it. I'm just going to prime the pump here a little bit. We've only got a half hour so we can't take too long on this. Okay. However you want to go. Thinking of our overarching theme today of the church as a community of the kingdom of God. Right. You talked some in your first session about the kingdom as reality. Yes. And so we were talking a lot this morning when you weren't here about that being a community of the kingdom. You know, we talked about being an ambassador of the kingdom, as Paul talked about. In The Divine Conspiracy, you write about Jesus seeing and living in a God-bathed world. Yes. How does thatâ€¦talk a little bit about how that would help us actually be ambassadors and be a community of that reality. The main point here is that the kingdom is much greater than the church, and that in fact, the cosmos and human history and all of that is under the kingdom of God. And now then, Jesus often looks ridiculous confidence in the presence of the kingdom. You know, why worry, he says. Look at the birds and the flowers and so on. Why worry? Well, the reason that you worry is, of course, because you're not sure he's in charge. And that extends to some pretty tough stuff. People get hurt and are killed and there are all kinds of things that happen. Now, if you do come to the place to where you can see this cosmos as a place, or the world, as I say in one passage, the world is a perfectly safe place for us to be, then you will have an incredible effect on everyone around you, partly intentional and partly not. One of the things that Jesus said about us, that those who believe on me from their belly shall flow rivers of living water. I'm glad he didn't say from their mouth, from their belly. That means the center of where they live. There's going to be something coming out from those people that is so different, the reality of the kingdom, the presence of the Spirit, that is so different that people cannot not be affected by it. Now, they still need to talk because they won't understand. able to say it's odd. And that passage in 2 Peter where he talks about be ready to give an answer to everyone of the faith. That's a context where people are happy in suffering. That's the thing about joy, kingdom joy, Christian joy, if you wish. The joy that Jesus gives is that it's perfectly compatible with suffering. Paul says in 2 Corinthians, suffering yet always joyous. See, joy is a pervasive sense of well-being. That's what joy is. It's a pervasive sense of well-being. And so we can sing that old song, It is well with my soul. When peace like a river attendeth my way. When sorrows like sea bellows row. It's well with my soul. That kind of person has a kingdom reality out of which to speak, and that is what witnessing really is. Witnessing is causing people to know something. And you then can speak and help people understand why that difference is there. Our problem, I think, Todd, today is that because we have adopted a consumer model of Christianity, Often the difference just isn't there. But we have the privilege in our churches of bringing people to that place. And then the missional side is something that will be a natural expression. We talk a lot about missional stuff today, and people write books, and it's important to talk about. But I do think we really need to avoid the idea that missional activity is something that we could or could not just add on. And we miss the point that it is an inevitable and natural effect of the inward transformation that people go through as they live in the church as Jesus' friends. So without saying it, learning to live my life as Jesus would live it if he were I has a natural missional effect. Yes, and this is what Jesus is talking about when he says, a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Now, you might think about trying to hide Minneapolis. Is it set on a hill? Well, Denver. Trying to hide Denver. And that's one of... Jesus often said things that were really quite humorous. and that's another one of his statements, you know. You can't hide it. All right, let's get a little interaction here. Yes, sir. Here and then Dallas. Would you define for us, again, the first heaven that you talked about in Divine Conspiracy and the role that that might play as active in the kingdom of God? Yes, the first heaven is the atmosphere around you. That's the Jewish conception. There are three heavens. The atmosphere, the one is the heavens of the birds and the clouds. The next heaven is the heaven of the stars. And the next heaven is the heaven of the angels. So there were, that's the main division they used. They did use, they cut it a little finer in some places and had seven. But in the New Testament context, and by the way, a wonderful place to see that is right in the opening of Acts, where some, like I use the New American Standard usually because I think it is more accurate. It's not as good in literary terms. But for example, here in Acts 1.10, as they were gazing intently into the sky while Jesus was departing, now that's sky. They're gazing in the sky. Why? Well, because it was right there. And the men standing there said, verse 11, men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? Now, this Jesus who has been taken up from you into, and now the new American standard translates exactly the same word as heaven. Taken up from you into heaven will come in just the same way you have watched him go into heaven. But it previously said he went into the sky. What's the deal here? You see, the modern mind has trouble with this. It's got trouble anyway, but... And now, when you jump over to Acts 2.2, which we referred to briefly ago, suddenly there came from heaven, no, no, the sky. Or, translate heaven all the way. The point is that the experience of Israel with God was precisely God's presence in the atmosphere. That's where they dealt with God. And it was a great step forward, and it was a very painful step, when they moved in the exile to Babylon and discovered that God was still there. And that's where the idea of the God of heaven begins to emerge biblically. And you can trace this out with your concordance. It would be a very interesting study for you. But basically, God deals with us from the sky. Now what does that mean when I pray, our Father who art in heaven? Well, if you understand that that refers to the sky, that refers to God being here. God is here. He's elsewhere also, but he's here. And when I say, our Father who art in heaven, I'm praying, our Father always near because the point about the God of heaven was His immediate accessibility to the individual living here. And we lose that today because when we say heaven, we mean beyond the moon or something like that, certainly beyond the moon. That is not the biblical view. And so Peter on the rooftop in Joppa, the Scripture says, the sheet with all the animals was lowered, and now you get your choice. Heaven or sky? Well, it was lowered out of what we would call the sky, the atmosphere right here. And this is a really important thing when you understand that Matthew nearly always uses the phrase "Kingdom of the heavens," plural. And the kingdom of the heavens is the same thing as the kingdom of God. They aren't two different things, but they are different ways of referring to the same thing. And the reason that Matthew uses that phrase is because he is incorporating the Jewish perception of God in a way that when you go to Luke or even Mark or John, they're not really into that. They're talking in a more cosmopolitan setting. And so they use the kingdom of God, though they also talk about the heavens. Paul talks about the heavens, and they all mean the presence of God here and now. That's so crucial because, you know, if God is far away, He's far away. And what it means for your faith is that you will think of him as distant. You will think of him as inaccessible. And people do this all the time. They say, well, how can God hear me if he's all that distance away? These are not very sophisticated questions, but they're real questions. They don't have to be sophisticated to hurt us. So, God is here. God is present. And he cares. in many, many ways. That is what Jesus is teaching us, and that's what we want to take in our lives, in all of the things that happen, that God is here. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. Why? Because God is with me. And the with God life is something that goes from the beginning of the Scriptures to the end. You watch how often that phrase, God was with him, occurs. Jesus too. The great vineyard, Acts 10, 38 verse, you know, emphasized God was with him. Jesus. What does it mean God was with him? It means God is acting with him in his presence, causing things to happen. Isaac, God was with him so much that he was scary, and his neighbors asked him to move. You read the story. And then they wanted to make an alliance with him. That's the God of the sky. When you spoke about being filled with the Spirit, you mentioned surrendering yourself to the action of God, and then not focusing on the manifestations of filling. And then you said something about action and passivity, that sometimes that combination can defeat people. It does, because they can't understand how it works and it paralyzes them. Could you elaborate on action and passivity? Yes. Well, in the case of filling with the Spirit, see, the reality here is precisely God acting with us. But in most of the cases that we deal with practically, we have to act or nothing will happen. A crude metaphor here that I like to use is power steering. See if you have power steering in your car, which you probably do nowadays, but some of you may be able to remember when we didn't have that. And it was all your action. You had to wrench that thing around. Now, you don't have to do that, but if you don't do something, nothing will happen. I hope. You don't want power steering acting on its own. But you do something, and then something bigger than you takes over. And the way you know the presence of the Spirit in human life is that the outcome is incommensurable with the input. And so over and over again in teaching the difference between the Spirit and the flesh, that is what is emphasized. So, Ishmael is a child of the flesh. Why? Because it was all human. Isaac is a child of promise. The Spirit. Why? Because Isaac was beyond the capabilities of Abraham and Sarah. And that is a classic illustration that Paul pulls out in Galatians to illustrate the difference. So now in being filled with the Spirit, see, what we want to do is make more and more space as we learn how for God to be present. Basically, it's breaking habits. Because our habit is to seize it and make it go. And that's one of the things that we have to learn differently on. So, for example, in speaking or whatever you would do in the way of a service to Christ, it would be a disaster if you simply trusted your own abilities. Paul is a wonderful teacher about this because I don't know if it's ever struck you how he just took off up through Asia Minor and left a string of churches behind him. How did he do that? Well, he knew how he did it. He knew that when he spoke, God spoke with him. Listen to these words in 2 Corinthians 1.12. For our confidence is in this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godless sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world and especially towards you. And see, like Todd and I or others who you hear who speak, you know that when you speak for God, you do not trust your capacities to get people to believe things. Now, you do your best and you study and you try to understand things, but you don't trust that. So that's the big deal about passivity and activity. You're active, but you don't trust in your action. You trust in the God who acts with you. Another lovely illustration of that in Paul's case is in 1 Thessalonians. 1 Thessalonians 1, 4 and following. Knowing, brethren, beloved by God, His choice of you. Now what Paul is saying is, I know that God chose you. Here's why. For our gospel did not come to you in word only. Now, word only would be Paul's ability, see. That would be what he calls flesh. Flesh is what you can do without any help from God, roughly. It's not a bad thing unless it assumes an ultimate position, then it's a bad thing. That's what happened with Abraham and Hagar, or Abraham, Sarah, and Hagar. See, flesh was, okay, we've got to do this thing. And so they did. For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction, just as you know what kind of men we prove to be among you for your sake. Now see, he's saying, I know that you've been chosen of God. because the response you gave was to God and not to us. And again, if you look at what he actually was able to accomplish, you're going to agree it wasn't him. It was God. So when we read the statement of Jesus, without me you can do nothing, you want to remember that if you do nothing, it will be without him. If you do nothing, it will be without him. That's a rule of thumb, and of course he can do anything he wants to. And now he's talking to people who already have new life in them. So he's not saying that the initiative lies with you in salvation. That's a touchy theological point, and it's a very important one. I personally believe that until you have come to new life by your relationship to Christ, you will not do anything, whether or not you can do anything. These are touchy points and people often ask me if I believe in total depravity and I always tell them I believe in enough depravity. There's enough depravity that no one will ever be able to say, "Well, I did it on my own." Or, "I'm the one who did it." So, it's a tricky thing and passivity and activity, I mean, it's the election, all these difficult issues. But we just have to remember that in human relations, nearly all is a combination of activity and passivity that you can't separate out and say, "Well, this belongs to this person, That belongs to that person. Like a conversation. You can't separate passivity and activity out of a conversation and say this person was passive and that was active. Or dance. You know, when men and women used to dance together instead of stand in separate places and wiggle. You had one who led and one who followed. But the truth is you can't separate that. It isn't like the leader is active and the follower is passive. Interesting illustration. Paul in Romans speaks of the struggle he has with the old nature or the body of death. And so there's been a teaching around that we have to die to self and kill ourselves. When we don't live this way, it means that we're not dead, dead. We're just mostly dead. I'm just wondering how do you reconcile some of his struggles with what you're teaching? Well, let me address it a bit. This is a very deep and complicated set of issues, and so you come back at me, if you will, if I don't manage to address that. Actually, this ties right back into the activity-passivity thing. See, what Jesus said in one place was, as you know, that if you would save your life, you must lose it. And that looks paradoxical until you understand what it means. It means that you have to turn loose of your kingdom and in that sense die to self. See, many people have taken death to self to be a denial that I have a self. And it's the farthest thing from the truth. It's rather a teaching about where you place the self. And to die to self, in very simple terms, by the way, and simple terms are good ones if you can get them, very simple terms, to die to self just means, if I don't get my way, it's no big deal. That's death to self. And disciplines like fasting, for example, are primarily training in death to self, because in fasting, you practice not getting what you want. and one way of expressing the disciplinary effects of fasting is to say that you learn how to be sweet and strong when you don't get what you want. Right? You know, you don't want to die if I don't get something to eat. Typical kid says that, you know. No, you're not going to die. You know? So now, suppose someone verbally mistreats me or abuses me on the road or wherever. It's nothing. Right? That's death to self. It means that you are not governed by what you regard as the good and the evil that happens to you. another dimension of it would be you wouldn't be arrogant and you wouldn't be prideful in the bad sense because that's just not where you're living now if you are there you're going to have a different world and so now then when Paul in another passage says I am crucified with Christ and I hope you'll notice how often that type of language shows up because we have a very shrunken idea of atonement if we don't see it in a way that relates it to the spiritual life. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, Christ died for all that we might not live unto ourselves. That's why he died? That's one of the reasons why he died. And now, he didn't go to crucifixion, so we wouldn't have to go to crucifixion. He went so we could go with Him. And by so doing, step into resurrection life with Him. So now Paul says in Galatians 2, I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me. And the life that I now live, I live by the faith. So that's the back and forth you get. The crucial error for death to self is precisely that I am not what it's all about. Now, am I important? Yes, I am important to God, and I'm important to others, but that's not an ego thing. That's a realistic appraisal of my significance in human life and in the eyes of God. And see, that's the old view of the death to self, which often found expressing itself, oh I am nothing, nothing, nothing. It's just false. You are something, something, something. And something very important. But, you're not the king. Death to self says, I'm not the king. So if I don't get my way, that's okay. And, now then, And with that one move, probably about 95% of anger is just gone. Because anger is fundamentally a will phenomena. You get angry when your will is crossed. It doesn't matter how important or how unimportant it is. In Los Angeles, we shoot people over parking spaces and think nothing of it. But the thing that brings the anger out is the will is crossed. and the point of the cross is to cut that connection with self-will. Self-will, again, that's a misleading term. There isn't any other kind of will than self-will. So you just have to do all sorts of little careful distinctions here. There isn't anything wrong with having a will. But if what you will is to advance yourself uber alis, that's where you need the cross. And so, once we understand that, then we can accept the fact that you really are something, you really are important, but you're not running the show. And actually, a good way to put it is, since I'm not running the show, I don't have to be sticking up for my importance. God will see to that. Did I talk that long? Did I talk that long? Well, I think you did good. All right. That was good. I better shut up while I'm ahead. Thank you. We're going to take two hours.
