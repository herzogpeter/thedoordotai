Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. My name is Steve Weens. I'm the teaching pastor here at Open Door, and I want to welcome you all on this Memorial Day weekend. And as we move to the message, I would like to pray. And as we move to prayer, I want to recognize that there are some of you who have lost loved ones as a result of war, either this war or wars in the past, and so we want to lift you up in our prayers for that. Yeah, let's pray together. Jesus, we thank you for being a rabbi who cares about our lives and about our pain and about the things that excite us, about the things that bring us tears. And so we do pray for those of us who have lost loved ones. Pray for comfort. And we pray for peace to come in the world. And God, as I move into the talk, I really do pray that your son would inhabit me with his spirit. That through a mysterious thing that would happen beyond words and time, your spirit really would speak. So we ask that in your name. Amen? Amen. Well, if you haven't been with us, you don't know that we've been dealing with for about a year and a half a series we've called the Way of the Rabbi. And we're dealing these days with a certain teaching of Jesus found in the Sermon on the Mount beginning in Matthew chapter 5, where Jesus takes a small group of friends away to a mountain, maybe for the weekend. And they don't talk about religious theory. They talk about the real stuff of life, stuff that they deal with, like anger and lust and contempt. And in Matthew 5.31, Jesus says, guys, if we're going to talk about anger and lust and contempt, then we're going to have to talk about the way in which you treat women. We're going to have to talk about that. And we could almost hear Peter gulp. And Andrew shift around in nervousness. As we found out last week that a righteous Jewish man who was following the law could divorce his wife for what they interpreted as any indecency. Even burning the bagels, which is Dave's favorite joke on that. When that happened, when a woman was divorced by her husband in those days, she was given one of three options. The first option was she could find a couch at the home of a begrudging relative. The second option is she could get remarried, though she would be such damaged goods that her status would be little more than property. Or three, she could become a prostitute. Three options for women who got divorced. So in a culture, into a culture where the gavel comes down hard on women, declaring them guilty of whatever it was that men thought they were guilty of, Jesus comes in and with his words he stops the proceedings. And instead he places the righteous Jewish men of his culture on trial and declares them guilty of treating the daughters of Eve with anger. with lust and with contempt. And so later on in the book of Matthew, when Jesus was asked by some Pharisees and teachers of the law why Moses commanded them to issue a decree or a certificate of divorce to the women that they were divorcing, Jesus condemns not only their low view of women or of marriage, but their low view of women. In Matthew 19, 8, we hear these words of Jesus. Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard, but it was not this way from the beginning. It's interesting, this phrase in the Greek for hardness of heart literally means to be uncircumcised in heart and ears. And to a Jewish man, that's about the worst thing that they could hear. It would be like Jesus saying this, guys, in this arena, you need to understand that you are like ignorant, uncircumcised pagans. And because of your stubbornness and your unwillingness to be taught or to even understand, Moses told you to give your wives a certificate of divorce as a feeble attempt at protecting them from you. as Dave mentioned last week we find sort of the prophetic prequel to this rebuke in Malachi 2 16 we read this I hate divorce says the Lord God of Israel and I hate it when people clothe themselves with injustice says the Lord God Almighty now I was stumbling across the King James version this week, and I want you to hear their translation because it's especially poignant. In the King James version, we read this, For the Lord, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away. For one covereth violence with his garment, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore take heed to your spirit that ye deal not treacherously. And I find it interesting that the words used, in the King James Version at least, to describe divorce were putting away. Now, this is not the phrase that you use like when you put away your winter coats next week. This is a phrase used for when you put something away for which you have no more use. It's where you put trash. And this is where we've put the daughters of Eve. But it was not that way from the beginning, Jesus says. Now this week in my studies, I just have to let you in on this. This was a struggle. Because as we start looking at how the sons of Adam have treated the daughters of Eve, these faces kept popping up in my mind. My little nieces, seven years old and younger, I began saying, man, what kind of world are they growing up into? And have we gotten so much better? And I thought about my son, and I wondered how it is that he's going to learn about treating women. And so this talk, during this talk, man, you're going to be a little bit on the hot seat, but I'm right there with you. So what I want to invite you into, into the uncomfortable examining of how the sons of Adam are still treating the daughters of Eve. And I need to know if you're with me. Are you with me? So let's dive into it. On the website for the International Justice Mission, you can read about a 14-year-old girl who lived in Southeast Asia. And she escaped from her abusive home and found a job by meeting a woman who gave her a job amending clothes. And she really eagerly accepted the job when she found out that there was also a place for her to sleep at night because she was homeless. So she took the job and went and slept her first night there only to find out in the morning that the woman was gone and that she was in a brothel. She was held there against her will for two years before she was freed by the investigators of International Justice Mission. And there are two million other children, children, mostly girls, who are facing that reality right now. Right now. And it was not that way in the beginning. The gavel still comes down hard on women in our culture. One of my friends, she's a woman. She also happens to be a very gifted preacher. And the last time she spoke at her church, a man came up to her afterwards, and he was a little surprised, and he said, you know, you were preaching. you weren't just sharing and you were preaching like from the Bible and there were men in the room and my friend was a little nonplussed and this person began to press on her where she felt she got the authority to do that and she said well the elders in my church really say that it's not only okay, but that the voices of preachers who are gifted that way, regardless of gender, are needed. And my friend's name is Jen Linwall. And that happened here at Open Door. And so we just need to clarify where we're at on that issue. It's the stance of the elders of this church that the giftings of teaching and leadership come based on spiritual gifts and not on gender. but that's not the way it is for a lot of places and in a lot of places the wonderful, gifted, passionate authoritative voice of Jen Linwall would be put away and that just makes me sad I was watching a movie the other day that depicted an all too common scene this teenage daughter very normal teenage daughter braces, frizzy hair, the whole deal she was stressed out because of this test coming up and her dad was helping her study for the test where her mom came home and she had just gone shopping for her and she had these bags of of clothes and so the daughter her face lit up and she pulled out the jacket and she tried it on it was too small and so she checked the size and she looked at her mom and said mom size eight and then she went to the next bag and started looking at the sizes of all the other clothes and they were all a size too small for her. And the look of betrayal and shock on her face was met with her mother's response, which said, oh honey, you're gonna lose the weight and then you'll be beautiful. Well, in a culture where women are dying for people to see their soul, we obsessively rate them according to the size of their bodies, and in doing so, the gavel comes down hard on women, and they are put away, especially if their bodies don't match the culture's standard. But you've got to hear this, it wasn't this way at the beginning. It wasn't. So let's take a look at the beginning. Because understanding where we came from may be the only hope of getting freed from the trash heap, both men and women. In Genesis 1.26, we read this, Let us make human beings in our image, says God, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds of the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, over all the creatures that move on the ground. So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God, he created them. Male and female, he created them. Two quick observations about this passage. Number one, both males and females are created in the image of God. So we can assume that what is best about masculinity and what is best about femininity, Both exist within God. God isn't male or female. God is actually above gender. Within God exists what is best about masculinity and femininity. And so in order to image God, we need both. The second observation from Genesis 1.26 is that God decreed from the beginning that the sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve would co-reign and co-rule the earth together. And this is part of what it means for us to image God, that males and females would rule together the way the Trinity rules together in community, the entire universe. so back up off of that because that may be new for many of us what does that look like and specifically what was in God's mind when he created the first woman when he created Eve what was God thinking about we get a clue from the words that are written in Genesis 2 18 where God is hanging out and he all of a sudden realizes it is not good for the man to be alone Of course, he always knew that that was going to be true. He says, I will make a helper suitable to him. I will make a helper suitable to him. Now, does that phrase helper suitable or suitable helper, does that sound pejorative to anyone else? I mean, a suitable helper? like that's the definition of women if you read other translations that was from the tniv if you read some of the other translations they don't give us a lot more help we read helper or companion or partner or the worst help meet so i can see my little nieces you know frolicking in a field of daisies saying, yay, I get to be a help meat. That is always what I've wanted to be. Well, this is where it's one of those times that we got to get back to the original language because it's very helpful because some of those words are less translations and more interpretations. The phrase used in Hebrew to describe woman is a phrase called ezer kinegdo. Hebrew scholar Robert Alter who has studied Genesis for years helps us here said the word Ezer is used only 20 other times in the Hebrew scriptures in every instance Ezer refers to the powerful help that comes from God alone to a people who are in desperate need a better translation for Ezer other than helper would be life saver lifesaver Psalm 20 1 and 2 we read about Azer may the Lord answer you when you are in distress may the name of the God of Jacob protect you may he send you Azer help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion that's a little different picture than someone that helps you with your slippers right Psalm 33 20 says this we wait in hope for the Lord he is our azer and our shield azer means powerful help that comes in a time of desperate need and kinegdo means alongside or face-to-face it means counterpart so together azer kinegdo means a powerful lifesaver a face-to-face companion. And that is getting closer to describing the women in this room. Women, that is what you were created to be. Azer Konegdo, a powerful help in a time of desperate need and a face-to-face companion. And that's how it was in the beginning. Adam and Eve co-reigning and co-ruling together, naked and unashamed, face-to-face companions, imaging God and all that is best about masculinity and all that is best about femininity. But you know the story. Adam and Eve trade this beautiful life together for a lie, and at that moment, their way of knowing each other comes, screeching to a halt. And every generation after them piles up on them like a nightmarish, multi-car pile-up. And it's interesting that the first thing we notice after the fall is that the relationship between man and woman has changed. Genesis 3.16, we read this, your desire will be for your husband, God tells Eve. And he will rule over you. now unfortunately instead of seeing this as a tragic prediction of what life in sin and under the curse will look like it's sometimes read by pastors at weddings as a blueprint of how a great marriage should be so get this it's as if we're telling women women you're no longer a powerful help in time of desperate need, face-to-face companion. From now on, you're going to want to have sex with your husband. That's your punishment. Like, did Eve never want to? Okay, that's weird. And men, from now on, you're going to rule over your wife. Now, some men are thinking, well, that's a pretty good deal. If you throw in taking care of the kids and getting my beer from the fridge, doing the dishes, then we'd be all set, right? And with interpretations like that, it's a wonder there's any Christian women in the world at all. Now here's a little, just a little hint. Anytime you see the trajectory of relationships getting worse and worse, and that is told that that is the design of God who is about reconciliation and redemption, a light should flash for you. Examine that. Examine that. So as Dave pointed out last week, the truth is that Genesis 3.16 that I just read, in that verse, God is not editing the original design and saying that here's my new original design. He's simply predicting the result of sin. God is explaining to males and females the tragic state that this car wreck has resulted in. Instead of naturally co-reigning, co-ruling, face-to-face, companioning and imaging God in that way, they're going to be vying for power one over another. That is the result of sin. Men, you'll see women as objects to satisfy your own selfish gain, and you'll be tempted to rule them with a sort of despotic power. And women, you'll see that the way out from underneath that power is to manipulate and to control and to grasp for power. And that is the result of sin, and that is not the way it was at the beginning. So let's talk about how that plays out between men and women now. I want you to remember from a couple weeks ago, Dave's definition of intimacy. It's when two people willingly and courageously enter in and open up to one another. The image is quite graphic. It's sexual, actually. But it's not about sex. It's about two souls opening up and entering in. So what does that look like under the curse? What does it look like for men and what does that look like for women when that's not happening right? I think there are two primary ways that the fallen sons of Adam play this out, this ruling over. They either withdraw or they force themselves in. Men who withdraw from women do so typically when they feel threatened by the women in their lives because maybe they feel like their needs will eat them up. I know one man who made life so miserable for his wife that she left him. And that was his plan all along. But it doesn't take someone that's planning on leaving their wife or making their wife leave him to do this because I withdraw. I withdraw from my wife. Sometimes she asks me, honey, are you punishing me for something? And my first reaction, defensiveness. Oh, of course I'm not punishing you for something. What do you mean? You're my acer-connecto, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right? And I get defensive, and I get big. But after I get defensive, and after I get big, I realize that I've been giving her the silent treatment. I've been withholding from her the relational connection that she's asking me for and that she deserves from me as my Aeser Kinegdo. I do this. And I would be willing to wager that, man, some of you do as well. The other fallen side of Adam is that sometimes he forces his way in. Men who force their way in are telling the daughters of Eve in no uncertain terms that they hold all the power. This can happen in the form of sexual abuse. We've all seen that and even know some of the grisly stats about that, that one in six women will be sexually abused during their lifetime. but it can also happen when men, either husbands or fathers, force their wives or daughters to think the way they think. No matter what. And still another way that this happens is that when men force themselves on women is when they force women to communicate the way they do and interact the way they do in order to be seen and heard by men. That's another way of forcing their way in. So men, if you've got the courage to deal with this, and I am wrestling with that as well, two questions that might help you. When you're at your worst, man, what are you more likely to do? To withdraw or to force your way in? If you could be honest about that. secondly do you have the courage to ask your wife if you're married what would it look like for me to enter into our relationship in a more healthy way that would be a great question to ask your wife it would be maybe a dangerous question maybe a scary question but these are desperate times and we are in need of getting better at doing this thing called entering in men. Now let's talk about how women respond to the curse. In response to this, the sins of the sons of Adam, the fallen daughters of Eve typically respond in one of two ways, I think. They either close up against men or they attempt to consume men. The way that women close up against men is when they're convinced that the sons of Adam, their husbands or whoever, will never really see them. When they're convinced of that, they close themselves up and disappear into self-reliance. And because the daughter of Eve that is closing up believes that she is totally and completely on her own, she no longer allows anyone to enter in. She is closed for business. That's one way that a fallen daughter of Eve at her worst will respond to life under the curse. The other way that a fallen daughter of Eve will do that is she can literally consume men by becoming controlling and manipulative in the way that she forces herself onto the sons of Adam, demanding that they enter in. She's very threatening, but this is not the picture of feminine strength, even though it looks like that. It's actually fear because she is using her beauty and charm or what she perceives her beauty and charm to be to secure her place in the world because she is fearful that she will have no place in the world. So women, two questions for you to think about if you have the courage. When you're at your worst, what are you more likely to do? To close up against men or to consume them? And secondly, do you feel safe enough to ask your husband, what would it look like for me to open up to you in our relationship in a healthier way? That would be courageous. That's a dangerous question. But these are desperate times, and we need to get better at relating to one another and get back to the way it was in the beginning. so enter Jesus the rabbi that is also called the second Adam and watch as he treats men and women in ways that give us hope that there is a road map back in the gospel of John we see Jesus interact with a group of men who is literally hell bent on putting a certain woman that has been caught in adultery away I want to read the whole story to you found in John chapter 8 the teachers of the law starting in verse 3 the teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery and they made her stand before the group and said to Jesus' teacher this woman was caught in the act of adultery now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women now what do you say? they were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing Jesus but Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger and when they kept on questioning him he straightened up and he said to them let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and at this those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there. And Jesus straightened up and asked her, woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you? No one, sir, she said. Then neither do I condemn you, Jesus answered. Now go and leave your life of sin. I want to offer several observations to this text regarding Jesus' posture in this story. It's very interesting. These guys come in with a question and a woman in order to trap Jesus. And their question is, Teacher, the law tells us that we can stone this woman because she was caught in the act of adultery. What do you say? So Jesus, you know, bends down. And he starts writing with his finger in the sand. And I have heard messages about this text. And I have heard people wonder, what do you think he wrote in the sand? Like, I mean, do you think he wrote their sins in the sand? Do you think he wrote the Ten Commandments in the sand? Well, I don't think it matters what he wrote in the sand. By him bending down, he is telling the religious leaders of that time that he is not engaging in their question. If he was sitting at a desk, tapping away on his laptop, they would knock on the door, he would say, yeah? They would ask the question, and then he would go. Jesus bends down and we get that in part because in verse 7 we read that he presses them they press him the religious leaders and so Jesus straightens up and you kind of get the picture that when he straightens up they go uh oh and he reminds them by saying okay well if any of you are without sin go ahead he reminds them subtly that in leviticus 20 10 and deuteronomy 22 22 the mosaic law says that both the woman and the man should be put to death in the case of adultery i mean they had forgotten that. Sons of Adam, Jesus is saying, you must, you must deal with your own sin. And Jesus bends back down. This time he really is saying, I'm done with you guys. Okay? Conversation's over. And so they leave one by one. And it's interesting that it's noted here that the older ones leave first. Which means that that message cut to the heart that some of the most respected people of their time understood it and left. And then Jesus does a beautiful thing. He straightens back up. And he faces the woman. And this is the first time that this woman has been addressed directly. This entire story. And Jesus' words to her are a counterpoint to what he said to the Pharisees. To the Pharisees, he tells them that their past, their sins, should inform their present course of action. Whether or not you should take that stone and throw it at the woman, you need to look at whether or not you are guilty. To the woman, he doesn't talk about the past. He doesn't talk about the present. He says, go and sin no more. He gives her a future. He comes to her help in her time of desperate need. He in this moment is her azer. And facing her eye to eye, he is also her kinecto. I mean, it is beautiful what Jesus does. Sons of Adam, Jesus is saying, if you're willing to admit that you have dealt treacherously with the daughters of Eve, and that in many ways you have put them away, if you repent of that, you can change your present course of action. And so the question comes to us, men. Can we admit our wrong so that we can change our present course of action for the daughters in our lives and in this church? Doing so will require a love that does not withdraw and does not force their way in. Daughters of Eve, if you will leave your broken and sinful ways of responding to the sinful sons of Adam, then you will have hope for a future. But it's going to require a kind of love in which you do not close up and you do not consume. Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ, we read in Ephesians 5.21. It's a beautiful and subversive antidote to the curse. Paul is saying, into a culture that was still very misogynistic, in a Christian marriage, be different than culture. Submit to one another. Next week, we're going to take a look at that set of verses in Ephesians 5. that monster, we're gonna wrestle it down. We're gonna see a vision for a world in which men and women love and serve each other by coming underneath each other and by choosing to lift each other up because that is how it was from the beginning. Pray with me. Spirit of God, we need help on this one because we all, in different ways, are guilty of vying for power with the opposite gender in our lives, whether it be withdrawing or forcing our way in or closing up or consuming. We are guilty. And we need a different vision for how to live with one another so that we can give our sons and daughters a better future. So Jesus, thank you for having the courage to stand up straight when people are being oppressed and to give us a better picture for how we can live with one another and serve one another and bless one another and submit to one another the way that you do with the Spirit and with the Father. Give us a vision for the future. and bring us healing. Amen? Amen. As you stand for the benediction, I want to thank you for engaging in what I know is a difficult examination. So now receive the benediction. May the rabbi, who brings healing to both women and men. Bring us healing in this time of desperate need. And may you find him to be your Ezer Konegdo, your powerful help in time of desperate need. May the rabbi be your face-to-face companion. Amen? Amen. Have a great weekend, everybody. Thank you.
