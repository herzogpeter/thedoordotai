Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. I just don't recall a week in my 16 years of being a pastor where I have encountered so many stories of pain through emails to me and even some conversations that I've had through requests that have come across my desk, so to speak, stories of sexual abuse I've heard this week, marriages that are totally falling apart, people that are starting to really freak out about the state that our country is in right now, in Wall Street, in Washington, people worried about their jobs, people worried about the future, people worried about their houses, and it's like there is a cry that's just raising out there, if you have ears to hear it. And so I thought that we should do what the church does when we are confronted with immeasurable pain around the world. There's things happening in Africa right now where kids are dying because of drought, and we don't know what to do, and there isn't help that's coming fast enough. And so we do what the church does, and that is hold up our hands to God and say, God, we can't hold all of it. And we cast our cares upon God because we are told in the scriptures that God cares for us, and God cares for the world. And as Jesus says, God is at work to this very day, making all things new. Amen? So what I want to do is lead you in 30 seconds of silent prayer where you would just raise up your concerns, whether they be personal or global or both. And then at the end of that time of quiet prayer, I want to lead you in reciting the Lord's Prayer. Would that be okay? Do something kind of liturgical around here for once? That'd be cool? Let's pray together. Come, Holy Spirit, and hear our prayers. Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy and come and make this world right. Oh God, we beg you. And then we pray the prayer that Jesus taught us to pray, saying, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. And give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. Amen. Amen means yes. We agree. So be it. and so you can feel free to say amen at any time during any talk that I give when you agree amen Colossians chapter 3 verse 16 turn your bibles turn in your bibles there or your iPhones or droids or whatever you have you can feel free to do that and I want to read it to you as you're turning there Colossians 3 16 we've been there so long that you know you should have this memorized by now, or at least I should. Let the message of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through songs, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. Dave started this series three weeks ago, talking about the importance of why we do what we do around teaching around here in a very corporate sense, and then two weeks ago, why we do what we do around worship in a corporate sense. And then last week, I brought us to this more personal place of examining what happens when you are filled with something richly, when something dwells in you richly, whether it be Jesus or something else. And so last week, we looked at the fact that this word dwell comes from a Greek word oikos, which means house. So I talked about the different house guests that come into your house, so to speak, this personal place that exists inside of you that God made, the most personal place out of which your longings flow, your deepest longings. But there are things that come into that place or that try to come into that place that we called house guests last week. And there's a process that when things come in, and the process I outlined is that you'd have a threshold experience with something, whether it's good or bad. Sometimes it's the click of a mouse. Sometimes it's a conversation that sends you reeling. Sometimes it's a job loss or even a promotion. But you have this experience where a house guest shows up and wants to come in. And then it's our choice to give that thing or person or click or conversation or seed of an idea about who you are. We give it access. And it comes and moves in. And if it stays long enough, it takes control. And so last week we talked about the process. When houseguests we don't want come in and how to notice it and how to notice our responsibility in giving it access or not. But then we read the words written by John of Jesus in Revelations 3.20 where Jesus stands at your door, at your threshold, no matter how many threshold experiences you've had, no matter how many houseguests are in you right now that are causing you harm. And he says these amazing words, here I am. Here I am. And I'm standing at your threshold and I am knocking. And if anyone hears my voice, my voice, and gives me access, lets me in, I will come in. And I will eat with you and you with me. And that speaks to the most intimate fellowship that the writer of this letter would have known. That means I am with you and you are with me. We are together at the same table. So it's this amazing invitation that Jesus would stand at your threshold and say, I'd like to come in. Will you give me access? So this morning, what I want to do, because last week we talked a lot about when other house guests come in, I want to talk about what it means or what it would look like to have Jesus, to have a threshold experience with Jesus, actually and personally and uniquely for you that would lead to you possibly inviting him in. So to do that, I want to jump to a text that I actually looked at a few weeks ago, but I've been sitting with it for a while. And what happens when you sit with a text for a while is it just keeps popping up in sort of unexpected ways. But the text is in John 5, and I want to read it to you. John 5, verses 2 through 9, actually. I'll read just the first few verses first. But near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem, there's, again, you know many gates that would lead into the city, but this one gate was called the Sheep Gate. There was a pool in Hebrew called Bethesda with five alcoves. And hundreds of sick people, blind, crippled, and paralyzed, were in these alcoves because they were covered, and that's a place where they could be out of the weather. And they were sitting by this pool because they believed that if you were to get into that pool, you would be healed of your diseases. And one man had been an invalid there for 38 years. Just dial into how much of an identity that he would have as a wounded person sitting at this place. And when Jesus saw this person stretched out by the pool and knew how long that he had been there, he asked this question. And the question is very curious. It's, do you want to be well? It's not, do you want to walk? It's not, do you want me to help you into the pool? It's not, what would you like me to do for you? It's, would you like to be well? Very interesting question. In fact, a very dangerous question, if we're honest. Can you imagine Jesus of Nazareth The one who created all of heaven and earth Coming and having an eye-to-eye conversation with you Looking you right in the eyes and saying Would you like to get well? This is a threshold experience To which I think it would leave me sort of quaking in my boots Because it would be a conversation That I would know that he could see right into me He could see right into my oikos Right into the house guests That would need to be displaced if I were to answer that question, yes, I would like to be well. It's not a benign question. It's a very pregnant question. If you'd like to be well, there's probably a journey I'm going to invite you on. So it's a very dangerous question. Would you like to be well? And then I started thinking. We're used to being told what Jesus says. Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you. turn the other cheek. What we're not used to is searching for the questions that Jesus asks us. Do you know that in the Gospels there are over 300 questions that Jesus asks? They're often very personal. It's fascinating if you think about this idea because this to this guy he asked the question do you want to be well? In the King James, it's, wilt thou be whole? Wilt thou be whole? Which again is very different from, do you want help into the pool? Do you want help walking? Do you want to be whole? I'm going to say that a threshold experience with Jesus is deeply personal, very specific, and it's often posed as a question for you to wrestle with? It's a dangerous question. I showed this image last week up on the screens as a way of inviting us to wonder about what are the ways or the house guests that you've invited in that now you've given them an all-access 24-hour key into your heart. That they can come and go as they please. They can control you the way that they want to, not the way that you would have them control you. Maybe these are things or people or conversations that you don't even want in there, but they have a key to your heart. And when I showed that picture, it did something in a person that emailed me later on this week. And she gave me permission to share this story. But she said, Steve, when I saw that picture up on the screen, I heard from God a question in the moment. And the question was, you've been married for 31 years. Would you let your husband in? to your heart after 31 years. And then she told me part of her story that she was a victim of severe sexual abuse when she was younger. And victims of sexual abuse, men or women, when the idea of having a threshold experience with someone comes up and letting them in, the answer is, no, I've spent my life barricading the threshold so that no one would get in anymore. In fact, my threshold has been destroyed. I have no idea how to let God in, or my husband in, or anyone in. And so this question came to her, would you be willing to consider letting your husband into your heart? And she said, Steve, my answer wants to be yes, but I know I'll need God's help. And I just thought, what a beautiful picture of a fragile person like you and like me who gets a message from God that is dangerous and knows they need God's help. Questions are all over the scriptures, all over the gospels, especially I think about the time where Jesus sat down at a well with a Samaritan woman around noontime, around midday. And what does he do? I don't know if you remember the story that clearly, but the first thing Jesus does is ask her a question. And the question seems somewhat innocent at first, but it isn't. He says, do you have anything to drink? Now, what would have that of question elicited in the Samaritan woman? It would have posed some questions for her. What is this Jewish rabbi doing talking to me, a Samaritan woman? Men don't talk to me. Jews don't talk to me. Rabbis certainly don't talk to me. They don't hang out at wells. They don't ask questions of me. They don't ask things of me. They don't treat me as if I might have something to offer. This question was pregnant with possibility for this woman, and it led to Jesus being able to say to her, you are thirsty. If you only knew that I am the person that would create in you a spring of living water, so you'd never thirst again. Would you be interested in that? And she said, Sir, tell me where that water's coming from because I want it. No one had ever asked her that question before. Changed her life. She went back to her town, you know, did a big evangelistic talk or something like that. Half the town believes in Jesus, comes back and hangs out with Jesus for a few more days. We can only imagine the questions that were popping around that table. All because Jesus asked a woman a question. I've told this story before, but about three and a half years ago, my wife and I found out that we were having twins, and, you know, we had already had about a one and a half year old at that time. And for us, it freaked us out. I mean, we like quiet things and, you know, a tidy house and books. And, you know, now we have three kids, and you guys, we can't even put, we can't even have our chairs around the table. We have to put our chairs in a different room, lock that room, because if we didn't, the guys would just climb up on the table and just jump off and break their heads. Anyway, so this, this, the picture of our house is just what we feared it would be. It's chaos, and it's beautiful. But I remember sitting in the house that I lived in St. Louis Park at the time, on my porch. I was journaling out some prayers and worries and anxieties, and all of a sudden I felt like I got an invitation from God. And the invitation was, Steve, you're so self-reliant, and you're good at a lot of things. Would you let me lead you into doing some things that you cannot handle on your own? Would you let me? And my response was, well, Lord, you know, yes. My response was yes. And over the last three and a half years, I've been led into some things that I have absolutely no idea how to do. And so it led me to this, what became a series of sermons called Receive It versus Handle It. Can I be the kind of person that will just receive what God brings to me and what life brings to me instead of trying to handle it. That's a huge difference. And if you're going to move into the kind of things that you need to move into, especially as a leader of any kind, you need to wrestle that question all the way down to the ground. Because if you try to handle everything, you will die. Dave Johnson, about 20 years ago, got a question from God. Around a time at Open Door that he calls the hit-the-wall days. If you've been around for any length of time, you know what those days were like. He likens Open Door to an adolescent at the time that he was sort of like, oh, what am I gonna do with these people? What am I gonna do with me? He almost, he did hit the wall and didn't know what he was gonna do. But at that time, God asked him a question and it was this. Dave, would you be willing to stop being the Pied Piper, the leader of the crowd with the back to the crowd that leads the charge? Would you turn around and take on the mantle of a father to this congregation? Would you do that? And he describes it. He's done it publicly. said it to me. He said, man, that was a coat that didn't feel like it fit. You know, Father, I... And let me say this, if you've been around for any length of time, you think you love Dave because of his preaching. The reason you love Dave is because he answered yes. I'll be a father. Imperfectly. Making mistakes. But I'll do that. I don't know how to do it. Never done it before. but I'll do it. I'll say yes to that invitation. Questions, personal questions from Jesus require you to wrestle things all the way down to the ground. Now you might ask this, well, how do you get a question from Jesus? Like, can you sign up like for a daily email Where you might get some questions and then pick one? Is it just for people like Dave who have direct access to God? Like, is there a red bat phone in his office that when it rings, he knows, you know? Well, I think I heard, that was probably his daughter or his wife right there. Anyway, well, here are some ways that I think you might hear from God. There's lots of ways because I think God wants to talk to you. The main thing is, do you want to be well? If you do, you raise your antenna, and the scriptures are one of the best ways to do that, that you would just be a student of the scriptures, and that doesn't mean you know what they say. Just read them. Don't read 10 chapters a day. Read a couple of thoughts a day, a couple of verses a day, and just think of it like you would eat every day, right? Just think of it like that. Don't approach them like, okay, Lord, Now I will have the most emotional experience of my life. Come, Lord Jesus, here we go. And then Leviticus, you know, okay. You got to read the story enough to where it starts reading you. The scripture is alive. And when you read it enough, it will read you. And questions will start to be posed and words will jump off of the page from time to time, not every time. In fact, quite seldom. But another reason why it's important to be in the Scriptures is you might get an invitation or feel like you got an invitation. And the Scripture, you need to check it with the Scriptures because if it's from God, it will line up with what the Scriptures say. And if you need help with that, ask someone. Man, I got this invitation for God. I think it is. What do you think? Do you think this lines up with Scripture? But conversations with others, prayer. God, what would you have me do? Opening yourself up to listening to God, actually. listening to sermons sometimes though not always you may leave a sermon and go I mean I wish I was mowing the lawn that day instead of wasting I'll never get those 45 minutes back but sometimes it's like God is speaking right to you have you ever had that or it's like you're reading my mail I mean how did you know what I was going through that's not because the speaker is super dialed into you it's because God is super dialed into you I mean so many times people come up and say Steve thank you so much for saying this dot dot dot and then like I'll go oh that's so great and then I'll walk away and go I don't think I even said that I'm pretty sure I didn't but God did God said it to you because you needed to hear it and serving others is a great way sometimes reading a book watching movies burning bushes which is just noticing the things that go, whoa, what's that? What do you turn aside to? And then, of course, if you have toddlers in your house, this is the very best way to know that there is a God and that you have a lot to learn. Now, regarding questions, regarding your question that Jesus poses to you, here's a very important axiom or truth. Thou shalt not covet your neighbor's question. That's their question. The Lord loves you and is with you. And if you are patient enough, the Lord will bring you your question. And a question is something that will carry you along your life. It's not something you need an answer to right now or you need to give an answer to right now. It will carry you along the arc of your lifetime. if it's really from God. But it has to be your question. Do not try to put your question on someone else. And don't take someone else's question for you. And then when we've been asked a question from Jesus, as I've said, we need to wrestle it all the way down to the ground. Because it's a journey that Jesus is inviting you on. It's not a quick answer. It's not a quick, all right. It's something you'll have to wrestle with. This guy wrestled with it a little bit. In John 5, 7, the sick man back at the sheep gate said, Sir, that word jumped off the page to me, Sir. It's like so formal, you know. And you see Jesus going, hey, you know what? We can get closer than Sir, you know, but let's, okay, that's a good start. Sir, when the water is stirred, I don't have anyone to put me in the pool. By the time I get there, someone else is already in. And Jesus might have been thinking, I didn't mention one thing about the pool. I didn't say anything about the pool. I didn't ask you if you wanted help into the pool. I didn't say, hey, the pool is stirring. I didn't say, hey, watch out, that guy's getting into the pool, buddy, you better go. I didn't say any of that stuff. I didn't mention the pool. I said, do you want to be well? And I can even see Jesus just kind of, I know, I mean, we don't like to see Jesus getting in his face. but there was a way in which in his mind Jesus would have been saying, I'm not talking about the pool, the place that you've put your trust in for 38 years. I'm talking about something else entirely. What have you been sitting at? What pool have you been sitting by for 38 years, hoping that it will bring you something that it can never, ever bring you? We go into our script. The Samaritan woman at the well went into her script. Well, you know, we worship on this mountain. You worship on somewhere else. Why are you talking to me? I mean, she just goes into this script. I'm no one. And I can imagine the apostle Paul, when Jesus asked him the question, why are you persecuting me? You imagine that question coming at you from the creator of the universe? A, Paul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? to which Saul said, um, who are you? That was his script. He was like a lawyer. Hey, who are you? I am Jesus of Nazareth. Knocked him right down to the ground. What's your script? What's your story that you tell that keeps you safe and sitting by a pool that'll never get you well? that would be something to sit with what's my story that I'm saying that really keeps me comfortable and keeps me a victim maybe that keeps me away from the question that Jesus would have for me well when you've wrestled with the question that Jesus invites you into long enough then Jesus will invite you to do something very practical. And this is the deal. It's very practical. I think Jesus wants me to start a lawn mowing business for, you know, I mean, I don't know what that is. But he will invite you to do something very practical. In John 5, 8, and 9, Jesus said to this guy, get up, take your bedroll, and start walking. So the man was healed on the spot. He picked up his bedroll and walked off. And the thing that's very fascinating about this is Jesus doesn't touch him. He doesn't pray for him. He doesn't cast a demon out of him. He doesn't mention his faith. He doesn't say anything about believing anything. He just says, hey, get up, take your bedroll up, which to me means you will never, I want you to never come back here again. Take your bedroll and go start walking. To which I have some questions, right? Like if I'm the guy, that's awesome. I'm healed. I can walk. Yay. Hallelujah. Where am I going? Where am I going to sleep that night tonight? Hey, I haven't walked around for a while, so I don't know where I can get some shoes, but I'm pretty sure Tom's was not in existence back then, so I'm not getting a free pair. Where am I going to go to work? What is my role in the world now? When Jesus invites you to do something after you've wrestled with your question, these are the kind of questions you ask. What is my role in the world now that I'm in on this adventure? Well, that will lead you right back to Jesus. It will lead you all the way back to the one that created you and knows you and longs to fill that inner space that only Jesus can fill. the one that longs to lead you and be with you and help you to do something that you can't handle. You might be thinking, oh, isn't there a scripture that says that God never brings me that which I can't handle? No, there isn't. The scripture is there will not be a temptation beyond which that you can bear. You're gonna get, if you follow Jesus, you will get all kinds of stuff you can't handle. That's the story of the scriptures. So, what do you need so that you might begin the journey into wholeness? The guy was given a gift of healing to walk so that he could begin the lifelong process of becoming whole. What healing do you need so that you can get up and walk into wholeness? Not what you, not what do you need to do, not what do you need to, not what affairs you need to get in order. What do you need from God right now, right now, as a gift of healing from God into your heart? What do you need? And would you be willing to have the courage in this moment to boldly ask God a dangerous question? Because Jesus is standing here going, here I am, I'm knocking. And part of my voice is, what would you like me to do for you? How would you like me to heal you? In what way do you need to be healed? I want to move towards you right now. one of the things that really is helpful for me is this verse Psalm 32 8 for my life is very personal this is the word of the Lord to me as I start to move into the things that I don't know how to do the Lord says like this to me I will instruct you you can read a lot of good books read the books go to conferences awesome but I will instruct you and I will teach you in the way that Steve you should go I will counsel you with my loving eye on you. Let that in. Jesus will disciple you with his loving eye on you. That is what you need. What do you need? As we go to the table, We think about letting the words of Jesus and Jesus himself dwell in us richly. As we think about this word that Jesus says, that come, you know, invite me in and I will eat with you. Have this meal be a time for you to wrestle with Jesus and the question that he has for you as you take him in and drink his forgiveness in. Amen. Amen.
