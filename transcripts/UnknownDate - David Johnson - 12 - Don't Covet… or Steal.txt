Well, I remember the first time I said it, how odd it sounded to me that Jesus wasn't a Christian. Remember that in the context of this series, that he was a Torah observant Jew, which in the context of this series of sermons where we're coming to know Jesus as our rabbi, got us interested in Torah, in Old Testament law, particularly. We've been kind of zoned in on the Ten Commandments, which we've been examining for several weeks. In fact, we began this examination in the broader context of Jesus as rabbi. The Ten Commandments study began at the end of April. So today we come to the tenth and final commandment in the law, you shall not covet. Indeed, two weeks ago I told you that I'm combining the Eighth Commandment and the Tenth Commandment because it's out of our coveting that we steal the Eighth Commandment being you shall not steal. Therefore, Exodus 20, verse 17 says this, You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's spouse, or his male servant, or his female servant, or their ox, or his donkey, or her donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor. In other words, just leave his stuff alone. Pretty basic stuff, actually. I've been calling it kindergarten. This Ten Commandments thing, having lived as slaves in Egypt, and this gives us the context for this, for 400 some years, knowing no other way to live but that as slaves in Egypt, God had delivered his people from Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. And by the time we come to Exodus 20, he, having redeemed them, is now calling them to a different kind of life, no longer living as slaves, driven by a slave master who doesn't care about them. Now I want you to learn how to live as free people under the rule and reign of God and hopefully to step into the fullness of your destiny as the people of God in the world. For God's dream for his people was this, that they would be a light unto the nations. Here's how you can begin to step into this. This is at least just a start. Figure out what it means to put me first, accept no substitutes, revere my name, observe my day, don't murder, steal, or lie. Indeed, I'd like you to not even want to murder, steal, or lie. You shall not covet. Defined, Webster's Dictionary reveals that beyond strong desire, healthy ambition, or the pursuit of a dream, And covetousness unreasonably or unlawfully desires to possess what belongs to another. It's a disordered kind of desire. And the text is specific as to what is unlawfully desired by covetousness. It's your neighbor's house, your neighbor's spouse, possessions, and position. So covetousness, as you're kind of dialing into what it is and what it isn't, is not. dreaming about and planning for a house someday. It's being so discontent with mine that I can hardly rest till I have yours. Covetousness is not strongly desiring to have a better marriage and setting out to do the work required for a better marriage. It's being so discontent with my marriage that I want yours. Indeed, beyond your marriage, I want your wife. And now you've got adultery and whatever else adultery is, it's stealing. And adultery never once happened without lying. So once again, we see these commandments as we have for several weeks as being interconnected and interrelated. But regardless of how covetousness might physically manifest through lying or stealing or slander, at the root of covetousness is an abiding discontent, a brooding, simmering discontent relative to just about everything in your life. For covetousness, by definition, is ungrateful, it's insatiable, it's never enough, it is ever grasping and consuming, it devours, in fact, even your capacity to enjoy the things you have and the people who are already in your life because once you have it or have them, turns out it wasn't what you wanted. It wasn't what you needed. It just isn't enough. So the search goes on for more covetousness. Peter Kraft in his book, Back to Virtue, He defines covetousness as a sickness of the spirit, a disease of the soul that afflicts the human heart regardless, ironically, of how much you possess or don't possess. Indeed, I think we all know people who have vast amounts of stuff, more than enough, for whom it's never enough. Dr. Richard Swenson reflects on this very thing in the book entitled Margin when he says, half a century ago, my grandfather might reasonably have predicted that advances in affluence, technology, education, and entertainment would bring a commensurate increase in contentment. But such has not been the case. Instead, observes historian Arthur Schlesinger, Our culture, he says, is marked by an inextinguishable discontent. For the average American, discontent and the covetousness that comes with it has become a way of life. Indeed, we live in a culture, quite frankly, that stirs up discontent. It's a weird way to look at it, I suppose, but it's almost as if our economy requires discontent. We manufacture goods, they need to be purchased. For you to purchase them, you need to want them. To get you to want them, advertisers present them in as an appealing way as possible, making all sorts of promises, some of them subtle, some of them not so subtle, about what this product will do for you, provide for you. But what do they do if it's something you really don't need? I mean, because you're sure you have, or the car you drive is fine. Well, this is where the advertisers really get excited, because this is how they earn their money. It's called manufactured need, where you really don't need it, but I convince you that you do by stirring up a discontent with what you have. See, what you have is ugly, or what you have is old, and that's the worst thing anything can be, is old, and I'm getting there. That's the worst thing you can be. And what you have is blue. Didn't you know the color this year is red? What you have is short. The look this year is long, which means covetousness when it's really working, when it's really doing what it does best. It has the power to create in you a kind of blindness as to the value and the beauty of what you already have and who you're already with. So covetousness, and this is where it becomes insidious, is not simply wanting more than you have. Covetousness, again, full-blown, is when you despise what you already have. And if you're talking about a shirt, this ugly thing, or a car, I mean, those things are just disposable. Let's just talk about a marriage, a person. See, I think it's safe to say that some of you. In fact, it's probably a good thing if you wanted more in your marriage than you have. More intimacy, more openness and oneness with each other, more fun. Nothing wrong with wanting those things. Covetousness, though, this is where the face turns ugly. Covetousness pushes past desiring more than what you have to despising what you have. So before you know it, you are absolutely blind to any positive trait in your spouse. You can't see beauty, virtue, value, strength. In fact, you begin to have these thoughts, and they aren't even, you know, connected, not even put into words, but the thought kind of sounds like this. Why can't she, my wife, my husband, be more like her or him, my neighbor's wife? All of which is why the writer of the book of Hebrews, with no small amount of urgency, says in Hebrews 13, 5, let your character be free from covetousness. I want to break this phrase down a little bit. The word character is very significant. It paints a really important picture that, again, I help you enter into this whole thing. Comes from, does character. The word character comes from the Greek word protos. We get the word, or tropos, rather. We get the word tropics. It has to do with climate. Think of a tropical climate, environment region. It speaks to a temperature or a kind of weather system in which certain things grow and certain things don't. Then there are weather systems like that. I want you to think about it that way. Regions of the country where the temperature is so extreme one way or another that nothing can grow or nothing can live. Other climates, more moderate, allow certain things to grow but not others because it's either too hot or too cold, too wet or too dry. Dial that into this verse. Here's the word. Don't let the weather system, the internal weather system of your life be characterized by covetousness. Just think about the air you breathe in your spirit being never enough. The air in your spirit you breathe is, I've got to have more. This is really yucky what I have. Don't let it be characterized by discontent and ingratitude. Why? two reasons. Obvious, just in this illustration of this weather system because of what this kind of interior climate of ingratitudes can grow and what this interior climate of covetousness can kill. And what covetousness grows, among other things, is this, a jungle of futility, a leanness of soul, of barrenness of spirit, a blindness to the beauty all around you, and a life sentence of dissatisfaction. It's never enough. And what it kills, among other things, is the life of God in you. I mean, I'm not even saying, I'm not saying you're not a Christian when I say that. The life of God in you, if the weather system of your soul is never enough, it can't grow marriages can't flourish relationships can't last they just can't because after I suck you dry you didn't do it I got to go to someone else possessions can't satisfy even successful careers can't fulfill it will never be enough because covetousness by nature by definition consumes and devours people possessions, positions, therefore, back to the verse, Hebrews 13, 5, don't let the internal weather system of your life be characterized by covetousness and gratitude and discontent, but be content, the verse goes on to say, with such things as you have, for he himself has said, I will never leave you nor forsake you. Let me break that verse down a little bit. According to that text, the antithesis of covetousness is contentment. It's pretty clear. The key to contentment in the verse is trust, that whatever else is going on in my life, whatever else it is I have or don't have, trust that he will never leave me nor forsake me. Antithesis of covetousness, contentment. Key to contentment, trust that he will never leave me nor forsake me. But that raises the question. It's this. Would that be enough for you that you get God? Is that what you signed on for when you signed on to, I want to be a God person? Is that what you want to just know Him and love Him and get experience even more of Him? We've talked about this in times past, what I call the deal because many of us have a deal with God and the reason we got into God was not for God, life with God, life from God. It was all the things he could provide for me over here that I covered. See, the antidote to covetousness, what clears the air you're breathing of covetousness is not trying really hard to not be covetous. It's not trying really hard to be content. The key, the antidote, is to remember maybe to believe again and return again today to what we often forget and wander quickly from, and it's this, that the only adequate source of life and value and meaning and joy and peace and life itself is God Himself, that He and He alone has the capacity to quench our thirsts, to satisfy our hungers. So here's the deal. Just kind of put this whole thing in perspective. And this is something you know is true. Everybody's hungry, and everybody's thirsty. Every human being on the face of the planet right now has a hunger in their soul, a thirst in their spirit. It is a hunger and a thirst for a number of things, but among them are these, a hunger and a thirst for some sense of meaning, some sense of value, love, being loved and being able to love, acceptance, joy, peace, some sense of life, some sense of being alive in some way. It is a deep-seated hunger and thirst. It is common to man. It is true of the drunk on Skid Row. It's true of the corporate executive in the high-rise building. It is true of the homeless person on Hennepin Avenue, and it's true of the housewife in Maple Grove. What separates us is not that some people are hungry and some people aren't. What separates us is what people are feeding on to satisfy their hunger, what people are drinking to quench their thirst, because we're all hungry and we're all thirsty. But this is where the problem starts. because most of what we look to to satisfy our hungers and quench our thirsts doesn't work. In fact, an awful lot of what we're using to quench our thirsts and satisfy our hungers after we drink these things and devour these things just leave us frustrated, even angry because we're even more thirsty than before, more hungry than we were when we started eating this stuff. In fact, the prophet Amos says it this way, that the world is panting after the dust of the earth. In other words, the prophet is saying everybody's hungry. The problem is, however, that most of what we're eating to satisfy the hunger is dust. Therefore, it doesn't satisfy the hunger. Gospel of John, Jesus came to a well. you know the story of the woman at the well and began to talk to her, and it became apparent that he knew something about her. And this didn't take any revelation because he knew this was true of every human being on the face of the planet. He knew that she was thirsty. The thing that kind of freaked her out was that he also knew that she was trying to quench the thirst in her soul with with one unhappy relationship after another. In fact, he said to her, remember this, where he says, you know, I know you had five husbands and the man you're living with right now is not your husband. And so he knew she was thirsty and he knew she was trying to get her thirst quenched with one relationship after another. And it's interesting what he said to her because he didn't say, you disgusting pig. what he began to do is talk to her about a different source of water, a different kind of water, and a different kind of bread. And he said, you know, if you drink this water that I have to offer, not the kind that's physically from this well, but this life I'm calling people into, you'll never thirst again. And she said what lots of people say when they hear stuff like that. Huh? What? Huh? See, some of the dust that people eat is obviously dust. and when you see people like the woman at the well eat the dust that they're eating you wonder in fact we get a little irritated with them how can they eat that stuff I mean can't they tell it's dust it's so disgusting in fact they're disgusting a little word about people like this sometimes the reason they eat the dust that they're eating is because it's all they can find the woman at the well I don't have time to tell the whole story but just know this about the woman at the well she didn't have a whole lot of options. Like a lot of people who are eating dust to satisfy their hunger and coming up more thirsty and more hungry. They're just eating what they know how to eat. But sometimes the dust we eat looks like filet mignon and can actually taste good on the front end. And some of the dust we eat, we've kind of risen above the woman at the well, problem, actually seems to hold the promise of satisfying our hunger and quenching our thirst. And so we pursue it like crazy. For many of us, this starts very young. If I could just get the right grade. Now, there's nothing wrong at all with getting good grades. But if you're using that to satisfy your hunger and settle some issues of your identity and your value as a human being, you're going to end up really, really hungry. But we start very young at this. If I could just get that grade, if I could just make that team, if I could just get that girl to be my girlfriend, that guy to be my boyfriend, then I'd be about, okay, just get into that school, get that job, buy that house, get that car, then I'd be okay. And again, there's nothing wrong with any of those things in and of themselves, but if you're using them to satisfy your hunger and quench your thirst, there's this weird thing you're going to notice after a while, and it takes a while when you're eating this stuff, you're going to come up going, I'm still hungry, I'm still thirsty, I need more. That's covetousness. Some of us believe that if I would marry the right person, if I would just marry Mr. Meet My Every Need. So you married him, and after you sucked the life entirely out of him, you found out, well, have a baby. Well, let's have a baby. This will do it. and then you suck the life out of that too. So you see, this covetousness thing, whatever else it does, it consumes. You and people around you and whatever it is you have. See, at the end of the day, most of us are eating dust. Unlike the woman at the well, in some ways the woman at the well is closer to the kingdom than many of us because the woman at the well didn't need a lot of convincing that what she was eating was dust. didn't need a lot of convincing that her life wasn't working and so when jesus would come to someone like that and say you know i got some water that might last longer than this she was a lot more ready than many of us because we're still not quite convinced that the bigger house and the bigger car and whatever else it is we're chasing devouring trying to eat and trying to drink will satisfy why rich people it's really hard for rich people to come into the kingdom because they're not at the end of themselves. It's also why the richest country in the history of the world, us, has developed a culture that Richard Swenson says is marked by an inexhaustible discontent. See, covetousness and the insatiable, ever-grasping, and consuming reality that accompanies it is simply and quite predictably the natural result of trying to get life from something that has no capacity to give life, from trying to get life from something other than the only source of life, God. Which, by the way, is really interesting. We kind of connected this. Keith helped us do this last week when we connected. This is the 10th commandment, you shall not covet. But this commandment kicks you right back up to the first. No gods but me. No source of life but me. Try it a different way. you will end up a devourer, a coveter. So don't let the internal weather system of your life be characterized by covetousness, but be content with such things as you have. Let's close in prayer. How is the question? Well, how do I become content? That's what I have. Well, let's ask someone who knows. and the apostle Paul at least claims to know in Philippians 4 verse 11 and 12 where he says in effect I've learned how to clear out the air I breathe of covetousness I've learned how to be content whoa what a claim in whatever circumstance I'm in middle of verse 12 I've learned the secret wow of being full and going hungry both of having abundance nice house, nice car, whatever he didn't have that but that would be ours. Abundance and suffering need. I've learned how to do both of those things. In fact, I can do all those things. Stop right there. I can do all those things at least in part because I don't look to those things to give me strength. I don't see them as a source of strength, of life. I don't look to those things to feed my hunger, to satisfy or quench my thirst. I don't expect those things to do what those things, good or bad, full or empty, have no power to do. And what they don't have power to do is give me life, give me contentment, give me hope and peace and strength, all of which, by the way, just that little phrase, speaks to and gives some clues as to his secret. Let me just kind of touch on three. And there's so many here. Let me just touch on this. The first, I think, key to his secret of contentment has to do with expectations. I mean, and it is, indirectly, right in the text. See, if you're ever going to be content, if we're ever going to enter into this as a way of living and rid the air we breathe of covetousness, we're going to have to learn to relentlessly establish and have to do it over and over again probably, realistic expectations about what people like a husband or a wife or children or friends, possessions, positions, and places have the power to give to us, to provide for us. Let me say it like this. If we ever hope to experience real contentment. Somewhere along the line, reality is going to have to have a sit-down, heart-to-heart talk with expectations, saying essentially this. Here are your expectations, Dave, about life, about marriage, about what a wife can do for you, what your career, your ministry can provide for you, and what possessions can fill in you. Here's your expectations about what they're going to give you, and here's reality. Okay? Question. Do you notice a difference between your expectations about your marriage, your career, and friends, and reality? Do you notice a difference? Do you? Well, here's the secret. Adjust. Here's the secret. Or don't adjust. Most people don't. They keep demanding. But if you don't adjust, you'll never, ever be content. Consistently expecting things that have no power to give you value, meaning, life, joy, fulfillment, satisfy your deepest hunger, quench your thirst. Not only expecting, you will demand. You will continually demand that people, possessions, and positions provide for you things they have no capacity to provide. Bonnie and I, my wife, we've been married 33. Right? 33? I got it right? Yes. I got it right. You're clapping because we're married. I'm clapping because I got it right. I usually get that wrong. First two years of our marriage were by far the most difficult. We both kind of agree on that. part of the reason, it's real obvious, was that we both brought in to our marriage a script of expectations. Some of them we knew about, and those are the ones we dealt with and tried to put aside and just kind of let them go, but the ones that tripped us up were the expectations we didn't know about. Bonnie's was that she would marry a man who would satisfy her deepest longings, provide a kind of non-stop thrill ride of emotional intimacy, personal affirmation, physical ecstasy. So she pretty much got what she wanted, you know? Yeah, there you go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I'm not even going to look over there, but I just guarantee she's rolling her eyes, even if she's, yeah. No, she didn't. She got me, and I got her, And you know what? She is an amazing woman and a wonderful wife. In fact, she is the love of my life. But she is a horrible... Okay. Okay. She's a horrible... Cook. No, no, no, no. She's incredible. She is a horrible God. She is a horrible source. And so am I. she's a pretty good wife and I'm a pretty good husband but I'm a really lousy God oh man Dave Busby some of you remember Dave he used to preach one of my favorite illustrations of his was he would describe relationships and marriages remember this one two ticks no dog you know okay Though dead, he still speaks. Thank you, Dave. See, if we're serious about wanting in some way, somehow, to experience real contentment and to rid the air we breathe of covetousness, I think it's somewhere along the line. Reality has to sit down with expectations, have a heart-to-heart talk. Here are your expectations about what people and possessions, things, positions can provide for you. And here's reality. Adjust. And the way you adjust, and this is at the risk of sounding too simplistic because it's pretty involved being able to do this. The way you adjust is to release, to let go of your expectations that have really become demands. In fact, if you would look at some of the demands in your spirit relative to people and things and your job, it would help you understand a little bit why you're so angry. Because you're demanding of things that they can't give you. I don't care what they do or what they are. Interesting, one of the fundamental precepts of the church fathers is this, that all great spirituality is about letting go. sometimes of expectations like we're talking about here sometimes it's about letting go of life because what we're grasping is life and you don't become content so you just kind of let it go sometimes it's letting go of control the need to be right the need to look good all the time or to win let it go of whatever it is you think you have to have right now to be okay Richard Rohr one of my favorite writers talks about people needing to develop what he calls a beginner's mind and a beginner's mind is someone who recognizes man alive there's just stuff I don't know and I need to I need to learn but the only way to develop a learner's mind is to begin letting go of of you think you know so much you'll never learn a thing if you think you already know let go of your arrogance. One of the fascinating things about Paul is that in all this talk of contentment, it comes in the context of pretty difficult circumstances. Verse 12, he speaks of having abundance and suffering need. But he's writing those words of abundance and need in a Roman prison. This is Paul, who was beaten times without number, often in danger of death, speaking of contentment. His life, even though he was in a prison and even though he had been beaten time without number, was free from covetousness, from coveting maybe even an easier life. I wonder about that, and I think it probably is true that one of the battles that Paul had, when I think of how hard his life was, was this demand for an easier life. God, in fact, 2 Corinthians 12, we hear him talk about the storm in the flesh. And I came to God three times, and I says, God, and then finally, you know what he, what did he do? He let, he let go. I said, my, your grace is sufficient. I'm going to lean in. I'm going to lean in. I'm going to drink deep from your amazing grace. And if I live with this storm, I'm going to let go not of my demand that it be gone. But it's more than letting go. I mean, it's... See, what occurred to me about letting go is this, that I think I could let go and not let go the way Paul did, because I could let go, and sometimes we do this, and fall into a pit of passive resignation. Okay, I just let go. And what you actually did was quit. Become passive. That's not what we're talking about here. No, there was more involved in Paul's contentment than simply letting go. He did let go, but he didn't let go into nothing. See, Paul let go and then leaned in to a sufficient grace. Paul, see, was drinking from a different well to have his thirst quenched. He was leaning into a different source. I have learned the secret of contentment, for I can do all things through Christ. That's my source. That's my water. He's my bread. Do I want other things to happen nice in my life? Would I like abundance? Sure. Do I want the thorn gone? Yes. but if that's what I have to have I'll never be content and so he said I gotta be drinking from a different well so what's the water you're drinking and what's the food you're eating see the antidote to covetousness is not trying really hard to not be covetous or even try really hard to be grateful the key the antidotes is to remember and maybe believe again what we often forget and wander from quickly that the only adequate source of life and joy and peace and patience. Contentment is God. That he and he alone is capable of satisfying the deepest hungers and thirsts of the human heart and that every other place I go to, and I will go to, prone to wander, Lord, I feel it. Don't you? But every other place I wander to to get life other than him will leave me and you hungry and thirsty, discontent and full of coveting. So the Spirit and the bride say, come. And let the one who hears come. And let the one who is thirsty come and take the water of life without cost. Quiet your hearts. We're going to close with a song. Hear these words. Hear these words. Remember, return, release. Get quiet in your spirit right now. Get quiet. Lean in. And drink deep. Thank you. Surrounded by wealth And material things We're thirsty for something Riches can't bring We're digging so deep In miles that run dry We're looking for water Where death turns to life Cause we want to drink Drink you deep We want to drink From the water that satisfies We want to drink Drink you deep We want to drink from the river of life The lives of abundance, yet spiritually poor, replenish with you, so we're thirsty no more. Water so bitter, no life can be found. Cleanse mighty river, so life can abound. We want to drink, drink you deep. We want to drink from the river that glorifies. We want to drink, drink you dear. We want to drink from the river of life. We want a drink, a drink you deep. We want a drink from the river that satisfies. We want a drink, a drink you deep. We want a tree From the river of life We want a tree From the river of life Lord, thank you for this day and this word. I pray that you would help us believe today that you are in it. Give us the courage to let go and move into you. We pray this in your name. Amen. If you need prayer for anything, we invite you to come up. We'll be the altar team up here. Otherwise, have a great week. Thank you.
