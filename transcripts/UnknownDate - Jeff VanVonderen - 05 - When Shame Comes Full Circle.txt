Okay, before I begin the tape, actually, I have a couple questions that people have asked that I'd like to answer. And one of the questions was about what kind of implications this system or growing up in this system might have in terms of your relationship with God later on. Like, how does this land on God stuff? And I think probably that's a whole different, that's another talk. like a whole another presentation, but just some examples of that that would be easy to, or some conclusions that would be easy to draw would be, for instance, that if you're accustomed to living on the outside of the circle with someone in the middle that is the power person and they're abusive or hard to please, it would seem to me that for some people then God would be just a more mean, harder to please version than that person. And practically speaking, I see a lot of people who don't really have a dependent relationship on God. They have a codependent relationship with God, meaning that they have this view of God that he's kind of this moody baby, you know, who it's our job to tiptoe around just right because otherwise God's going to have a mood swing and we're going to ruin his day. So we don't want to have that person have a bad day, you know, because if they do, you know what happens to us. So it's our job then to keep God okay by how we act. And all that is is just living out perhaps a bigger version of a previous relationship system that we were in. If you were the hero in your family system and you're in a church system that demands heroes, then you already know how to do that stuff. And so you do all the good church stuff, and then people put you up front and hold you in front of everybody and say, look at this, and you're the example and all that. And you get to just do your job in a different relationship system. So it really does fit real well with God's stuff, I think. And that's why we have to work through this stuff so that we're not just acting out our old skills in new relationships. The other question that says, how are the roles different in a blended family? And the roles aren't necessarily different in a blended family, but it is conceivable that you could have some conflicts if you end up with children from each family having the same jobs. So if you ended up with a hero from one family and a hero from the other family, then what that means is you used to get all the attention and all the praise and all the glory, and now you've got to share it, and you don't want to share it. The first child job is a great job. You understand? Now, it's not a great job if you're stuck and it's about being dysfunctional. I'm just talking about in terms of the payoff. It's a great payoff. The part of the payoff that's not great is having to carry the weight of the family feeling good. That's a bad payoff. But in terms of avoiding trouble and getting perks and things like that, and now you've got to share them with this other person, so it's conceivable that you'd have some conflicts there. The other thing about it is, Has anybody here provided foster care for anybody? Okay. When you do foster care, what happens is that you take this person from outside the system, and they are in the middle of the system from day one. Understand? It's just like taking a person and sticking them right in the middle of the system, and then your job is, with that person or with anybody else who's in the middle, is to keep trying to push people to the outside. You don't want people to live in the middle of the system. And if you don't find a way to get that person back to the outside, then the system's going to set up around them in a way that actually keeps them there, and people are going to resent the fact that they're getting all this attention when we used to get it, things like that. So our job is to keep pushing people to the outside of the circle, even though at the same time we realize that someone is always going to be in the inside because there's no such thing as a problemless family. Someone is going to be in there, you know, most of the time there will be someone there, but our job is to not help them be stuck there, but to keep finding ways to get everybody on the outside and not get stuck that way. So blended families, you know, I had another question, and that was, is it possible to have two parents in the middle of the family? And yes, it is, and it's possible to have two parents in the middle of the family as individuals and also as parental units. You know what I'm saying? Like the mom is in the middle for one reason, the dad is in the middle for another, and then there's also this arrangement that the parents have that somehow even put them both in the middle at the same time together. And so then the circles might align differently around each parent. So someone who is the hero for one parent might be the troublemaker for the other and that kind of stuff, and it gets really complicated. But it's not impossible to deal with and to recover from if you put it all out here and look at it. If you just try to do it differently and not look at it and you can't admit to stuff and you can't need help, then it's really tough to do that. Anyway, okay. We're going to talk about another way that this empty full circle finds its way into relationships. I ended the session on characteristics of shame-based systems by saying that the last characteristic is that shame-based systems have people who are empty on the inside. And when I say empty, I just mean in a state of unmet needs. I don't mean like you're a really empty person. I mean not being full of their needs being met. That's all I mean. But because love and acceptance is based on performance, then this person has learned to perform. So they're full on the outside, empty on the inside. So let's call this person Person A. and person A is empty on the inside, full on the outside. The thing about this person is that since how things look is more important than what's real, they haven't been taught to ask inside kinds of questions. Their main concern is how things look. Because this person is needy, then they need to come out of this family system of relationships with their needs unmet, still looking for somebody to meet their needs. And so guess who they would gravitate toward? They'd gravitate toward somebody who looks good. Never asking the question, where is this stuff coming from on the inside? You know, is this real behavior? Or is this just external behavior? Because after all, that's all that matters is external behavior, right? So a lot of times they run into person B and many times person B is empty on the inside and full on the outside as well, because what attracts these people is that this emptiness, this neediness, looks over here at this full behavior, and that full behavior promises to meet my needs. And then the emptiness of person B looks over here at the full performance of person A, and that person promises to meet their needs. And so it's like, aha, finally, here's someone who cares about me and tries hard and does it right and is trying to do all this for me. And once again, the critical point here is that neither one of these people have been taught, it's not their inclination, their natural thing, to ask the inside question, what is really going on inside this person? Where is this coming from? For instance, when I was in college, I went to Bethel College, we had a rule there that members of the opposite sex could visit people from the opposite sex on Sunday afternoon for four or five hours. I can't remember what it is anymore, like 1 to 6 or something like that. That's it, okay? You couldn't go in anybody else's, anybody of the opposite sex room any other time. You could only go from 1 to 4 or 1 to 6 on Sundays. And so when my wife, who was my fianc√©e at the time, when she came and visited my dorm room, my dorm room was clean. Because clean rooms are the right behavior when you're courting someone. Do you understand this? it would not be a wise strategic behavior to have a messy room if the person that you're trying to marry and have a relationship with comes and looks so clean rooms are the right behavior so when she came and looked in my room it was clean now it wasn't because I was that clean of a person actually in the family I grew up in we had a rule that said it doesn't matter if you're a clean person it just matters if you look clean if someone's looking so we didn't have to do any stuff unless somebody was going to come over and look then we had to rush around and do a bunch of stuff but I figured out also that it was so important to my mom what people thought of our house that if I waited long enough she would just clean my room understand? and so at that time I was pulling the ultimate coup and getting out of doing this but the end result is that I'm a person now who didn't learn cleaning skills at the time in my life when I'm supposed to learn them, but I could crank out a clean room if someone was looking. So she'd come, and there'd be this clean room, and she thought, aha, here's this clean person. And of course, she was doing the same thing, although I didn't know that at the time either. And now we're two adults who lack cleaning skills trying to teach our kids how to clean, and we're trying to give away something we don't have. The biggest struggle in our house, the biggest struggle in our house between the parents and the kids and among all of us is overcleaning. It's the biggest issue because we're like starting from scratch. We're all, none of us know how to do it and we're all trying to do it and we spend incredible amounts of energy because we lack skills doing this. When we would come to a door, you know, I'd run ahead and open the door because that's the right behavior. But now look at this. If I'm doing this behavior, to get a relationship, to earn or to acquire a relationship with this person. If that's the reason why I'm doing the behavior and I get the relationship with the person, then I don't need to do that behavior anymore. You understand? Plus, the fact that this positive behavior was inconsistent with my lack of cleaning skills in my life on the inside, then it wasn't even real. Understand it was only real for someone to come and look at, but it wasn't a real expression of my values or my living skills. So because it was inconsistent with who I really was, plus the fact that now I had gotten with it what I was trying to get with it, which means I don't have to do it anymore, then it goes away. And that's what happens. People who have relationships that start like this end up getting real surprised, because they go, wow, they look so great during the whole dating time and six months after we're married, all this good stuff disappeared. And it's because, first of all, maybe it wasn't even consistent in the first place. It was just pretend. And second of all, it got what it was designed to get, which was you. So now they don't have to do this anymore. So when I ask people who come in for marriage counseling, how long were you married before you realized this wasn't working like you thought it would, most people answer six months. And it's interesting that I could ask a couple that was married for six years, and they'd say six months, and I could ask them, someone who's married 20 years, 6 months, 30 years, 6 months. Everybody has a sense that about 6 months into this deal, no matter how long they were married, 40 years, how long were you married before you realized that this wasn't turning out the way you thought? 6 months, even if they were married 40 years. That after about 6 months, people started running out of gas, and they noticed that all this good stuff that attracted them in the first place is kind of disappearing and they don't know what it is, which means that they've had 39 and a half years of denial. Or just trying hard to overcome this, you know, or trying hard not to see this, that kind of thing. And so this relationship goes in kind of cycles, or cycles isn't really right, it's more like it exhibits certain stages or characteristics or whatever, and one of them is denial. And so you ask these folks, how are you doing? And they say, fine, we're doing great. Even though on the inside, they're scared to death because all this stuff they thought was going to happen isn't happening. And all this stuff they were afraid was going to happen is starting to happen. And it's because the relationship wasn't based on what's real. It was based on what you could see on the outside. And so people go through denial. But for some people, they run out of gas. They say, I'm not doing this anymore. You know, I mean, I've tried and tried and tried, and it's not okay, and I can't try anymore. I don't know what to do anymore. And so they kind of run out of gas, and they say, we need help. And now the denial is broken, okay? Or someone gets a black eye, or someone gets in a fight in the church parking lot, and people see it. So now everybody knows. It doesn't do as much good to deny it anymore, you know, because somebody knows. They can kind of hold you accountable and ask you how it's going. So we leave this stage now and go to the next phase, which would be that person A, and by the way, this isn't just about marriage. Do you understand this? This is about the ways that people try to get filled on the inside. And so even for people who aren't married, this applies, I think, because this could be a friend acting like you're capable of performing well enough to meet their needs, and then you finding out that you can't and burning out of the relationship. person A thinks that the reason why they're so sad or so unfulfilled or whatever is because of person B so they fix person B they fix the other person they look over at person B and person B just doesn't have enough of these positive behaviors that they wish they had so what they do is they fix them they lecture them, they bribe them, they plead with them they beg, they threaten, they quote Bible verses at them, they leave books around for them to read, they do all kinds of stuff, try to get person B to do some more positive behaviors because then they'd be okay. Or they compare them to where they came from, and they say, well, you know, in my family they used to do this, and you don't do this, and so they try to get them to act differently. Well, see, at the same, so while they're doing that, though, the message that they're sending over here to person B is, I don't like you. But I would if you did this, if you did this, if you stopped doing this. So now, the relationship, one of the relationships that God has given to cement on a horizontal level unconditional kinds of love and acceptance for people, even if we don't like behaviors, that is consistent with God's stance toward us on a vertical level, now is sending exactly opposite of the messages and there's strings all over it, and basically love and acceptance is based on perform, so perform. And people feel that. That's because in this scenario I've just described, person B is being inadequate to meet the needs of person A. And the problem is that person B is inadequate to meet the needs of person A, but as long as they don't know they are, they're going to keep trying to be adequate, and person A is going to keep trying to get them to be adequate. This is treating the resources like they're the source and acting like another person is capable of doing the job of filling me up, which they're not. So the reason this doesn't happen isn't because people don't try hard, because they do try hard. The couples that I get in marriage counseling have tried as hard as you can even imagine. They belong in the Hall of Fame of trying hard because trying hard is not what's been lacking here. Actually, trying hard makes this worse because if person A is looking over at person B as kind of a false god, you understand what I mean by that now? Like somehow they're going to fill me up or make me okay, then they're a false god. There's somebody other than God that I'm looking to to make me okay. And if person B takes on that challenge and tries harder, they're just trying to be a better false god. And so if they pull it off, they've reinforced the idolatry that's happening in the relationship. And so trying hard doesn't make it better, it makes it worse. Well, this doesn't work. And so sometimes person A looks over at person B, and there's a negative thing going on over here on the outside. Well, see, if you're getting okay from another human being's behavior and they do a negative thing, it's bad PR. I mean, it drives you nuts. So you either have to fix this then or hide it, you know, make sure nobody sees this because this feels like it's a reflection on you. And so you've got to fix this. So that would be now they're not being inadequate, They're being a broken false god, and people hate it when their false gods are broken, so they try to fix their little false god. Well, that doesn't work. So sometimes person A looks over here, and person B is doing a positive thing, but it's just negative to person A. In other words, it's not really negative, but they just think it's negative. And to person B, it's okay. It's no big deal. Where they came from, nobody had an issue with it. It was okay, but now to the first person, it's a terrible thing. And so they end up fixing them even when they're not broken. So they fix them when they're inadequate, and they fix them when they're broken, and they're even fixing them when they're not broken. They're fixing them all the time. This would be like an issue about how you load the dishwasher. Like person B gets the job to load the dishwasher, but person A is the only one who really knows the ultimate cosmic right universal way to load the dishwasher. So then they're over here fixing the way that person B did the dishwasher, even though the way they're doing the dishwasher ain't broke. this would be the ever popular how you load the toilet paper on the roll debate which is a real thing people argue about this stuff because the debate goes if you load it over the top or underneath to come out the bottom and which one saves more paper and people just get incredible arguments about this because each person knows the right way and even though this person happens to be there when the toilet paper runs out so they get to load the new roll, they don't load it right. Now, I was given this illustration at a camp in Missoula, Montana one time a couple years ago, and afterwards a guy came up to me who worked for Boise Cascade Paper Company, and he told me that actually there was a right way to load the toilet paper. And so now I'm going to share this with you, and this will end the debate for all of the people in the room. If it's single-ply, it doesn't matter. You don't save any either way if it's single-ply. But if it's double-ply, you save paper by loading it under. Now everybody says, she told you, I told you. You save paper by loading it under instead of over. Actually, you probably save about 10 sheets of paper for about every 500 rolls of toilet paper. So I'll bet you're glad to know that. Well, the message then that's communicated here is, I don't like you. I'm not okay with you, but I would be if, when, because. And so now instead of having a relationship that affirms people for free, it affirms people based on behaviors, and there aren't enough behaviors there to affirm. So all there is is criticism and shame and those kinds of things. and a message that says you're not okay, but you would be okay if you did it the way that I said. And now the relationship makes people more tired instead of less tired. Well, this doesn't work, and so there's a little bit of a variation on this, and that is that in scenario number two, person A thinks that the reason why they're so sad is because of person B, so they fix person B. In scenario number three, person A thinks that, well, the reason why person B must be so miserable or sad or whatever is because of them, person A, so they fix themselves. They adjust themselves, they change themselves, they read a bunch of books, they get new clothes, they go on a diet, they lose weight, they gain weight, they fix their hair, they give up doing what they like. They do all kinds of stuff fixing themselves because they believe that if they could just fix themselves good enough, then finally person B would be okay. But see, the twist on this is this, that person A fixes themselves so that when they're fixed, person B is fixed, so that when person B is fixed, person A is fixed. So it's just a crooked way of trying to fix the other person, you see, so that when they're fixed, you're fixed. So it's still idolatrous. You know, this couple comes for counseling, and if they get a Christian counselor that has a view of health that it's just about behaviors, external kinds of things and not about inside stuff, which there are a lot of people out there in the church that do that. Health is just about acting a certain way. What's inside doesn't matter. Just fake it until you feel it. Then what happens is that the husband comes in and the counselor says to the husband, well, see, the reason why your wife is so crazy and your kids are off the wall is because you're not being the spiritual leader that you're supposed to be. And so what you need to do is you need to have daily devotions and pray with your family more. And then there's this little dot, dot, dot, you know, like with a parenthesis around it that shouldn't be there, and it's not ever said, you know, but it's kind of like it doesn't matter if you really care about what God has to say. It doesn't really matter if you care, if in your heart you're seeking after what God has to say. Just act like you are, you know. And of course, because this guy's a good performer, he's going to do that. he's going to crank out a Bible study, and then things will settle down maybe, and then once you get what you've been trying to get by doing this behavior that's not consistent in the first place, guess what happens to it? It goes away until things feel bad again, and then they try harder again, and then things feel good, and then they don't have to try so hard, and then things feel bad, and then they try hard, and it goes back and forth like that, you see? So it doesn't matter if you really care about what God has to say, just act like you do, and get your family to act like they do too, and God will bless that and fix your wife and kids. Because God really likes faking it. Well, see, I don't think so. And wives, the reason why your husband's so weird and your kids are off the wall is because you're not being as submissive as you're supposed to be because good wives are supposed to be submissive. And actually, I'm going to talk about submission in the last hour and what that's really about, and that's really about husbands and wives, not just wives, because I think that submission is so important it needs to be a real thing, not a fake thing. So what you need to do, wives, is you need to stand behind your husband and support what he's doing, dot, dot, dot, even if you don't really support it, even if you don't agree with it in your heart and you think it's disgusting or inappropriate, it doesn't matter, just help it happen because that's what submissiveness is, and God will bless your faking it and fix your husband and kids, you know, just pretend to go along with stuff you really hate. Meet him at the door wrapping cellophane paper, everything will be great. I mean, you know, books were written about this. Well, see, God hates faking it, and he hates pretending, and he doesn't bless it. But people do get tired doing it. And this doesn't work, and actually people end up, after trying hard, believing that trying hard is the solution, they try hard, and when it doesn't work, they end up with more shame than when they started. So now this message has strings all over it, and instead of it building people up and giving us rest, it just makes us more and more tired. The last thing that happens is that people leave because it's so shaming and so indicting to be here and so many reminders about how you don't do it well enough, they just leave, you know. But what I've noticed is that for lots of people in churches, church people tend to think that God likes lousy marriages better than he likes divorce. And they think that as long as they don't get a piece of paper from Hennepin County that says this is a broken relationship, God can't tell. Because God doesn't care about what's real, he just cares about pieces of paper. So as long as you don't get the paper that says this is broken, God won't be able to tell. The truth is that God hates lousy marriages and divorce the same. He hates them both. Because a lousy marriage, a broken relationship and a broken relationship with a piece of paper are both broken relationships and God can tell whether there's a paper or not. People come to me for marriage counseling. Some people actually come to have me help them get a divorce. They have all kinds of guilt and shame about doing that. They know I talk about grace a lot and they want me to give them some grace so they can go do that. If you want to have a broken relationship, go someplace else, okay, because I'm not willing to help that happen. And if you want me to help you stay the same, because some people come for that too, they just want to smooth everything over and keep what they got. If you want to keep what you got, there are people who help you do that too, okay? But if you want to do what it takes to have a relationship, then let's go for it. Because God hates both of those the same. Christians like lousy marriages better than they like divorce because they're less shaming. Not really. They aren't really less shaming. But it seems like they're less shaming because, frankly, in the church, divorce is about one of the worst things you could do. I mean, it's like we have more compassion and forgiveness for people who have shot people than for people who get divorced. And so now because the shame is public, it's on record, it seems like it's a bigger deal than if it's under the surface. So because they think that God likes lousy marriages better than divorce, and because they really like lousy marriages better than divorce, they find ways to leave and stay both at the same time. And the most obvious way to leave and stay both at the same time would be having an affair, okay? Because then you're leaving and staying both at the same time. But that's so obvious, I won't even talk about that. Let me talk about some other ways. Over here is a person who has a job, and in their job, they're a vacuum cleaner repair person. and they can take a vacuum cleaner apart into a million pieces, find the broken piece, replace it, put it back together again, flip the switch and it runs and people give them money. So when they're over here, it's a constant reminder of how adequate and how competent they are and when they're over here, it's a constant reminder of how inadequate and how incompetent they are. So where do you think it's easier for them to be? Over at their work. So here they are over at work, mood altering now out of the pain of this relationship. But because person A gets okay from person B, they notice that they're not around. So they go, you're not around. You're never around. You don't love me. If you loved me, you wouldn't be spending so much time over there at their job. And because person B is such a good performer, they come back. They go, okay, I'm back. Happy? But their heart and their head is still over there because that's where it feels good. So then person A notices that, and they say, well, when you're here, you're not even here. And then person B says, well, see, I mean, when I'm over there, I'm in trouble. If I come home, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble either way. Television. You know, I'm not a crusader against television. I watch television. I watch television on purpose. I like to watch television. When I leave here today, I'll probably go watch television. What television does for me is it lets me not have to think. And I need to not think sometimes. Actually, the best show for not thinking is Mr. Rogers. If you ever want to not think, go watch Mr. Rogers. You watch Mr. Rogers, he does it all. He's got it all thought out ahead of time. He says it slowly. He explains it all. It's great. I watch television on purpose. I used to watch television by accident. You ever watch television by accident? When you watch television by accident, you watch a lot more television than when you watch television on purpose. Watching television by accident is going home, turning on the TV and saying, well, let's see what's on tonight, and then watching three hours of television. Watching television on purpose is getting the TV guide out. On Sunday, even, would be best when you first get it, and going through every night of the week and saying, okay, on Monday night, here's what we'll watch and put in a star by it. And then watching that and nothing else, okay? On Sunday, before the TV's on, decide what you're going to watch on Wednesday. On Sunday, decide what you're going to watch on Thursday and then watch what you picked and don't watch what you didn't pick on purpose. I'm the guy who can watch 83 cable stations all at the same time with a channel changer. Okay, it's my choice of weapon. Channel changer. And follow all the stories. and keep track of the plot on every one and know what's happening in every single story. So I can't be watching television by accident. Do you understand? It's like another thing for me to mood alter with. I have to do something different about that. But for some people, you see, it's easier to be over here doing this watching TV stuff than it is to be having this relationship. And so they're over there. Everybody can watch TV good enough. Nobody comes away from watching TV going, oh, I'm a terrible TV watcher. And for some people, it's just easier to do that. Do you understand? It's not about whether it's an evil or a good thing. It's just that some people use that to not deal with what's real in their life. That's all. Hunting. I like to hunt. I grew up in northeastern Wisconsin, and I know it's not politically correct to like to hunt, but tough. I like to hunt. And I lived two blocks away from high school, and all fall, before basketball season started, I would walk home from high school, get in the car, and within 15 minutes I was in deep forest. And I loved to do this, and it's one of the things that my dad did with me and that worked for me, and it's something that he gave me that still works for me now, and I like to do it. My wife grew up in Baltimore City. She lived in a row house. They had a fire escapes on the back, you know, like the pictures you see, and a backyard that was maybe almost as big as the light area on the screen. And she never met a hunter and didn't know anything about it, and we get married and moved to Minnesota, so I want to go hunting. She says, you're always going hunting. That's a lie. I say, I don't ever get to go hunting. That's a lie. But see, if you're going to get what you want, you've got to embellish. So that when you compromise, you get back to where you wanted to be in the first place. She said, you'd rather be with the ducks than with me. I'd say, it's not like this. It's not, okay, who would I rather be with? The ducks or my wife? Okay, it's not like that. It's that I just like to go hunting. Now I'm going hunting and I'm feeling guilty. I never felt guilty when I was a kid going hunting. No, I feel guilty going hunting. If I stayed home, I felt angry. If I went hunting, she felt angry. If I stayed home, she felt guilty. I figured, as long as we're both going to feel lousy either way, I'm going hunting. I'm going hunting. What? This is... Is it possible for husbands to go hunting too much? Yes. Is it okay to do that? No. This is about hunting, but it's mostly not about hunting. Mostly what it's about are under-the-surface kind of stuff that this found. Okay, and I'll give you a little clue. My wife came from a family that had a rule that said good wives meet all the needs of their husbands. And she saw that in her mother trying to do that for her father. and so good wives always meet all the needs of their husbands which meant that if I wanted to go hunting that must mean that she's not doing everything that she was supposed to be doing as a wife because if she was, I wouldn't even want to go hunting that's how she thought so every time I wanted to go hunting, she heard that as an indictment on her when it had absolutely nothing to do with her and I would like to do that whether she was there or not Is it possible that I would want to go hunting to mood alter the pain of our marriage? Yes! But it's not automatic. Do you understand? I used to buy her season tickets to the Guthrie in March so that when October came, I could throw that up to her when she griped about me going hunting. So that thing that she thought was a real gift back in March, you know, wasn't really a gift at all. It was a deal. and she just didn't know the conditions of it until later on. And then she'd say, you're always going hunting. I'd say, well, I bought you season... I mean, I even went with her. And I even got kind of fooled because I liked it. It was okay. I never, you know, where I grew up, I mean, there wasn't any place to go to. I mean, there just wasn't, you know, you went hunting. I had a rule that said, good husbands always know what to say when their wives are sad. See then Holly would come to me and she'd say you know I'm really sad about this and I'd go well and give her the answer why she shouldn't be sad why she really didn't need to feel like that because good husbands always know what to say when their wives are sad although I hardly ever knew what to say I was clueless I didn't have a clue what to say I acted like I knew what to say because good husbands know what to say when their wives are sad and so the message she got was something was wrong with her for being sad. You're not handling your sadness correctly. If you'd handle your sadness like I do when I'm sad, then you'd be okay like I'm okay. That's how she heard it. Even though in my heart, I really wanted to help. But I had this goofy rule I was trying to live up to. The real rule is good husbands hardly know what to say at all when their wives are sad. My kids would come home from school, and I'd say, how was school? And they'd tell me about a sad thing that happened at school or a bummer on the bus ride, you know, and instead of just hugging them or whatever, I'd tell them all the reasons, all the ways to think about it so they didn't have to feel what they felt. And then pretty soon they stopped telling me how they felt because I was trying to fix them. They weren't broken. They were just sad. You don't have to fix somebody who's sad. You just have to hug somebody who's sad. Now when my wife comes to me when she's sad, I just hug her. I just go, oh, wow. Works every time. she didn't want me to solve her sadness she wanted to know that she could be sad and I'd still be okay with her because where she came from you couldn't be sad and have people still be okay with you being sad meant something bad about you and she needed to know that no matter how sad she was I wasn't going to go away and you can say that with a hug or a facial expression or just a noise you know. She'd come to me, I remember when we were first married, you know, we've been married 19 years. Most of this is about the first six or seven years, about our marriage. We were so, so tired, so tired. And we tried harder and just got more tired. She'd come to me and she'd say, we don't talk enough. We need to talk more. We should talk more. I'd say, okay, let's talk. Pick a subject. You start, okay? Now it's your idea. Start. she'd say why do I have to ask when we were over at Bethel we'd stay up all night talking in the lounge or in the library or whatever and now I've got to ask you to talk I'd say well see I'm not talking, you're not okay with it I offer to talk, you're not okay with it she'd say we're not affectionate enough I needed a hug this morning and you didn't give me one really? I didn't know that all you have to do is ask death, death those words are death, all you have to do is ask what's the rule? if you have to ask, it doesn't count if you get it, right? all you have to do is ask why do I have to ask, she would say when we were at Bethel you wouldn't keep your hands off me now I've got to ask you for a hug laughter laughter say, see I get a lecture if I don't give you a hug, I get a lecture see, this is not about hugs should husbands talk to their wives? yes, should they hug their wives? yes this is not about that this is about an expectation and unwritten rules and trying to figure out how to do it right and trying like hard to do it right and trying hard just makes it worse people end up getting more tired as time goes on what else? money, some people do money out here to fix their shame on the inside and mood alter from being over here ministry I did this one too I'm over here visiting the person in the hospital you know, this person who thinks that I'm so great because I'm such a young, busy, important guy and to take time off of my schedule to come and visit low self-esteem them, evidently is such an incredible thing that I'm their hero and I'm a legend because they're telling all their friends you know, you know who came and visited me it's great over here. And then I come home and my wife says, you know, you spend more time visiting people in the hospital than you do with your own family. Well, where's it easier for me to be? But see, the reason why I can do this is because my wife and kids aren't tracking as deeply spiritually as I am, and they don't know how much God needs me to be off saving the families of the world. And God will grant my wife and kids a special dispensation of grace to meet their needs while I'm off over here meeting your needs. Well, see, that's right out of the pit of hell. And that's based on a lie that says God needs me in the first place. God doesn't need us. He wants us. He likes us. He chose us. He equips us. He calls us. He doesn't need us. We need Him. We're penciled in. You understand this? I'm penciled in. I'm penciled in. Who's giving the talk today? Jeff is. In pencil. God could just erase that right out of there and still get this talk without me. You understand it? I'm here. I'll give the talk. but he doesn't need us he wants us he likes us he equips us he uses us but he doesn't need us we need him but if you think that god needs you you might even neglect your family which is what i did in the beginning so one day i've said yes this is 1983 i've said yes to too many things again and i'm sitting on my floor in the living room crying all of a sudden it occurred to me, you know, here I go again and I don't want to go and I wish I'm sad I said yes and I wish I wouldn't have said yes and so I'm taking my suitcase and taking out the dirty stuff and putting in the clean stuff that Holly has washed and got ready for me to go even though she doesn't think I should be gone, which is called what? Enabling. Helping me go when she doesn't think she should go. It's not submission, it's enabling. And it occurs to me, this sinks in a little bit and I start to cry, so I'm going sitting on my floor crying. And Aaron, who is the thermometer of the family, feels the temperature, comes walking in the room, comes walking over, puts her head on my shoulder and pats me on the shoulder and says, don't worry, Daddy, we won't ever forget you. Which is true. That's true no matter what. That's true. But what they're going to remember, I didn't want them to remember. Do you understand? And the idea that they're going to get about God, I don't want them to get. Because the idea that God needs them more than they need, I mean, God needs me more than they need me, is ludicrous. What a puny God that would be. What a wimpy God they're going to have if they have a God that needed their dad more than they need their dad. God doesn't need dads and moms. Families need dads and moms. Dads and moms need God. I also have to tell you that because I'm this first child, I told you about, it's an ongoing battle to not be off saving the families of the world because it's my job, understand? But 1983 was a light went on. That's when I figured some stuff out. Well, this doesn't work. And then sometimes what happens is that these people have a baby. And see, this baby, they're a little empty circle. meaning they're in a state of unmet needs understand? They don't know that they're loved and accepted they don't know that they're capable and worthwhile as a matter of fact they're not capable our job is to help them become capable they don't know they're not alone our job is to help them know they're not alone I don't know if you knew this but when babies are really little when you actually physically leave their field of vision you don't exist do you know that? you exist if they can see you you don't exist if they can't see you you put them in the nursery and leave there's 40 other babies there there's 20 workers, they scream and cry they're alone, even though they're not alone our job is to have relationships that build them and strengthen them on the inside so that they know that they're not alone even if we have to leave them alone a little bit but see in this family these people are coming out of their unmet needs themselves, looking at each other to do that looking at other things to do that which don't work. And so now instead of the parents being there to meet the needs of the kid, they can't. They can only give away what they have. They can't give away what they don't have. So they look over here at the child. And so now this child has to look good and be cute and do tricks and never run in church. And then these parents will feel like okay parents based on the performance of the kid. So the family flips upside down. And the child is there to meet the needs of the parents. Which makes them the parent, by the way, then. and then they come out of this family system with unmet needs, looking full, just like their parents did, looking for somebody who's going to meet their needs, and then they find someone and the system passes on and on and on. And then they go to church. And on Sunday morning, somebody's fixing somebody for eating too slow, and somebody's fixing somebody for eating too fast, and somebody's fixing somebody for wearing the wrong colored shirt, or the wrong colored socks, or partner hair on the wrong side, or dressing with the wrong, you know, whatever, dress on, and driving too fast or driving too slow, or not taking the cosmic right universal route to church, which only this one person knows, you know, because it's their goal in life to always take the shortest route someplace. You can't go two blocks out of your way. That breaks a bunch of rules. And then when they hit the door and the greeters say, how are you doing? They say, fine. this is not fine this is tiredness this is about control this is about coming over people this is about as good as it gets this is called codependency there are a lot of ways to talk about this you know the good news of the gospel the issue that the cross solves here is that the cross Jesus' performance what he did gives every person in this system a place from which to know that they're loved and accepted for free and give them a sense of value in life that's settled even before all these other people figure out how to do it right enough. And based on that, you see, then we can address issues that are affecting the family just because they're not working, not because when everything is doing great, then I'm going to be okay. And in this system, everybody's health is on hold waiting for everybody else to be okay. Being a Christian doesn't give these people a bigger, longer list of Christian behaviors to do so that when they finally do them, everybody's going to be okay. Being a Christian gives these people a source to which to turn on whom to lean on as our source of value and acceptance and identity so that everybody in our lives don't have to feel the weight of generating that with their performance, and then we can deal with stuff in the context of what works and doesn't work in relationships instead of having to generate self-worth for one another. That's the good news. But that's a hard fight. So, next session I'm going to talk about graceful families and what they look like. And at this point, are there any questions about this? Yes? This has to do with the toilet paper. Yeah, the toilet paper. I want to know what happens with that. I mean, in two sentences, can you explain what do you do with that? I mean, if that's the biggest issue? That's the biggest issue? No, that... Yeah, that wouldn't... When that issue comes out in a marriage counseling session, that usually isn't the biggest issue. That's usually a very small issue that seems to promise some kind of tangible solution because all the other issues are so intangible and they're so big that it finds its way into something that you could actually point at. My answer to the toilet paper question is, I've got two rules about that. One is don't sweat the small stuff, and the other is most stuff is small stuff. But if you and I can't talk about the real dynamics of what's going on, because we're the problem for noticing the problem, and it accelerates into this big thing all the time, then we'll find some little thing that we can pick at. And usually that's all that is. It's more of a smoke screen or whatever. But it is an illustration of how somebody knows how the other person's supposed to be doing it better than they do. You know, if you tell your kids to load, there is a right way and a wrong way to load the dishwasher. That's why they have a manual, okay? And if you load the dishes on top that are supposed to go on the bottom, they won't get clean. and if you load the dishes on the bottom that are supposed to be on the top, the thing won't turn around. And there are some right ways, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about people who aren't following the manual. I'm talking about people who put the cups here instead of the glasses, and they're really supposed to put the glasses here instead of the cups, and the forks are supposed to be here and the knives. See, well, when you're arguing about that kind of stuff, that usually isn't really the issue. That usually is something that's kind of tangible that you can know if you won or not, depending if you win, because the issues that are really there is that somebody is trying to fix somebody, and this is just one of the little ways it comes out. Usually it's a small illustration or a small metaphor of a really big dynamic that shames people and sends messages of unacceptance. Yes? Do most of us see ourselves as being as false as being? The question is, Do most people see themselves as B, the person who's being fixed, as opposed to A, the person who's doing the fixing? I'm not sure. I think that I can, for myself, I think that I see myself most of the time as, I've seen myself as B, although I do have seen myself as being a tired B, okay, and deciding that the real way to get her to change would be to fix all this stuff so that finally she'll give in and do it my way in which case I'm just fixing her again. So I think that it's sneakier than that. But let me ask you a question. How many people have seen themselves as a B? The one being fixed, the one on the receiving end. How many have seen yourself as the fixer? Actually, there were more people who saw themselves as A than B, as far as I could tell. It's not a sexual thing either. Okay, it's not, it's not, my observation in dealing with married couples is that it's not like mostly this is the male and that's the female or that's the female and that's the male. It doesn't matter. It can be either one. Yeah. If you're the one, if you're the one, if you're the one, how do you leave A alone when they're trying to fix you and how do you quite answer that? Yeah. How do you deal with the fact that person A is trying to fix you all the time? well the way you don't deal with it is that you don't give in to person A even though it's not a real thing for you your struggle is going to be to give the real answer just because it's real you understand what I just said? do the real thing for you just because it's the real thing whether or not they're going to be fixed or not whether or not they're going to be okay with it or not and then they have to deal with whether if they're not okay with it they're going to have to deal with that But sometimes what person B does is they know that if they do the thing, even though it would be the real thing for them to do, person A is really going to like it. So they don't do it. Because they have done it so much to try to fix person A, and they know that that hasn't lasted, that they're not willing to expend any more energy in that kind of hopeless pursuit. So at that point, then, they're just trying to control the other person with their response. Just give the real response. Person A is going to have a hard time believing that if they actually asked person B for what they wanted, that if person B did it, it was really something they wanted to do versus just to get them off their case. If this is a married couple, the struggle that person A is going to have is to learn to be honest with what they need and what's going on on the inside and just say that because it's real, not to get the other person to change, but just because it's real. And then when person B responds, person B's struggle is going to be to just give the real response, yes or no, not based on how that's going to affect the other person, but just based on whether that's the real response. And then person A, once again, is going to have to struggle with trusting that that was the real response instead of the patronizing, you know, placating kind of response. And see, what this does is that then if there is somebody who's selfish or somebody who is dysfunctional, it just makes them look selfish or dysfunctional, and then you can give them help. Then you can deal with it. When people are acting like they're not selfish when they are, you can't help them. They can't change. They don't change. But you know as well as I do that people who have acted unselfish to you when they really were, you end up paying for that later anyway. So that's not a free thing anyway, is it? You end up having to pay that back at some future date. So this is very tiring to do this. It's not necessary to do this. But a lot of people do this. And can you understand why trying hard makes it worse? Because if you have the role of being a good enough false god to fix somebody else and you didn't try hard to do it, you're acting like you could actually do it, which you can't. So it feeds itself.
