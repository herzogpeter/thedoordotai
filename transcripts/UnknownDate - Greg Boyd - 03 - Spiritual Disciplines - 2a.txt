When we go to pray, and we'll be talking more about this next week, but when we go to pray, your thoughts are scattered, your mind's scattered, you're not there, you're not really present. And centering exercises are intended to help you get focused, to help put your mind in a receptive mode, into a mode where your prayer will be effective, where it will really do some good and some spiritual work will get done, as opposed to just being a time where They take up time thinking about other things. So centering exercises are there to call us to a center of peace in which we can hear from the Lord, in which we can talk to the Lord genuinely out of the depth of our heart, in which we can let go of some of the hustle-bustle and the things that are in our life. So what I want to do is this. We're going to have a time of silence. And in this time of silence, I simply want us to notice how busy our minds are. Our minds are addicted to activity, to thought. They can't help themselves. And that is one of the main obstacles that we face when we are going to prayer, is that our mind keeps on wanting to do its own thing. It is a thought factory. It bubbles forth thoughts continually, and they get in the way of what we're trying to do. If you try not to think, it's very difficult. Try to just be in a thoughtless state for five seconds, and I bet you can't do it. The mind is just too active. But one way that I and one way that many others have found help to calm down the mind is to be proactive about its thought process. What I mean is this. To shut yourself off for a moment, close your eyes, and then say to your mind, speak, I am listening. Speak. Go ahead and talk. I want to hear what you have to say. And then just be in that receptive mode, waiting for it to talk. And treat your mind as you would a movie screen. Just be detached and observe it. And after a short period of time, very short period of time probably, you'll find all of a sudden that you are talking. You will have forgotten that you were in the receiving mode, and you'll start talking, you'll start jabbering. The mind is just a ceaseless jabber box. Well, notice that it's talking, and as soon as you notice it, say, thank you for that thought, speak again, I'm listening. And be in that receptive mode again. And pretty soon you'll find yourself thinking about, when's this exercise going to end? You'll find yourself thinking about, what are other people thinking about this? You'll find yourself thinking about the laundry. Or you'll find yourself thinking about how tired you are. You should have another cup of coffee. The mind will start talking to you. Did you know Daneta? And I think that it is. Just say, as soon as you catch that happening, say thank you. Speak again. I'm listening. And let's do this for several minutes. If you're not used to it, this can be kind of irksome. We're not used to doing this sort of thing. You'll find yourself maybe getting restless. You'll find yourself getting frustrated because you'll find yourself thinking and you're not listening. You forget this. You forget to do it. But it's a good way to calm the mind down, just by paying attention to its ceaseless chatter. It is constant talking. "Yap, yap, yap." It's always yapping. Even when you're sleeping, the mind's yapping away. Well, just notice the yapping and don't try to fight it. Don't get angry. Just notice it. Treat it like a movie screen and say, "Thank you. Now yap some more. I'm listening." and wait for it. What you find is that a certain kind of calmness begins to come over you. Maybe it won't happen tonight. But it's a way of quieting the mind down so that when we begin to pray, when we begin to listen to the Lord, there's room on the frequency channel for Him to get through. Many times the Lord tries to talk to us, but we're so busy yapping to ourselves that there's no end. This is a way of just kind of quieting down the yapping a little bit. So spend some time centering. Close your eyes and tell yourself. These people have no idea what we're talking about. Close your eyes and just really try to tune out everything else and listen to your mind. And even when you don't tune out everything else, that's fine. Just notice it and thank your mind for it. And let's do this for several minutes. now i'd ask you to fill that speaking voice with some content you tell it what to say and i'd like to suggest you to say the words as a prayer say it with deliberation and every time you say it say it with as much meaning as you can invest with it repeat the phrase in your mind not my will but thine be done not my will but thine be done Lord you've said that the double minded man is unstable in all of his ways and our minds are so often double-minded, triple-minded, quadruple-minded. We're torn in many different directions. Our minds are pulled like pieces of metal to magnets, and we're scattered, we're fragmented. Being pulled in those directions, Lord, it's very difficult for us to find that center out of which all growth and health and wholeness and life comes. But Lord, teach us what it is to be wholly dedicated to you. If only for a few moments, what it is to be wholly surrendered to you. To say in the very core of our being, Lord, not our will, but your will be done. and to invest all of our consciousness and all of our energy and all that we are and all that our ambition is to invest all of it into that prayer, Lord. Not our will, but yours be done. Create in us, Lord, and use this class, if it be your will. Create in us a purity of heart that wills one thing above all else, second to none, that wills your will, that returns to you that position that you created us to have before the fall, where we are totally dependent on you, and the beauty of that dependency shines forth in our life, and that our will is to reflect you. Our will is to glorify you. Our will is to have our life to be an artwork that you've created, and through which you've showed forth your image, your glory, and your love and joy. creating us that purity of heart, Lord God. Wean us from the other things we will, from the idols in our life that promise fulfillment and never deliver, that we may chase them a whole lifetime before we find that out. From the concerns that worry us and bring us down because we don't put them into your hands and see you as the providential Father who has our best interest in heart. Ween us, Lord God, from the many things that take away from us the truth, that the purity of heart is to will one thing. Use this class time, Lord, for your glory. We pray in your name. Amen. One of the things that happens sometimes is that if you take a phrase, not my will, but thine be done. See, I just said that. It comes right out of the King James Version. Then I go quote the King James Version again, and all of a sudden the word thine began to sound weird to me. A lot of times if you say a phrase over and over again, it can begin to sound strange. Take anything, paradiddle, or say it over and over again. Paradiddle sounds weird anyways. Paranoia, paranoia. What a weird word. Any word begins to sound odd like that. The trick is to keep on investing it. What I find helps sometimes is to emphasize a different word. Not my will, but thine be done. Not my will, but thine be done. Not my will. And it emphasizes different points. It's a way of keeping the meaning fresh and keeping the words fresh. And what you do is you just pour yourself. The words take on more meaning as it becomes an incarnate reality in your life. Well, last week we were introducing the spiritual disciplines. We talked about Paul's analogy of beating the body as a person would beat their body in training for a race or for some spiritual exercise. That our lives are to have the kind of quality, the kind of intentionality that an athlete has. Your life is a project. You are in a race. And therefore our lives should have this kind of disciplined intentionality to it. Our life is a project. The goal of which is to see, and here's this phrase I can never get right, how close is it possible for a human being to get to God? How close is it possible for a human being to get to God? That's our goal, our ambition, to grow in the Lord. And the disciplines are there as ways of bringing into focus and of bringing into reality that ambition. We saw how throughout Scripture a disciplined life is presupposed. That's part of what it is to be a follower of Jesus and how spiritual blessings are always connected to obedience, Psalms 15, and how discipline is a central part of the Christian tradition that we've inherited. We then ask the question, how does all this connect with salvation by grace? We talked about what salvation by grace is, that we're saved for free, totally for free. You can never improve upon the righteousness that you have through Jesus Christ. Whatever you do in life, it's not going to add to what you already have because of Christ. Whatever the motives are for being disciplined, it's not to get points with God. But then we saw some misconceptions that arise from an understanding of grace, or maybe a misunderstanding of grace. One is called antinomianism, which means lawlessness, where you have people who say, did we get this far? Okay, where you have people who say that your behavior is totally inconsequential, or unimportant, that God doesn't see your sin. A lot of times this is associated with this idea of Christians, all the things that are said about Christians in Scripture are positionally true. They concern your position in Christ, but God wears Jesus' focals or Jesus' glasses, and therefore doesn't see your sin. And we saw the mistake of that. The other idea is that all growth should occur naturally, and by naturally I mean when it feels right, when it just sort of comes out of you as a byproduct, as though no struggle or no willpower was a part of the Christian life, which is clearly not the case. I suggested that when Scripture declares us to be holy and righteous and blameless before God. It's not just speaking about a positional truth, though it is true positionally. We are in Christ. That's our position. And therefore, it is true positionally. But when God declares something to be true, when God declares a reality, it is a reality. God's word defines reality. He says, let there be light, and there is light. He says, let there be the earth, and there is the earth. God's word is, to put a phrase philosophically, ontologically productive. How do you like that? It creates being. That's what ontologically means. So when God says, Lori Rakestraw is righteous and holy and blameless, Lori Rakestraw is righteous, holy, and blameless. God declares it, and it is so. Now the question is, then why does Lori still have some of the attitudes she has and the carnal desires that she has, and as a professor I can say, aberrant behaviors that she has. I had to pick on you. Why don't our attitudes and our behaviors and our affections, our emotions immediately line up? What is going on there? the bottom line is this when god said in the beginning let there be light there was nothing to oppose god's word god said it and there all there was was void nothingness and and therefore there was light immediately but when god says let laurie be righteous there's something already there god doesn't annihilate the old laurie he recreates the old laurie but there's an old laurie and an old greg that is already there and therefore god's word is true but there's a reality which is over and up against. And this is what the Bible calls the flesh. The flesh is that state of being, just put it in a nutshell, the flesh, Paul's word is sarx, is that state of being which is under the deception of the enemy, that state of being which causes you to experience yourself and experience the world, as though it were not true, that God were the true God and you were the true creation of God that God created you to be. To the degree that we live, whatever else we may believe in our minds, to the degree that we live as though Christ were not Lord, and to the degree that we experience ourselves as though Christ were not Lord, and we were not the true, holy, righteous creatures that he saved us to be, to that degree we are in the flesh. It is lived, is life lived in the lie, the lie of the serpent that defines the flesh, all life that is separated from Christ. So it looks like this, and here I don't mean to show off my artistic ability, but I can't help myself. well you know and kiss the point across this is a man with severe indigestion okay so it's like this and i'm just really giving a a a summary of of i know i'm just touching the surface of this but this isn't the whole point of the course so i'm not going to go into it as in as detail as i would like to but there is a new self there paul calls this the inner self the inner man that's why i drew it on the inside though it's not really an inside outside sort of a distinction. But this is the new self created in Christ Jesus. This is the self that Paul says in Romans 6 is united with Christ. We have been united with Christ. This is the self that is filled with the Spirit, the self that has its motivations and dispositions transformed, that hungers and thirsts after righteousness. This is the self that hates sin. This is the self that is all that God says it is. It's the true self. This is who you are. When you're a believer, this transformation has happened. We are new creations, Paul says, in Christ Jesus. Behold, all things are new. Old things have passed away. Old things have passed away. Trouble is, we have an old self that has passed away but doesn't know it yet. Paul sometimes compares this to a carcass that we carry around. This is the old self, or what Paul calls the flesh, where Paul says in Romans 5 is in Adam. This is the self that identifies with reality in Adam. And this is the self that hungers for independence. And this is the self that loves sin. I was saved when I was 17, and that gave me plenty of time to develop non-Christian ways of thinking and feeling and interacting with the world. And even if you're raised in the church, you have plenty of influence on you. Lord knows you've got plenty of influence on you and is there every day of your life, which is conditioning you to live as though what God says is true about you is not true. Thoughts are like grooves in a mind. They're like water running down a hill. It finds grooves, and it stays in those grooves. And the longer it goes in those grooves, the harder it is to ever get out of those grooves. Well, we get into a rut, a habitual way of thinking about ourselves and a habitual way of experiencing ourselves that is not in conformity with God's Word. So there's the old self and the new self, the outer man and the inner man, the spirit and the flesh. And these two, Paul says in Galatians 5, struggle against one another. They struggle against, there's a conflict there. God says, let there be light, but now there is something which has a reality which opposes that, which says no. God's word is still true, but your old self, your old self wants to live and act and experience itself as though it were not true. What we have, what the Christian life is constituted by, is a truth struggling against the lie. Where's my body? Oh, here it is. Ephesians 4, chapter 4, verses 22 to 23. Let me just read this. What I'm doing here is setting up the rationale for Christian discipline. Paul says this. You, however, did not come to know Christ that way, the way he just discussed with all this antinomianism, this sin and all this kind of stuff. Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught with regard to your former way of life, his flesh, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires. Deceitful desires, because you desire things that you think are going to fulfill you, but it's a lie. It's a lie. If only I had the new car, if only I had the new house, if only I had better clothes, if only I had this ability or that ability, You've only had a new husband or what have you. It's deceitful because you think that it will fulfill you, but it doesn't. That's the old self that is addicted to idols, that is addicted to the flesh. It's being corrupted. It's being destroyed by those deceitful desires. Put off that self, Paul says, to be made new in the attitude of your minds and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. And he goes on to say, therefore each of you must put off falsehood, etc. Then comes some different mandates. The point is this. This putting off and putting on, or sometimes Paul phrases it differently, putting off and manifesting the new self requires discipline. Discipline is required to put off the old and to manifest the new. Oh, yeah, sorry. You be my cue man here, okay? I need some. This doesn't come. There is an old self which has to be warred against. And therefore, while some growth occurs naturally, and that is to say it comes without trying, it comes effortlessly, a lot of times it doesn't. There's an old ingrained habit, a way of thinking, old ways of feeling about yourself. And those just don't disappear. They carry on. It takes discipline to begin to manifest what is true about you over against what is false about you now that you're a Christian. Discipline is the way that we bring our own experience of ourself and our experience of our world and our experience of God into line with the truth of God's word. Discipline is the process by which we get our lives to begin to line up with what is true about us. It doesn't always come effortlessly. in time it does but that's just a sign that the old self is dying the old self is weakening the grip that it had onto you is is is losing its power and there's a lot in the bible that pertains to this bring it bring every thought captive under jesus christ you got to make it a slave to jesus christ that doesn't come naturally because your mind for however old you are has been conditioned by its culture by the pattern of this world paul says in romans 12 2 the pattern of this world has made inroads there and it's a war against it it's a fight against it it's a truth against the lie it's not like these things are equal powers one is true one's false but that that that lie has tremendous habitual influence on us and so that's where discipline comes into being the way of manifesting the new self over against you get this for free you're not a new self because of any disciplines you do rather the disciplines come as a result of the fact that you already have a new self. And the disciplines come as a desire to manifest this new self, who you really are in Christ, over against everything else that the pattern of the world and in your past experience has said about you. Okay, let me confront four major lies that are prevalent in our culture that keep us, I think, from sometimes engaging in discipline as earnestly as we might. These aren't just germane to our culture. They're shared by other cultures, but they're sort of intensely a part of our culture. The first one is that suffering is bad. Suffering is bad. We live in a narcissistic, self-indulgent culture. The way that we do flesh in our culture, and it's different cultures, in other cultures, it's slightly different, But the way we do the flesh in our culture is through pleasure. The God that we serve is usually the God of pleasure. And so we seek to have pleasurable experiences, to do pleasurable things. This is why sex is sort of the premier God of our culture. And there is a sort of floating assumption that says that suffering is always a bad thing. Suffering is a bad thing. There's something inherently wrong with it. It should not be a part of our life. This is why, you know, the idea that, well, this is why, for example, it's okay to talk about safe sex in the light of the AIDS controversy, but if you talk about abstaining from sex, you're seen as being an absolute Victorian prude. Because that's like, how dare you deny people their right? They have a right to express themselves this way. And so it's sort of like a taboo thing. You're cool if you talk about safe sex, but if you talk about abstaining from sex, that's just like impossible. Why even talk about that? There's this sort of assumption that sex drives are sort of like these beasts. This is maybe a legacy of the Freudian era, but it's like it's got to be expressed. No matter what happens, it's got to be expressed. I was talking to somebody a little bit ago on the issue on homosexuality, And there are people that, at least it's claimed, and I'm inclined to believe them, that they were born gay. They never have had an attraction towards a person of the opposite sex. It's just never been there. But they still have sex drives. And my position on it was that that, as far as I can see, means that they're called to celibacy. If that's really a true thing and they can't be healed from that and never develop sexual attraction towards people of the opposite sex, and they say they can't ever develop that and maybe they can't but the bible does talk about people who are called to be celibate jesus talks about that in matthew 19 and so my thinking is that this is a person who is called to be celibate and the response of the person i was talking with was that that's a cruel thing to do how can you possibly even suggest to somebody that they would they should deny their sexuality and uh and you know the assumption is that this is something this is a non-negotiable need that's there. It's got to be lived out. And it's like putting a person in a torture chamber to say that you should go your whole life abstaining from sex. I also think that the reason why homosexuality is so prevalent in our culture is because in our culture, being asexual is not an okay thing. There are people, I think, are really born asexual. This is not a part of their life, and they're called a celibacy. And in past ages, they would have joined the monastery, the priesthood, or what have you. In our culture, that's sort of like, not only is it not permissible to abstain from sex, but it's like, you're really defective if you're not a walking hormone ready to burst. It's like, you know, this is, something's weird with you. And so I think a lot of people are born asexual, but they realize they don't have an attraction towards the opposite sex. But now the alternative in our culture, since the alternative is to be, is not to be, you know, asexual altogether, they develop an affection towards people of the same sex. And that's why I think you have a, this is a speculation now. It'd be interesting to research this thing. I know of at least one case personally where this is what happened. But that's why I think we have perhaps a proponents of homosexuality today. But in any case, the underlying assumption is that suffering is a bad thing, that it shouldn't be a part of our lives. This is why people get so into addictions. They can't get free of addictions because the idea of having to go through some suffering is just, there's messages in our brains galore that says that that's not a good thing to do. That's a bad thing to do. You should avoid it at all costs. We hate to suffer. We're pampered in our culture not to suffer. The truth, however, is the opposite. If the world had never fallen, it'd be true that there would be no suffering. But the world is a fallen place, and given that it's a fallen place, suffering can be very beneficial. In fact, I think it's the truth that no genuine growth occurs without some suffering. In a fallen world where we are constituted in a fallen condition the way we are, self-denial never comes easy. But almost all growth in one way or another is connected with self-denial. Look at how you raise kids. They've got to go through some suffering before they learn the truth that they are not the center of the universe. The universe doesn't revolve around them, and therefore they can't get everything they want. That's learning self-denial, and usually it's a painful thing to learn. The Bible says that even Jesus, Hebrews 5, verse 8, says that jesus learned obedience by the things which he suffered now if the savior learned obedience by the things which he suffered do we think we're gonna learn it without suffering suffering is not a bad thing it is a good thing now there are certain kinds of suffering of course which are bad which are destructive if it's not producing any kind of fruit if it's not producing any characteristics it can be a real negative thing there's a destructive kind of suffering and that's not the kind i'm talking about in here talking about the suffering of self-denial or the suffering of just not getting what you want, the suffering of abstaining from things that you'd rather have. That's what produces growth. It's usually a good thing. It produces fruit, produces patience, produces character. It did in the Savior and it did in us. This is why the Bible says an awful lot, in the New Testament especially, about count it all joy when you come into suffering because that's what produces patience. Closely connected with this, and I've already spoken on this, is the idea that we have a right not to suffer. I have a right not to suffer. When we come into suffering, we usually say, why me? I mean, why should it be me? It just seems like I should be exempt from this law. Don't you say that to yourself sometimes? I say it to myself a lot. Why me? It's not fair. But if you step back and take a broader perspective on things, where do we get the notion that we have a right not to suffer? In a world where 17,000 kids starve to death every day, how could I ever get the idea that I have a right not to suffer? You know, when you think about it. That conviction that we have in our first world culture is a totally unrealistic, let alone to say nothing of being a non-Christian assumption. Ultimately, we don't in a fallen condition have rights, except what we have by God's grace. And to think that we have a right to be exempt from suffering, to get everything our way or to not have to go through anything, is just unrealistic. The world's a suffering place. And suffering, for people especially who are intentional about their growth, will be an ordinary part of their life. Suffering is not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. I don't want to be too pessimistic here, but isn't that the case? a third thing that needs to be confronted we've already touched on this a little bit last week is that and this occurs to people who have got a pretty good understanding of a graces but the the mistaken assumption is that doing what i don't feel like doing is legalism doing what i don't feel like doing is legalism and therefore the only things i should do are the things that I feel like doing. And so when I feel like contributing financially to the church, I'll contribute to the church. But right now I don't feel like it. I don't have the extra money. When I feel like getting up at five in the morning and praying for an hour, I'll do it. But right now I must not be ready for it because I don't feel like it. And when I feel like witnessing, I'll do it. But right now I don't feel like it. I feel awkward doing it. And so we postpone and postpone and postpone and postpone, waiting for some kind of magical moment to come around when we're finally going to feel like it as though we couldn't, you know, we're getting this urge where we can't help ourselves, but get out of bed at five in the morning and say, gee, I really feel like seeking the Lord's face right now and do it. But that never happens. Oh, once in a while I've heard of it happening, but it's never happened to me. It doesn't usually happen that way. Discipline is required precisely when you don't feel like doing things. That's why it's called discipline. If it's things that you do feel like doing, It doesn't take any discipline to do that. You do things because it's right to do them. You do things because it's true to do them. You do things because you're motivated with a broader ideal, a broader goal that you want to achieve. In a sense, you want to do these things. Your inner self, that little red blob that was on the inside of the person, that self says, I want to manifest righteousness. I want to be close to God. I want to experience His presence. I want this day to be dedicated to him. That inner self, that regenerate self says that you want that. And when you give in to that, you embark on discipline as a way of bringing that manifestation about. But at the time, you're not going to feel like doing it. So you say to yourself, I really want to develop a better relationship with the Lord, and so I'm going to pray a half hour every morning. Well, come that morning, you're not going to feel like doing that. But in another sense, you want to do that. See, there's a difference between what you want and what you feel like doing. What is your fundamental motivation? Discipline is healthy. Doing what you don't feel like doing is healthy if that's what you want to do. If you want the higher goal, the higher agenda, then you embark on the things you don't feel like doing to get it. The illustration I used this summer was with running. I had a goal that I wanted to run. There was a world championship thing coming up, and it was a 62-mile race, 100 kilometer race, and I wanted to do that, and I wanted to do good at that. I wanted to see how fast I could run for how far. I really wanted to go for bust on this thing. So that was in October. Starting January, I got this schedule out. Every Saturday morning, I was going to get up at 5 o'clock and run for 5 or 6 hours. I hated that. Once I got out there, I started to like it, but it was always hard work. I didn't feel like doing that. You feel like sleeping at five in the morning. But because of the larger agenda, the long range goal that I was seeking at, I embarked on it. I didn't feel like doing it, but I wanted to do it. Discipline, it's not legalism if it comes from the inside, if it's what you want to do, even when you don't feel like doing it. Now, if you don't feel like doing it and you don't want to do it, but you do it because someone told you to do it, that's legalism. And that will not bring forth good fruit. It will be more destructive. It's degrading to your personhood. It'd be better for you to abstain from the discipline altogether and first learn that you're okay with Jesus for free. The motivation can't be because I told you to do it or because it's somehow a spiritual kudo that you get with the people that you're around or you're trying to win points with God. That can't be the motivation. But if the motivation comes out of an understanding of who you are in Christ and a desire to express that, if it comes out of a motivation to make your life a project to see how close it is for you and how close is it possible for a human being to get to God, if that's your motivation, that's good. And you may grind your teeth. You may suffer. It may involve suffering. That's a good thing. It produces character. Discipline is most beneficial when it hurts. And you know what? This could sound like a cliche, so I'm just going to say it and I'm going to pass on. But it really is the case that there's a physical rule that we understand when we get into exercise, and that's no pain, no gain. And that's really a true thing. In some ways, it's true spiritually as well, that when it hurts the most, the blessings are the greatest. At least the long-range blessings are the greatest. I know this sounds like asceticism, but it's not. And that ties into the fourth thing that we're dealing with. The idea that discipline is drudgery. So far everything I've said probably sounds like drudgery. Boy, this is a Halloween class. This is a lot of fun, boy. Let's all suffer. The thing is, though, that when you deny yourself and do what you don't feel like doing, you enter into eventually, now it's not always immediate, it, but you enter into a rewarding experience that you couldn't have had any other way. And that you don't, sometimes you can't even conceptualize until you break through and start to do it. You know, you make a schedule where you're going to get up at six in the morning or seven in the morning or whatever to pray for a half hour. And at first, that's nothing but sheer discipline. It's just, eh. But in time, you'll find that your greatest moments of blessing come during that half hour. And you begin to see the rewards it reaps in your life. And you begin to see that it's worth it. Eventually, it might be the case that it's not so much work to start doing it at 7 o'clock in the morning. That the fulfillment you get from achieving what you want, in spite of the fact that you don't feel like doing it, eventually makes your not feeling like you want to do it into a feeling like you want to do it. Did you get all that? Eventually, it begins to feel good to do it because you're being overwhelmed by the fact that you're accomplishing one of your goals. The person who makes this point really good is Henry Nowen in his book, Genesee Diary. He entered a monastery for nine months just to see what it was like. And he talks there about, they were very regimented about their prayer times. They had five different times where they prayed and did mass and all this kind of stuff. And he says that in some of these prayer times, He'd just be bored stiff. He'd sit there and his reasoning was sort of like this. He says, well, as long as I can't do anything for two hours, I might as well pray. I'm stuck here. But in time, that came to be an incredibly fulfilling experience for him. There is a joy here, a joy that comes through discipline, the joy of being freed from some of the junk that holds us down year after year after year after year. There's a joy in this that you couldn't get any other way. Being disciplined is freedom. Being disciplined is freedom. That's why Richard Foster titled his book Celebrating Discipline. It really is a celebration. It's one that if you're addicted to rest, if you're addicted to not being disciplined, if you're addicted to just gratifying at your whims, you can't even maybe at this point conceptualize what I'm talking about. Because you associate that the greatest joy you have is with gratification. But there's a joy that comes from not gratifying yourself in order to attain a higher goal that's far more profound than immediate gratification. The final thing I want to say is this. When is discipline unhealthy? When is discipline unhealthy? And it may even be that there are people in this class who shouldn't be in this class. I don't know. I'm just throwing that out there. I don't want anything-- oh, he's talking about me here. Maybe there are people in this class. You know, because this is Christianity 102. It's not 101. And so let me say this. When is discipline unhealthy? First of all, when there's no foundation in Christ. When there's no foundation in Christ. I'm going to go through these passages here. One of the things that you'll notice in Paul's writing, especially though you find it in other places in Scripture, is that there's a lot of injunctions, a lot of do's, a lot of don'ts. You ought to live this way. Walk worthy of the Lord. Don't yield your members to unrighteousness, but yield them to righteousness. There are commands that pertain to our behavior, and they must be taken very seriously. What you find very frequently in the New Testament is that those commands are immediately preceded by a statement about who we are in Christ Jesus, about who we are in Christ. For example, in Romans 6, 1 through 12, it's probably the clearest example of this, Paul starts off by saying things like this. You are dead with Christ. You have been buried with Christ. You have risen with Christ. He points to the believer's baptism as the reminder of that. He goes on for 10 verses about what you are in Christ Jesus. And then he says in verse 12, Therefore, don't yield your members, don't yield your bodily parts as instruments of sin, but as instruments of righteousness. What he's saying there is basically this. Because of who you already are in Christ, because of what is true about you, live like that. Think like that. In fact, in verse 11, it's a profound verse, which is a transitional point between the indicative and the imperative, between who you are in Christ and therefore how you ought to walk. He says, therefore, consider yourself. Think about yourself. Meditate about yourself to be dead to sin, but alive to Christ, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Get your mind to line up with who you are in Christ. And then, verse 12, get your life, your activity, your behavior to line up with who you are in Christ. And then the rest of the chapter is talking about abstaining from sin. Abstain from sin. Don't be involved in it. But the foundation for the whole thing is because of what is already true about you. He doesn't say abstain from sin in order to be dead with Christ. He says you are dead with Christ, therefore live like that. In Romans 12, 1, Paul says, in view of God's mercy, in the light of God's mercy, and I could unpack that phrase, God's mercy, for a while, but I won't. He says in the light of that, let your life, render your bodies, what does he say, a holy sacrifice pleasing in the Lord, which is your reasonable service. It's that verse. Let your life be a living sacrifice, or something to that point. Because of what God has done for you, because you've experienced that, because of who you are, therefore live in such a way that your life is a pleasing sacrifice to the Lord. In Colossians 3, 1 through 5, and also in verse 12, Paul says he puts out a lot of commands here. Don't be involved in lust, don't be involved in envy, don't be involved in jealousy. He tells us why not to be involved in. He tells us what to abstain from. But the whole thing is based on what he says before that, where he says your life is hid in Christ, and that you are united with Christ. He tells us who we are before he tells us what we should do, because what we should do is based on who we are. And finally, in 1 Corinthians 6, 19-20, Paul says, that you have been bought with a price. You don't own yourself. You belong to God. You've been bought with a price. You've been redeemed. Therefore, don't unite yourself with a prostitute, among other things. Because your body's not your own, it belongs to the Lord. The point here is this. The foundation for discipline is an understanding of who you are in Christ. Now, that doesn't mean that you have a perfect understanding of who you are in Christ, that you've perfectly experienced God's grace, and you're totally in love with yourself. And it doesn't mean that at all, because I don't think any of us are at that point. In some ways, discipline helps us realize more and more who we are in Christ. But I'm talking about a foundational understanding, an awareness that who you are is there for free. and some experience of that, some freedom. What's a necessary part for the foundation of discipline is some degree of freedom from shame. Not total freedom, because that's something you might work through the rest of your life, but at least a foundational freedom from shame. If you're still prone to performing, if you're still addicted to that as a way of getting God to like you, then it'd be best for you to spend some time resting in who you are in Christ before you embark on some spiritual disciplines. You might want to come to one more class, though, because we'll talk about resting in Christ next week. Okay. Oh, finally, and this ties in with the same thing. Discipline is unhealthy when it's done for the wrong motives. When it's done for the wrong motives, namely to win points. And this usually happens when there isn't a solid foundation of the believer and who they are in Christ. When it's done for the wrong motives, it can be real damaging for a lot of reasons. This is where you get asceticism. Asceticism is the way of behaving such that you just afflict yourself for the sake of afflicting yourself. Simon Stalactite thought it was a good thing to build a post, as far as we can tell, about 20 feet high. and make a little chair, and he sat on that for 37 years. He was a holy man. But why? Why would you do that? It's like religious masochism. What happens is if you think that somehow, if you think you get points for fasting, and God likes you a little bit more if you fast, if that's a source of life for you, here's what happens. The same thing that happens to the person on Wall Street who's trying to get richer and richer and richer will happen to you in asceticism. See, you get a little bit, but you're not quite fulfilled. But you think if you just get a little bit more, you'll be fulfilled. So you crave it. And you get that, you make your second million dollars, but you're still not fulfilled. But you still think, you're still trapped in the lie that you think a little bit more will get you a little bit more fulfilled. So you've got these people who are billionaires but are still working 15 hours a week. Why? Well, because they think that somehow life is in money. They never think that cautiously, but that's a fundamental thing in their life. Well, if life to you isn't money, but it's religiosity, you'll never get enough of it. So you might fast for a day, but you'll still be a little bit unfulfilled because life for you is something other than God, and it can never be fulfilling. So the next time you try to fast for two days, and then maybe five days, and before you know it, you might be sitting on a totem pole for 37 years. Because you'll never be enough, and you'll never be fulfilled, and you'll end up doing yourself harm. What also begins to happen is that the real issues in your life that need healing are never addressed because you're very busy cranking out this religious discipline stuff as a facade, as a way of trying to get life. It has to be done for the right motives. The right motives is the project that we want to see how close we can get to the Savior that we love, the Savior that saved us, the Savior that bought us. Okay, any questions about that? Questions or comments about that? That's the foundational stuff. Yes, that's a real good point. Where Bonnie's at is she comes from a legalistic background. She's not sure if this will get her back into that mode of thinking or not. Part of it will depend on how bad you burned out on legalism. If you really burned out on it big time, like I did, there's absolutely no temptation to get back into that because I couldn't succeed the first time. And I'm more acutely aware that I wouldn't succeed the second. But if it was just sort of a gradual growing of your understanding, maybe that's still there. I would say that the thing to do would be to, maybe you know in your head that you're saved by grace, that you're okay perfectly before God for free, whatever. And in varying degrees, that's a reality in your heart. I would test the waters. Go forth and try some of these things and see what your motivation actually is. And when you see that maybe you're, you know, wondering if people notice it or not, then maybe at that point you need to back off. Yeah, I'd say go forward with it. The thing about us is that I don't think our motivations are ever totally pure. We're double-minded. And I don't know if I ever do anything with an absolutely pure motivation. I sometimes think I do, and I look back on it later on, and I see that I was getting some gratification out of this from other sources or whatever. And it's important that you don't beat yourself up when you do that, because that's just part of the reality here, and that's how you learn. So, yeah, one mistake might be for people to be then waiting for this pure, pristine motivation. And that looks a whole lot like, when I feel like doing it, I'll do it. We don't want to get into that. Amen.
