What I want to do this morning is get at the heart of the causes of what we've been hearing about in the lectures and the workshops and in the drama sketches. The problem that creates all the strangeness that comes under the heading of spiritual abuse arises out of a misunderstanding, a misconception of who God is. The perpetrators of spiritual abuse do not have the appropriate relationship with God, otherwise they wouldn't do what they do. And so-called victims of spiritual abuse would not allow themselves to be victimized if they understood the basis of their relationship to God. Both groups misunderstand the relationship because they believe that the essence of it is contingent on their performance. And the very heart of the Gospel is that it is Christ's performance that matters. His life, His death, His resurrection. What He did is what gives us our relationship with God, and nothing that we do can enhance that, and nothing that we can do or don't do can destroy that. And once we understand just the basic part of the gospel, then all the other goofy things that happen in church and in leadership, including the phenomena we refer to as spiritual abuses, would be impossible to sustain. The gospel cures everything. And it is a misunderstanding, a lack of appreciation to some degree, that keeps us from this mythical abundant life, joy unspeakable, full of glory, and a church that really acts like an integrated body and a community caring for its members as it would for itself. Spiritual abuse is not, therefore, just a problem, but spiritual abuse reveals a problem. And I'm going to get it as part of the problem and the thing that I like talking about most this morning. I'm going to do it, you can do it almost in many places in the New Testament, but I'm going to do it from the parable of the prodigal sons, plural, in Luke chapter 15, 11 to 32. I'll read the parable to you in just a minute, but let me, while I'm trying to warm up here, take a few things about why Jesus' stories are where we begin our theologizing. The Gospels were the last of the New Testament writings to be penned. When the New Testament writers wanted to leave the final statement, the final, most refined, most precise statement of the good news in Jesus Christ was not the letters of Paul, as important as they are, not any of the other epistles. It was the four Gospels. They were the last. They were the latest. They were the final. This is what the church, this is the last thing that the church wanted to say to make sure we got it right. And they remembered some of Jesus' key teaching and key stories, most pivotal stories to make the point. The most powerful story, and the story that has become the most well-known story on the entire planet is the parable of what is referred to commonly as the prodigal son. I have put the plural to that because both sons were prodigal, as I'll point out here in just a minute. but this parable is usually regarded, I mean, one of the reasons that it's so popular is because its point is missed. Most of the church would hate this parable, and many of you are going to see why in about 15, 20 minutes. The church would hate this story if they really paid attention to what it says. Instead, what has happened is that this parable has become this story about this warm-hearted father and the fatherly love he has for his rebel son. And our culture, at least, has sort of romanticized the hero without a clue or the rebel without a clue motif. And in our books, you know, Catcher in the Rye and James Dean and all of our icons that have sort of given us our prototypes and our culture, the misunderstood, rebellious young man, the angry young man, who is bright and interesting and daring and courageous, is romanticized. And that gets put on to this so-called prodigal son. And what really is going on in the parable is 180 degrees away from that. And we'll get to that in just a minute. But this is not a pretty story. This is not an interesting story, an endearing story. What we're going to hear here this morning is the very heart of the gospel, and it is the most profound theology you will find in the Bible. Paul learned all of his reflections on the nature of grace from Jesus and from these stories, and from his own experience with Jesus. So, let me read this parable to you, and then we'll begin making some points. But before that, let me set it up and say that Jesus' parables were always prompted by something. And that's the case with the parable of the lost son. In the first couple of verses of chapter 15, it sets up the rest of the chapter. It is the excuse or the prompting for Jesus to give the stories that he does. So let me read this. Now the tax collectors and the sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, This man welcomes sinners and eats with them. Two kinds of people in this story. Tax collectors, sinners, and the Pharisees and the scribes. That is to say, the bad people and the good people were gathered around him. And the scribes and the Pharisees, the spiritual authorities of Jesus' state, were upset with Jesus because he was friendly with wastoids and perverts. And so, in response to that, he tells this story, the parable of the lost sheep. I'm not going to read it to you, but you are very familiar with it. The parable of the lost coin. Again, the point is very clear. And then, finally, the parable of the lost son. These are all responses to the situation that had two people gathered around Jesus, the good people and the bad people, the good people taking exception to his liberal friendship with the bad people. Okay, now, here's the essential clue that we need to get right off the bat. In verses 1 and 2, the thing that set up the teaching on the parables, there are two types of people. How many brothers are there in the story of the parable of Pradeal's son? There are two. There's your essential clue. There were the good people and the bad people. The good people were the religious people, the good citizens. folks, you know, let's face it, these are good people. These are good citizens. They pay their taxes. They keep the law. They do what's right. They're good people. They obey the rules. And then there's the bad people, the outcasts. These people also believe that it's important to keep the laws and to be good, but they've given up trying. They have simply given in to their sinful inclinations, and they are living it out in a public way. under the scornful eye of the good people. Now this corresponds to the parable of the prodigal son. There's the good son and the bad son. The good brother kept the rules, worked hard, and as we will read in the parable, expected the father to reward him because of his performance. The bad brother had, for whatever reason, given up trying to keep the rules in order to earn his father's favor, but he believed, beyond any question of a doubt, that that is how you earned your father's favor. And that also shows up in the parable. Eventually, he got so discouraged that he gave up trying to be good and decided to simply live independently of his father. being in the presence of his father, being in the presence of someone who expected, he thought expected performance that he couldn't give was torturous to him, so he cut the best deal that he possibly could and demanded his half of the family's wealth, which of course the father was not in the slightest bit obliged to give him. There was absolutely no reason for him to do it, but he did it. So the two types of people are covered by the two types of brothers. here's the last clue before I read it the last clue is this even though Jesus is telling a story to two types of people Pharisees and bad people he is telling the story about two types of people the good brother and the bad brother and these two groups operate entirely differently in terms of the way they express their life their philosophies of life are entirely different. But at the very core, at the very core of their understanding of reality is a false conception, a false core belief. Now see if you can pick up that false core belief. Different people look differently, act differently, and you would think these are at opposite ends of the pole. Spiritually, they are exactly in the same box. They're exactly in the same category because of one fatal flaw in their understanding, a faulty concept of how they get a relationship with God. Okay, with that in mind, let me just read through the parable fairly quickly. You're all familiar with it. Be sensitive to and be alert to the clues that I've given you so far. Jesus continued, there was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, Father, give me my share of the estate. So the father divided his property between them. Not long after that, the younger son got together all that he had and set out for a distant country, and he squandered his wealth and wild living. After he had spent everything there, there was a severe famine, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him into the fields to feed his pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. This is just a Hebrew way of saying it. This is as bad as it gets. When he came to his senses, he said, How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death. I will set out and go back to my father and say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. He's going to repent. And I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me one of your hired men. In other words, I've broken the covenant, so just give me a contract. So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, a long way off, the father saw him. The father saw him because the father was looking for him. And the father was filled with compassion. And he ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. The son said to him, Father, I have sinned against even after this amazing reception. The son, thinking that he knows what pleases the father, religious performance, oh, there I gave it away, wants to get in his repentance. Even though he's fully received, fully accepted, he's got to do his religious thing. He's not going to accept reality. He's not going to accept complete lavish affection from his father. He's going to push his father away and do something religious. Attention, folks. But the father said, Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you, and I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. Death is too good for me. I'm a worthless worm. I'm a sinner. And the father interrupts him right in the middle of his repentance. But the father said to his servants, Quick, shut this kid up. Bring the best robe and put it on him. put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet, bring the fatted calf and kill it, let us, have a feast and celebrate for this son of mine who was dead is alive again. He was lost and found. And so they began to celebrate. While the older son was in the field, where else would the older son be? He's in the fields working. He's a good citizen. He's a good boy. When he came near to the house, he heard the music and the dancing. So he didn't even go in to investigate personally. he sent one of his servants to ask what was going on. The servant replied, Your brother has come home, and your father has killed the fatted calf because he has him back safe and sound. The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went and pleaded with him. Father loves both sons, apparently. But he answered his father, Look, all these years I have been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat that I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you killed a fatted calf for him. My son, the father said, you are always with me, and everything I have has always been yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad. Because this brother of yours was dead and is alive, He was lost and is found. Two types of sons, two types of people, which to a very frightening degree correspond with the two types of people we have been talking about in this conference. Good people in spiritual authority with spiritual power, manipulating people who think of themselves as bad people, the so-called victims of spiritual abuse. and if we understand and we have to I'll make it very clear there won't be any question in your head and I even believe this in my head I believe this with all my head but what I'm going to pray and what we're going to have to ask for and look for is for the Holy Spirit to make it real at the visceral level so that in addition to believing it with all our head we believe it with all our heart and once we do we're no longer going to be a threat as leaders running the risk of abusing people. And we are not going to put up with it from anybody ever, not even for a minute, if we get what I'm saying. Two sons representing two types of people, and two types of people in Jesus' day and two types of people here this morning, as well as the two types of people that we've been talking about. Two sons' lives look very, very different, but each hold the same false core belief on how they are to relate to God. They both believe that their performance was essential for a relationship with the Father, a relationship with God. The elder brother, the good brother, the religious brother represents the scribes and the Pharisees and some of the religious leaders that you have run into. He and they believe that they keep the law, keep the rules, and therefore deserve the favor of God. They have earned it. Now, what could be more obvious and self-evident than that? It lines up with everything in the world. Be good, receive good, do bad, receive bad. Everybody knows that. Look around. So, of course, of course, and since religion basically teaches this, and this is the core of religion, why wouldn't we think that that's the way we relate to God? It couldn't be more wrong, but it's understandable as to why this misconception is perpetuated and has gotten into the very cells of our being. It's not just in our head and in our heart that we... It's in our bodies. This belief is so fundamental to the way the world operates. that we need the power of the Holy Spirit to convince us of the truth. Like the elder brother, they believe if they do the right thing, then reward and the favor of God is their just expectation. Verses 28 and 29. The older brother became angry and refused to go in, so his father went out to him and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, Look, all these years I have been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. And he's just saying the truth. He'd always been a model son. He'd always been a good boy. He'd always kept the rules. He'd always had his quiet time. He'd always witnessed. He'd always tithed. He'd always attended meetings. He'd always prayed. He had done everything right. He never did any big sins. He had always done everything right. And I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me anything to celebrate with. I was doing a conference for a group of Lutheran men in Los Angeles a couple of weekends ago. It was several churches who got together, several hundred men from the men's group in these various churches. And I forget what I was rattling on about. But everybody got real quiet at one point. And it was kind of casual. So I encouraged people to interrupt me and ask questions. And this old guy who had been introduced earlier as the man who had been here. This old guy, this conference had been going for 31 years. And he had been there 31 out of 31 years. and he was a really nice old guy and I'm talking about something, I can't remember what it was, and he stands up and the veins in his neck are just bulging. And you can tell, this is a brand new experience for me. He's living. And he says, Dr. Blue, I have obeyed the church's laws all my life. I have kept the rules and I have never gotten anything for it. I said, welcome home, big brother. One consolation. He understood what I was saying. He understood what I was saying. See, when the gospel is preached, people are offended. The Pharisees, the good people up here at the top, are offended when Jesus is living out the gospel by being just as free and open and liberal and casual and friendly and even eating with them, is to declare solidarity with them in this culture, eating with them, and the Pharisees are indignant. If you practice the gospel, or if you preach the gospel, it will offend people. And I can assure you that there will be people here this morning who are offended. It can't be that good. The good news cannot possibly be that good. This is the thing. I've done good. I deserve something. Performance, good performance equals blessing. Aren't those the rules? And folks, isn't that how you get a church to work? By promising your good performance will get the church to esteem you, and what's more importantly, your good performance will get God to like you. I mean, isn't that how a church operates? by and large, that's how church operates the younger brother, the bad brother the one who represented the wastoids and irresponsible, irreligious people the tax collectors and the sinners they also believed as the good people do the younger brother believed the same exact thing about the father I mean, this is what we missed the good brother and the bad brother believed the same exact things about the father. The bad people believe, as the good people do, that the essence of a relationship with the father depends on good behavior. Look at verses 17 to 19. When he came to his senses, this is the younger brother, the bad brother, when he came to his senses, he said to himself, how many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death. He's just trying to figure out some way to work a better deal for himself. I will set out and go back to my father and say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired men. Why was he no longer worthy to be called a son? What has he done? Bad performance. His bad performance excluded him from the covenant with the father, excluded him from the blessings of sonship. Performance has the power to disenfranchise you. That's what the big brother, the good brother, believes too. Performance has the power to disenfranchise you or to gain favor. They both believe exactly the same wrong thing about how we maintain a relationship with God. He believed that, but he had failed. So he accepted the judgment of that false core belief. Now the father, notice, the father takes it upon himself to correct the screwy thinking in both boys. He takes it upon himself to straighten out and to heal the false core belief in each. And hopefully the father will be able to do that for us this morning. If so, no matter what you paid for this conference, it's worth ten times as much. The bad son was as, first of all, we have to understand that the bad son was as bad as he could be. This is where bad behavior is measured from. And again, you just have to get James Dean and all the rebellious Rebels Without a Clue heroes in our culture out of your mind. out of your mind, this was a sniveling, little, pathetic, miserable little bastard. That's who he was. First of all, see, he has no right to ask for anything. Everything belongs to the big brother in the first place, culturally. The little brother doesn't get anything. He somehow presumes upon the father for half of the family's wealth. so he wants half of the family's wealth but not to benefit the family but to indulge himself that's his motivation so he goes to the father and in essence says you know if you were dead I could do this but I'm getting tired of waiting for you to die so I want the benefits of your death does that have any kind of a gospel ring to anybody I want the benefits of your death I want to inherit what's mine now. I'm impatient. Bad people are very often impatient. Good people often can defer pleasure in a disciplined, good way by working for something in order to have the benefit later. Bad people are usually very impulsive and irresponsible. That's why their lives look so messed up. I want it now. So he takes it now, and then he adds insult to injury by taking half the wealth and then moving away, depriving the family of half of its income, embarrassing and humiliating the father by rejecting the family. And in ancient areas, this would have absolutely been unthinkable. Today it's kind of mildly shocking. Back then it would have been absolutely scandalous. A younger son gets half of the family's wealth, gets his inheritance, which is questionable to begin with, and then moves away. Okay, that's really bad. The son is saying, Dad, I don't want anything to do with you. I don't want anything to do with the life that you've made. Basically, I maintain he's just tired of not being able to perform in a way that pleased his father, he thought. And he wanted to just go away and indulge, which he did. Okay, so that sets it up. But it gets worse. He does all the terrible things, apparently. If you read the lines and in between the lines. He does all the terrible things that the church is really upset about. You know, all the drinking and the grousing. And the big brother must have known something. He mentions prostitutes. And so he's just as bad as he can be. Now the question is, what is it about the Father? and this is absolutely critical. What is it about the father that let him get away with that? Why would the father have allowed this irresponsible little twit, this sniveling little brat, to run away? I mean, he must know. He must know where this money is going to go and what it's going to do. Why? In this culture, the father was absolutely not the slightest bit obliged to give him a dime. In fact, the mere suggestion of what the son proposed could have very easily gotten the kid beaten within an inch of his life. So what's in the father's mind? The heart of the parable starts to come into focus. The father gives the boy half of his wealth for one reason, because he doesn't care about the wealth. I'll tell you something else. He doesn't care about his reputation. I'll tell you something else. He doesn't care about his honor. He cares about one thing, the boy. And he wants, got to get it, he wants the boy's heart. And if the boy's heart is in a far country, then the father wants to give him the freedom to be there. He can coerce the boy. he can manipulate the boy, he can abuse the boy into some semblance of good citizenship and good sonship. But the father is interested in one thing, a voluntary response of love and affection. That's what the father's in it for, and he's willing to sell everything, to give everything, to risk everything for the chance of getting back. The father doesn't care about the money, doesn't care about his reputation, doesn't care about the humiliation, he cares about one thing, a love relationship with the boy. And the only way he can have that is if the boy freely gives it. And at this point, the boy isn't freely giving it. And so the father does whatever kindness and generosity is in his power to do. So he freely gives the son the money. and so the boy clears out. But because the father cares about the boy, he doesn't send servants into the far country to haul him back because he's got to come back voluntarily. He can't be coerced to come back. But the father awaits him. The reason that he sees him as far off is because he's looking for him. His eyes have gotten really strong over the months, years or however long it was because his eyes have been focusing on the horizon waiting for the boy to come back hoping that he will return because the father still wants only one thing that's the love relationship with the boy that's what he wants so being good doesn't get you in with God and being bad doesn't break fellowship with God This is why Paul says, our keeping or not keeping of the law has nothing to do with God's acceptance of us. Paul learned this insight from Jesus and his story. But please notice, folks, and this is the other part that the parable very clearly teaches. But while keeping the law, or being good, or being bad, is irrelevant to the question of whether God loves us or not, and really doesn't have anything significantly to do with his end of the relationship with us. While keeping the law doesn't make us right with God or wrong with God, keeping the law, being good, doing the right thing, has everything to do with the quality of your life. God loves you and wants intimacy with you no matter what you do or don't do. But folks, there is sowing and reaping on this plane. What goes around does come around. Being good doesn't make you right with God, but being good determines whether you have a life that you are happy with or not. Sin doesn't separate us from God, but sin will separate us from our money. Sin will separate us from our health. Sin will separate us from our peace. Look at the consequences of the boy who was loved passionately by the Father, nonstop, never interrupted. But look at what happened regarding the sowing and reaping on this earthly plain. Verses 14 to 16. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in the whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went out and hired himself to a citizen in the country who sent him out to feed his pigs. And he longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. As I said, this is to say, this is as bad as it gets. A good Jewish boy feeding pigs and competing for their food, it's just a metaphor for it doesn't get any worse than this. Bad behavior will wreck your life. It doesn't affect your relationship with God, but it does wreck your life. So, being good does have its rewards in this life. being bad does have its consequences, negative consequences in this life. And I think that that's what kind of confuses us. Go off into the far country, spend your money, and commit all kinds of immorality, and come home broke with AIDS, and it will lower the goodness that you would otherwise like to have experienced in life. but it doesn't separate you. What I've just said is irrelevant to the question of whether God loves you or not, or whether he's committed to you, or whether he is capable at his end of having an intimate, close, open relationship with you. So there's nothing that you can do or not do, which makes the spiritual abuse impossible, basically. If you get the gospel, it makes spiritual abuse impossible. As a leader, I mean, I've understood this a long time ago. As a leader, you just have to preach the gospel, pray for people, and then sweat it out. Because if they don't want to serve, they won't. If they don't want to give, they won't. And as the shepherd appointed by God, you have to go on loving them and blessing them and giving no hint. You can say, look, here's the quality of life that you're missing out on because of this irresponsible behavior. However, you're a brother, you're a sister, and more importantly, more importantly, you're a son or a daughter of God, and that can never be effective, because nothing you did and got it for you in the first place. Your relationship with God doesn't depend on you. It depends on God's love for you. And God's love for you is now legally free and clear your possession because of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. When were you saved? 2,000 years ago, in the historical event of Jesus Christ. You weren't saved 10 years ago, 20 years ago, last week. You were saved 2,000 years ago. It was an objective fact before you ever showed up. It was a reality before you ever came here. And no matter how bad you mess up a day, you don't have the power to undo what happened 2,000 years ago on your behalf. It's an objective fact. You get that, and you understand that the affection and love of God, people say, well, doesn't your behavior please or displease God? Absolutely. Let me tell you why. God loves you. He doesn't want you to be broke. He doesn't want you to be competing with the pigs for food. That's the nature of love. He wants the biggest, best possible life for you that you can get. Bad behavior displeases Him because it violates your person. But He is not displeased with you because He's not displeased with Jesus. When God the Father gets hacked off of Jesus, then you're in trouble. When Jesus loses favor with God the Father, then you can start sweating. But until that time, you are secure and bomb-proof because your performance can't affect you. Good or bad. See, both sons were out to lunch on this issue. Both groups of people, almost everybody here, completely wrong about the significance of your own performance. Now watch what happens when the boy comes home. and here we go, the boy's false core belief, verse 17 to 19. When he came to his senses, he said to himself, back home where my father is, they've got all this food, I'm going to perform religiously in order to get at least a few crumbs in the action. You know, my performance has ruled me out of a relationship with the father, an intimate good relationship with the father. That's gone. But at least I can negotiate by some religious means e.g. repentance. I can negotiate by some religious means to get at least something from God. Bad behavior equals I'm no longer a son. Okay, what's the truth? Verse 20 and following. But while he was still a long way off, the father saw him and was filled with compassion. The word for compassion is the strongest imaginable. We don't have a word for that in the English language. But it refers to the viscera. It refers to the womb. The Hebrew background to this word is womb. It's this involuntary, gut-wrenching compassion you feel when you hear about the death of a loved one. The uncontrollable, visceral response to a terrible accident on the freeway. The actual Greek word is sphagmizimor. We needed to know that. But it's sphagma, the viscera. It's an earthy, gutsy response. The father is filled with compassion when he sees his wretched son coming home. He's not mad. He's not upset. He's not interested in putting the boy on probation, making him jump through hoops. Because, folks, the father cares about one thing, and that's the boy. And a love relationship with the boy. And even though he might not get it, he's going to give himself totally into it. This is the way God is. We think, well, God is going to, wouldn't you? I mean, this is bad business, isn't it? He goes and throws his arms around his son. He runs and meets him and throws his arms around his son, totally reinstates him. And you can hear the servants doing what is the most logical. I mean, it's good advice, I have to admit. Dad, I think we better put this kid on probation. We don't know that he's home for sure, for good. He may break your heart again. He may run off with what's left of the money. I think that what we need to do is not jump to reconciliation. And the Father's not hearing any of that. The Father's not hearing good advice. He's not hearing good counsel. Because he cares about one thing. He cares about the boy. He has compassion for the boy. He doesn't have compassion or he doesn't have a theory about discipleship. None of that matters. It's a person-on-person event. He has a chance for intimacy with his boy, and he launches. He forgets about it. He forgets about all the suffering and the anguish and the humiliation. None of that's held against him. It doesn't even enter in because he's focused on one thing. That isn't taken into consideration because he's focused on one thing. The boy, he's getting his boy back. There's a chance that he'll love me, that we can have intimacy. That's what he's in it for. Folks, that's why you and I were created. That is our destiny in life. All the other stuff is peripheral. The reason we came to this earth is to love God back and enjoy Him forever. I mean, that is the purpose. And God created us out of love for love. That was His only motive. All this other devil and fall and all this stuff is peripheral. It's nickel-dimes. It's details. Life, death, suffering, those are all details. The heart of it is God the Father, who is infinitely interesting and full of compassion and love, has created us to love Him back. And that's it. And that's it. And that is why your behavior, being a good person or being a bad person, is of so little importance. I mean, in religion, it's all important. So far as God is concerned, it's irrelevant. Except, of course, for the quality of your life. which is something you ought to take seriously for yourself. It doesn't affect the father. He can love broken, beat-up prostitutes just as easily, in fact, quite a bit more easily, than good religious citizens. Because what matters to him is intimacy and openness, having nothing, having no structures, having no resistance between the father and the heart of the one who is loved. So here, the Father interrupts him as he's in the middle of repentance. And you've heard, you've got to repent in order to get right with God. No, you don't. All you have to do is show up. Well, of course. I mean, the Bible talks about repentance. It's important. Oh, yeah, it's important. Yeah, agree with God about how bad you are. Sure, do that. That's really good. That's really important. That's really important. It's a part of your affection and your relationship with God. It's one of those intimate things that you share with God. But don't think that repentance gets you back with God. God's love gets you back with God the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ gets you back with God all you have to do is show up the boy is in the middle of this repentance pretty eloquent repentance too I mean it would have impressed him the father is not interested he doesn't care about the religious performance of the boy he just wants to get on with reconciliation bring the robe the robe was the robe in these far eastern times near eastern times The robe of the clan was made of a characteristic weave so that everybody could see at a distance what clan, what family a person belonged to. And the father says, bring me the robe, the robe, and put it on my boy. Not just to cover up his filth and his degradation, but so that everybody knows he belongs to me. This wasteoid, miserable, little sniveling brat. I want to show everybody he belongs to me. Give him the family robe so the people can tell the difference. He's lying. And then give him the ring, the signet ring that he could use to do business with, to finalize documents with. It's like giving him the family charge card. That's exactly what it was. It wasn't currency, but it was the same thing as currency. It was as powerful as currency. And bring him sandals. The slaves go barefoot, but royalty wear sandals. put sandals on his feet. I want everybody, total and complete restoration, complete reintegration. And the kid hadn't done anything yet to earn it or to be worthy of it. All he did was to go out. That's all he did. So, we don't know whether it worked with this boy or not. All we know is that the boy left the robe and the ring and the sandals were put on him. And we know that the boy entered into the celebration. So we know that to some degree at least, the father talked about it, his only notion, that his performance is turning his relationship with his father. Now he has to turn to a much different couple of questions. Verse 25 to 26. And folks, now finally, they're getting to the heart of the heart. Usually this is where it stops. I mean, it stops with the boy coming home. The point of the parable is yet to be read. Verse 25 to 26. meanwhile the older son was in the field where else is the older son going to be he's going to be hard at work when he came near to the house he heard music and dancing so he called one of his servants and asked him what's going on your brother has come and the servant replied and your father has killed the fatted calf leading on the older brother became angry and refused to go in So what happens? The father goes looking for him. The father's kind of strange. He lets some people come home with their own accord, and some people he actually goes looking for. The good boy, he goes looking for him. And the boy says, all these years, all these years, every one of these years, I have slaved for you. I have never disobeyed one of your commands. I've done the perfect model son. I've done everything that should have gained your favor and earned your love. I did it all right. But you rewarded this son for doing nothing right and for everything bad. It's unjust, it's wrong, and I am offended. Preach the gospel, preach the right, and you'll offend the people. And of course, what do religious people do? They compare themselves. This son of yours is this wastoid, and I have been this really good son. The Pharisees are always, just as if people are always comparing, it's essential to their system. They have to figure out some way of figuring out who's number one and who's number two. What they don't know, that in the church, there's only one number one, and it's Jesus, and all the rest of us are number twos, and there aren't any number threes. But he's shocked and offended. But folks, this religious shock, this offense, didn't matter to the father. The father presses in. He says, look, good behavior doesn't earn you anything special. Bad behavior doesn't lose it for you. This is my son in his home. Don't you understand what matters is the fact that he's my son? Don't you know that nothing else matters? Everything else is irrelevant? But the good son is so busy working, so busy doing the right thing, so busy trying to please the father, that he totally missed the joy. And where is he when the celebration is going on? He's out working. But the father says, my son, you are always with me, and everything I had has always been yours. I want you to understand, this was all yours. The fatted calf, the fatted calf on a thousand hills were all yours. All you had to do was save it. The resources, the joy, the celebration, it was all here. You were so busy trying to earn it that you never experienced it. You had such a goofy misconception of who I am that you missed the point of our relationship. Everybody feels good. You are trying so hard to be right that you missed the point of our relationship, which is free, sovereign love. You are my son. You are my daughter. I have chosen to give my favor, my love, my grace on you, and that is why you have it. A good son constantly trying to gain the favor of his father because he sent that he didn't. And the Father doesn't make excuses for himself. He puts it back on the front. He gives an issue to him. I've done everything for you. It was all yours. All you had to do was to save you. There's a certain boldness. There's a certain boldness that we need to develop. To simply accept the fact that God has given us everything and press in to fellowship, to worship, to joy, to intimacy, to ask the Father for anything that you want. Do not preface it with, Father, I have sinned, and I'm not worthy to be called to a son. Don't preface it with, well, I was bad yesterday, but I'm going to be better today. Please share my prayer. Don't preface it with, I'm really going to do better in the future. Therefore, please, Lord, give me this blessing. And certainly not, you know, I've been really good. I expect something from you. Just leave all of that aside. It's a person-to-person thing. It has nothing to do. It's just a point, good or bad. The true evil is not, the real evil is not the son's sin, the bad son's sin of our country and the humiliation. The real evil is theological. It's falsehood or belief. That relationship depends on performance. The real evil of the big brother is not pharisaical pride. The real evil in the heart of the Big Brother is assaulting theological beliefs. And it is exactly the same as the Little Brothers. The evil, the thing that I talked about yesterday, the occult mischief, is this. That religious performance means something to God. And when you finally understand that religious performance has nothing to do with anything, You will not manipulate people with religious performance. And you will not allow anybody to manipulate people with religious performance. Not just because you have a free relationship with God based on His love, but also because that activity is evil. The older brother became angry and he refused to go in. Understand that when you refuse to go in, you don't go in. And when you don't go in, you don't get the celebration. And it's your own fault. If the celebration is going on, you can go in. You have to go in. But if you don't go in, you don't participate in the celebration, and that's why you don't have it. That's the only reason you don't have it. It's not because you're that patient. It's not because you're good at it. It's always our refusal to go in. One last insight. Killer, killer. The elder brother, the good brother, refused to go in because he was offended by the grace of God. Look at this. He despised the grace of God that accepted the bad brother, and that offense, refusing the grace of God to the bad brother, kept him from the celebration. Is that what I'm saying? Unbelievable. This is what I mean. This is the most theologically potent stuff in the Bible, Jesus said. He refused grace to a sinner and in the same time ruled himself out of the benefits of the grace. Now what this means is that you and I as good evangelicals, as ever as angels, cannot rule out the challenges. We cannot rule out even the fighting fundamentals that have been the focus of much of your angels. they all get in the same way you do. You can't in your victim state or in your superior theologically arrogant state, which is what I'm talking about, rule anybody out. Because when you rule somebody else out because they're not good enough for the grace of God, in doing that, you don't enter any of the same. You cannot refuse the grace of God to anybody, whether they're bad people or victims. and that's finally it's finally the care we love and so as a leader what do you do you set people free and hope that they will voluntarily return to the Father and pick up a hole and start with you to do it with joy and do it out of love or stay in the car country so whatever we do let's not cultivate a bunch of elder brothers either model it or be a bunch of or cultivate a bunch of elder brothers who do everything right, pay the bills, tithe, witness, pray, but never know God, never enter into a relationship with God. Better set people free, sweat it out, hope for the best. And I want to tell you, I have tried to live that way for the past many years, and I have got some very painful stories to tell you that might dissuade you from my life. It is not a pity sign. Not to mention that you get everybody in your profession mad at you. So, intimacy with God comes the same way for the good brother as well as for the bad brother. Just by taking it. Just by entering in. Entering boldly, as the writer to Hebrews said. Let us now enter boldly into the presence of God. Under the blood of Christ. Having our consciences completely cleansed. Let's enter boldly. Having the blood of Christ, not our performance, cleansing our conscience. So if you're a bad brother, don't waste any time. Just come home. And if you're a good brother or a good sister, don't waste any time. Just come in and welcome each other when you get to the party. Stand and let me pray for you. Father of all forgiveness and love, we want an opportunity now to let the Word of God sink into us. Everything that I've said has been clear. I have told confidence in that. Everything that I've said has been true to you that you need something more by the power of your Holy Spirit. You need for this to sink deep, not just into our heads, but into our hearts and into the tissues of our being. Because we have believed a lie. We have been steeped in a lie by the world. We have experienced conditional blessing and conditional cursing all of our lives. We think that that's the way the life of the world is. We say to us, if you want to see the kingdom of God, take all of that and turn it upside down. I thank you, Father, for the balance of this story that shows us that bad behavior or good behavior really do have consequences on this earthly plan. But they are irrelevant to our relationship and the possibility of receiving with you. But that's truly given. And because it's truly given, the only way it can be received is by truly receiving. I ask Holy Spirit now that you intensify the healing and convicting and convincing power of the words of Christ. to carry worship, to enter into us, and to empower us, and to embolden us, to give us a light heart, and to have us better to celebrate. Come on, Holy Spirit, God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
