Let me just read a couple of verses that we're going to be focusing on this morning so that we understand where we're going or at least where we're at. Verse 21, and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. That is the umbrella under which everything else is going to flow. Wives to your own husbands. The words be subject is an interjection, not in the original text. Wives to your own husbands as to the Lord. Wives to your own husbands. And then verse 25, Husbands, love your wives. How? Just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her. Let's pray as we begin. Father, the struggle I'm having with this this morning is the fact that even as I reviewed this one more time before church this morning, I saw myself as being in a position of needing to do significant changes, Significant growth in this particular area of how I relate to my own wife. Open our hearts to your truth, to your standard for spirit-filled marriages. I ask this in your name. Amen. We are entering this famous or infamous text. I guess it depends on your outlook. It has become the model for Christian marriages. Wives, be subject to your husbands. Husbands, love your wives. And the way I said that, it's kind of how we even deal with it a little bit, isn't it? I think if we were honest, we would say that that is basically how we deal with it. In fact, we've heard this text, I'm sure, taught many, many times. And if I have a complaint, if I have one at all, with the way I've heard it taught before, it's the fact that we really do separate those two things and what we remember most quite honestly and maybe this is just my perspective as a man is how my wife is to submit and all i have to do is love in fact my wife makes jokes about that that all i have to she she has to love me or i have to love her she doesn't have to love me but uh all she has to do is respect me and we get real legalistic and it's real weird and obviously we're missing something some say that this particular text just makes so much sense it's just obvious that the man is to be the head of the home and he is to be the head of the home the man is to be the the strong one he's to be the boss and it's real clear and the woman is submissive and all this kind of stuff and it's just as clear as as you can possibly imagine it's real clear others i've heard i heard someone tell me he thought paul was probably not taking his own advice and he was a little bit buzzo on this particular thing and he was really goofy and something was really wrong here because this doesn't make any sense at all to him. But again, fundamentally, the struggle we have very often with this particular text is that we never seem to study it in whole. Now, I think you know something about my teaching that I am not afraid to go slow. We've been in Ephesians well over a year now, and we're going to be in here for a while to go. And when we went through the filling of the Spirit, we spent six weeks, and we took it apart week by week. I struggled with that this week because in doing what I'm going to do this morning, I'm going to forego some of the things I relish doing, and that is going slowly and teaching and teaching and teaching. I think it's important this Sunday that we get a grasp of the whole, what this text is really dealing with in whole. We can't separate the function of the woman and the function of the man in this particular text. And I think as we go through this, we are going to see that. They both need to be seen together. They both need to be seen functioning together. What I believe we need to see is that if this text teaches anything at all, that at the very core of its doctrine, there is a doctrine that we will call mutual submission. Now that may be a new term to some of you. To some of you who have studied this for years, it may not be at all. But one of the things I want you to write down in your book, if that's what you're doing right now, is that little term, mutual submission. That whole concept is set for us in verse 21. Remember the context we're dealing with here. It's very important. That's another thing. You know, one of the joys or one of the privileges of preaching in an expository fashion is that we never are allowed to go to a text and just kind of pull it out and do with it what we want. We're always seeing it in context. And this is no exception. What is the context here? We're speaking of the filling of the Spirit. We're speaking of people's lives who are being controlled by the Holy Spirit of God. And then we begin to talk about the results of that kind of filling. The results is that my relationship with myself is right. I have a song. My relationship with God is right. I say thanks. And thirdly, my relationship with you is healed. And that is submitting where? Verse 21. One to another in the fear of Christ or out of reverence for Christ. Basically, one of the things we need to see is that more than anything else, what Paul is talking about here and dealing with is a body concept. He is talking about the body of Christ and how we are to relate one to another. What do we do in the body of Christ? We submit to one another. There are some fundamental problems with that, however. The fundamental problem is basically this. We're all selfish. And see, I want to get it my way, and you want to get it your way, and somebody else wants to get it their way, and we've got all these different opinions and all these political parties, even in the church, beginning to form, and we're going all in different directions. And the only thing, the only thing that can rectify that and bring a sense of unity and oneness is what? The filling of the Spirit. That's the only thing. As we're walking in the Spirit, as we're controlled by the Spirit, there brings this ability in my part because I'm full of Him that I can give to you. And that is the hallmark of our Christian walk. And then in an effort to illustrate what he means, the Apostle Paul does just that. He illustrates it. Be subject to one another, And in case you don't understand exactly what I'm talking about, this is what I mean. Wives, be subject to your husbands. Husbands, love your wives. Children, obey your parents. Parents, don't provoke your children. Masters, slaves, what are we doing? Every one of those people are submitting and subjecting themselves to the other. Yes, we have a concept of headship. Even in the church, you know, Paul could have used a lot of different illustrations. He could have used an illustration of government. He could have used an illustration of the church itself, where there's a spiritual equality and everything's the same, and at the same time there is a structure. I don't even know if I like that word, but there is a structure. There is a headship in the church. Obviously the head of the church is Christ, but in a lower kind of context, you have elders and deacons and that kind of thing running through it. Mutual submission. Submit one to another. Everybody submits. Everybody is involved in serving. Okay, I've dumped that on you. Now we're going to go back and begin to take this apart and study a little bit. If we have learned anything in the book of Ephesians, we have learned that the standard of living for the believer is different than the rest of the world. And that's a key word. Just to say it's different. If we see the world scratching their head, we're going to scratch our belly. We're just going to do it different. If they're walking like this, we're going to walk like that. It's a different kind of walk. We are salt and light in a decaying and dark world, and God calls on His people to live differently in that world. We walk a different walk. We have a different talk. We have a different kind of unity. We have a different kind of love. And on and on and on we could go describing the differences between the believer and the world in which he lives. And I believe that if anything ought to be different about the believer, it ought to be how the believer, you and I, live in our homes. how I treat my wife and wives, how you treat your husbands and how we relate to our children. And this whole thing, these next few weeks, is going to be dealing with this whole verse. That if anything can be the true indicator of whether David Johnson is really controlled by the Spirit of God, if whether David Johnson is truly Spirit-filled, that the place that is going to be indicated more than any other place is how I live at home, how my wife perceives me, how my kids perceive me. And I could have, and this is something just for me, I could have the most magnificent ministry here that you could possibly imagine, and things could be happening. But if I fail in that home, something is tragically amiss. And I think it's a real indictment on some of us who are in the ministry that over and over and over it's almost become a joke that the pastor has the worst kids, and things are really bad, and there's always this kind of rebellion. and I really believe that there is satanic work there and I understand all that but I also know that Eli the prophet when he lost his two kids he lost not only his two kids but he did lose his ministry as well and there was a tremendous heartbreak men and women we need to be focusing on the home and if any place again I'm going to say it again if any place is an indicator of whether we're being controlled with the spirit that is going to be indicated in how we live at home my wife knows me better than anybody here my wife knows whether I'm a hypocrite or not better than any of you here and I can do real well I'm enough of a pretender I'm enough of all those things we've been talking about for the last few weeks and I'm good enough at some of those things that I could fool an awful lot of you but I couldn't do it at home and that is a real charge to me and to you in this whole vein General Montgomery in addressing some of his very, very young charges said these words, Gentlemen, don't even think about marriage until you have mastered warfare. Huh. You're a little slow, but we'll get it. Huh. Why is it so tough? Why is it so tough? Every one of us relate to that. Why is it so tough for us to have meaningful relationships with someone? And again, I'm not even saying with my wife or with my husband or anything like that, but even here within the body, again, the umbrella for this is submitting one to another. That's the focus, it's body. Why is it so tough to have those meaningful relationships? That promise of a deeper and better relationship that in 35 years is going to be richer than it was before. For some I see it and it's wonderful, but others it seems like an elusive dream and it's just a fantasy. In fact, it seems that if we were totally honest, the norm seems to be when we look at marriage, it is portrayed as a fighting, bitter, discontented, wrangling kind of thing. And we put it on TV and we laugh about it. That's the subject of all the soap operas and all that kind of thing. Bitter, angry, and I find my fulfillment somewhere else. It's ugly. Why is that? You know what? I believe there are reasons for that warfare. I believe that there are reasons for that tension. And I believe that they are very, very clear. And I also believe that before we can deal effectively with Ephesians 5, we need to do some background work, and that's what we're going to do this morning. We need to do some background work in understanding just exactly what Ephesians 5 is bringing to us, because it is bringing to us something new and fresh and alive and resulting, and the result of a Spirit-filled life. Discover the reasons for the tension between men and women, between men and men and women and women, people, the reasons for those things. I want you to go all the way back with me to Genesis chapter 2. Genesis chapter 2, verse 18, where the pages are white. Genesis chapter 2, verse 18. We have here the story of creation, and as we come to verse 18, man has already been created, but God is not finished yet. In verse 18, God says this, Then the Lord God said, It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper suitable for him. Or a suitable helper. One to help with what he has been assigned to do. Verse 19, And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called the living creature, that was its name. And the man gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to every beast of the field. But for Adam, there was not found a helper suitable for him. Verse 21, So the Lord God caused the deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept. Then he took out one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place. And the Lord God fashioned into a woman the rib which he had taken from the man and brought her to the man. Verse 23, very crucial. And the man said, This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she has been taken out of man. For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh. And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed. Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh. What we have here, dear people, is a marvelously perfect relationship. If you want to know, if you want to go to one place in all the Word of God that gives to us what God intended marriage to be, this is the place we come. This is before the fall. This is before the influence of sin that has been allowed to decimate our relationships. This is what God's intended. bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, one flesh. We see a marvelous unity, a oneness, a union, an equality here between the man and the woman. Yes, there is a headship here. Yes, there is that concept of the man being the head, and that cannot be refuted. There's too many places all through Scripture where we have that functional position. But I want to tell you something, that the unity and the union between the man and the woman in this particular place is so magnanimous that the concept of headship isn't even seen. There's a unity here. There's a blending into oneness. And all we see here is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh taken out of me one flesh. Chapter 1. Move back just a little bit to verse 27. We see the same account given just in a little bit different way. A briefer account of the same thing. Verse 27. And God created man in his own image. And in the image of man, God created him male and female. He created them. And God blessed them and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and rule over it, over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on it. Listen, one of the things he's describing here is he's describing the man and the woman here, them being fruitful, them multiplying, them filling the earth, them subduing it, them having dominion. A marvelous co-regency here. This is not, again, to negate the structural functioning of the headship of the man, 1 Corinthians 11. Christ is the head of the church, man is the head of the woman, you can't get around that. We're not trying to get around that. What we're trying to see is that what God intended in a marriage is to be such an incredible union that that can be functioning and not even seen. Them subduing. It's a team effort. But something happens in chapter 3 that spoils all that. In chapter 3, we have the influence of sin coming in and Eve is tempted and Adam is tempted and they both acquiesce to the temptation that came. Sin enters into this relationship and this relationship that once was marked by mutual submission one to another, this wonderful unanimity is now destroyed by the entering of sin. And this is very important that we understand this. In chapter 3, verse 7, what do we see? Something has changed. They got involved in this sin, they acquiesced to it, and then, verse 7, the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings and they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees in the garden. You know what happened here? This is incredible. The result of the filling of the Spirit. Do you remember what it was? It was that all three most important relationships in my life were healed. Remember that? With myself, I had a song. With God, I was made right. With you, there was this serving of one another. And here is where it's all destroyed. With me, I'm ashamed. With you, I'm separated. From God, it's over. I want to hide from Him. I want you to know this as we go through this, that if the Gospel message is any message at all, the message is this, that the fall has been reversed, that Christ came so that the relationship with me can be made whole, that my relationship with Him can be made whole, and my relationship with you can be made whole, but this is where it was destroyed. And as soon as that happens, our marriages suffer the consequences. The unity, the oneness, the mutual giving, that vulnerability of these two people giving to one another, them subduing, them was just absolutely gone. Right now, it was over. ever since then we have been at each other's throats men and women we call it the battle of the sexes right? the battle of the sexes where the women are saying I'm the better one and the men are saying I'm the stronger one and we're constantly trying to beat each other down it started right here all our relationships have been followed up I want you to look at chapter 3 verse 14 these relationships have been followed up no longer is this mutual giving anymore a reality we're fighting with each other and God kind of takes the whole thing and sets it in concrete with what we call the curse. In chapter 3 verse 14 it says this, And the Lord God said to the serpent, Serpent, here's your curse. Because you have done this, cursed are you more than all cattle and more than every beast of the field. On your belly you shall go and dust you will eat. That's the curse for the serpent. Here's the curse for Satan. It says this, I will put enmity between you and the woman between your seed and her seed. Basically, I don't want to get real into this because we could take a lot of time here. But, excuse me, between your seed, those would be the children of God, and between your seed, Satan's seed, those who follow Satan, and her seed, those who would follow God. And throughout time, there's going to be a warfare on a spiritual sense. And he shall bruise you on the head, or he shall crush you on the head. This is speaking of Christ, what he's going to do to Satan. At Calvary, Satan is going to be crushed. The ultimate victory is Christ's, and you shall bruise him on the heel. That is speaking of Christ at the crucifixion. Again, it is not a fatal blow, but it is one that causes suffering. That's what that is alluding to. Verse 16, what we're interested in for our study is this. To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you shall give forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you. Post fall. This is the defilement of marriage. This is not the model of marriage. This is not what God intended marriage to be. The curse of the woman. I want us to look at this. The joy of childbirth, first of all, is that the joy of childbirth is going to be mitigated with pain. The joy is still going to be there, and any woman who's ever had a child can testify to that, but it's going to be mitigated. it's going to be tempered by the fact that there's going to be tremendous pain involved in it also. That is a result of the curse. Every time you go through that, you can understand it. And it says also, And thy desire shall be for thy husband, and thy husband will rule over thee. Again, the first thing we need to see here is this is the curse. This is not the model marriage. Headship for the man in the home is before the fall. That is what God intended. Ruling over, dominating, is not what God intended. The second thing I want you to see is something that needs to be exegeted and understood. It is in verse 16 where it says part of the curse is that the woman's desire is going to be for her husband. Now most of us believe and most of us have been taught or understand this particular verse to mean that the woman is going, as a result of the fall, to have a very, just a compelling desire for her husband. Sexually and emotionally both. That her desire is going to be for her husband. And that's a result of the curse. there's something missing in our interpretation of this particular verse i'm afraid for one thing just in terms of real life i realize that the women physically do not have that kind of urge for their husband if anything is true it's the other way around right my poor wife i get home from work she hides in the bathroom for half an hour lets me it's chasing him around and all that kind of stuff that's the way it is. We don't see that. If anything, catch this now, catch this. If I was to interpret this verse that way, I'm kicking it back to pre-fall. If there was ever a time where a woman had a desire for her husband to please him and to give herself to him, it would have been before the fall, not after. What's missing? Let's do some study. I did, and let's look. Men, let's do that first. He shall rule over thee. The Hebrew word there is masal. Masal. It means to reign or to rule, and it is despotic in nature. It is ruling over. Okay? Before the fall, what did we have? We had co-regency. We had people who were wonderfully won. We had a real team concept there. Headship, yes. Not ruling over at all. Now we have this concept of men ruling over the wives. Despotic in their rule. Crushing of the women. Two, women, let's look at that. Desire shall be to thy husband. Desire is the word shuka. Now get this. It comes from the Arabic root, which means not loving desire, not an urging to please somehow at all. It means rather this. To compel, to urge, to seek control. You got that? To compel, to urge, to seek control. People, what this is basically saying is this. When it's rightly read, your desire as a result of this curse is that you are forever going to be at war. Before there was this unity. Before there was this mutual submission, both of you giving to one another. And now you're going to be at war with each other. Your desire, your urge, your compelling force will be to control your husband. And his desire and his urge is going to be ruling over you. People, from now on, family life is going to be at war. And it's just like the way you're going to have to fight with the ground, men, to make it bring forth fruit. It's going to be a war. It's going to be a struggle. Because why? Because we're basically selfish people. And the very things that destroy the body of Christ because we don't submit to one another is the thing that destroys our marriage because we don't submit to one another. Because nobody knows how to give. Everybody's usurping authority. Everybody's grabbing it for themselves. That's what destroys the church, and that is what destroys our marriages. the curse of sin is seen in our marriages we see it over and over women seeking in wily wily manipulative kinds of ways to rule their husbands and men lording it over their husbands oppressive dictators you know I just have this picture of us men and I grew up in the same culture you did and you know what I want us to understand too that much of our many of our perceptions of what the man in the home is supposed to be has not been derived from Scripture. We say it is, but it's really been derived from our own culture. And I think, well, if we're going to be the men God wants us to be, we're going to have to know that and understand that so I can begin to serve my wife the way God has called me to do. Men lording it over and oppressive. Yes, there is male chauvinism. Yes, that is a tremendous curse. Yes, that is something that we need to fight with everything we have. You are not the boss, men. You're the head. We're going to get into that a little bit tonight when we define some terms. This is my frustration I have this morning because we're not going through that. Headship, how is that established? How did Christ establish it? He gave himself completely. Yes, there is male chauvinism. There is no question about it. Yes, there are women who seek to usurp. There is no question about it. whatever happened to the unity, it is gone. We see this at work every day of our lives. It was at work in Jesus' day. It was at work in the Old Testament. It was at work in Paul's day. We don't want to submit to anybody, men or women. Wives in the Old Testament day were a little more than slaves. You think you have it bad now. I mean, that doesn't make it any better now. But in the Old Testament, they were a little more than a possession. that you would own. A Jewish prayer would go something like this. God, I thank Thee that I am not a Gentile. I thank Thee that I am not a slave. And I thank Thee that I am not a woman. Divorce was allowed even in Deuteronomy. The book of Deuteronomy relates for us the fact that divorce was allowed under certain circumstances. If your wife was deemed to be unclean, then you could divorce her. That was wonderful. The bottom line then becomes, what does it mean to be unclean? Most of the rabbis of that day, if they were conservative, they would say that the only thing that deems a wife unclean would be adultery. And so under those circumstances, divorce would be allowed. But if you want to get around that, you just find yourself a liberal rabbi, okay? And there were liberal rabbis. Doesn't it sound like today, it's just the same junk. Rabbi Hillel said things like this, she's unclean if she spoils the dinner so if she burns your bagel she's out you find somebody prettier you find somebody prettier a little more attractive and that causes your wife to look unclean in your eyes she's unclean you can leave her get somebody else anything you want to do the Greeks were even worse at least they have some laws here the Greeks could do it on a whim anything you want to do so when Paul was writing to these people he was writing to people whose marriages were absolutely being decimated by the attacks of Satan and by the attacks of a society that was being controlled by Satan. And again, I feel like I'm interjecting all the way along here. We better know that we are living in a society that's controlled by Satan. And we better not be getting our marriage mores from our society. The unity has been broken. Mutual submission is out. And the war is being waged between men and women, between men and men, between women and women. Look with me for a moment at what happened. This is just boggling the mind, and I want to boggle your mind a little bit. I want to overload you a little bit on the incredible way that relationships just got destroyed when people quit giving to one another after the fall. It's like falling off a cliff. Satan begins his attack in Genesis 4. Remember the fall took place? Genesis 2, Genesis 3, Genesis 4. Verse 23, we have Lamech, and he says to his wife Ada and Zillah. He's got wives from A to Z. Wonderful, huh? Lamech, what are you doing with two wives? What is going on here? You know what? We've got the fall in Genesis 2. Genesis 4, you've got polygamy. Right now, immediately, the prostitution of the divine standard. What's the divine standard? Two becoming one. This is the prostitution of the divine standard all through the Old Testament. When they have more than one wife, don't tell me one time that that was okay. It wasn't. It was a prostitution. It was a defilement of what God intended marriage to be. Chapter 16, verses 2 through 5. We have more. Flip along with me. Hope you've got your Bibles. You need it if you come here. I think you know that. Chapter 16, verse 2. So Sarah said to Abram, Now behold, the Lord has prevented me from bearing children. Please go into my maid. Perhaps I shall obtain children through her. And Abram listened to the voice of Sarah. Wonderful, they did it. All you have here is adultery. Another way to destroy a marriage. And I want to tell you something. It had a tremendous impact on their marriage. There was a seething between those two women. Adultery. Chapter 19, verses 1. Verse 1, and then down to verse 4. Chapter 19. Now the two angels came to this wonderful city named Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. And he said, Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise early and go on your way. They said, However, no, but we shall spend the night in the square. Verse 4, Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all of the people from every quarter. And they called to Lot and said to him, Where are the men who came with you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them. Homosexuality, right now. Chapter 34, verses 1 and 2. Chapter 34, verses 1 and 2. Now Dinah, the daughter of Leia, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land. And when Shechem, the son of Hamor, the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, He took her and lay with her by force. Rape. Fornication. Chapter 38, 13 and 14. Turn to that. I know I'm overloading you. That's okay. Chapter 38, verse 14 and 15. So she removed her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in the gateway of Enam, which is the road to Timnah. And she saw that Shelah had grown up and she had not been given to him as a wife. When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, for she had covered her face. You know what you have here? They do get involved. You know what they have here? Incest. And you also have prostitution. In verse 16 and 24, it says that she was counted to be a prostitute. You know what? We are not even out of the first book of the Bible yet, and we have already got polygamy, adultery, fornication, homosexuality, rape, incest, and prostitution. Chapter 39, we have the incident of Joseph and Potiphar. And you don't have to turn to that, but you know the story. The evil seduction that goes on there. Stop there. That's enough. Listen, you want to know why marriages are tough. You want to know why our relationships are miserable. Because to start with, they've been cursed. And everybody since that time, since we quit giving to one another, everybody since that time has been vying for power. I want to have it my way. It's all for me and the reason you're there is to satisfy me. Add to that the fact that Satan, I believe, is on an all-out assault to destroy marriages. Add to that the fact that the impulses of polygamy, adultery, fornication, homosexuality, rape, incest, prostitution, seduction. And add to that the fact that right now, today, we live in a society that even exalts those things as virtue. And you've got problems making a marriage work. we live in a society today that would take one who would get married and still be a virgin and that would be the source of jokes and you know that and we live in a society today that would look at a man who is really serving his wife and laying down his life for his wife and giving himself fully to that family and those children and you would have some men even some men in our church believers who would say ha his wife runs that family boy you know we don't know what it means to be the head of our home we think that what it means to be the head of the home is to sit back and give orders we don't that's off contrast that junk i just dumped on you with what we talked about in genesis 1 and 2 it isn't good for man to be alone. He needs a helper. Bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. Where did that go? More important, how do we get it back? And then I come to Ephesians 5. And we have wives lovingly, graciously, willingly giving themselves to their husbands who is the head. And we have husbands lovingly, graciously, willingly giving themselves to their wives, how as Christ gave himself to his church. And all of that born out of a heart that is filled with the Spirit of God. And that's the only way. I told you last week when I was finishing up with the filling of the Spirit that my biggest fear was that we'd get into this kind of stuff and everybody would go home and try real hard to be a good wife and try real hard to be a good husband. It won't work. You've got to go back to that verse 18. to empty yourself. You know, suddenly it begins to hit me as I look at this text in Ephesians 5 that what is being described here has brought us back before the fall. This is the reverse of the fall, the reverse of the curse. And while the headship is still there, what we see is one flesh. Even in chapter 5, verse 31, For this cause, remember, a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh. You know where that's taken from? What we just read in Genesis 2 where that was pre-fall. That was marriage the way God intended it to be. One flesh. One flesh. What a glory. Looking at the text real quick and I'm just going to close with this. We're running late. Wives submit. Wives submit. There is no way I would say anything less than that. Wives, look at the text, it says this. Wives to your own husbands, that, again, be subject is something that is understood. It is not in the original text. It doesn't mean that. It does mean that. It's tying in with verse 21. Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. Wives to your husbands. Wives to your husbands. Very specific in its terminology. Wives, that is the only characteristic. It doesn't say wives of husbands who are doing what they ought to do. It doesn't say wives of big, strong husbands. It doesn't say wives of husbands who are making a lot of money. It says wives, be subject to your husbands. Be serving your husbands. Be giving yourselves to your husbands. You know what the word is not? The word is not obey. There's a different word here completely. In fact, the word that describes a relationship between a child and a parent is obey. The word that is used to describe a relationship between a slave and a master is obey, but not here. It's submit. There is a willingness here, women, that you willingly place yourself into that position of service to your husband. And by the way, there's also a feeling here of possession. Your own husband. You own him. You possess him. And by an act of your will, you place yourself into that position of service to him. You don't have a child-parent relationship in a marriage. You don't have a slave-master relationship in a marriage. I'm afraid that some of our marriages function that way, but let me tell you, if it works for you and you're satisfied with that, I'm not going to try to talk you out of that, But I am going to tell you this, that that is not God's standard. That is not the divine standard. That is not what God intended. Wives, you're not to stand in the center of the home awaiting command while your husband sits, and this is for you husbands too, me too, where I sit there and go to Bonnie, do this, do that, clean this, clean that, and she's thinking, why do you do that then? I really need to do a lot of growing here. And you know, I have another sidelight here. I feel like we're training our sons to be takers and too often we train our daughters to be givers and to be dependent and to be less than what God would have them be mutual submission I think husbands and dads we need to begin to teach our sons to give do this, do that go here, go there, fix this that is the marriage of the world that is not the marriage that God intended us to have willingly giving yourself wives to your own husband husbands love your wives verse 25 again very specific husbands if you fall in that category that's you it doesn't say husbands who have wives who submit it doesn't say husbands who have wives who are pretty it doesn't say husbands who have wives who are real agreeable and helpful in the home it doesn't say that it says husbands love your wives I've said this all the way through the sermon but I'm going to say it again the husbands we also submit to our wives just as a woman has trouble giving because that's the way we are we're basically selfish so do men you know we exalt this macho man junk you know we do we really do again I grew up in that I tried like crazy to be tough and strong and I thought that's the kind of thing that she'll respond to no just beat her down that'd be great the hard guy the tough guy and basically if you want to bounce that out onto our society what you have out of that kind of mentality is exactly the reason we're having so many problems in our nation today with marriage and this whole ERA thing we have men who are seeing themselves big and strong macho man junk suppressing women crushing them using women as sex objects and nothing more this week I had occasion to go downtown Minneapolis twice and I had to drive down Hennepin Avenue And there's no way in the world you can drive down Hennepin Avenue without seeing the proliferation of junk that lines that street. And all it tells to me is that women have been suppressed and men do perceive women as nothing else than something we can use. And that is the defilement of God's statement. The depravity of sin. Again, we raise our little boys sometimes to be takers. I can relate to that too well. With a mother who took care of me. So by the time I was ready to get married, I wasn't looking for a wife, I was looking for a maid. And that's a defilement of God's standard. And then we have the gall to think that's the way it should be. That's the depravity of sin. I believe men, and I'm speaking to men now, and to myself, I believe that we have a society that's full of weaklings as far as what God wants men to be. We act so often like spoiled little kids who've got to get our own way. And then it's almost as if we believe that it's okay for us to act like a spoiled kid and have a tantrum and say, this is the way it's going to be, this is my house. And we have the gall again to think that that's the way it ought to be. That I'm a man, so that means I can act like a jerk. What a defilement that is of God's standard. Again, I've got to kick you right back to Genesis 2. Husbands, love your wives. How? Just as Christ loved the church. And what did he do? He gave, and he gave, and he gave, and he gave. When I was done with this text, I felt very strongly about the fact that the command to live a life of service is laid at the feet of the man even to a deeper level than it is laid at the feet of the woman. Again, there is this headship. There is that responsibility of the man before God to be the leader in his home. But how is that leadership established? We're going to talk about that a little bit tonight. But how is that leadership established? How did Christ establish his leadership? He established it by serving and giving. He never grabbed it for himself. In fact, if in your home you're walking around going, I'm the boss, then you're not. You may be the boss, but you're not the head in your home. Your headship is established by your service and your giving and the laying down of your life. Dads, husbands, do you love your wives? For her and for your children, are you laying down your line? That's what we're called to do. Nothing left. Moms and dads, husbands and wives, I believe and I feel this real heavy on me right now as I've got three little ones at home, two little girls and one little boy. It is laid upon me as a father and a husband, and it is laid upon my wife as a woman and a wife and a mother to leave for our children a legacy of love, a legacy of mutual giving. Passing on to my daughters, very properly through my wife, passing through our marriage to our daughters, what it means to give. And me passing on to my son, what it means to give. And give, and give, and give. But I want to tell you something. This kind of pre-fall marriage is not possible without the in-working of the Holy Spirit, without the control of the Holy Spirit in your life. No way. In fact, unless you've already grappled with the filling of the Spirit in your life, the things I'm even talking about aren't even going to be a desire for you because for many of our marriages, even here this morning, to live a life this way in your home would require such an incredibly radical change that it would be far easier just to ignore this and move on. But I want to tell you something. If you get serious about the filling of the Spirit, it's going to begin to affect your marriage. It has to. you know there's some other people some other couples just because I've seen your living who understand what it means to be filled with the spirit and you've never even heard this taught and this is just how you function you're going well this isn't new this isn't new this is how we live I think our marriages can be all God intended them to be I believe because of the society we're living in and the pressure there is right now on the total decimation of marriage that it has to go beyond what I just said though I think our marriages have to be all that God intended them to be and if they aren't and if we don't pass that legacy of mutual giving to our children then God help us all this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh for this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. That's God's great design. Don't let it be less. Let's pray. This concludes the message on this cassette.
