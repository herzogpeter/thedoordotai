Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Good, good, good. Well, our senior pastor, the infamous David Johnson, yesterday spoke at this small groups conference at a little church you may have heard of called Willow Creek in Chicago. So through live, a few thousand people there live, and then 8,000 or 9,000 other people through satellite feed, he spoke about how to live in the way of Jesus. And so you can imagine these poor people. got fire hosed by the thing that Dave loves to think about, be about, and talk about the most. And he's going to kill me for telling this story, but you're going to love it. You know, Willow, that's a big stage. And so he was out this last week, and he was going to buy a pair of new jeans to wear, you know. And he said that, you know, he was looking at himself in the mirror thinking, I look good in these new jeans that I'm going to wear on this stage. And then he said, you know, right in that moment I got this word, don't wear those new jeans. Wear your old jeans. Bring yourself to that big stage. And that story made me think, I'm so grateful for him. Right, 30 years of wearing his old jeans and bringing himself to this stage on easy days and on hard days. And so that's our senior pastor, Dave. So next time you see him, tell him thanks for bringing it out there and bringing it in here too. And tell him not to kill me for telling that story, okay? Well, last week Dave asked this question that I thought was a good one. In your personal battle to find hope and faith, what is it that you see? And are you able to see any more than just the rubble that's all around you? I think all of us have our own battle to find hope and faith, whether that be something small or something huge. We're in this battle, and in our battle, most of us only see the rubble that's around us. We can't see anything else. And that metaphor of the rubble all around us, Dave told us the story came from Nehemiah, when Nehemiah chose to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, this Herculean effort that the children of Israel undertook. But they got to a place, we learned, where it was really difficult because all they saw was the rubble all around them. Nehemiah 4.10 says this, The strength of the laborers was giving out because there was so much rubble. And they even said, listen, because of this rubble, it's so much and so big, we're not gonna even be able to rebuild this wall. Our strength is given out. So my question today to you is this today. How's your strength doing these days? Has anyone's strength, in fact, given out in the effort of rebuilding whatever wall it is that you're rebuilding? Maybe it's a marriage or a work life or a relationship or whatever that is. Have any of you declared this week that you can't rebuild your wall because you have no strength left? Well, my guess is the answer is yes for many of us. Really, more of us than we'd think. I know a lot of people who are like this. A couple I know that have been trying to have a baby for years just went to the end of the line in their fertility treatments and found out that they are still not pregnant. So the rubble they see is disappointment, failure, and absolute exhaustion, and it overwhelms them. And they are right on the verge of declaring that they can't rebuild this wall. Another friend of mine has a son, 21 years old, that's just been sentenced to life in prison without parole. Something he didn't do. Can you imagine this mother's anguish as she thinks about the life that he's going to live from here on out? On good days, on good days, she's hanging on barely. And on bad days, the wall seems like it's completely torn down and unable to be rebuilt. Another friend of mine has been searching for a job as a pastor for a bunch of years now. And almost every job that he's applied for, he's been turned down. And this guy is one of the guys that has the most character that I know. I love this guy. But whenever he gets that phone call that says he, you know, didn't get the job, The rubble he sees is failure, and it feels like a personal accusation that pins him to the wall. And his, on good days, he's willing to make it another day. And on bad days, all he sees is rubble. I have another friend who, like many of us are in this day and age, he's trying to turn his organization around in this failing economy. And the rubble he sees is inefficiency, low morale, and confusion. It wakes him up at night. And all he sees is what he can't do. another friend that I have can't stop thinking about kids around the world who have no one to stand up for them and are therefore hopeless so he desperately wants to see change in the world especially as it relates to these kids who have no hope but all he sees the rubble that he sees all around him is politics and division and he feels like anything he tries to do is in vain and you have a wall that you're trying to rebuild as well, and the rubble around you maybe, maybe is overtaking you. So my question is, has anyone's strength given out? Has anyone lost hope? My guess is the answer is yes, for more of us than we'd like to think. So I'd like to introduce you to someone who just might help. His name is Epaphras. So open your Bibles, if you have them, to Colossians chapter 1. we're making it to verse 3 and all the way through 8 today I'd like to read it to you we always thank God, Paul and Timothy Wright the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all of his people the faith and love that spring from the hope we talked about this last week stored up for you in heaven about which you have already heard in the true word of the gospel that has come to you and in the same way the gospel is bearing fruit and is growing throughout the whole world, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God's grace. And here's our character coming, verse seven. You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf and who also told us of your love in the Spirit. Now, you've probably never heard of Epaphras. Maybe some of you have. But the truth is, you know him. See, Epaphras is the person in your life who is for you when everybody else is against you. When you get a phone call from Epaphras and you see his little face come up on your cell phone or his number on the caller ID, you don't screen that call. Epaphras is the person in your life who, without any fanfare, quietly helps you to survive. He's the person that writes that little note on your Facebook wall that you actually read and it actually encourages you. Epaphras shows up at the hospital when you're sick, and you don't feel like you have to entertain him, because he is there for you. That's Epaphras, and probably you have someone like that in your life. Now, you've never heard of Marie Weins, but she's my 99-year-old grandma. 99. We just celebrated her 99th birthday, and she was a pastor's wife for a number of years, and so she's always had a special place in her heart, I think, for me and my wife Mary, and because she knows the specific struggles that go through being a pastor. So every time, every few times a year, she will write me a card, a little handwritten card, front and back, and she'll just write it to encourage me. She'll say, Steve, I know what it's like because we lived it, and there's some great times and some hard times, but I want to tell you, I've lived 99 years, Steve, and God is faithful. God's been faithful to me. And so God will be faithful to you, even when it's tough. And she says she prays for me. And you know, I don't doubt that that's true when she says that. 99 years old, she's an Epaphras to me. There's a couple of women that are from this church, they're friends of ours, that come to our house about once a month to take care of our three little maniacs. So that Mary and I can actually get out and eat a meal that we did not cook, a meal that we don't have to clean up after, and a meal where we don't have to get up 17 times to clean barf off of someone's, you know, shirt, or to get more, more, more of anything, unless we ask more, more, more for something. And they do this partly because they love our boys, but they also tell us we're doing this because your marriage really matters. The strength of your marriage matters. And you need to get eye to eye without kids every once in a while just to say, oh yeah, I remember you. I remember you. I married you. They're an Epaphras to us. In Colossians 1, 7, Paul calls Epaphras a dear fellow servant. And the Greek word for that is sundulos. It's a compound Greek word. Son refers to a connection that is based on a common commitment to something else. So it means we're not just friends because I like you and you like me. We're together in this because we're committed to something in common. And doulos is the word for slave. We heard Dave talk about this a few weeks ago as it relates to Jesus being a slave and then Paul being the slave of that slave. Doulos means one who is in a permanent relationship of servitude to another. I'd like that to characterize who you are as it relates to Jesus. One who is in permanent, in a permanent relationship of servitude to someone else. That's not something we're very familiar with in our culture, is it? Epaphras is Paul's dear friend because he's on the same mission as Paul is. And he's bonded to Paul inseparably because he, like Paul, defines himself primarily as a slave of Christ. but Epaphras' role, unlike Paul's, is not to write epistles and become famous. It's to come and offer Paul a cup of cold water or a warm blanket. Epaphras was a Colossian. He's from the Colossian church but he's been spending a lot of time around Paul. We can assume that he voluntarily has entered into a prison with Paul in order to serve him and be with him. Epaphras is totally insignificant on the scorecard of worldwide fame, but Epaphras is extremely significant to Paul because in Paul's personal battle to find hope and faith, and for Paul, it was a battle. He was sometimes in despair. We heard last week, but Epaphras played a huge role in Paul's battle to see more. Here's the deal. In my personal battle to find hope and faith, I need an Epaphras to walk alongside of me. and so do you. In Colossians 4, verses 12 and 13, we read what Paul writes about what characterizes Epaphras, about how it relates to how he feels about his friends in the Colossian church. Verse 12, chapter 4. Epaphras, who is one of you, Colossians, and a servant, or read, slave of Christ Jesus, he sends his greetings. He's always wrestling in prayer for you that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured. And I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Heropolis, these two nearby towns. Now the word for wrestling says that Epaphras was wrestling in prayer. The word for wrestling is a Greek word called agonizomai. That is a fun word to say, and I am glad that I said it right right there. But it's a Greek term used to describe a wrestler or a boxer who's about to enter the ring to do battle. He's completely focused, he's anxious, his muscles are tensed, he's kind of pacing, he's ready to enter into the fray. Think Rocky right before he was about to meet Apollo Creed. Remember that? One commentator described agonizomai this way. the trembling excitement and anxiety produced by fear or tension before a wrestling match or fight, denoting not the fear that makes one shrink and flee, but the fear which makes one tremble in the face of the issue, yet allows one to remain and face it. To remain and face it. I love this definition. Because when it applies to someone who shows up for me in my personal battle for hope and faith, I know that when they're agonismying for me, that they know exactly what it is that I'm going through and the seriousness of my rebuilding of the wall and how hard it is and how laborious it is for me. They see how difficult it is. And instead of shrinking back or fleeing or giving me a cliche answer, they say to me, Steve, I will agonismy with you because I love you and because I'm a slave of Jesus with you. And when they do that for me, when they do that for you, it helps you to remain and face whatever it is that you have to face. The other night that Jesus was betrayed, remember this, we read about him up in a garden. He went off to pray before this terrible thing that he was about to endure. And when he was praying in the garden, the same word is used to describe his emotion about what he was about to do. agonizomai he was experiencing before he went to the cross in that garden that night the trembling excitement and anxiety produced by fear or tension before a fight but in that fear Jesus did not shrink back and flee he remained to face in Luke 22 44 we read about it says being in great anguish that's the word agonizomai being in great agonizomai he prayed more earnestly so earnestly in fact that His sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. Then you know that Jesus got up from that prayer, we read in a couple of verses later, and he went to his friends, the disciples who were with him, the disciples who were sleeping. But lest you think that they were sleeping because they were so lazy, it says in the scriptures they were sleeping because they were so exhausted from prayer. Read it. They were sleeping because they were agonizomying for their rabbi. because they knew how big a thing it was that he was about to face. And Jesus said, wake up, because I need to not face this alone. Have you ever agonismied for anything? For yourself or someone else? One of my friends, he's been married for about 20 years, and his wife has cancer. So they're spending a lot of time waiting in doctor's offices and waiting for treatments. And they told me that this is kind of how it works when you're taking treatments for cancer. You oftentimes take it once a week, and they schedule you on the same day of the week. So maybe your day is Fridays. And they oftentimes schedule in the same shift. It's either the morning shift or the afternoon shift. And so what happens is many people are waiting around in the waiting room week after week with the same people. So you get to know some of these people. But my friend said that on this one particular day, they overheard a conversation that blew them away. This one woman walked in, and she was wearing a wig because the treatments had taken away her hair. And this other woman goes, oh, Betty, Betty. I didn't recognize you at first because of the wig, but how are you? How's your family? How are you doing? And they said it was kind of weird because Betty, the woman with the wig, kind of, like, looked at this woman as if to say, now, do I know you? And they sat down and started talking, and then what happened was, this woman that recognized Betty said, I remember you telling me that you had been eating at one of your favorite restaurants, one of your favorite meals, but you were so sick because of the cancer treatments that you have had to do that you couldn't finish your meal. And then, so you had the guys box it up in to-go bags, but then you left the to-go bags on the restaurant table, and I remember you telling me that. And she pulls out this gift card from her purse. And my friends said that, you know, my nosy friends, I guess, said that they, they, they saw on the receipt that there was $125 on there, on this gift card. And this woman said, Betty, I couldn't stop thinking about you this week, so I went to this restaurant and I bought you a gift card because I want you to, I want you to be able to go back and enjoy this meal. Here's a woman who, you know, doesn't even really know her, but is agonizing for her, so much so that she got a gift card, put it in her purse, not knowing if she would see her again. Just in case she saw her again. She wanted her to have it. Who does that? Who does that? Epaphras does that. Epaphras enters in to the battle with you, knowing how big it is, knowing how hard it is to rebuild the wall. And Epaphras says, I don't know if we're going to end up rebuilding this wall, but I'll be in it with you. See, my personal battle to find hope and faith, I need an Epaphras to remain and face whatever it is that I have to face with me because my personal battle to find hope and faith is just that. It's a battle, and so is yours. And in a battle, you're not just facing discouragement, you're facing an enemy. now this is really interesting in this story in nehemiah of them trying to rebuild the walls this is so fascinating what ends up happening in nehemiah 4 11 right after the verse that we read earlier about the strength of the laborers giving out because the rubble was so high around them and they felt like they couldn't rebuild the wall in nehemiah 4 11 we read this also our enemies said before they know it or even see us will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to their work. See, I think when you're facing your wall and all you can see is the rubble around you and your strength is about to give out and you're super discouraged, isn't that when the enemy comes in to finish you off? In Ephesians 6, Paul writes that our personal battle, in our personal battle to find hope and faith, We don't battle against what it is that we can see and feel, even though that feels like what we're battling. Our battle, Paul writes, is against the spiritual forces of evil that are bent on confusing us and destroying our spirits. And so when we get discouraged, the enemy is right there among us. It says before we even know it or can see him, threatening to kill us and put an end to our work. And I don't want to get weird about this. Like any time that something happens to you that's hard, it's the enemy. but it is the enemy sometimes. So Nehemiah does something brilliant in the face of enemies and a lot of rubble. He does this strategic thing. He puts families together. Sword in one hand and brick in the other to keep rebuilding the wall but to fight together at the weakest parts of the wall. In Nehemiah 4, 13 and 14 we read this. Nehemiah writing, Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families with their swords and spears and bows. And I looked things over and I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, listen everybody, don't be afraid of your enemies. Remember the Lord who is great and awesome and fight for your people, your sons and daughters, your wives and your homes. Why does Nehemiah do this? Because I think that even when your strength gives out in a task like rebuilding a wall, when you are shoulder to shoulder with people that you love, you will fight for them. Even though, or even if you might not fight to rebuild a wall. So in your personal battle to find hope and faith, wouldn't it help to stand shoulder to shoulder with an Epaphras who will agonizomai for you, helping you to remain and face whatever it is that you have to face? Now some of you may be sitting there thinking, yes, it would be awesome to have an Epaphras. Can I sign up for one at Beyond Our Door? Right? I mean, you're preaching to the choir. I would love an Epaphras. I just don't have one. Well, if that's you, if that's you, I really think the heart of God, and this is demonstrated through the ministry of Jesus, is to send people out two by two. So I think if you have not asked God for an Epaphras, you need to ask him. Maybe you have been asking. I would say keep asking God to send you an Epaphras. I think God sent Paul an Epaphras, and it was actually Epaphras. I think because Epaphras was a slave of Jesus. You see, Epaphras should have been with his family in Colossae, right? He voluntarily entered into prison with Paul. I think because God sent him. So ask God to send you an Epaphras. But while you're waiting, don't forget that you actually already have an Epaphras. There is someone who intercedes for you on your behalf to the Father. There's someone who agonismizes for you, remaining with you, so that you can face whatever it is that you have to face. And that person is the Spirit of God who is in you. We read what he does in Romans 8, 25 through 27. But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. And that's sort of optimistic, I think. Sometimes we wait for it impatiently, right? In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. Helps us in our what? In our weakness. When we're at our weakest part, The Spirit says, oh, your strength is given out. The wall seems like it can't be rebuilt. All you can see is rubble. Here I come. We do not know what we ought to pray for. I love that too. Have you ever gotten to that part? I don't even know what to pray for anymore, God. I don't even know. When that's you, the Spirit Himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. that speaks to a kind of passion that the Spirit has for you. Agonizomying for you, and he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God. So if all you can see is rubble, and if you're standing with no one shoulder to shoulder, you need to know that the Spirit of the living God is agonizomying for you. For you. In your pain. And Jesus himself begins the Sermon on the Mount with these Epaphras-like words. He said, blessed are the poor in spirit. Remember that? Now to be blessed in this sense means to rejoice. Because even though no one else is for you, God is for you. Even though no one else is on your side or standing by your shoulder, God is standing shoulder to shoulder with you. he is on your side. And to be poor in spirit here means to be at the very end of your rope, to be desperate, to be needy. Tokos is the word for poor. And it's not something to aspire to. Jesus is not saying all of you should be tokos because that's how you get blessed. He's saying, listen, for those of you who are tokos, who find yourself being despised, those of you who are spiritual zeros with nothing going on for you, those of you who have made mistake after mistake after mistake, and all you can see is rubble. Think Bernie Madoff here. I'm dead serious. I'm not saying that what he did was to be blessed. What I am saying is that Bernie Madoff, his soul, according to the Holy Spirit, is still redeemable. And you better believe that the Spirit of God is agonizing for him. And if that's true about Bernie Madoff, It's true about you and I. So it's time to rejoice if you are in that place because if no one else is on your side, the gospel of God says that God is on your side. He's your Epaphras. So ask God for an Epaphras, but remember that the Spirit of God who is in you called the Perikletos, He comforts you. He advocates for you. He's your Epaphras. now reading about epaphras in this way doesn't just make me know that i need one this someone to stand shoulder to shoulder with me in my personal battle to find hope and faith it makes me want to be an epaphras for someone else so question what does it take to be an epaphras for someone else to agonism i for them to enter into their battle on their behalf so that they can remain and face it. Well, Paul writes that he heard something about the Colossians, and he knows that they learned it from Epaphras. We read this in Colossians 1 verse 4, because we have heard, Colossians, of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all of his people. If you want to be an Epaphras, I think, the first thing that you're going to desperately need is faith in Christ Jesus. And I don't mean a faith in a statement like someone that's tacked up on the basement of a church or a website. I mean faith in Jesus Christ, the one who is still at work reconciling the world to himself. The one who still is agonizing for the Bernie Madoffs of the world and for the Steve Weens of the world. Faith in Jesus who is still prompting people to love their enemies and turn the other cheek and follow in his third way so that the kingdom of God will come. Faith in Jesus, because in order to remain with someone, to agonizamai with them, who's facing a giant enemy, you're gonna need faith in something that's bigger than the enemy and faith in something that's bigger than you, bigger than your will or your generosity or your ability to be a great epaphras and to pray. You're going to need faith in something bigger than that. You need faith in Christ Jesus. Who is our Archegos, Dave said last week. It's this metaphor for, or this Greek word for when sailors were coming into port and then they couldn't get to the shore because the water was too tempestuous. And so an Archegos would tie a rope around himself and jump in and swim to the shore. And then everyone else would follow, carrying along, holding along to the rope, because the archegos would say, I have crossed the waters for you, and because I have, you can. You need to have faith in our archegos, Christ Jesus. But I think the other thing that you'd need is a love for all people. What it says right there in the text, Colossians 1, 4. How do you get that? Because like most of us would be happy for love for some of people, right? Well, here's where it gets kind of messy. So like when I'm booking a flight somewhere, whether on vacation or whatever, I'm generally looking for a nonstop flight, right? Because flying is a pain. And I hate doing layovers. I think that increases the chances of missing your flight. You know, you got to be in places that you don't want to be. Eating food you don't want to eat. being around people you don't want to be around. I hate layovers. And Steve Hansen, our global pastor, just got back from Africa. And so he listened to my talk last night and he goes, Steve, the layover thing's really working for me. I was in 36 hours of layovers a couple days ago. Here's the deal. Learning to love all people requires you to spend time on layovers. Right? You tracking? Requires you to spend time doing things that you don't want to do around people that you'd rather not be around. Eating food you'd rather not eat. Being inconvenienced. Slaves don't give a second thought to being inconvenienced. But we who, in our culture, we are taught that we are the kings. And we deserve to be served. And so we don't like being inconvenienced. But here's the deal. Submitting yourself to delays and cancellations and layovers and waiting places will teach you to learn to love people. It will. Because you will find that when you're in a waiting room with someone else, you will find that their battle is a lot like your battle. A couple nights ago, 1.30 a.m. to be exact, one of my boys woke up. Didn't want to go back to sleep. Now, this is a huge problem because I did want to go back to sleep. So I was holding this little guy, and I was praying, Lord, please help him to go back to sleep. And that's a good prayer, right? I mean, the kid needs sleep. I need sleep. And I remember he was reaching up, and he was kind of, you know, rubbing my whiskers. And what a tender moment, right? I didn't think so. I'm dead serious. I remember pulling back so he wouldn't touch my face. I know I'm terrible. I'm a terrible father. But it was 1 30 in the morning and I was thinking, man, if he he wants a moment here. Like he wants to connect. Brother, I mean, there's 12 hours of the day to connect. Well, he finally went back to sleep. So did I. But on the next day, this question occurred to me. Why was my prayer for him to get back to sleep? Now, it's pretty obvious I was tired and stuff, but why wasn't it, God, help me to engage in this moment and to endure it? Why wasn't it that? I think it's because I'm not used to being inconvenienced. I'm the king. Everyone else needs to serve me. Yeah, it's ridiculous when you say that out loud, isn't it? Isn't it? Well, I think if I'm going to learn to be a people who loves people, I'm going to need to change my prayer from, God, rescue me from this inconvenience, to, God, help me to engage in it. Help me to engage in it so that I can learn to love people like my boy. But also other people who really inconvenience me. See, I think the prayer of an Epaphras, the agonism, is not always, God, get me out of this. It's, God, help me endure this so that I can help someone else remain and face it. Now, there are those of you who know what that feels like. and if you were up here you'd say yep here's what you need to know about that though it's not going to make the staying up at 1.30 in the morning any easier it's not going to give you a free pass from the pain and the hardship of agonismying for someone else but it will give it purpose when you have to go through the inconvenience of hanging in a layover or a thing that inconveniences you agonismying is a purpose that's big enough. See, learning to love God's people, all people. It's interesting in the text it says all of God's people and all people, God's people. Being an Epaphras for someone else isn't primarily just about showing up for the big crises in life, though that is included. It's, I think, primarily about being there at the 1.30 a.m., the nitty-gritty of life. And because of that, that's true. I think this next quote is brilliant. One of my friends sent me this quote from Oswald Chambers. You ever heard of this guy? Yeah. It really resonated with me as it relates to being in Epaphras. I want to read it to you. Here's Oswald Chambers on discipleship. Discipleship is built entirely on the supernatural grace of God. And he writes, you see, walking on the water is easy to do when you're fueled by impulsive pluck, but walking on dry land as a disciple of Jesus Christ is a different thing. You see, Peter walked on the water to go to Jesus, but he also followed him afar off on a dry land. And then he writes this thing that at first makes you go, huh? He writes, we do not need the grace of God to withstand crises. Human nature and pride are sufficient for that. We can face the strain magnificently, but here's his point. But it does require the supernatural grace of God to live 24 hours as a saint, to go through drudgery as a disciple, to live an ordinary, unobserved, ignored existence as a disciple of Jesus. That is what requires the supernatural grace of God. Amen? It is in bread in us, he writes, that we have to do exceptional things for God, but we don't. We don't. We have to be exceptional in the ordinary things, to be holy in mean streets among mean people. And this is my favorite part, and this is not learned in five minutes. it's going to take some time being inconvenienced with the layovers of life see being an epaphras i think means being exceptional in ordinary things exceptional in ordinary things i would love for that to describe who i am i would love for people to talk about me that way he didn't do great things he did do little things with great love according to oswald chambers to be like that would require supernatural grace and it's not learned in five minutes but it is learned over time and i love that which means it's both supernatural something that needs to come as a gift from god but it also needs to be learned it'll take time to learn so the real question is this is anyone willing to submit to something that both requires supernatural grace, a gift from God, but also requires time to be learned, to be inconvenienced in the waiting rooms and layovers of life. And are you willing to ask God to show up in supernatural, huge ways, but also to watch for God in the inconvenient 1.30 a.m. moments that are altogether unglamorous, that no one sees, the ordinary moments of life. Are you willing, let me say it again, to ask God to show up both in the extraordinary ways, but also to watch for God in the inconvenient, 1.30 a.m. moments, which are altogether unglamorous and ordinary, so that you can learn to love people. So in your personal battle for hope and faith, and you have a battle just like I do, if you want to see more, As Dave mentioned last week, you're going to need to learn to move in both of those dynamics. The supernatural grace of God for the big things and to learn to watch for God in the ordinary things. Now as we close, here's the deal. You've just inhaled a lot. So I want to give you a minute to try something. I don't know if we've ever done before. Just about a minute or so. for you to reflect on what's the one thing that you're taking away from our time together today? What's one thing? Maybe it's gratitude for an Epaphras in your life. So you want to tell them thank you for being there for you in the ordinary moments. Maybe it's that you want to move towards someone as an Epaphras. Maybe it's a plea for help for God to send you an Epaphras. Maybe it's something else altogether, unrelated even to this talk. We're going to take about a minute just sitting in silence. You ask God what it is that your next step might be. So let's just sit in silence and ask God to show you what that is. Amen. Thank you. and now hopefully you have something either written down or in your mind if you would like to and I know some of you don't want to do this it's personal and private so you can fully take a pass on this but if it would help you let's just take a minute to tell someone sitting around you what that thing is that you need to take away. So let's just take a minute or so. And again, if you want to take a pass on this, take a pass on this. But if you'd like to, just turn to the person that's sitting close to you and tell them what that is. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, why don't we stand for the benediction? Sorry if I interrupted any of you that were sharing your thing. You can finish after we're done here. Benediction is something that God does for you. So receive this as a blessing. May God provide you with the supernatural grace that he so generously gives so that you can live 24 hours as a saint. That you can go through drudgery as a disciple to live an ordinary, unobserved, ignored existence as a disciple or slave of Jesus. May that be on you. and in you. Peace, everybody. Have a great rest of the weekend. Amen.
