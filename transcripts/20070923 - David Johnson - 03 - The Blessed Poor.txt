Let's pray as we go to the Word. Father, I thank you for the work of your Spirit already among us. And as I reflect on the Word I have for the morning, I reflect, among other things, on the fact that I've chosen these words carefully and worked hard at crafting them. But even as I say that, I just become overwhelmingly aware that if your Spirit doesn't fall and give life to this, it's just a lame talk, and we want more. And so we pray your holy spirit to be released among us To breathe life into these words to give what's what cannot be tapped by any effort of the flesh The anointing of your spirit the flow of your wine and your water and the dispersing of your bread To nourish the soul we pray these things in jesus name. Amen Last week as most of you know we took what I think amounted to as a crash course in the teaching style of Jesus, rooted in the rabbinic tradition he'd been trained in and formed by Jesus, our Redeemer, our Rabbi, was a master teacher who by use of paradox and parable, the answering of questions, not with answers but with more questions, great reversal themes and metaphors of mixture, he was particularly adept through his rabbinic style of teaching to bring people into what we referred to last week as sacred space. Remember that phrase? It's kind of new to most of us. Sacred space being that place where for whatever reason, but usually the reason was that something would disturb you, disrupt your normal train of thought, your normal way of thinking, something usually unexpected, sometimes even catastrophic, that by that kind of thing, you would be knocked off center. Such that, again, our normal way of thinking and viewing the world and all the things we think we know for sure would be disturbed. And while this disturbance, actually, in terms of how you experience it, is often an unpleasant experience. Its value is that it creates a kind of space within the mind and within the heart of the human being, wherein which authentic change, authentic transformation has the possibility to occur. Now, I gave you several examples of sacred space, some of them catastrophic, not all of them. We talked about like the first time you fall in love and you're in sacred space. And what that is is because you are no longer the center of your life. For the first time in your life, something outside of you is the center. It's her, it's him. And for a while, it doesn't last long, not even through the honeymoon, You're in this place where paradigms shift, where what you always thought begins to change. We talked also about how death can do that, of someone that we love and really are connected to and bonded to, especially if it's sudden, that change. All of a sudden, you are in this disturbed place, and all of a sudden, values are switched upside down, things you cared about yesterday. You don't care about at all, and those are places where you enter into the possibility transformative transformation of a different way of viewing the world. Sometimes those things last, sometimes they don't, but when you're in it, it's sacred space. My favorite was the Apostle Paul. I love this one, who on the road to Damascus, remember, it's just a wonderful paradigm because on the road to Damascus, whatever else he was, he was positive that he was right. He was so sure. He knew who the good guys were, who the bad guys were. He was the good guy. The people he was trying to kill with the bad guys till he got disturbed. Remember? Kind of disturbing to get whacked right off your horse. Kind of a face-to-face with God. He thought he saw. I even think the metaphor of this is interesting. He thought when he was riding his horse on the road to Damascus, he saw really clearly. And ironically, what helped him see was when he went blind. And in that place of being disturbed, where what you always thought is kind of being challenged and turned upside down, The Apostle Paul and people potentially change, are transformed. The point of all of that is this, relative to Jesus' teaching, that his rabbinic style of teaching was uniquely designed and perfectly suited to create that kind of space, that kind of disturbance. Not by simply providing answers, which is basically what we usually want, but by often doing the opposite, by raising questions, by speaking in ways and telling stories to people where the meaning of the story was hidden and you would actually have to do some work yourself by use of parable and paradox and the great reversal themes we talked about last week where Jesus intentionally reverses the order, like the song we just heard. And in the reversing of the order of things, he would by that be disturbing, disrupting, and contradicting what we called last week conventional wisdom. What most people think. In order to make people think, prime example of that, in addition to the ones I gave you last week, is the example that we're moving into these weeks in the Sermon on the Mount, which begins with these words, Matthew 5, verse 3, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. A reversal theme, beloved, if I ever heard one, because what he's saying there, among other things, is this, that life in God's kingdom is not what you think. Indeed, it will not come to and it will not flow through who you think blessed are the poor in spirit. Now, to really catch the incongruity of that statement, and it might strike you right off the bat, it might be obvious to you that that's a reversal theme, but to really dial into what a reversal theme this was, particularly to those who originally heard it, I want to kind of get into the mind and the reality of those who originally heard it, By giving you a word about the poor in Jesus' day. Before I do that, even just kind of dial into this, that this issue of the poor is a quite significant thing in Jesus' teaching. Here in Matthew 5, verse 1, as he's introducing his ministry for the first time, his inaugural address, the Sermon on the Mount, the first thing he speaks about is, among other things, the poor in spirit. In Luke chapter 6, same thing. It's a parallel of this. He doesn't talk about the poor in spirit. He talks about the poor, blessed are the poor. And later on in that same chapter, he kind of rails on the rich. What's that about? There's nothing wrong with being rich unless there's something we don't know about what's going on there. Luke 4 as well. He's in the synagogue. You know the story. We've spoken of it recently in the context of this series. The scroll is given to them. He opens to the prophets. Isaiah, and he reads this text that reveals to the people his mission and his message. And basically what he's saying is this. My message and my mission will be, among other things, good news for the first thing he says, poor. What is that about? Some history will help. In Jesus' day, most of the world lived in what was called an agrarian society. Gerhard Lensky and Ray Vanderlin are two sources I'm very indebted to for some of the research here. I've mentioned those people before. They're on the website. All the sources I'm using for this whole crazy series are on there. And those guys identify eight classes in an agrarian society. Actually, there are two groups. There is the ruling class and the peasant class, and each one of those groups have four classes. Let me kind of break it down for you so you get a picture of what's going on in Jesus' day. At the top of the ruling class was the ruler. This would be the king or the queen. This would be Herod or Caesar. This person was literally in a class by himself or herself. Normally this person amazingly had access to somewhere between 25 and 50 percent of the gross national product. A massive amount of wealth. I mean just dial into that. A massive amount of wealth in the hands of one single person. And it wasn't just that they had this massive amount of wealth. But that massive amount of wealth was provided to him. This one person on the backs of the poor. By oppressive taxation systems. There are many faces of evil. That's one. Second class of the ruling class was the governing class made up of bureaucrats, nobles, and officials surrounding and supporting the ruler. They amounted to about 1% of the population in Jesus' day and received as a group an additional 25% of the gross national product. So between this group, 1%, and the king or queen, whoever they might be, they owned at least half of and maybe three-quarters of all the goods and services in the society. Third group's an interesting group. A little more people in this group was known as the retainer class. Interesting. I want you to think about that word retaining. To retain something. There's meaning there because it was their job to retain the system. To conserve the system the way it was. And they were very motivated to do that because they motivated. They benefited by this oppressive backwards system that made, you know, five people really rich and everybody else desperately poor. They were lower class bureaucrats, this group. They usually had some degree of education. They were the soldiers and the secretaries, but they were also the scribes and the teachers of the law, the Pharisees. They were in this group as well, and they comprised about 5% of the population. Their place and their energy, you know, their energy was to serve the political elite. And because they wanted to maintain their jobs and their status, they were highly motivated and highly devoted to the system that provided for them their money and their power and their status. So they stood up for and they defended the ruler and the one percent who had all the money and all the power, and their energy, again, was to conserve that system. Now, let me give you a little sidebar here. It's very interesting because the scribes and Pharisees who were in this particular category, and very wealthy themselves, many of them, Sadducees even more wealthy, because they benefited from the system, and they benefited particularly from the temple system, as you know, were always in conflict with Jesus. Sometimes the reason we think it was was because it was, you know, they had some theological differences, and they surely did, but it was more than that. Let me explain. Part of the reason the scribes and Pharisees were always in conflict with Jesus was because Jesus' message and mission had reversed the order of things. He was constantly doing that, and the reversing of the order of things was an obvious threat to their power and position, their economic power and their political power. Let me explain it this way. As most of you know, because we've talked about this before, the scribes and the Pharisees had devised a very complex system of laws within the context of their religious expression. You can see some of them in Leviticus and all through Numbers, which only their expertise would allow someone to wade through. So the system was such that if you were going to express your devotion to God and come to the temple and do the things you needed to do there to kind of get to God, you needed these scribes and Pharisees because they knew the rules and they knew the hoops you needed to jump through and they were considerable. And they would indeed help you jump through the hoops and do the things religiously that you needed to do to get to God for a very substantial fee, by the way. It was all part of the temple system, a system that we've talked about in the past and I'm not going to go into in great detail, only to say this, in Jesus' day, the temple system, extremely corrupt. Within, in addition to the taxation system from Rome, that was very oppressive, from Herod, that was very oppressive, there was the temple tax, again, which just sucked the economic life out of the vast majority of people in Jesus' day. Indeed, in Matthew 23, Jesus confronts the rulers of the temple system, this particular class of people saying this, and this was the confrontation, the problem with you guys is this. Instead of using your power and authority, by the way, nothing wrong with having power and authority, but they were using their power and authority to, instead of giving people access to gods, they were using their power and authority to keep people from God. The way Jesus said it is this. You use your power and authority to shut off the kingdom from people who are actually trying to enter. And the way it would actually play out would be this. People would come to the temple the way you might come to a church in our day. And one of the expectations you would have would be this. Even though you may not understand the liturgy or whatever else these people are doing, you're expecting that this group and these songs and the words they hear today are gonna give me a glimpse of God. They're gonna give me some sort of access to God. People would come to the temple that same way. But when they came to the temple in Jesus' day, they would have all of that access to God shut off from them. Literally, it would be slamming, it would be like a door slamming in their face. And the way the scribes and Pharisees did that was by making access to God and forgiveness of sin so elaborate and so confusing and, quite frankly, so expensive. Well, if you're going to do the sacrifice, you're going to have to pay this for the sacrifice, but that's the one God wants. You better pay that much, on and on and on and on, that an awful lot of people couldn't do it. In fact, you know, there's so many rules. Oh, I stepped wrong. I got to start from scratch. There were so many things you had to go through, and it was so expensive, many people couldn't even do it at all. So imagine, with that backdrop, the scandal. When this rabbi named Jesus, I love this, goes out to be baptized by a hermit in the desert named John. John, wear a long cloth, no robes, no, you know, Jesus says you broaden your phylacteries and your tassels just to look even more spiritual. Guy didn't have a phylactery, didn't have a tassel, didn't have any robes, didn't have any incense, no candles, no nothing. And Jesus goes out to this guy to be baptized saying essentially this, I got a new word for you. We're reversing the order because forgiveness is as accessible and free as water in that river. Come on in boys, the water's fine. Amen. Amen. Jesus, Jesus was making God accessible in a variety of ways. He ignored the dead codes. He ignored the purity codes. He walked up to lepers. We've done not teaching on this before, but lepers who in Jesus' day, if they even were healed in some way, in order to be allowed back into a polite society, had to go to the preach, the Levites, the scribes, and the Pharisees, and go through an elaborate system of things they had to do, and very expensive as well, in order to be declared clean. And finally, okay, you did okay, okay, you were clean. Now we'll actually, you know, talk to you. Jesus, you know what he did. He walked right up to these guys before they were clean, and he made him clean. And then he said, oh, by the way, you're clean. Oh, by the way, forgiven too. Here's the deal. If Jesus really has authority, given the history I've just given you, to do that, to forgive sin without the temple system, then you don't need the temple system. And if you don't need the temple system, the scribes and the Pharisees are out of a what? Job. Listen. the scribes and the Pharisees hated Jesus but it wasn't just because he walked around saying I'm God one of the things they're going to accuse him of is blasphemy but quite frankly I think one of the reasons they did that was because they knew that one would stick let me tell you why they hated him in addition to the blasphemy they hated him because the kingdom of God wherever it manifests will confront and seek to subvert every other kingdom economic, that's why they hated him Political, personal, religious, every other kingdom's coming down. They hated him. And it was more about money than their theological differences. I've said this before, but lots of people still have this picture of Jesus as a kind of docile, inoffensive guru who just kind of went around inviting little children to sit on his lap and holding cute little lambs encouraging people to just be nice. Problem with that. Problem with that is people don't generally get crucified for that. For bland, innocuous moralizing. Why don't you just be nice? They don't get crucified. For that, they get ignored. But people get crucified when powerful kingdoms are threatened, be they economic, political, religious, or personal. And powerful kingdoms are threatened when you reverse the order of things. Fourth class in the ruling class was the merchant class. Think merchandise. In Jesus' day, this is a very, very small group. It wasn't even until the 13th century that the merchant class began to grow based on the producing and selling of consumer goods. That's the huge class in our day. So I'm not going to say much more about that. Now, those four groups in Jesus' day made up the peasant, or they made up the ruling class, where 20% of the population had 80% of the wealth. The peasant class had four classes or categories as well, comprising 80% of the population holding 20% of the wealth. So you have this significant group, this very small group holding most of the money, very rich, and a very large group who were very poor. In fact, the phenomenon of the middle class that we enjoy ourselves is a relatively new phenomenon historically. But even in our day, when the alarm bells go off, when the middle class is shrinking, because most everybody recognizes when you have a very few, very wealthy, and everybody else very poor, that is a powder keg of, well, it's unjust. God hates it. But it was exactly what was going on in Jesus. the first group of the peasant class were the tenant farmers who didn't own land but they worked the land they could lose their place on the land on the whim of the ruling class the owner of the land that's why many parables of Jesus have to do with landowners and tenant farmers two thirds of what the tenant farmers produced were taken away in taxes be it temple tax the Herod tax the tax to Rome but bottom line is they were taxed to support the ruling class which would have again included the temple system. Imagine just for a minute being a peasant and trying to survive in a season of drought. It'd be tough any day, but in a season of drought, which undoubtedly happened then, having to give two-thirds of your money to the ruling class, you still had to save enough of what you produced to grain, relative to grain, in order to plant for the next year. And so after all of that, you had to learn how to live on the rest, which is pretty much how the working poor have lived from the beginning of time and in some parts of the world even today still do live that very way. Second group in the peasants class were the artisans. These were skilled workers, people who are good with their hands. Carpenters would have been in this group and maybe a bell goes off. I do think that this was probably the category, the level of life that Jesus lived in. His father, Joseph, being a carpenter. Jesus having, I'm sure, some skill in that arena as well. Keith even this summer talked about that in some fascinating ways. Third group of the peasant class, however, was the group referred to as simply this unclean. Who by origin or occupation were just that. They were unclean. They were the Amha'orats. Remember them? We've spoken of them before. It literally means the people of the land. They were the outsiders outside the system, regarded by the religious elite in particular as ignorance, backwards, even disgusting. They didn't know the Torah. They didn't observe the purity codes, the rituals for purification. Rabbis in Jesus, they actually had a saying related to them that there are six things that are a disgrace for a rabbinic student. Among them was this, to recline at table with one of these unclean. Interesting. I know you're connecting the dots because it's something that Jesus did on a fairly regular basis. He eats with sinners was the accusation. And that was a specific, that was this category of people. He eats with unclean sinners and prostitutes. And the fact that he did that served as proof, at least to some, that he couldn't be trusted and he shouldn't be followed. But here's the deal. Again, you get these people who are in a really small group and have all the power and money, and they're trying to keep control of the 80%. But the 80% are hearing Jesus and seeing Jesus, and they did trust him. He shouldn't be trusted. He shouldn't be followed. And the 80% and going, I trust him, and I'm going to follow him. And part of the reason they did was because he was reversing the order of things, where the low would be lifted and the mighty would be brought down. The first would be last. What? And the last would be first. Huh? It sounds so weird. But Jesus did this, not accidentally, but on purpose. not once in a while but day after day because Jesus was among other things a prophet and prophets don't always speak to make their points sometimes they engaged in symbolic actions that often spoke more powerfully than their words so when Jesus sat at the table with this group of peasants the unclean it was a real life parable he was making a statement about the kingdom of God and who's invited to the table and sometimes he would not just make gestures that were statements. He would actually add words to his gestures from time to time when he would say things like he said in Matthew 9, which is one of my favorite verses relative to this. Listen, you guys. Many will come from the east and the west and sit at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But the sons of the kingdom who think they belong at the table, some of them will be cast into our darkness. What's that about? It's about reversing the order. And it confused, disturbs. What? What? It disturbs the people from the east and the west, the unclean in particular, and it disturbs those who think they're at the table already, and he's saying, maybe you're not. He was reversing the order of things. And this reversal was, among other things, good news for the poor, for the captive, for the blind and the naked, for those who are far off, who have no hope. Which brings me to the last group in the peasant class, the totally expendable, who made up about 10% of this 80% class. These people were not only unemployed, they were unemployable. To survive, they often had to lie and steal and cheat. They were criminals. If they weren't criminals, they were beggars. Not wanting to cross that line into criminality in order to survive, they would just beg. living off the charity of others, often eating out in existence by scavenging through a garbage dump to take the crumbs that fell from the table. The word for this category of poverty in the Greek is a bit strange. It's ptokos, pt, pt, ptokoi is another form of it. Ptokoi, ptokos. All of that in your mind. Just kind of can't figure it all out. Just kind of let it mull around. Let me bring you back to the text. but this time let me set the text in its context. Beginning in Matthew 4 verse 12 it says that when he, Jesus, heard that John the Baptist had been taken into custody, John's being taken into custody, I want you to see it this way, was in effect the divine starter gun of history so that from that moment on Jesus began in verse 17 to preach and say repent, change your mind, turn around, I'm reversing things here for the rule and reign of God. The kingdom of God is within your reach. And walking by the sea, verse 18, he saw two brothers, Peter and Andrew, fishing. And later in verse 21, he saw James and John fishing with their father. And he said to all of them at one time or another what the rabbis say. Remember that phrase, lehachorai, come, come, come, follow me. And immediately they left their nets to follow this rabbi named Jesus. full of authority and mystery and what's he saying? Jesus in verse 23 was going about in all of Galilee proclaiming the availability the availability of God's kingdom and just again dial into the culture what he's saying it's so subversive oh you guys it's as free as river water but you gotta bring your repentance bring your repentance strap that on but it's as free as river water he was proclaiming the availability of God's kingdom and demonstrating in a variety of ways the power of God's kingdom so that news about him spread, verse 24. Multitudes began to follow, verse 25. And when he saw the multitudes, chapter 5, verse 1, and now we're into the Sermon on the Mount. Went up on the mountain and after he sat down, his disciples came to him and opening his mouth, began to teach them saying, fundamentally this, I got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is this, all this stuff that I've been demonstrating to you with manifestations of power and proclaiming to you about the availability of God's kingdom right here and right now is real and true, and it is available to you. I see him looking them right in the eye. This kingdom is available to you goofballs, you fishermen, you people who think you are of no account. This kingdom, life, and power is available to you right here and right now. But there's some bad news in this as well. It's this, that none of this authority and power and life is going to come to who you think. It's not going to flow through who you think, because I'm reversing the order. Blessed are the poor. In spirit, theirs alone is the kingdom of heaven. And guess which word he used for the poor there? He used the word that describes the bottom group in the peasant class. he used the word that describes the totally expendable the ones who were unemployed and unemployable beggars ptokas blessed are the beggars how would you respond? I mean you might have a weird response even now given our culture but forget about ours if you're a first century Jew blessed are the ptokas I suppose it depends on a number of things how you would respond if you were rich, part of the ruling class. I mean, maybe hearing those words would kind of relieve you because it would be the evidence you needed to finally go, I was interested for a while, but this guy's a nut. This would give you the excuse you needed to just write him off. He's a lunatic. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Blessed are the, blessed are the, what a joke. But if you're poor and you heard those words, it might make you wonder. and then it might make you sing. Like Mary sang in Luke 1, 46 when she sang these words, the Magnificat, my soul, this is such good news, my soul doth magnify the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior. Why? Because God has regard for the humble and nobody else does. Just nobody else does and he scatters the poor. He's reversing the order is basically what Mary is rejoicing about in The Magnificat. See, this message of Jesus, in the words of Dallas Willard in his book Divine Conspiracy, was good news to the seriously crushed ones, to the broke and the broken. It was good news to the drug heads and the divorced, to the HIV positive and the herpes ridden. It was good news to the brain damaged and the incurably ill, to the barren and to the pregnant too many times or at the wrong time. It was good news for the lonely, for the incompetent, for the stupid. It was good news for the emotionally starved and the emotionally dead. Oh, magnify the Lord with me for God has regard for the humble state of his bond slave. He scatters those who are proud in the thoughts of their hearts. He brings down rulers from their throne and he exalts the humble. He's reversing the order. Blessed are the poor in spirit. Oh. So if you were rich, you might respond a certain way to these words. And if you were poor, you might respond a different way to these words. And if you were knowledgeable, and there would be many people like this in the crowd. He's speaking here to the disciples, and it looks like that's just it. But at the end of the Sermon on the Mount, it says the multitude. So people picture people kind of just kind of coming around. And by the time he's done, a crowd is gathered. And someone in the crowd, people there, you know, they knew the Torah. They knew the word of God. So if you were knowledgeable and you were hearing these words, you were just sitting in the crowd, you could see some solitary figure there. You might recognize as you hear these words, this guy speaks with the voice of the prophets. You might recognize that what Jesus is saying in the Beatitudes is not a new thing, it's an old thing. He's saying what Isaiah and Jeremiah have said, calling down judgment on the people of God for their treatment of the poor. If you were knowledgeable, you'd know that what he's saying is the heart of God for the least and the lost. And you might even begin to wonder, is this Elijah? Is this John the Baptist come back from the dead? This guy speaks like the prophets. I wonder if he's the one. Messiah, the new Moses, Redeemer. So if you were rich, you might respond one way, if poor another, if knowledgeable another. But if you were wise, you might take a step back from this whole scene and recognize with sobering, even frightening clarity that regardless of what category you were in, rich or poor, we're all poor. I'm poor. From the wealthiest king to the most hopeless pauper, We're all tokas before holy gods. Blessed, hear the beatitude now, blessed are those who recognize that very thing, that their physical, spiritual, economic wealth, it's not just economic, their physical capacity to produce, regardless of how great it is, is insufficient. Because at the end of the day, blessed are those who recognize, I can't save myself. Two really important words. I need. I don't care how capable you are, how rich you are in, again, physical, emotional, intellectual, economic capacity. At the end of the day, I desperately need a redeemer, a saver. And I can't sanctify myself. I can't purify myself. And if you were Jewish, you might say, I tell you, if I have one more ceremonial washing, I'm just going to become pickled. I'm just all wrinkly from all the water. But if I'm honest with my heart, I'm still not clean. I'm still not clean. And I need the most competent religious person, blessed as that person who recognizes, I need a purifier, a sanctifier, and just think of all these Jews doing all their Jewish stuff and desiring even to please God and serve God. At the end of the day, they recognize that all their service, all their service and all their doing for God just didn't accomplish much. And you come up thirsty out of that kind of poverty, hungry, really hungry for an empowerer. When you find yourself saying things like this, oh God, for me to enter this kind of life, to live in it, to become who you designed me to be in it, I desperately need your life, your power, your grace. And if you're there, hear this word, from the Father, blessed are you. For yours is the kingdom of heaven. By the way, just get this as I wrap this up. This poverty of spirit does not give birth to more poverty. Like people who are poor in spirit, this desperate place of recognizing they need, that does not give birth in their life to, oh yeah, I'm just poor in spirit. What was me? Oh, so gross. No, no, no. That's just poor. Truth is, people who come rich or poor, and this is where this beatitude encompasses everyone, from the most noble and the highest of all society to the bottom, all of them, when they see the reality, they come as desperately needy for a God who can empower and save and purify. But that kind of poverty gives birth not to more poverty, but it gives birth to a robust spirit and a robust faith and robust life. You see, it's again a reversal of the order of things where the last, poor in spirit, I just can't do it without you, God, shall be first. And he who descended also ascended, and the ascent comes after you descend. So how do you respond? let me just pray Holy Spirit come Holy Spirit come Lord in my mind even last night I felt a confusion in terms of this and just a trust that you would sort this out because it occurs to me that some in hearing this if they respond to you the appropriate response would be to scream at the top of their lungs God be merciful to me in fact in the spirit of that we're going to ask the prayer team to come and whoever's here from the prayer team to make yourself available after service if anyone needs prayer you come you come for prayer what occurs to me another response would be the response of Mary because some of you have heard good news today and your spirit is crying with Mary, oh, magnify the Lord. For you give grace to the humble. Which means there's hope for you. You lift up the lowly, the stumbling and the bumbling, and those who've lost their way. Oh, magnify the Lord. Holy Spirit, preside over this time. Would you stand with me? would you just listen to the spirit would you just listen to what he's saying to you Holy Spirit come Holy Spirit come enter in enter in to whatever he's saying to the confrontation of this word that you'd receive it to the encouragement of this word that you'd let it that you'd drink it in that you'd drink it deep So you're talking. Lord, exalt His name and sing with me. Magnify the Lord. Exalt His name, the King of kings. Magnify the Lord Exalt his name and sing with me Magnify the Lord Exalt his name, the King of kings Magnify the Lord Exalt his name and sing with me Magnify the Lord Exalt his name, the king of kings Oh, magnify the Lord Exalt his name and sing with me Magnify the Lord Exalt his name, the king of kings Magnify the Lord Exalt his name, sing with me Now you're far from home It's all to say Amen Amen Prayer team, would you come? Just come right now from where you are We're going to dismiss, but church ain't over The Spirit of God continues to move and speak and woo and confront and call to life your people. We pray these things in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, Amen.
