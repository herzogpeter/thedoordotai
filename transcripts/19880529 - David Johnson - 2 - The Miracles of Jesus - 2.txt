We're dealing these weeks, as I think you know, with the healing ministry of Christ. That begins in chapter 8 and it goes through chapter 9. The Sermon on the Mount has been completed in the end of chapter 7. He came down from the mountain, as it is recorded in chapter 8, verse 1, and he healed the man afflicted with leprosy. And then after that he went into Capernaum, and that is where we pick up the study in verse 5. And when he had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, entreating him. And he was saying this, Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering great pain. And he, that's Jesus, said to him, I will come and heal him. But the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy for you to come under my roof, but just say the word, you just say the word, and my servant will be healed. I believe that. For I, too, am a man under authority with soldiers under me. And I say to this one, go, and he goes. and to another I say, come, and he comes, and to my slave, do this, and he does it. That's why I believe that if you just say the word, he'll be healed. Now, when Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who were following, truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel. And I say to you that many will come from the east and from the west, and they will be the ones who recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness. In that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way and let it be done to you as you have believed. And the servant was healed that very hour. And when Jesus had come to Peter's home, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever, and he touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and gave him dinner. Let's pray. Father God, I am thankful that the thing that really happens that changes lives and moves us deeper and deeper into kingdom reality is not just being talked into it with a good sermon or having something explained the best they've ever heard but it is the dynamic of the Holy Spirit of God that moves among us and changes men's hearts and gives blind people their vision and gives people with hard hearts a soft heart and breaks the ground that is hard And I pray in the name of Jesus, your spirit to be released with power among us. To teach us truths and insights into kingdom living and ministry that change us forever. That keep us, on the other hand, on the right path of kingdom stuff and not just church stuff. And I pray your supernatural anointing upon me. I pray for physical strength as well. This morning, I pray it in the name of Jesus, the strong name of Jesus. Amen. As I indicated last week, when we come into a section, one of the things we need to do is lay a foundation of teaching so that we understand what is going on. I think you're aware of the fact, if you were with us last week, that there are nine miracles in this section. The miracles that were being delivered by Matthew, however, were not just random and chosen without any purpose or design. The way I described it to you last week was this. There are three sections of three miracles each. The first three miracles deal with physical areas, and there is a message that we need to understand in that, and that is that God deals with the physical. The second section of miracles had to do with the spiritual realm, and the message of that was that God deals and moves in not only physical things, but spiritual things. He has authority on this earth to forgive sin. He has authority on this earth to come against the work of the enemy and cast out demons in people's lives, with a word, to bind the enemy. And finally, the third section of miracles, the last three miracles, deal with the ultimate enemy of men's souls, and that is death, physical death, but the picture is eternal death. God has authority on this earth to deal with physical things. He has authority on this earth to deal with spiritual things, demonic forgiveness. He has also authority on this earth to deal with eternal things, giving life to the redeemed forever. Those were the messages of the miracles, and that was one of the things we had to tie into right from the beginning. These are not miracles just kind of randomly chosen to prove to us that Jesus did miracles. The miracles, each one of them has a design and has a message. They are communicating things to us about the kingdom of God, what it's really about, what its purpose is, what it looks like, how you can spot it, where it moves. And in that whole thing, too, is a model for ministry that I think we need to catch, too, as well. There are things I'm going to elucidate today that will help us know whether or not we really are doing the kingdom stuff or whether we're just being this nice little church that looks real good. The thing I want you to remember is that there are messages in these miracles. One of the messages in the miracles, in every one of them, is this. Jesus Christ has authority on this earth to do the work of the kingdom. And it is supernatural, physically, spiritually, eternally. That was one of the messages. Another message we talked about that was affirmed from the Sermon on the Mount, and now as he begins to flesh out his ministry, is this. Just like the Beatitudes, when he said this, the ones who are going to come into my kingdom are not the pious and the pretentious and the self-righteous. The ones who are going to come into my kingdom are going to be exactly opposite what you think. They're going to be the broken, the mourning, and the hungry. Just like those being the ones who come into my kingdom, the ones who are going to experience the power of my kingdom are the broken, the mourning, and the hungry as well. we noted that it was very significant that the first miracles of Jesus were being brought to and demonstrated to a leper, first of all. Unclean and outcast. Nobody wanted to be around him. The second miracle was to a centurion who was a Gentile. No God-fearing person would ever have anything to do with a Gentile. And the third miracle of God, the power of the kingdom of God, was demonstrated on a woman of all people. And in that culture, it was worse than it is today. Women were non-entities. Yes, it could be worse than it is today, women. So, it used to be worse. But the message, the theme that comes from the miracles, it is not by accident that he healed the leper first. There is a message there. I care about that. That's where my kingdom is. And anything that claims to have me on their side is going to have to be demonstrating a ministry with those kinds of people, because that's where my kingdom is. Another message that we are needing to look for in all of these miracles is this. Through every one of them, he has a message. This is it. I bless faith wherever I find it. I bless faith wherever I find it. We need to know that the kingdom of God is an equal opportunity employer, okay? It doesn't matter about the color of the skin. It doesn't matter about whether you're black or white or yellow or green. I don't care about that. It's not about rich or poor. It's not about religious or not. It's not about culture or not. It's about brokenness, hunger, mourning, getting out here, what is in here. It's about real inside stuff. That, wherever I find that, I bless it. If it looks good, but there's faith, I bless it. If it looks lousy, but there's faith, I bless it. But then the other message we've been looking for in all of these is this. I bless faith wherever I find it, but the other thing is this. I find it in the strangest places. And that is a kingdom truth we can never forget. You see, I looked for it in Israel, he says in verse 10. But I didn't find it in Israel. You'd think you'd find it in Israel, where all the God talk is, and where all the God monuments are, and all the work of God is, and the people who call themselves the people of God are. But I didn't find it there. I kept finding kingdom faith among lepers. And I kept finding kingdom faith among Gentiles, and among women, and among the people that religious people wouldn't even have dinner with. That is a kingdom truth. and with that foundation laid we began to look at the miracles and the first one was the leper the leper was indeed a social outcast not only was he socially outcast he was physically disgusting nobody wanted to look at him but on top of all of that not only was he physically disgusting to look at and socially an outcast he was spiritually deemed by the people of that day as being unclean He was physically the embodiment of sin. So that when people looked at this leper, they not only saw a disgusting-looking person to them physically, but they saw someone they had permission to hate. He is a disgusting person. He just doesn't have a disgusting disease. The parallel I gave you last week was that of AIDS. It was the same kind of thing, the same revulsion we would have to someone who would come here with AIDS or something like that. We would go, behold, holy cats, a leper came. Holy cats, someone with AIDS came. but he did come and this leper who nobody wanted to have anything to do with came in a way that demonstrated kingdom because he came number one desperately I don't care what people think I don't care what they say I don't care what they do to me anymore I need to know the king I need to know the king and it doesn't matter what they think anymore and we applied that to people who are coming for redemption and we applied that to people who are coming for sanctification, and we applied that to people who are coming wanting to serve God. You are going to have to somewhere along the line, if you're deciding to serve God in the kingdom, not just in the church, all you got to do to serve in the church is sign up. If you want to serve God in the kingdom and in the power of the kingdom, you are going to have to come to him absolutely desperate. God, if you don't work, if you don't move, I don't have anything to give. And I don't care what people think. I don't care what they say. I don't care what they do. I am going to do in the power of the Spirit, what you've called me to do. Not only did he come desperately, he came reverently. Praskuneo. He bowed down to him in verse 2. A contrast I never want you to forget was the one we played in last week that came right out of this text. All through the Sermon on the Mount, I was telling you about the Pharisees that were described by Jesus in Matthew 23, 23, as those who polished the outside of the cup and of the bowl, and they looked so good, and they would fit in most every evangelical church you know, even ours, and they look great. They know the words, they know the code, but on the inside, they're vile, wretched, and decaying. And the irony of this leper was him coming to Jesus. On the outside, he looked outside, vile, wretched, and decaying, but he bowed down to Jesus and asked him for his grace. And on the inside, he was real, and there was life, and there was faith. And Jesus says, this is what my kingdom looks like. It doesn't look the way you thought. It's not spit shine. It isn't always click. Click. It doesn't always click. Hurry up. Hurry up. Catch up. My mind has got to get going here. He came humbly. He didn't come demanding. He says, if you will, heal me. But he came faithfully believing, I know you can. The message of that leper to us was that people who come that way get a touch from God. They receive the power of God. They get cleansed, they get redeemed. But you know what? The message of the whole Sermon on the Mount is this. They are the only ones. They are the only ones who get cleansed, who get healed, who get redeemed, who receive the power of God. It's not the way we think. See, we go to seminary. I'm so glad the schools are back because I got you kids again. We go to seminary and we figure out how to do it and do it slick and do it right. I'm going to tell you something. Do that. Fine. But do it. If you don't do it in the power of God, desperately coming to God, humbly asking for his work, proscuneo on your face before him, you've got nothing to give, and it might even look slick. Jesus, to people who come desperately, humbly, reverently, believing God for a miracle, says to them, you want me to cleanse you? I will. I will. And he did, and he still does. Good message. I think I'll preach it over again. I just about did, didn't I? The centurion today. Let's take a look at him. I want to break it down into four parts. First of all, I want to introduce you to him. An introduction. Second of all, I want to expose you to some new insights. Third, we're going to hear an old confrontation. And fourth, we're going to see a demonstration of power in the centurion. Number one, an introduction. Like the leper, he was despised and cut off by the religious self-righteous people. Why? Give me three reasons. Number one, he was a Roman soldier. That was reason enough. these people had Israel under their thumb, so they despised Roman soldiers. Number two, he was a Gentile, which meant this. He is unclean and he is godless. He is a pagan. Do not have anything to do with him, strike two. Not only that, he was a Samaritan. How do you know he's a Samaritan? Let me give you some teaching here. According to Josephus, the historian of that time, the Roman occupation army was a massive group. There was no way in the world that they were going to get all of their soldiers from Rome. So one of the things that they began to do was from neighboring countries that they had occupied, they would go to those neighboring countries and begin to draft and recruit soldiers. Antipas records that in Capernaum, the army there was under the leadership of Antipas, and almost all of his recruiting was done in the neighboring province, and guess what it was called? Samaria. There is very, very good evidence that this centurion was indeed a Samaritan. So let me give you the picture here, though, as far as the confrontation on these religious Jews. What we've got is, number one, a Gentile. That's bad enough. In fact, let me give you a little picture here. The rabbis in Sunday school used to teach the little kids, you know, these Gentiles, you know what they do? They abort their babies and they throw them in the garbage can. And the way we're going to deal with Gentiles and the way we're going to stay holy and stay pure in God's people is we're going to stay away from them because they're vile and they're evil and they're bad. You ever hear that in Sunday school? You stay away from the world because they're vile and they're evil and whoa. Let me tell you something about religious people who do not have the internal power of God at work in them. They better stay away from evil. You know why? Because if all you've got is an external show of piety, you have no power of God. And if externally motivated, pious people with no internal reality touch what is unclean, you know what happens? They get dirty. contrast that with the touch of jesus who was indeed internally really holy when he touched uncleanness what happened the uncleanness got clean that got perverted with holiness and healing and power not only was a gentile he was the worst kind of gentile a samaritan how many was a half breed what i mean by that is this a samaritan was someone who years previously had intermarried a jew who had intermarried with gentiles so they weren't just any ordinary gentile they were samaritan but not only that he was a samaritan gentile who was a ranking officer in the occupation army of israel that had israel under its thumb and i got news for you any god fearing, self-respecting, church-going Pharisee would have nothing to do with him. And they would do it in the name of God. The sign of our witness, beloved, is that we stay away from the rabble. We show how spiritual we are by how few relationships we have with lepers and centurions and women who are underneath everything. We don't go there. Aren't we something in our wonderful nice robes? Church, God, great, glorious, and God goes, he doesn't like it. You knew what I was going to do, didn't you? We've gotten that mentality from time to time as a church. We almost begin to really believe that our spirituality is demonstrated by the people we don't like. That's how spiritual. I have so much insight. I despise that person. Let me add to the rub that this centurion was to the mind of a religious Jew. So, have you ever noticed in Scripture, have you ever noticed in Scripture that every centurion in the New Testament ended up being a good guy? You ever noticed that? We had three examples. There's Cornelius, there's this guy here, and there's John Wayne at the cross. Remember him? Surely he is the son of God. Whatever. Why do you think that was? Why do you think the three centurions in the Bible were put in a good light? Well, maybe it was because they really were good guys. If you believe that, I've got a swamp I'd like to sell you. The centurions were evil people. There is a design. Why? In the Word of God, the centurions were always in a good light. One of the reasons was this. It is a revelation. What is the revelation of? The kind of people who come in the kingdom. They are not always the churchy ones. They are the ones who've got a hungry heart, who are broken and mourning and realize the direction they are going is wrong. It is also a confrontation on the religious, self-righteous, looking good Jew who couldn't in their wildest dreams imagine that a leper or a Samaritan, a Roman soldier, could possibly be part of God's army. We've heard this message for over a year in Matthew, from the beginning of Matthew, that he's turning the whole identity, and the whole definition of what spiritual life is really all about, upside down. He has come into this culture, and this word has come to our culture and our church, and said to them and said to us, the people you always used to think were spiritual may be the least spiritual you know, and the people you've always seen as struggling and bumbling, but they love Jesus, may be the ones who are really in the kingdom and experiencing the power. Take a look at it. It's the broken, the mourning, the lepers, the Samaritans, who not only come into the kingdom, but they see the power of the kingdom, and nobody else. but the desperate. Now, Pharisees can come in and religious people can come in just like rich people can come in. But I'll tell you something, it's harder for a camel to get to an eye of a needle than for a rich person. You know why? Because they're not desperate. And neither are religious people because they are so self-satisfied with how they look and what they know and all they do. And it keeps going to the lepers. What a picture. I love it. one of the things i reflected on last week and i want to bring it up again because i think it's so important we talked last week when we were dealing with the leper and now the samaritan what are the marks of an effective church how can you tell and the things that immediately come to my mind may be the same things that come to your mind well if you were doing a church growth paper people or if you were reading a book on church quote. The marks are a slick program. You can tell that's one of the marks. Big bucks, nice building, everything's in order, the music is professional, a mentality that says this, hey folks, I'm going to tell you something, the world does it well. Why shouldn't we do it well in the name of Jesus? Hey, that makes sense to me. How about you? This is not an apologetic to do things sloppy, okay? But I want to tell you something. The mark of an effective church, the way we're going to be able to tell that we are doing kingdom stuff and not just church stuff is how many lepers are there, how many Samaritans are there, how many people are here who don't look like church people. Because there's the kingdom. Desperate, mourning, hungry people. Proscuneo, bowing down before their king. Not wrapped up in all the peripheral. if a church is a kingdom church what is happening in that church will be easy to spot the way you'll be able to spot it is everybody will be happy well if that's true then Jesus had a messed up ministry because everybody around him wasn't happy a kingdom ministry is a ministry where lepers are coming Samaritans are believing and Pharisees are despising every minute of it. We talk about Christ-likeness a lot. Maybe not enough. What it means to be like Christ. Be like Jesus is my song, in my day and in the throng, on and on. And what we mean by that is being nice generally and being good, and that's good. I hope what we mean is understanding that the Spirit of God in us is moving through us to produce real holiness and virtue and morality and ethics and godliness. But what does it look like to be a Christ-like church, a Christ-like ministry? It's nice, and it's good, and everybody's happy. No, it's a ministry where lepers are healed and Pharisees are confronted. That's what a Christ-like ministry looks like. external, fleshy, churchy things are confronted and resisted, and lepers are received and healed. I talk to pastors a lot. In fact, I believe more and more. One of the ministries God is moving me into and calling me to is to minister to and with pastors, other pastors. And the ones I talk to who come to me are the ones who are real tired and beat up. And one of the things that I hear from them, as I share with them the ministry God has given us, is this. The reason I get beat up and I'm dying is that somewhere along the line, I got this message that in the church, what I was supposed to do was appease and try to make happy all the Pharisees in my church, and make them quiet and get them to like me and all this kind of thing. And the thing I noticed was this. Number one, it wore me out. Number two, because they really don't care about God. It's just all this stuff that externally matters to them. It's not about the God thing. but number two I never got to lepers I never got to the lepers and when I hear that I just begin to think of the experience I've had in the church and what I see in the church so often are churches that are just filled with people look just right where are the lepers I want to know my fear is that one of the things that's infected us as a church not just us specifically but the church in general and I care about it is that in many ways instead of confronting Pharisees and ministering to lepers we confront lepers and minister to Pharisees and that's wrong the result is that the people who really are ready for the kingdom life and power never ever get it because we never get to it because we're always trying to appease the religiously external self-righteous Pharisee that's the introduction to this guy now some new insights point two a couple of things here out of the text that I want you to see that are really are parallel to the leper this guy really was a great pagan in verse 6, it says, Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home. Just a thing I want you to note. My servant. The request he's bringing isn't even for himself, it's for his servant. There's something I even want to tell you about the servant. The word there, servant, is the word pise. In the Greek, it means child. So what he's got here is a child slave. You need to know just a little bit about slaves in that day. Slaves in that day were nothing more than property. It would be like a tool. That's what they were considered. Tools, like a hammer. If you've got a hammer that works, you keep it. If you got a hammer that breaks, what do you do? You throw it away. Same thing with slaves. This guy had a heart for this guy. That reveals something to us about his heart. But I think the picture's still exciting. So what you've got here is someone coming to Jesus, a Samaritan that nobody cared about, on the behalf of somebody that nobody cared about. The whole thing is about people that are despised by religious people. The other thing I want you to note about him, just like the leper, he came humbly. There is no demanding of God to do a miracle. I demand, I command you, Jesus. Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering great pain. He does not even request. He says, Lord, here's my need. Here's my need. And then Jesus' response is this. I love it. And he said to him, I will come and heal him. Wait a minute. You've got to stop there. I told you a little bit about before why it was, what it was that rabbis taught about Gentiles. Gentiles were the scum of the earth. If you wanted to stay holy, you stayed away from them. What happened to Jesus when he is saying to a Gentile who was a Samaritan that, yes, I will come to your house and heal him? Jesus, you're in trouble. Enough already. For him to go to the house of this Gentile was a violation of ceremonial law. And by the way, even the centurion knew that because he said, I am not worthy for you to even come into my house. Why? Because he knew the understanding of the ceremonial law. I am not, you cannot come into my house, it's ceremonially unclean, but I still believe there's something here. And Jesus said, anyway, I will come and heal him. What happened to him? He probably forgot. You know, he's just, he had a hard day, and he says, oh, I'll come and heal him. Wait a minute, he's a Gentile. Okay, I won't go. When he says, I will come, it is not absent-minded assent. Again, there's a message in this when he says, I will come. It wasn't that he just didn't think then. He is already in trouble with the religious establishment, and he knows it. He is already in trouble with the religious establishment, and he knows it. He has violated their traditions. He does what he does on the Sabbath. He touches lepers, and he goes to Gentiles' homes. The very power of God is put on display every time he reaches out his hand, And every time he does that, the religious people hate it. And when he says, I will come, he knows exactly. I'm making another confrontation. The way the kingdom operates is not running away from sin, it's running toward it. But it doesn't get defiled when it goes, it heals it. I want you to know the word on Jesus. When he started doing things like this, the word from the religious, proper, good-looking people about this Jesus who was doing a ministry to lepers and Samaritans was this. He doesn't care about sin. Not like us. We are the ones who care about sin. That's why, see, we wash our hands just right. And we wear our hair just right. And we talk just right. And we do it just right. And he's touching lepers. I never. And he's going to Samaritan's houses. And he's a wine-bibber. And he hangs around prostitutes. What I want to know is when the church starts to look like that. That's a kingdom church. That's a kingdom work. He did care about sin. When the accusation toward him was they don't care about sin, he did care about sin so much that he went where it was. And he brought his healing and redemption to it and his forgiveness. I want you to hear something here real briefly. It's a teachable thing, the message in the miracle. There is a very strong evangelistic thrust, evangelistic message in that statement, I will come. That's an evangelistic thing. what he is saying is this I do not run away from it I run toward it it is a picture of going to those who are in sin he is not saying this the church is made up of people who stay in their nice little place everybody looks the same talks the same acts the same and we all feel safe we hold each other's hands and sing kumbaya it's a group of people who have been redeemed and made holy by the blood of the lamb who have the power of the spirit living within them and they know it and they begin to move in this world like salt and light. Frank Tillepaugh caused what one of the greatest problems in the church today that we have become a fortress where we have these wonderful walls and the only person who would possibly come in is somebody who likes it churchy, who likes it pious and the world out there doesn't like it like that. They want it real. So does Jesus. So we're on the same team. but the real thing hardly ever looks good the kingdom thing hardly ever looks good it's about lepers samaritans going to the wrong house getting a bad reputation among reputable religious people you know that's not a fun thought is it if we do kingdom stuff we'll get a bad reputation among some isn't that delightful if the word of God is true if what happened to Jesus happened to us that will happen and if you care about that then let's quit doing the kingdom let's start being religious again forget it let's move on new insights verse 8 the centurion answered and said and the insights are going to be on faith and authority here Lord I am not worthy for you to come into my house but you say the word and my servant will be healed you just say the word that's faith right you just say the word that's faith what i want to focus on though is not just verse eight where we see the faith verse nine is the real key to this thing because we see the source of the faith i'm not here to just say have more faith the source of the faith is in verse nine and i'll give you the tip off right now the reason he had faith was because he understood something about delegated authority relative to kingdom truth i too like you am a man under authority jesus said this all authority has been what given to me i am under authority as it were there's a sense in which jesus was under authority having been given the authority because he emptied himself in the kenosis passage remember that in philippians he emptied himself but he was given authority on earth to do the work of the kingdom and this centurion pagan as he was didn't know the doctrine said i noticed something in you and that is this delegated authority. You function with authority. And I understand authority. See, I too am a man under authority. And I don't have authority in and of myself, but it has been given to me. And when I say go, it goes. And when I say come, they come. And when I say do this, they do that. And here's the kingdom truth. When that guy understood that Jesus had authority on earth to heal, when he had authority on earth to do the kingdom, when he had authority on earth to forgive sin when he believed that he had authority on earth to bring the kingdom and the reign and the power of God to earth faith just followed right now with the authority that I see you have I believe all you got to do is say the word and he is healed the key to faith relative to kingdom power is believing that you have authority to function in the kingdom that's a kingdom truth that's another one you need to write it down some of these feel disjointed write them down hang on to them let them be digested by the spirit later on let me bring you to that matthew 28 passage that's the one where jesus says this all authority has been given unto me i want you to know something about that that's at the very end of the gospel right so by the time he says all authority has been given unto me nobody doubts it they have already seen his authority demonstrated in his teaching remember in chapter 7 they were amazed because he taught with authority not like the scribe. He has already established his authority visibly on earth to heal. He has established his authority over the demonic realm by delivering people from demons. He has established his authority on earth by forgiving sin and redeeming people. But then he says something that ties in with this little passage here that is whether we know it or not a foretaste of what the church is being called to. Because he says this, all authority has been given unto me and now here's the staggering words I give that authority to you. Go now and make disciples teaching them to do what I did. Teaching them all that I commanded you and what did I command you to do. Preach the kingdom and do the kingdom. You know what I know? People who begin to believe and understand that on earth in the church Jesus has given gifts to his church to do the work of the kingdom and they begin even in small ways to believe that they have authority over the domain of darkness, you know what begins to rise in them? Faith. Real exciting. Faith begins to rise. They begin to believe. Jesus, all you've got to do is say the word. I believe that there are two things that Satan is attempting to and is succeeding at robbing from many, many believers and it's rendering the church of Jesus Christ impotent in many instances. One of the places that Satan is coming to, believers, and robbing them from something as this. He is robbing them of their identity. If he can lie to you about who you are in Jesus Christ, you will be rendered impotent. If you think your identity and your value in the kingdom is based on your performance, you're going to wait until you perform just right until you attempt anything in the kingdom life. The word of God consistently says to us, in Jesus Christ, you have been made complete. You are a new creature. The God of heaven lives in you. Move out in the authority and the identity of who you are in Christ. not on the basis of the shifting sand of your performance. You need to know who you are. I know, what I know about people who are coming to know who they are in Christ is this. They begin to move into kingdom reality and service with some measure of power. The other area that Satan is attempting to steal from the church is their authority. Beloved, if we are ever going to function, individually or corporately, consistently in this spirit realm of kingdom power, We are going to have to know our identity in Jesus Christ and we are going to have to know the authority that he has given to his church over the domain of darkness. Because I'm telling you what, if I do not have in the spirit realm authority to storm the gates of hell, I ain't going. I'm going to stay back and do nice little church work. Church, he saves things. Forget about the gates of hell. But he has given us authority. And when we believe that, faith rises. And when faith rises, we move. that is what Jesus marveled at this guy centurion Samaritan did not sit at the feet of the rabbis and yet he understands one of the most profound dynamics of kingdom truth authority produces faith and faith produces power it's a good word but then comes the confrontation and it begins in verse 10 he marveled at his face saying truly I say to you I've not found such a great faith with anyone in Israel. And again, I've said this already. He looked in Israel. He looked where you ought to be able to find it. Among people who call themselves the people of God, but he didn't find it there. He found it with lepers and Samaritans. And then in verse 11, he begins to go for the jugular, if you will. I didn't find that kind of faith in Israel. In fact, verse 11, I'm saying to you that it is from the east and the west. that is where the people who are going to recline at table are going to be coming from. It'll be Isaac and Jacob and Abraham and not the sons of the kingdom. What in the world does this mean? A little teaching. The Jews had an eschatology, and eschatology simply means the culmination of history. What is going to happen at the end? The culmination of history to a Jew, they had what was called the great messianic banquet in their theology. In 2 Barak 29, it's an apocryphal writing, but it gives us some insight into their thinking. It said this, that we are going to sit down with Messiah at the table of the feast, and we're going to eat Behemoth and Leviathan. Behemoth was an elephant, and Leviathan was a huge fish. All that really means is this. It's going to be all-you-can-eat time on Friday night. The equivalent for us in our eschatology, their Messiah banquet, is the marriage supper of the Lamb that we picture. The thing, however, for the Jew is this. They knew exactly who was going to be at that banquet. them after all they were the sons of Abraham they were the children of the covenant they went to the right synagogue and they knew the right doctrine and like the Pharisees they prayed more than anybody and they fasted more than anybody and they gave more money than anybody certainly we are the ones but there's a problem you see in verse 11 Jesus on top of all the other things he has done to offend these religious people starts inviting other people to the banquet inviting people that they in this present life would not in a million years have dinner with talk to go to their house ever he starts inviting them to the culmination of history the time of celebration when the redeemed sit at the feet of Abraham Isaac and Jacob their fathers the people he's inviting don't look good they don't smell good they don't pray good they aren't mature not nearly as mature as us they start inviting the people that these religious people feel so superior to and indeed more spiritual then they are reclining a table that's offensive enough but in verse 12 he says this not only will they be coming from the east and the west let me just, I just realized I didn't even give you the exact thing on that east and the west of what? Israel Israel is the central point to the east and to the west those are the ones who are going to be coming into the kingdom they are the ones you were Israelites you were religious types thought you were the only one this is a prophetic word of the gospel by the way going to the Gentiles but not only does he say those people that you don't like are going to be there the worst thing about it is this you're not what? if anybody's going to be there we're going to be there maybe I'll allow a few from the east and the west Jesus says they're going to be almost all from the east and the west and you're not going to be there he says that in verse 12 the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness who are the sons of the kingdom in Acts chapter 3 Peter calls the inhabitants of Jerusalem who were very very religious did it right looked good knew the words the whole shmeel but had no life he says you are the sons of the kingdom they are called sons because they have all the appearance of sons by all appearance they were sons they went to church, they knew the doctrine they hung around the church they were very involved but when you started looking for the life of God what made their hearts go ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom and get excited wasn't God it wasn't the kingdom it was all their churchy things that's what they hang on to that's what they got mad at when you violated it it wasn't God they are the sons of the kingdom small s you see they believed the entrance into the kingdom was on the basis of a physical seed growing up in the church i was born into this i've learned to wear the garb of god i know how evangelicals last i do it no power no life by the way i said this is an old confrontation what he's dealing with here and who he's speaking to here are the same people he spoke to in chapter 7 verse 21 not everyone who says lord lord will enter the kingdom. In fact, many will come and I will say, depart from me, I never knew you. And they'll say, man alive, God, we did all this stuff. And he will say, it's the people from the east and the west that are coming into the kingdom. It's the lepers, the Samaritans, the broken, the mourning, the desperate from me. And all you liked was the trappings, the religions. You never did know me. The power of God never flowed through you, ever. And you will be cast in outer darkness and there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth because they're going to be real surprised because they thought not only would the Gentiles and these scummy people they wouldn't let in their church be in the kingdom they thought they would be the only ones in the kingdom totally reversed verse 4 he comes back to that message it's not you guys it's the hungry it's the lepers it's the Samaritans and Jesus said to that Samaritan that centurion I've got good news for you go your way. Let it be done to you as you have believed. And that servant was healed at the very hour. Third miracle. Very quickly I close with this. And Jesus came to Peter's home and saw his mother-in-law lying sick in the bed. Let me tell you what's significant about this and just wrapping up this and see that the theme is consistent all the way through. The irony of this is that Peter's mother-in-law was a Jew. She was a Jew. But she was a woman. low totem pole among the Jews let me explain how this flows Jesus has already reached out his hand and touched someone who was unclean a leper he touched his uncleanness and he made him whole but that was real hard for these self-righteous Jews who knew that you only ministered a slick looking good looking polished people that was hard for him to handle and then he had to go to heal a Samaritan's slave and then he had to go to marvel at the fate of a pagan who they wouldn't have dinner with. And then he had the incredible audacity to shut the gates of the kingdom to the people who thought they were the most spiritual of all. And maybe the message could be going, well, he's just shutting the doors to us completely. He just doesn't like us and he'll never let any of us in. And so it was, the last person he healed was a Jew. But it still flows, you know why? Because I just said it. Among the Jews, among the religious, among the externally performing, good-looking people, among that group, the ones who respond to the kingdom are the broken and the mourning and the hungry and the low ones on the totem pole. And whether you like it or not, that's the way the kingdom looks. And I'll tell you what, that is a message to the evangelical church even. I really believe that one of the poles I feel on my spirit all the time all the time if you're in school you're going to feel it we are going to feel it as a congregation the call of God on us is to look slick and be good and have it looking good all the time the call of God on us is if we're going to do kingdom work it's going to be among cripples and lepers and we're and I wonder if we're ever going to have enough money see and I wonder if we're ever going to have enough teachers and I wonder if we're ever going to have enough of what we need to do what Jesus did and it's always going to be on the edge but it's always going to be faith and we're going to see god come through over and over and over again but we're going to have to decide every day who we're going to minister to and what level we're going to have it's going to be the lepers centurions samaritans the broken the morning that's where the kingdom is and that's where the power is see the fact remains i bless faith wherever i find it wherever i find it i even bless it among slick looking people but the problem with the rich the slick is that they're not coming desperate when they do come very often they just try to add me to the list of neat things they've got and I'm a real jealous God and people who come to me are going to be hanging on to me for dear life and they're going to be scared sometimes but they're going to know my power and they're going to know my healing and they're going to know my redemption and they're going to walk in my kingdom forever and ever and ever and ever he blesses faith wherever he finds it but he finds it in the strangest places. Lepers, Samaritans, women, you, me, the broken, the hungry, the mourning. Let's pray. Father, in the name of Jesus, I pray that your spirit be released among us right now. There are people here, Jesus, who like lepers and like Samaritans don't look real good and don't fit in with a lot of slick stuff and maybe by super pious people look immature. But Father, they're desperate. And sometimes they might even be so desperate, but they're scared to even ask for a touch from you. And I pray the release of your spirit here right now to give them the courage to ask and come and receive a touch from you. And there might be some other people here, Lord, you just put it on my heart. But there are some people who have indeed relied on how slick they look. And they don't like that. They love you. But they, because of fear, maybe shielded themselves and wrapped around themselves the garb of God that isn't born of the Spirit. And God, even now as I speak, you're breaking some of them. And I pray that you would so slay their pride that they would be able to come like a leper and say, cleanse me from that junk so that I can know the kingdom and not just church work, but kingdom work, kingdom life, kingdom power. But it's scary and it's messy. Jesus, I release that. I ask that that be released by your spirit among us. And I ask that in Jesus' name. I also ask God for those who aren't redeemed, who don't know you in any way. And Father, I just ask your spirit be released among us to break down the walls of delusion and make people here aware of the things they're hanging on to that can't give life and that they could come to, like the leper, desperate, saying, God, my only hope is you. I need your grace. I need your forgiveness. And if that's you, then you need to know he will cleanse you and make you new today. Father, I ask all these things in Jesus' name. Amen. you
