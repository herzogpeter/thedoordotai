The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Jesus. And he opened the book and found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim the release to the captives, people in bondage to whatever issue. He has sent me to proclaim release to those people, recovery of sight to the blind, to set free those who are downtrodden, and to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord, that is to proclaim a season of forgiveness and a season of healing. And Jesus then closed the book, and he gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him, and he began to say to them, Today this scripture I just read has been fulfilled in your hearing, thus saying, I am the fulfillment of this. My job description, it's as if Jesus is saying, is this, preach the gospel to the poor, break the chains on those who are held captive, give sight to people who cannot see, set free those who are downtrodden, proclaim seasons of grace, forgiveness, and mercy. Let's pray as we begin. Father, I pray that as we go to the table, our time of healing, as we break open the word and hear from you, that you would among us do your job description. I pray in Jesus' name that you would be who you are among us for your body. And I pray it in the name of Jesus. Amen. Back in mid-December, simply in the flow of our study in the book of Acts, we came to a word in chapter 15, verse 20, where the Apostle James, speaking to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, gave an instruction to them that they were to abstain from, among other things, fornication. The Greek word we have been using interchangeably for that is pornea. That word has become a rather extended series we find ourselves in right now. With that word, abstain from fornication, there came a promise in verse 29 of that same chapter, if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. With that promise implicitly comes a warning that if you don't keep yourself free from such things, or needs to be added, if you can't keep yourself free from such things, how in the world would we not be able to? If it's perpetrated upon you, that's how. If you are a victim of this abuse, rape, some sort of incestual involvement that came to you, the result of that either way, whether it came to you or you moved into it, is pain. And among us, we have come to call it, refer to it as the pain of pornea. And over these last several weeks, we have been doing something that each week for me has felt a little more difficult, a little more frightening. And that is this, we've kind of taken the lid off of this whole thing. And having pulled back the veneer, having exposed the wound, the fright comes in realizing that this wound may just be a lot bigger, a lot more painful than many of us ever imagined, even among us. the pain of porneia a phrase that I don't think we will forget soon that pain includes everything that we have spoken of these last weeks from sexually transmitted diseases cures for which everything but fidelity is considered in our culture to broken relationships, marriages that are shattered friendships that because of porneia have gone awry capacity to trust because of porneia, for some of you seemingly lost forever in any kind of relationship with a man or with a woman. Part of the pain of porneia we have seen these weeks is manifested in distorted views of sexuality. From on one end of the spectrum a wild kind of promiscuity that acts as if in sex there can be, maybe found some life or love or intimacy to the other end of the spectrum where we find people with an inability to see or experience sexuality in any context that is healthy, holy, happy, or safe. And sometimes the pain of porneia is not manifested in anything even that visible. rather an overwhelming, sometimes debilitating, but oftentimes silent sense of shame, just inner shame about sexuality in general. And here we have been these weeks, week after week, kind of taking the lid off of that. I hope you have not sensed flippantly, but we have been doing that, in a way ripping off the band-aid. but to say we're ripping off the band-aid would once again minimize what we have discovered over these weeks is the pain of pornea because a band-aid would be far too small to cover what many many men and women among us have felt as it relates to this issue it's bigger than anything a band-aid could cover but the point is this we have been exposing this thing to the light. And I don't know if you have had any instincts like this over these weeks, but there is an instinct when we see a wound grievous to cover that up, to just put that back. I don't want to look at that, not because I don't care, but because there is a helplessness that comes with that, thinking we can't do anything. I have thought this last week of doctors kind of paralleling it with this kind of issue, and nurses who would function in an emergency room and people would be coming in with grievous kinds of wounds, the kind of wound that you or I, unskilled, not uncaring, but unskilled, would desperately want to cover with a sheet. If they came in covered with a sheet, I would want to leave it like that, even if it's bleeding through. I don't want to have to look at that. It feels like the kind thing, in fact, to leave that covered. something way down within me seeing grievous wounds wants to be repelled and move away not because I don't care I don't have a clue what to do but a doctor or a nurse with a heart to heal a real healer doesn't cover that wound and leave it that way but pulls that sheet back exposes it sometimes to our horror in an attempt to heal it puts their hand on that thing. Gently, hopefully very gently, using every means to minimize the pain, though it cannot be fully eliminated. The real healer moves toward that wound, exposes the wound in order to cleanse the wound, touches the wound in order to heal the wound. But it's not a very pleasant process. Let me share with you what over these weeks I have heard. I believe it's something I've heard in my spirit from you regarding this wound that we would very much like to leave the sheet on, even if it's bleeding through. Not because we don't care, but because we feel overwhelmed with how big this thing is. What I have heard in my spirit as we have pulled the sheet back among us is a howling. A kind of wail come from our body relative to the pain of porneia. Men and women both. I don't know how better to say it. From the letters, from the cards, from the stories you have shared, from the people I have run into, I could give you specific experiences and events, but the men and the women, some of them victimized, some of them perpetrating, some of them perpetrating because somewhere along the line they got victimized. It all begins to run together. And what I've heard from us, our body, the sheep of Opendoor, has been a howl. It's been a howl of pain. My question to you as I say that is this. Have any of you heard it? These weeks, have any of you heard the howl? Some of you would respond to that by saying, I have heard the howl, it's been coming from me. Some of you have heard it because you have allowed yourself to join your arms with those around you who have been affected, either perpetrating or victimizing or both. But the pain of porneia, you have allowed yourself to feel it and to hear it. It runs together. It turns into a howl. And one of the things it does, on one hand, is it makes us want to cover it. On another hand, it makes us want to heal it, but we want to leave it covered because we don't know what to do. Hopefully, what it makes us do, it's certainly what it makes me do, feeling totally helpless to touch it. It makes... they want to come to God and ask him, God, would you do your job description here? You came to preach this stuff and proclaim release to captives and recovery and set people free and proclaim seasons of forgiveness and grace and mercy. Would you come and do your work here? This is beyond any human touch. If it's just a little thing, we'll put a Band-Aid on it. Well, just leave it covered. Time heals everything. It's not going to heal this. Well, to ask everyone who's been affected by porneia to come forward, we'll get them into counseling. Counseling's not going to... We need counseling. Counseling's not going to touch this. Sunday school class isn't going to touch this. Singing a song isn't going to touch this. Hearing a sermon isn't going to touch this. Isn't going to heal it. We're going to have to ask the Spirit to come. somewhere God's going to have to show up and do what some of us have lost hope he could ever do. But we need to hear the howl. We need to hear it. I have no desire whatsoever to wallow in it. No desire whatsoever to stick our nose in it. But I think in terms of moving even toward repentance and moving toward recognizing that this is bigger than any human touch, we need to hear this with permission from three people I read these letters I want to tell you something about these people first of all they are regular people they come to open door week in, week out they love Jesus with all their heart all of them they are moms they are single, they are parents, they are children, and they're sitting next to you. And they are lambs in the flock of God, and from them I hear a howl. When I was a kid, my dad was totally unavailable to me. I adored him, But I never managed to win his admiration. I spent years desperately trying to find a dad. It was not until my second year of teaching that I felt God gave me one. He was the high school counselor at a school I taught at. For about six weeks, he was everything a dad could be. Six months, he was everything a dad could be. We talked, we jogged, we canoed, etc. I watched him interact with his wife and children. He was everything I had imagined a godly father to be. And I observed him interact with his students. And as he did, my overall comment about him was Christ-like. But then came the devastation. One night when I was babysitting at their home, he came home and raped me. I was 22 years old, but I might as well have been seven. He was my dad in my mind. There were the threats if I told and the consequential rejection if I resisted. Yes, I was an adult, but the whole thing was so twisted, so confused and enmeshed. It was during that time that I started hating my body. I left that town when school ended. Oh, yes. He got Teacher of the Year that year and is now a pastor of counseling at a church. I assume his wife still has no knowledge of what went on. I moved to Minneapolis and met a man who was a Lutheran pastor and worked part-time as a counselor at Lutheran Social Services. He, too, began sexually abusing me. The first time he forced me, I threw up. He beat me so bad I ended up in the emergency room. It was after that that I began making myself vomit all the time. I had to cleanse myself. The beginning of 12 years of bulimia. I wrote this in my journal. Quote, If I am going to have a relationship with someone, or have someone ever care about me, I guess I have to be willing to be abused. I've not had a date with a guy since then 10 years. I tried to destroy my sexuality by starving and vomiting. The more emaciated I got, the less feminine I was. Maybe no abuse now. Being in recovery also means, however, becoming more feminine because I just got healthy. It also, however, means being a target again for abuse. Very frightening. Then there was Scott's sermon. Scott's sermon was a month ago at communion. He spoke of, at the table, Jesus coming and washing our feet. Back to the letter. When he talked about Jesus washing our feet, God gave me a picture of that. Jesus came to me. The dirt and filth on my feet was the filth of pornea. He washed, that is, Jesus washed and washed my feet. Then, as this picture continued, Jesus looked up at me with tears running down his face. face and said, I'm sorry, your feet are stained. Did you hear that? I cried through the entire service. The pain was so great, it hung on me all week. I couldn't figure out the stains on my feet until your sermon Sunday. The stains are the spiritual scars. Your analogy of a short healing time for a gunshot wound and long healing time for rape really hit home. It was like that with me. This is going to take time. She closes the letter. Hey, it's one in the morning. I better crash. Sorry about writing a novel. I still have a lot to figure out. I'm praying that God will use you to help me understand what to do about the stains I have. Maybe that's why I always wear white socks. What does that kind of wound do to you? When I'm reading that letter, what do you feel like doing? I don't know about you, but there's something in me that wants to cover that up. I just want to, that's just too much to look at. It's just too much to hear. It isn't that I don't care. It's that it's just too big. There comes out of that kind of pain of desperation. Do you feel that? Do you feel that desperate? How do we get to that? But I want to tell you something. Not all desperation is bad. Hopefully somewhere along the line when we uncover what is true and painful in our lives, the desperation that arises in our spirit is a desperation that would even corporately come to God, literally to His throne, shake the gates of heaven and say, dear God, come by Your spirit to us with amazing grace. Come give your gifts. You are Jehovah Rapha. Come here and be our healer. Come here and be her healer. Somewhere along the line, these desperate kinds of things that we want to cover over, not because we don't care, but because they feel too big to even go near, corporately we come to God and say, dear Lord, one of your little ones, no, it's more than one because behind this letter are hundreds. Your little ones are badly wounded. One of your little ones in this letter has even come to believe that you told her that her stains are too much even for you. Did you hear that in the letter? See, I hear that in the letter and I wonder how many more people in our body this morning believe that whatever stains are on them, they are too much for God. This dear precious one got a message in some sort of vision that even Jesus said, these are stains. Makes me desperate. Holy Spirit, come and do what you do. Do your job description here. Cleanse your people. be her redeemer be our redeemer and cleanser and reclaimer and stain remover god this is so big it's beginning to make us aware this cannot be counseled away or sunday school classed away or preached or sung away holy spirit fall i've thought a lot lately of revival what would revival look like what would make it come repentance clearly is part of the key i wonder if historically one of the key elements of revival was a people who became desperate knowing that nothing could touch this or heal this but God himself, Holy Spirit, come. But I read this letter and I know there are hundreds behind it and with that I hear a howl. I hear a howl. hear it from another I was a 16 year old victim of rape at a Chicago high school party in 1972 there's now a name for what I experienced acquaintance rape but then it was just being at the wrong place at the wrong time I knew it was all my fault should have known better all the things people tell you Then the lies got louder. You will never be clean again. You will always be dirty. I hear that word, and I want to tell you why I hear a howl. Because behind this one letter I'm getting, a hundred letters behind it, how many people here have gotten the same lie? You will never be clean. You will always be dirty. You can never expect to enter into God's presence again. These lies carried over into my marriage, and it was not until a woman's retreat at Open Door that I was fully and completely what she calls unbrainwashed. The lies lost their grip. God, in that moment, in that time, told me in no uncertain terms how much he loved me. He also asked me why I kept reminding him of my past sin, that he no longer knew of them. What a revelation to me. I knew that before, but somehow now it became real. It is not what Satan had been telling me for all those years. What a filthy liar he is. He is the father of lies. No more would I believe the lies I knew before. They were simply lies. The truth is I can be made whole again. I can be pure and white again. And I can enter into the throne room of God. Get aggressive about it. I can move into the throne room of God by the blood of Jesus. We can. The forgiveness is already there. It had already happened. But you are right, Dave. This revelation came to me only by the breath of God. It was only by the power of God touching me that I began to recoup what the enemy had stolen and the lies began to look like the lies they were. The breath of God. And again, I think I put this with the other letter, with stains that feel like they can't be removed. Holy Spirit, come with your breath. Holy Spirit, come like a mighty rushing river. Blow your wind. Bring your presence. We can't counsel this one away. She signs it, Dirty No More. Dirty No More. When I realize... I talked to this lady this week, asked her permission to use it. We began to speak. She told me that the first time she shared this out loud was in a Bible study of 10 women. As soon as it came out, she experienced something, something that many of you experienced whenever you shared something very, very close to your heart and very painful, open wound. She wished she'd never said it. She wanted to put all the words back in. She felt humiliated and exposed until of the 10 women, six of them came up to her afterwards and said the same thing had happened to them. You see, behind this letter are hundreds more. That's why I hear a howl. One more. Two years ago, after 18 years of marriage, I found out my husband had entered into an emotional affair with one of my friends at church. Through a series of awful events, a severe judgment, and eventually an excruciating, painful public meeting, and then she puts in parentheses, when I am a very private person, we chose, were basically forced to leave that church. And because we live in a small community, gossip flourished, especially among church members, all done in a godly manner. They would pray for us in great detail out loud. I was stripped of all dignity. Then one day, while we were at Open Door, the picture came to me, one communion. Just let that settle in. In a service just like this one, coming around the table, God gave her this picture. It wasn't a pretty picture. It was of me standing totally exposed, tied to a pole in the middle of a huge public town square like a European village. And all of the elders and all of the pastors of our old church came from all directions just looking at me in all of my shame. And they didn't help me. And then came their wives one by one, shaking their heads at me and pointing at me. I'm glad the vision didn't end there. Finally, she says in that communion service, Jesus came and stood by me as well. He stood by me. He wrapped a blanket around me, but I was still in the public square and everyone who wanted to could still come and see my shame. It felt better because I wasn't alone and I was clothed, But the weight on my shoulders felt like a thousand pounds. But yesterday, dot, dot, dot, when the body of open door came, and what she's referring to here is a few weeks ago, you may recall when out of Joel 2 we proclaimed a solemn assembly. We called the elders. We called the congregation and basically said what we need to understand about the pain of pornea is that we are interconnected as a body. Therefore, it is not just his and his and hers and hers. It is ours, and we decided that we would bear this thing together, and we would repent, and we would call on God to bring healing, because it's our pain. We have been tied to the post. Wonder what happens on services like that. You never hear. But yesterday, when the body of Open Door came, and the elders lined up in front, and collectively felt the pain, and publicly came forward. I felt they were coming to that public square for me. We were. To stand with me and shield me from all those accusing, pointing fingers, wagging tongues, and coming somehow supernaturally. And their coming somehow supernaturally lifted the weights from my shoulders. That word key, supernatural. Last letter, breath of God. And that awful pain and shame was distributed among everyone, and I didn't have to bear it all alone. Point there, by the way, is that it didn't necessarily vanish, but she was not alone. Our entire family is having planted deep in our beings the grace of God and the knowledge of who Jesus really is and that he really is. Our marriage has been restored and is stronger than ever, and another huge chunk of healing happened to me yesterday. I'll never forget that phrase. Let it be part of our vocabulary. A chunk of healing. I like that. I got a chunk today. Doesn't it happen like that? I want it to all be gone today. And sometimes it is that way, but more often than not, it's a chunk. God gives you a chunk. For the first time in my life, I've gone to church, by the way, since I was tiny. Now, every week, I am overwhelmingly, exceedingly, wonderfully glad when they said to me, let us go to the house of the Lord. I'm glad you're glad. P.S., I love her P.S. Pretty soon, though, could we maybe start to proclaim a congregational celebration? I'm ready for joy and gladness of heart and rejoicing once again. Let me tell you this. Joy comes in the morning. It's coming. It's here. This is even it. So what do we do with all of that? Hopefully it makes us somewhat desperate. Hopefully we become courageous in not putting the sheet back on. But yes, we're going to pull it off. Recognize then this wound is way too big. We can't counsel this away. Sunday school class it away. Preach it away. Sing it away. Holy Spirit, come. Do your job description among us. Give us chunks of healing. Wash our feet. Remove our stains. Do some unbrainwashing here among us. By the breath of God, do it. It occurs to me that if everyone who needed a touch from the Spirit of God this morning about this issue or any issue. Got it or asked for it. We couldn't handle everybody who comes up. I was talking about that very thing with Tom Johnson this last week. We started talking about revival. He had done some reading recently, talking in their dynamics class about the revivals that happened around John Wesley in his time. Spoke of the fact that this whole idea of coming forward is a relatively new thing. They'd never done that. And because God moved in such powerful ways and the needs were so broad that what happened then was the Spirit would just fall on people where they were. I want to tell you something. That God can come and do what He does and be who He is for you, where you stand and where you sit. We believe in the importance of Jesus with skin on, and so we line up altar ministry people here, and they're just regular people like you, and they even have their own issues too, and they need to get their own healing too. But on this time, we believe they're anointed by the Spirit to minister and gently love and bring healing to you. And so healing services are marked by people coming forward. We invite you to do that. Form lines. Don't feel awkward about that. When you're done being prayed for, go back to your seat. But know this, we come to God as a people and say, Dear God, we've heard the howl, and we want your Spirit to come. I'm going to ask the altar ministry to come right now, the praise team to take their place. I want you to stand. I'm going to pray, and we'll move into our time. Hear these words. Hear these words and let them build in you faith to believe. The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Jesus. He opened the book and found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, and He has sent me to proclaim release to people bound up. For today, from the pain of porneia, to release that recovery of sight to people who cannot see, to set free those who are downtrodden, and to proclaim seasons of grace and mercy and forgiveness. He closed the book, gave it to the attendant, sat down. Everyone looked at him, and he began to say to them, Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing. Jesus, come and do what you do among us. Cleanse the stain. Wash our feet. Give us a chunk of healing. Renew our minds. Reclaim, restore, redeem what has been lost, what has been taken, what we have given away. do your work among us in Jesus name Amen Amen. Spirit of God, won't you come and fall down on me? Spirit, Spirit of God, won't you come and fall down on me? Without your Spirit in me, Jesus, I would not be free. Never be free to worship thee You are my hope, you are my life You are the light in my life Maker of gold and all that's right Spirit, Spirit of God, won't you come and fall down on me? Spirit, Spirit of God, won't you come and fall down on me? Listen to my heart and know that it's true, resting in your grace is all I can do. Jesus my only hope is you You are my Lord, my God, my King You are...
