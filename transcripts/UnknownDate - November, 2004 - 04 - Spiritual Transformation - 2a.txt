We turn to this little picture here, and I know some of you have renovation of the heart with you, so if you look in the front there, you'll find some circle diagrams that show this up. But what we want to talk about now is just very briefly talk about some of the ways that when you begin to apply the Vim pattern to these parts of the self, you begin to see real change. and in thinking about how I could best use the time that I have here, and I'm not going to talk long because I've got a whole bunch of questions here that I'm going to try to respond to. I thought that the central issue should be to just focus a while on the mind and especially the thoughts that come with the gospel that Jesus preached, because the gospel brings us different thoughts, different ideas, different images. Now, we're going to presuppose here that the heart has turned back to God. Until that happens, nothing works. That's the new birth. The word of the gospel comes in under the administration of the Spirit, and it strikes the mind, and the heart responds to it by yes or no. When it says yes, then there is reestablished a connection between the person and God that the person had turned away from. See, really, the main function of the Spirit is to rely on God. That's the main function of the Spirit. It is to trust God. And to be spiritually dead is to be cut off from that trusting relationship to God. So now then you have to trust yourself. We used to say down in Missouri in the winter when the corn ran out to the hogs we would say root hog or die. You ever hear that phrase? Well, that's what you say when the grain has run out and you open the gate and you run the hogs out into the woods and say root hog or die. And that's the condition that a person is in when they're not trusting God. Now then, the new birth is that moment where the Word of God through His Son comes to us, and we say, whoopee, this is for me. This is for me. And we begin to trust God. We trust Jesus to take care of everything that's between us and God. We just put it on Him. And he says, because of your relationship to me now, because you trust me and you're my friend, these other things that you've done, they're behind, they're past. You'll never have to deal with those again. And so then we pick up and go on. Now, at that point, however, our initiative comes into play. Because basically, the rest of the change that's going to come about is going to come about because of our efforts accompanied by grace. And now I hope at this point everyone is clear, there's no opposition between grace and effort. They go together. So what we need to do is to find well-directed effort that grace will work with to transform, and first of all, to transform our minds. And now this is where the content of the gospel becomes so important. What is the gospel? What is the good news? And in this country, and in most of the Western world, perhaps worldwide, there are three gospels that are heard. I don't say three Gospels that are preached because sometimes it doesn't matter so much what you preach, it matters what people hear. And there are three Gospels that are heard. One is the one we'll be most familiar with here, I think. The Gospel on that version is, Jesus took your beating so you don't have to be beaten. All you have to do is believe he did that, and then your beating is gone. Whatever you should get because of your sins, you will now not have to get, because Jesus got it. And if you can, or if you want to, you can just think of that as the gospel of the theological right, though let's don't put right and left too far apart here. It's a conservative vision of what the basic gospel is, that there was a beating you had coming, Jesus took that beating, now you don't have to get it. Right? And there's something sweet and beautiful and right about all of that. The problem is it is not the gospel. It's a part of the gospel, but it's not the gospel. It's one theory of the atonement. That's what it is. It's one theory of the atonement, one theory of what Jesus did to save us. And it is, he took our beating. Now, another gospel that is heard is the gospel of liberation. This is the gospel of the theological left, the idea that God is in favor of liberating people from all of their bondages. Now, frankly, usually for this gospel, the bondage to sin is not considered. But what they call structural evils is very big. And now you will, I believe, agree with me that biblically that is a big issue. God is not in favor of oppression. And the prophetic word that comes from the Bible, from beginning to end, and Jesus himself was very strong on this, that's clear. But it's not the gospel. and it isn't the gospel that Jesus preached. When I say it's not the gospel, it's not. Now, why? Because it does not give an adequate picture of God and what He's doing and what we're invited into. That's why it's not the gospel. Another gospel that is heard is basically, be faithful to your church. And it's very widespread. One way of putting it is, you take care of your church and it'll take care of you. And many times that is what people hear. And that also is a good thing. But it's not the gospel. And now when I say it's not the gospel, what I mean primarily to say is those three versions do not naturally lead you into discipleship to Jesus. They don't put you on a path that leads from regeneration to justification to sanctification to glorification and makes it all part of one picture, one life. They just don't do it. And they all wind up redefining discipleship in a way that omits that. For example, one of the most well-known discipleship groups in this country has for decades defined discipleship as preparing to lead others to Christ. That was their version of discipleship. Other groups, more to the left, more to the left, they think of discipleship as social action or serving the poor or something like that. Well, again, that's wonderful. And then people also who are church people primarily, they want to think of discipleship as faithfulness to your church. Now, if our mind does not have a greater vision of what God is giving to us, calling us to, restoring us to, our lives will change. And now, when I say that, I'm just saying, look, if you look at how it actually works, lives don't change in response to those Gospels. Now you say here and there, there's one or two that you'll find people that do. But it is not a reliable path. And that is abundantly proven now by the track record of these three versions of the gospel because they all give a different version of who God is. And what we have to really have restored in our mind is God as the heavenly Father. who created us and all of creation and has a purpose for everything that he's done and has made a place for us to come into the world. See, when you were born, God ushered you into the scene. And now it was your time to live and be a part of his kingdom and to grow and to keep growing more and more into what he's doing, taking on his character and taking on his power. Now, in this particular conference, I haven't had time to really go through the Scriptures from Genesis to Revelation and point out how that is laid out. I started you out by talking about Genesis 1.26. Let us make humans in our image. and let them have responsibility over the earth. See, when you talk about the gospel, it's got to tie back to that. You can't separate redemption from creation, nor creation from redemption. They have to come together as one picture because that's the way God is. And He's created, and now then we have moved away from Him, and he's going to restore us to that. And salvation is being restored to that place in what God is doing, his eternal kind of life. Salvation is returning us to that. And that's where the great invitation of Jesus, repent for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand. That's the gospel. Now, if you just, I think if you take any New Testament scholar, or if you just take your New Testament and start reading, you will see that. That is the gospel. It says over and over that's what it says. Over and over that's what Jesus preached. No question about that. And I also haven't, but I want to alert you to it so that you can do it. I haven't taken you through the book of Acts and the letters and shown you how the gospel of Jesus is the gospel of the kingdom, and the gospel of the kingdom is the gospel of Jesus. See, Jesus put a face on the kingdom of God. And if you just read the book of Acts and you look at, just take your book of Acts and your concordance and look up gospel and preaching and teaching and see what is preached and taught, and you will find from beginning to end, I gave you the beginning, where Jesus is for 40 days talking about things pertaining to the kingdom of God. But if you go through that, you're going to see how that is the message that continues, and Jesus fills out what it means. So now, if you have Jesus without a kingdom, you ain't got Jesus. And if you've got kingdom without a Jesus, you ain't got kingdom. They go together. That's the only way it works. And that's why Paul winds up at the book of Acts in aâ€¦he was an in-house prisoner, but he was preaching Jesus and the kingdom of God. Now, remember what the kingdom of God is. The kingdom is the range of God's effective will. But you won't know what that is unless you know Jesus. But you won't know Jesus unless you know that He's actually right now the King of the kings of the earth. Did you know that? He is the king of the kings of the earth. Who does Putin work for? He works for Jesus. He probably doesn't know that, but he will someday. See, Jesus is the king of the kings of the earth. He's the last, the first, the omega, the alpha, all that, firstborn from the dead. And He's creating a kingdom of priests, and that's you. See? And that runs from Exodus 19.6, again, all the way through into the book of Revelations. That's what He's doing. And the good news, the gospel now, is that you can, whoever you are, you can just step into that and learn and grow and forever, never stop. The good news for that is that God is supervising human history and nothing good will be lost. Nothing good will be lost. and you get to be a part of that that's your invitation and you don't have to qualify you just come simply as someone who says I trust you Jesus I turn it all over to you I see what you're doing and I don't want to be left out of that I don't want to be left out of that And that is the most effective way I think you can present the gospel to people, is to let them know what's going on. That's basically what you do. Say, hey, this is what's going on. Sometimes I will say to a person that I think I should say something to about the gospel or about God. I will start by asking them, how are you doing with your kingdom today? you know that's an appropriate way to do it because it puts them in the right position and normally they'll come around to saying I need a little help with my kingdom well I can tell you where you can get some help see and then you move into talking about...you have to be led by your good sense and by the Spirit and all of this, you understand. But you will find ways of helping them hear some good news, some really good news. It may be just as simple as, you know, God loves you. And then explain what that means. And the old little card, you know, God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life. That's really true. And so then from there, your mind can go on and you can begin to enlarge it with good teachings. Now the effect of that is going to go all through your personality. Once you begin to really believe this, you may find yourself skipping even because you'll be so happy. Do you ever skip anymore? Try it. see that's you can put your body into something like that and actually when you begin to hear this it's enough to make you skip now the feelings will begin to change rapidly you see once you begin to have these new ways of thinking the feelings will begin to change what is on your mind will change your feelings and fear and anger and contempt and desolation and loneliness and despair and depression and hopelessness they will begin to lift because you will have hope and that hope will be based in the love that is inspired by the vision of God that is before your mind. Now when you do that, the addictions to desire and manipulation of your feelings will also begin to look uninteresting, shall we say. Uninteresting. if you don't have this vision before your mind then fear, anger, contempt and desolation will make you miserable and you'll want a little something to help you out you know maybe a little drugs or alcohol or sex or violence or whatever you know Paul is so good on all of this He really is a master psychologist. I love the way he puts it in Ephesians, the fourth chapter. He's talking about this great contrast. And he first of all gives you the picture of the church as the people of God who are called out in history to be expressions of the kingdom in the first part of chapter 4. and culminates in this wonderful verse 15 of Ephesians 4, speaking the truth in love are to grow up in all aspects unto him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body being fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies. That's my favorite picture of the church. There's a lot of joints supplying one another. you're receiving and giving. According to the proper working of every individual part, this causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. And that's really the story on the church. But now then, here's what follows. You shouldn't walk any longer as the Gentiles who walk in the futility of their mind. That's Verse 17, they walk in the futility of their mind. Notice how it develops. Being darkened in their understanding. That's here. They've got all the wrong ideas, all the wrong thoughts. Darkened in their understanding, and that excludes them from the life of God, because they've got the wrong God. The ignorance that is in them because of the hardness of their heart. Now, verse 19 then leads over into feeling. And they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. See, that's the thing. If you try to medicate yourself with feeling, it always fails because you become hardened. and what gave you feeling no longer gives you feeling and so you have to have more of it. And that's where perversion comes from. It's an attempt to push the limits of feeling and it becomes ever more difficult to feel because you've got calluses on your soul. And that will also mean that you can't feel your conscience. your conscience is seared because those calluses have built up. And you're just going for more and more feeling because that's the only thing that keeps you alive. It's the only thing that deals with your fear and your anger and your depression and so on. So you just keep pushing that button more and more and more. Paul says you didn't learn that from Christ. So now, as you begin to change here, so your feelings, they're not like your thoughts. Your feelings are kind of, they're the front line of your relationship to your world. That's one reason why they're so important. And I do think, actually, that Christians, especially as they go along through life, maybe as they grow older, they become more and more subject to their feelings. And that's a very unfortunate thing because feeling tends to grow dead as you grow older. And that's why so many people grow bitter and angry is because they don't have a picture of life that fills them with joy and hope. And they're thinking about they're going downhill and they think they're actually going to die, which is an incredible mistake. But their life amounts to nothing. See, because they don't have the right picture of themselves and God that will allow hope to come in. So their feelings trip them up. And, you know, feelings just sit right there up in the front row of your life. They're like kids. They're just up in your face all the time. And that's why we say to people in the morning, how are you feeling? We don't say, how are you thinking today? We say, how are you feeling? Because we know that that's that interface there. And it's really going to move you. And so until someone may have had their coffee, you don't even want to talk to them. And so thank God for coffee. Now then, these feelings, sometimes we just call them things like love, joy, and peace. Actually, love, joy, and peace are not feelings. They are conditions. They're orientations. but they do have feelings associated with them. And we don't love for the feeling's sake, but when we love, our feelings are very different. They're very different. They are associated with peace and with joy and so on. Being loved and loving is one of those wonderful conditions that has with it a whole stratus of feeling that counteracts anger, fear, contempt, depression, and so on. So we don't just try to have the feeling. We have the condition by action and by grace, and because we have the condition, then we have the feelings. So it's a very interesting thing. You cannot actually change your... you can't change your thoughts by changing your feelings. There's a little bit you can do there, but not much. But you can change your feelings by changing your thoughts. And it's important to understand that the first freedom that we have is where we put our mind. And so now when we come to apply our VIM principle, the first place we want to be sure that we attend to is our mind. We want to take care that the right views of God and ourselves, especially those views, are what we retain in our mind. And so these things like the saying that I use, for if you're in the kingdom of God, this world is a perfectly safe place for you to be. no matter what happens. See, we see the guys in the boat, and they're screaming at Jesus, and there's a storm, and they're scared to death, and Jesus is asleep. Typical Jesus. I don't know what words you would select to describe Jesus, but the word I would select is relaxed. And here he's sleeping in a storm, and they're screaming. They wake him up, and he calms the storm. Then he says to them something very strange. Why were you frightened? Why were you frightened? I'm sure that's one of those cases where they must have turned to one another and said, Why were we, let's see, why were we frightened? You see, Jesus understood that even if the boat sank, they were still okay. It wasn't just that the boat wasn't going to sink. It was more important than that. Even if the boat sank, they were okay. Now, you see, you have to have a different picture. You have to welcome that picture. You have to do the things that will interact with grace to fix that picture in your mind. And then you can begin to enter into the sayings of Jesus. He talked about worrying all the time. Again, some of his humor. God looks after the birds. You're worth a lot more than birds. you ever try to price someone in birds that's what Jesus is getting at you're worth much more than birds God's going to take care of you but you have to have that picture and if you don't the fear and the anger which usually comes out of fear the hopelessness the despair the sense that nothing is going to work everything is down the tubes my life is past and so on, all those feelings you can't resist them but if you have love that will bring joy joy is a pervasive sense of well-being as I said the other day joy, peace peace is a sense of fullness and adequacy peace is not the opposite of war it's actually peace is the opposite of deadness deadness is what drives you to sensuality if you can't find God or if you're not ready to accept God so these feelings begin to change and this can drive anger attack, withdrawal, all the bad stuff in social can help that go and of course you can work on this too and that will help your mind And your soul, which is the part that runs the whole operation, can come together in a harmonious way and it all begins to function well under God. And just in a very sketchy way, that's the way that spiritual transformation takes the whole person, puts them all together, and makes a harmonious whole which manifests the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, kindness, meekness, goodness, faithfulness. And Paul says, again, a joke, against such there is no law. No law against those. And that all comes out of this process. Now, that's available to everyone. That's available to you. That's available to me. And I'll say again the thing that I said at the outset yesterday, which is that there's not a single thing that is held out before us in Scripture as good that we cannot appropriate through faith in Christ that works intelligently with his teachings about who we are. So now let me stop there and answer questions if I can. Why does the Lord give power to people without character? That's a really good question. And it's because there's something really important he wants done. Some years ago we had a very well-known figure in Southern California who, as they say, traded in his 40 for 220s. And he had been influential in leading a lot of people to the Lord. And I had several people come to me and say, what does this mean? Am I saved? And this is actually a very old issue in the church, if you know the Donatist theory. The issue was, are the administrations of a sinful priest efficacious? Now you see, God uses people to accomplish His purposes. Balaam's ass spoke. And he was still a jackass. Here's a nice question. How the spiritual traditions that Richard Foster speaks of in his book, Streams, Streams of Living Water, how does that coordinate with spiritual transformation and the idea of Vim? That's really good. And it's important to say here again, the traditions tend to differentiate not in terms of vision nor intention, but in means. And they often make the mistake of thinking that the means, or take this issue of baptism with the Spirit, which we've been talking about. You'll see folks there that get fascinated with one particular aspect of that and then, if you don't have that, you ain't got anything. And all the traditions are like that. You know you see nuns wearing funny clothes? Sometimes, they quit doing that a lot, but sometimes you go like there's a group in Holland, a group of nuns, they look like they're about to fly, really. But you know they started wearing those clothes so they would not stand out. did you know that that's exactly why so they would not stand out and you know you just keep hammering away at that thing now and of course you wind up standing out more than anything else so really the answer here is that there are many wonderful things wearing those clothes not to stand out that's okay there's nothing wrong with that but you know you don't want to make that essential to anything. So you glory. It's okay to be happy that you have the tradition you do, and you should rejoice in it. It's not necessary, but it's good for you. And you love, maybe you were raised in that tradition, and you love the people who shared it with you, and that's wonderful. And I do think God likes all the amazing variety. I'm going to be kind of disappointed if they're not wearing those uniforms in heaven. Because I think that would be beautiful. That'd be lovely. But we don't want to make it a part of what's essential. Can I trust God too much? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. The question is about presumption. Can you be presumptuous? Absolutely, yes, you can. So now when you trust God, don't make a big deal about it. And above all, don't get into a position where you're trying to prove to God that you trust Him. I remember hearing people say, you should never pray for the same thing twice, because that God would know then that you didn't believe Him the first time. like he's waiting to see if you're going to do that again because then he'll know. Give us a break, you know. John Eldridge talks about the importance of desire. On Thursday, you cautioned against desire and discipline and restraint. how do discipline and restraint interact? You can trust your desires as you submit them to God. If your desires become your God, you're in real trouble. See, and that's what largely happens here in America with our slogan that I talked about last or yesterday about you have a right to pursue happiness. You don't have a right to pursue happiness. You can do that, but you're probably going to be unhappy if you do, but submit your desires to God. And as the Scripture says, He will give you the desires of your heart. Now, you can read that as He will give you the desires, or He can give you what your desires are for. But if you're in the right place with God, that's perfectly all right. And John Eldridge is emphasizing something that is often left out of our teaching. And romance may not be the right word for it. I like the word drama. A life that is deprived of drama will be a life that can't really be sustained. And the greatest drama on the face of the earth is the story of human redemption. And once you get caught up in it, it'll make the movies look mighty dreary. You spoke this morning of temptations coming to us through our minds, how do we handle temptation to come through our bodies as in physical addictions? Well, there are many ways that you can get help with those. And you should use any sensible means. For example, if a person is addicted to alcohol, well, they should join AA. It's a good thing. and they should practice the things that will help them. Alcoholics Anonymous is one of the clearest presentations of what discipline can do. And actually, Bill W. and his friends, I believe, were called out by God because the church was not dealing with that problem. And now we have lots of churches that wouldn't survive if it weren't for the AA meetings in their basement, paying rent. Very ironic sort of thing, isn't it? So, but that's just one thing. I mean, if you're troubled with your body, start with things like, how are you using your body? And are you thinking of your body as the primary source of gratification in your life? That's a real trap. And it almost always leads to addiction, whether it's food addiction, drug addiction, sex addiction, violence addiction, whatever. How are you using your body? Start there. probably this business of rest comes up again so you need to take care of your body and you need to not use it for ends that are destructive that would include things like seduction power over others and so on so you just need to get it out of that category start taking good care of it honor God with it and use anything that you need that can help you. If there's medication, then you do that. See, that's back in the area of means. And if you have an addiction, it certainly hits you in your body, whether it's cigarettes or cocaine or whatever it may be. So you have to address the needs of the body to solve that problem. And that will always be tied up with problems of the mind. fearful, worry. What are we going to do is not the voice of faith. You may have a fact, but the truth overrides the fact. Well, these kinds of situations, and I'm a little cautious here. I don't want to be cavalier about any of this. But in fact, you see, we talk about the fact. Sometimes that's the question, what is the fact? When Daniel was put in the lion's den, was the fact was that lions eat people? Was there another fact possibly there? Well, maybe we misdescribe that situation. You know, we say that's the story of Daniel in the lion's den. But what would you think the lions would say if they could talk? Their story might be, well, this is the story of the lions in Daniel's den. And I'm sure they were glad when they pulled him out. Now, here's a real good one. And I remember a lady down in Alabama or somewhere at a conference, and she had been a faithful servant of the Lord in a ministerial capacity for decades. And I was talking about the easy yoke and all that, you know. And she just stood up and gave her testimony. She said, I have never found the easy yoke. And this question says, my yoke is easy and my burden is light. I've been a Christian for 30 years and I've never known it to be easy. What am I missing? What you're missing is surrender. You're trying to make it work. Give up early and avoid the rush. Quite seriously. You see, that burden is one that crushes ministers. Ministers have such a hard job. And their families. It's just so hard. I mean, occasionally someone isn't like that. and some denominations do better by their ministers than others. But generally speaking, ministers have a terribly hard job and they just have to give up. They just have to say, I'm not running this. I do what I believe to be right and I trust God. And I also take naps. This is really important because so many folks are in that position. And the thing is they're trying too hard. And many times they don't give God a chance to do anything. Jesus said, take my yoke upon you and learn of me. See, that's the discipleship process. So I'm going to learn how to do this without pulling the load. You know, if you appear in Minnesota, you must still occasionally have an animal that you're training to pull a load. And the way you do that is you harness them to an animal who already knows how, right? You put a green horse with an old horse in the yoke, and for about half an hour that young horse will just try to pull the whole thing. And then it'll figure out, well, maybe I'll do this, and it'll slack off and the singletree will start hitting their legs. And then they may think, well, what's this guy over here doing beside me? It's just walking along. Maybe I'll walk along like he does. That's the secret of the easy yoke. And it really does work. But it's a learning process and it does take time. Please review what you said about being filled with the Spirit and surrender and submission. What I said was we don't want to confuse the manifestations of the reality with the reality. Being filled with the Spirit means, and I'm sure that this is a matter of degree and it grows, it really means that every aspect of your life is one where you are inviting, expecting, and experiencing the action of God. So, for example, if you have thought that it's only for religious stuff, you won't be filled with the Spirit because there will be aspects of your life which you're not counting on the Spirit to assist you. Go back to your running that taco stand. Being filled with the Spirit means that what you do running a taco stand is something you do in dependence on the Spirit. How can someone else praying for me result in my being filled? Actually, I was thinking about this because they gave it to me a few minutes ago. I'm not sure that you pray for people to be filled with the Spirit. You pray for them to be baptized with the Spirit. You can do that. That's scriptural. But filling is a little more on the inside here where I'm sure there would be nothing wrong with praying for it. But I don't think you should expect to be filled with the Spirit because someone prayed it on you. Like a ministry, there is a ministry of the laying on of hands and baptism of the Spirit, but I'm not sure there's a ministry of filling people with the Spirit. And it's something to think about. On the other hand, I don't want to say it would be wrong to pray for that, so please understand that. How can someone else praying for me result in my being filled? I don't think it results. It might help. It might help. But I wouldn't count on that as a way of being filled with the Spirit, is what I'm saying. In other words, Scripture says, be ye filled with the Spirit. Don't be drunk with, you know what, be filled with the Spirit. That sounds like something you're supposed to do. That's why earlier I put it on a kind of tie in with growing grace, you know, because that's what we're talking about. Remember, grace is the action of God in you, accomplishing what you can accomplish on your own. That's the Spirit. I think I answered that one privately. And I'm going to quit here in just a minute. A friend of mine shared the thought, love God and do what you want. That's good. Love God. Make sure you're loving God. That takes a little learning. I heard yesterday that it comes down to trust in God. Trust is one of my greatest wounds. I'm afraid of trust. Could you address how fear affects trust. It's really hard on trust. So here's what I would do. Find a situation where you have to choose whether or not to take things in your own hands, gently choose not to do that, and watch for what God will do. See, now, God is either real or He's not. God either acts or he's not. And we can't dodge that. We just have to confront it. That's why I say to you, find a situation where it might be something very simple, like straightening someone out. And suppose you're tempted to do that and you might just say, well, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to see what God will do. Here's one just, I think, with information. Thank you very much. Someone referred me to Firm Foundations by New Tribes Mission. And another thing, I will look into that. Oh, I'm doing fine. Thank you. Thank you. Here we go. In God's kingdom from everlasting to everlasting, he connected a special way with the Israelites in the Old Testament. He connected in a special way with the Israelites in the Old Testament. Where do they stand today if they have rejected Jesus? They stand where everyone else does who has rejected Jesus. And if they haven't rejected Jesus, they stand where everyone else does who has accepted him. Now, this may be a question about whether or not, as an identifiable people, without regard to whether they've accepted or rejected, God is continuing to work with them. I think that he is. I think that he will be vindicated himself in the history of Israel eventually. But probably it's going to be, Israel is going to look very differently than from what it does today, before that to happen. Because Israel is a very mixed and torn society today. and a large part of the Israeli population has come either from Europe or the United States and they want a secular state. So they have some way to go, I think. But I don't think that they have been set aside. I forget what the word is that we use for that now, but I don't think that the church replaces Israel. I think actually there are interesting relations of inclusion in between the church and Israel and something to keep your hopes up for what God will do on earth. This is a special concern to me because I work with a lot of seniors who are Russian Jews. I love them and know how they love and respect me, but they still reject my Jesus. Is there a way to reach them with the good news of the kingdom? Yeah, actually, I think there is. And a good way to do it would be to talk about the kingdom and relate it to what they already believe. And I think you're going to find that Jesus will come up in that discussion. Now, when speaking of becoming disciples of Jesus, the resistance or fear I've noticed in myself and in others is that there are examples in the Gospels where people have asked to follow Jesus and he responded, no. Well, you have to understand that following Jesus in his day meant you had to leave where you were and go with him where he was. And that was only for a select group of people. It was not for everyone. And in some of these cases, like the wild man of the Gadarenes, as one of the cases mentioned here, Jesus wanted that man to go back and talk to his own people about what had been done, what great things the Lord has done for you. So sometimes, now that doesn't mean that Jesus was not with that man and that that man wasn't his disciple. There are other times when Jesus turns people away when he realizes that they are not prepared to make being with him the most important thing in their lives. And if they're not, he says, you can't be my disciple. He wasn't saying, I won't let you. He was just saying, if it's not the most important thing in your life, you're going to flake out. You won't be able to stay with me. And so he discouraged people. And you remember there was a whole bunch of them there in the first half of Luke 14 who were clamoring after him and he said things to them that sent them away. And that happened on other occasions in his life. So the real issue for someone who is in this position is what do you really want? And I think if you come to grips with that, this will straighten out. You see, the question of being a disciple of Jesus is a question about alternatives. And this is the clearest statement of that is, of course, by Peter. When Jesus had said some things, that sent a whole bunch of people away. And Jesus said to them, will you also go away? And then Peter asked the question, to whom shall we go? So I think in dealing with that situation, you need to look honestly and thoroughly at what your alternatives are and see if you don't get more scared of them than you are of Jesus. People sometimes find out around the campus that I'm a Christian, and I've had students come and say, why are you a follower of Jesus? Now, you know, for these talking machines like Todd and Keith and me, that's an invitation to give a long discussion. I think that's a real mistake. And I will, if it seems right, my answer to that question, why are you a follower of Jesus, is who else did you have in mind? Now that gives them a chance to start thinking. See, well, now really, who else? So now, if a person who is worried about or frightened about being a disciple of Jesus, they need to think, maybe I should worry more about not being a disciple of Jesus. So we have a very lovely book that you're probably familiar with called The Cost of Discipleship. How about you write one on the cost of not being a disciple? Thank you.
