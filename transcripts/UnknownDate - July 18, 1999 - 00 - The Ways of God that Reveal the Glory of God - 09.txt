Our study of late, as most of you know who have been here, born of Exodus 33, has been revolving around this statement, that one of the primary ways of God that reveals the glory of God, especially to people who don't know God, is when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God. Now having spent two weeks affirming and illustrating that as being true, we found ourselves last week faced with a question, a question that was more difficult to answer than we had expected. The question was this, but what is love? Having been called to do it, what is it? Even more to the point, what does love look like in different situations at different times with different people? For the fact is this, there are different kinds of love. In fact, one of the major points I made is one size does not fit all. There is romantic love. There is committed love. Intimate love, sacrificial love. There is courageous love. Courageous love that stands against, that says no, that imposes a consequence. It is a love that gives to evil what Dan Allender calls the gift of defeat. It's a different kind of love. It is not warm and gooey, saccharine sweet, but it is love. Jesus said, love your neighbor. And while I would reflect on the fact that I have room to grow and so do you in terms of doing that, I have a pretty good idea of what that kind of love looks like. But Jesus pressed it further than that. He said, love also your enemy. What does that look like? What does that feel like? Is it warm and gooey? Probably not. Probably requiring a different kind of love to love your enemy. There are kinds of love I understand and warmly embrace, and I'm highly motivated to cultivate and build. We spoke of three last week with help from the original Greek language. The first was eros, erotic or sexual love, created and blessed by God. The thing about this love that I pointed out was it's a love I understand. I get this. I am not mystified about erotic attraction, as if it was some mystery as to how that even happens. I know how that happens. It's natural. The work around erotic love is not to encourage you to stir that up. Generally, when we talk about erotic love, it's how we need to fence it in with healthy and holy boundaries. The bottom line, though, is it's natural. I get it. Second kind of love, storge, family or familial love, that of a parent for a child. And while we may feel from time to time with our children and family kinds of love like we don't do it very well and maybe this week I just feel like I lost it. It again is a love I understand. The love of a parent for a child is a natural thing. Third was phileo. Simple friendship marked by mutuality and commonality. I like you, you like me. I get that. It is not a superficial love. It is what I feel for my best, most trusted garden friend. It is what Jesus felt for John, the disciple that he loved. And once again, I get this. I understand this. This kind of love is natural. It was the fourth kind of love that called us into mystery that we do not understand because it calls for something altogether unnatural. The Greek word for this kind of love we're familiar with was this, agape. It is a love defined at the core as sacrificial. It is a love extended without promise of reciprocity or relationship. Unlike phileo, storge, and eros, which I understand because in all three of those loves, I get something pretty significant back from you. There is no such promise of getting something back with agape. It is a love that acts in the best interest of the person being loved, regardless of the consequences, and it is precisely that kind of love, I believe that is required if you're ever going to even think about loving an enemy. It is the love that was embodied in Christ and eloquently described by Paul in Romans chapter 5 when he said this, one would hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for a good man one might dare to die. In other words, at least I could understand that kind of behavior. This is what I don't understand, this, that God demonstrated his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners and that while we were still his enemy in that condition, he died for us. That's agape. Frederick Buechner, in his book The Magnificent Defeat, said this about the different kinds of love painting for us. I think a pretty compelling picture of its variety when he said this, that the love for equals is a human thing, a friend for friend, brother for brother. It is to love what is loving and lovely. the world smiles at that kind of love the love for the less fortunate is a beautiful thing the love for those who suffer, for those who are poor or sick the failures and the unlovely this is compassion and the world is touched by this kind of love the love for the more fortunate is a rare thing to love those who succeed where we fail to rejoice without envy with those who rejoice the world is bewildered by this kind of love and then there is the love for an enemy love for the one who does not love you back but mocks, threatens and inflicts pain this is God's love and the world is conquered by this kind of love back to the question so what does love look like? well sometimes it's as pleasant as a walk on the beach I like that kind of love I can do that, I abound in that sometimes it's as simple as a cup of cold water sometimes it's as confusing and frightening as bringing your child to a treatment center to break an addiction and sometimes it's as painful as a man hanging on a cross last week I invited you to participate in the complexity and mystery of what love really is and to acknowledge that one size does not fit all I invited you to struggle, to anguish, as it were, with how love looks different in different situations at different times with different people. But I also told you that if we were going to enter into this struggle of what love really looks like effectively, that we needed a framework for our understanding, some objective truth that might tell us what love looks like in any situation, regardless of the circumstance, so that we can more accurately tell, are we even in the ballpark with this love thing? Are we moving in the right direction? You see, I feel like I'm a loving person, but how do I know? What does love look like? Well, to that question, the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 says this, I'm really glad you asked, because in terms that everyone can understand, here's what love looks like. 1 Corinthians chapter 13 verse 4 says this, love is patient. That's what it looks like, and right off the bat, I'm in trouble. I'm going, I got to get out of this. I mean, I thought I was a loving guy, but it says here that love is patient. Not one of the first things that comes to me about me. I'm not going to say everything there is to say about that right now. But patience doesn't mind waiting. Patience doesn't force. Patience is willing to trust. and the lack of patience raises all sorts of issues about trust. Do I really trust God with my situation? Do I really trust God with you? Or do I have to push? Do I have to manipulate? Do I have to force? Love doesn't look like that. It looks like kindness. Sometimes love is as simple as baking a cake. It's fixing a meal. It's writing a note. Sometimes it's as simple as getting outside yourself when you're walking the hall and making eye contact and saying hello or hugging a kid. Jesus said it this way. Sometimes you guys need to know it's as simple as a cup of cold water. God spoke to me about this one last week. I made a big thing. In fact, the whole message in the beginning of this message was inviting you into the complexity of love and realizing that a behavior here that looks like love in this situation might be the wrong behavior and you need to do a different thing over here. It was very confusing. And what God said to me about this one this week was this, be careful, Dave, about making love so mysterious and so complex that we all kind of shut down going, wow, this is so complex. You've really convinced me. I suppose we can't do it. You need to understand that sometimes it's as simple as a cup of cold water. Sometimes it's just kind. And you know what? I know what that looks like. I know what kindness looks like. It isn't jealous. It doesn't brag. It isn't rude. the text says it doesn't act unbecomingly what does that have to do with it? it isn't rude what does that mean? love doesn't burp? what does that mean? when it says it doesn't act unbecomingly the first thing that comes to my mind is love is stuffy it doesn't mean that our house we have table rules largely because of my wife they are not they're not repressive but they are enough that people don't get physically ill you know when we're eating things like bellowing burps and squishing food through your teeth playing C you probably don't know what C is but C is when you have food in your mouth and you open your mouth and you just go C isn't that disgusting there are people in our family who do that have done that who said it's him or my daughter. And if you do this disgusting stuff at our table, you get a chore. And it kind of keeps things civil. Fact is, however, this, and this is true. Some of the most hilarious, memorable times we've had as a family is when somebody broke the rules. Somebody breaks the rule, and then somebody else gets a twinkle in an eye, and they break the rule too, and they break it a little better, and all of a sudden, it's like a contest. Who can be the most disgusting? and we are laughing hysterically. By this time, my wife has given up. One such time escalated to the point where, I don't even know how this happened, but we were sitting out on the porch. We have a screened-in porch, and we eat dinner out there all the time in the summer. And this thing finally culminated in our whole family at the top of our lungs singing, I don't know why, the Star-Spangled Banner. And we were singing it as badly as we could, as loud as we could, for our neighbors think we're nuts, but most of our neighbors are nuts as well, so we fit right in. Here's the deal. You know, on days like that, everybody gets a chore. So you get, okay, okay, we're going to have fun, but you're going to get a chore. And the dishes get done right now. And everybody gets loved. So this thing about rudeness is not stuffiness. The reason rudeness is an evidence of lovelessness is that what it says is this. I will do whatever I want. I will do it when I want, and I will do it where I want, because the only one who matters is me. That is what rude lovelessness looks like. So I'm driving my car, and I cut you off. Here's the truth. Sometimes when I cut you off, it's because I didn't see you. I'm mortified that I did it. it really was a mistake. And when I see you, I put a look on my face. Forgive me. But sometimes the reason I cut you off is because, yes, I really do own the road. I don't really care about anybody but me. The reason I didn't see you was because I didn't look. And the reason I didn't look is because I didn't care. see sometimes when i make a disturbance in a public place like a movie or a concert or even in church it's because i made a mistake i'm mortified i bump something that falls a big noise everybody looks at me i want to climb a hole sometimes however the reason i make a disturbance in a public place is because quite frankly i do what i want when i want where i want it doesn't matter pretty much the world revolves around me and i'm going to follow my impulses whatever they are whenever I feel like it. It's called rude. And you know what? It means you're totally incapable of getting outside yourself and just maybe wondering how what I do affects somebody else. Love can do that. And guess what? This isn't a big mystery. This is not that complicated. Love is kind. Love is patient. It isn't rude. what love looks like is becoming painfully practical I liked it better last week when you made it a mystery and we couldn't figure it out it takes no joy in sin says chapter 13 it rejoices over the truth it is eager to forgive it believes the best and perseveres to the end and what love looks like in 1 Corinthians 13 becomes even clearer when you set it in context, when you know the whole story of what's going on in Corinth. Turn with me in your Bibles, if you haven't already, to 1 Corinthians 13, and as you do, let me just give you some background. Let me kind of tell you the story that is around chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians. The first thing you need to know about this chapter is that this is not simply a sweet-sounding soliloquy on love that's nice to read at weddings. It is nice to read at weddings, but that's not all it is. What these words are, in fact, are a major confrontation in a body of believers who were, on one hand, zealous for the work of God, who moved eagerly in the power of God. Chapter 1, verse 7 says, you Corinthians come behind in no spiritual gift. In chapter 12, just before 13, he was speaking to them about all of the gifts of the Spirit, and they were gifts that these Corinthians moved freely in. There was some chaos around it, but he was giving them instruction about something they did very well, they were very eager about the power and work of God but they had failed miserably at demonstrating the love of God. Chapter 11 verse 7 about them says there are divisions and factions among you and quite frankly it doesn't surprise you. I believe it when I hear this. So serious are these divisions that when you come together it is not for the better but for the worst. In other words when people come to your church and they come together time instead of being built up, they'd get torn down. It would be better, in fact, if they didn't go to church at all. Pull that together. What you have as far as the story of 1 Corinthians 13 is this, that in their zeal for the work of God and in their pursuit of the power of God, they'd forgotten about the love of God. But when they did that, unbeknownst to them, they were no longer doing the work of God. And even though they kind of saw themselves doing the gifts, They were no longer moving in the power of God. And that is why Paul says what he says in verses 1 through 3 of chapter 13. Look at verse 1 just to start. If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but don't have love, I've become a noisy gong and a clanging cymbal. Now that I know the story, that verse means something else to me. You see, the apostle Paul here is not just grabbing some hypothetical situation out of the air. that he's making up to highlight love's priority. The truth is that Corinth was the tongues-talking capital of the world. Let me make something clear. Nothing wrong with speaking in tongues. Many of you have been given by God, by the Spirit of God, a prayer language. I have a prayer language. Nothing at all wrong with that, obviously. But it's what they did best. And it's what they wanted people to know about them the most. In fact, they'd become competitive about this. chapter 14, verse 26, 1 Corinthians says this, when you assemble, each one of you has a psalm. Each one of you has a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation. And on one hand, that sounds, well, that's how you ought to come to church. You ought to come ready with a tongue, an interpretation, a prophecy, something to give. Well, that really is a neat thing to come ready to give, except in the Corinthian church, if you read the whole chapter, they were doing it all at once. They were climbing all over each other. And guess what? It had no, it had nothing to do with wanting to give a prophetic word or speak in tongues to edify the body. They were doing what they did to be noticed by everyone. Can you believe how spiritual? Am I a tongues talker or what? Do I get prophetic gifts or what? Paul's instruction in chapter 14 was this. Let what you do be done for edification, for the building up of others. If you need to speak in tongues, if you have a word of prophecy, here's how you do it. two, at the most three, never more than that, and then in turn control yourself. But when love dies, what builds up other people is not what I'm thinking about. I don't ever come to church when love dies even wondering, I don't know, what might I do today in my interaction with people that might build somebody? I'm not even thinking about that. I'm thinking about what could I do today? What could I suck life off today that will just build me up and make me feel, I know, I got a word, I'm going to say it out loud. I don't care. I'm going to do it. Chapter 13, verse 1, Paul is saying in effect this, a little less gifts of the Spirit, a little more fruit of the Spirit, and the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness. After church, look up Galatians 5, read the list, guess what? It's the same list as 1 Corinthians 13. Galatians 5.22 says the fruit of the Spirit or the indicator, the telltale sign that you are a filled with the Spirit person. You ever have anybody come up to you and ask you that? Are you Spirit-filled? I'm a Spirit-filled Christian. And basically what they want to know is if you speak in tongues. And what they're telling you is they're telling you they speak in tongues. Galatians 5.22 says the indicator that you've been filled with the Spirit, that you are right now dominated by the life of God in you, is not that you speak in tongues, not that there's anything wrong with that. It's that you walk in love. Are you filled with the Spirit? I don't know. Are you patient? Are you kind? Love doesn't brag. It isn't arrogant. Let me say it this way. The gifts of the Spirit without the fruit of the Spirit is not a work of the Spirit. I'm going to say that again, but I want you to think about the ramifications of that, because that really is a pretty radical thing that I just said. The gifts of the Spirit without the fruit of the Spirit, without love, joy, peace, is not a work of the Spirit. That's pretty radical. I mean, I've seen people moving the gifts, and the gifts are real, and something really does happen, and the guy or the woman is really a bitter person. I'll say it again. The gifts of the Spirit without the fruit of the Spirit is not a work of the Spirit. How do you know? How can you say that? 1 Corinthians 13, 1-3 says tongues, prophecy, knowledge without love is what? Nothing. Again, I've already said this, but I want to nail this down so you don't get hear me saying something that I'm not. This is not to be taken to mean that the gifts of the Spirit are not vital and central to the life of the church because they are. In fact, in this whole series we're doing on the ways of God that reveal the glory of God, the final way of God I want to touch on is this, that the way of God that reveals the glory of God is when the people of God move authentically in the power of God. And I want to talk about the gifts of the Spirit. But love comes first. Then he hits in verse 2, prophecy, revelations, and knowledge. And if you just keep in mind the story, chapter 12, he was talking about the gift of knowledge and the gift of prophecy and speaking gifts. So vital are these gifts to the church, whether it's foretelling, and foretelling gets manifested in our church, not so much in people who come by words of knowledge to predict the future. I really don't get much of that, and I don't know if I put much stock in that even. Foretelling prophetically would be more of God speaking to some of you, and it would be confirmed by others about things that God is speaking to us as a church, about spiritual things that he is calling us in deeper ways to. Happens all the time. Forth telling, if you want a paradigm for it, it's not exactly what I do, but it's kind of what I do. It's forth telling the truth of God, the words of God, the seers and the knowers help to make clear the mysteries of the gospel. It is an extremely important gift to be manifested in the church. But in some quarters, this gifting is so highly regarded that arrogance and unkindness is overlooked. It doesn't matter. We call people like that who have giftings like this, but they're kind of mean. It's called a prophetic edge. And some people even begin to get the idea that in order to really be a prophet, you've got to be kind of crusty and mean. Here's the deal. Prophetic people and truth speakers sometimes do say hard things. And the truth, as you know, sometimes does hurt. So what would prophetic, truth-speaking love look like? Well, I don't know exactly, but I can tell you this. It would be patient. It would look like that. It wouldn't push. It wouldn't manipulate. It would speak the truth, but it wouldn't unrelentingly manipulate and push you. It wouldn't force stuff. It would tell the truth. It would be kind. I don't know how else it would look, but it would be kind. would not be arrogant. Incredible damage can sometimes be done by people prophetic who really see truth and use the truth to just fillet people. Humility among the seers can be demonstrated when authentically in their spirit they speak what they have to speak, sometimes with great passion and conviction, but they always consider the possibility that they just may be wrong. Loveless prophets are frightening people. My picture of a love-filled prophet is Jeremiah. He did not rejoice in sin. 1 Corinthians 13 says that's one of the marks of love. Don't rejoice in sin. In fact, one of his primary calls was to expose sin. He brought words of scathing judgment on the people of God. But here's the deal about Jeremiah. He wept every time he spoke. In fact, he was known as the weeping prophet. By the way, bringing judgment and weeping while you do is the heart of God. Jeremiah 13 says this, God speaking through Jeremiah, if you don't repent, people of God, I will bring judgment. Well, that looks mean. Here you go, though. But I will sob in silence at your pride, for the people of God have been taken captive by sin. I will bring judgment, but it will break my heart. I take no joy in sin. Dan Allender, in his book, Bold Love, that I mentioned last week, says this, if I am judged by how I love and not on how many books I write, seminars I give, people I counsel, tie it to the text, prophecies I give or sermons I preach, then at one level, it does not really matter if I write, teach, counsel, prophesy, or preach. It only matters that I love. And then he protests. I love this. Why can't I be judged on what I do well and do every day as a matter of course? Why can't I be judged on how I run my business, how often I'm involved in ministry activity, or how right and true I am? Then he tells a story of a tense argument with his wife over who was going to pick up their daughter from school. He was home working. She was busy and distracted and felt like he could take some time off from his work and go pick her up. He was frustrated, wondering if his wife understood that just because I'm working at home doesn't mean I'm not working. This is still official work. Argument ensued. Fault finding, blame shifting, both sides scored direct hits. She stormed out of the house. He went back to writing his book called Bold Love. And then he says this. I wrote well that day, but I am sadly aware that maybe I lost more than I gained the section that I wrote after our war will be judged not on its merit or practical helpfulness but on whether my heart was lovingly other-centered or hatefully self-obsessed. Really? 1 Corinthians 13 says, really? A prophet, a truth-seer, truth-speaker without love is nothing. Faith, he goes on to say, even the kind that gets things done and moves mountains without love is nothing. So you moved the mountain, you built a church, you made a mark for yourself, but were you kind? I don't know if we have any mountain-moving faith people here. Get it away from, you know, biblical language. These are the movers and shakers. If you're a mover, shaker, mountain-moving man or woman, and you hear what I just said, I would predict that something might just stir in you. When I say, sure, you moved the mountain, but were you kind? Something would erupt in you, maybe like this. Kind? No. Actually, I wasn't kind. If I was kind, this mountain that you are so delighted that we moved, or this church that we're so happy that we built, I'm sorry, but it wouldn't have got built. Somebody had to do the hard stuff of being not kind. because kindness to many of us is mush. Think on this with me because kindness does not have to be mush. Paul Hawke, I think that's how you say it, it's spelled H-A-U-L-K, in a book called Rational Management of Children and Adults. It's a book on parenting styles and he ties it in with management styles. Talks about four styles of leading or managing. First is this. A style that is kind and firm at the same time. Whether that be a church or a family, a business area, this creates people who know the rules, boundaries are clear, consequences are consistent, people get respected, valued, and they also get consequences. Sometimes they even get fired. Second, style is unkind and firm. Staff sergeant's style is this. producing high-performing neurotics. Third is kind and unfirm. This, on the front end, looks like the one I'd like to live in. Everybody's kind, and you can pretty much do whatever you want. It's unfirm. Instead of high-performing neurotics, this produces people with no boundaries at all. They set their own rules. They see themselves eventually as the center of the universe with this overwhelming sense of entitlement. The author calls them the whiners of the world. Fourth style is this, unkind and unfirm. Rules keep changing. One minute they're lax, nothing matters. Next minute you're hammered for every little offense. Eventually, this hopelessly confuses people. It's possible to be kind and firm. So you move the mountain. but were you kind? Were you patient? Patience is another thing that bumps up against the movers and the shaker types who just can't wait. You got to make it happen and we make it happen and then we call it God. Were you willing to wait? Were you willing to wait and let the spirit of God move or did you force it? Did you make it? Did you manipulate it? maybe the final question around this one is and do you really believe that it matters more that you were kind than that you moved the mountain or do you really believe it matters more that you moved the mountain in verse 3 Paul stretches credulity when he says this if I give all my possessions and give it to the poor deliver my body to be burned but don't have love, it profits me nothing. The reason I think that stretches credulity is this. I mean, what other possible motive could there be for giving up all your stuff and giving it to the poor or offering your body to be burned if it isn't love? Well, actually, if you think about it, there are quite a few other motives. Let me say it like this. While it is impossible to genuinely love without giving, serving, or sacrificing, It is altogether possible to give, serve, and sacrifice without love. Because sometimes the reasons people give are really to get, to gain, and to acquire. And if you need an example of that, the Pharisees would be exhibit A, who prayed loud and long, who gave way more than a tenth of everything they had, and the reason they gave it was to be noticed by men. And Jesus said of them, truly I say to you, you have your reward, and your reward is this. you got noticed. People think you're something. And that is why they gave. Had nothing to do with love. So we begin to see that without love, it is possible to do some really good things and yet produce nothing really good. At least nothing eternal. In verses 8 to 12, Paul talks about everything that will pass away. Only three things will last. Faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love. And the Corinthian church had gotten that all messed up. They were pursuing important things like the gifts of the Spirit and the work of God and doing the right stuff. But oddly, all the things they were trying to build, good as they were, were going to pass away. And the one thing that was going to be eternal, they let go of right off the bat. Love. We were at a staff meeting a couple weeks ago talking about this. Al Shuck chimed in with a conversation saying this, you know, it occurs to me that there are a lot of things that we do well here at Open Door and there's a lot of things we don't do well here at Open Door and in our youth group, I really hope that this love thing is one of the things we do well because it seems to matter more than an awful lot of what we worry about. And it seems to matter more than most of what we're trying really hard to do well. So here's the question. Are you patient? Are you kind? Do you love the truth? Are you eager to forgive? Because that's what love looks like. It's not that big a mystery. It isn't jealous. It doesn't brag. It isn't arrogant. It takes no joy in sin, either in doing it or in confronting it. But it will confront it, hopefully, like Jeremiah did. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Verse 7, whatever else that means, I think it means this. that even though I have been by false love disappointed, betrayed, and hurt, I will not abandon hope in the more excellent way. I will not close my heart to love. Even though I want to protect myself when I get wounded, I will not by bitterness, hardness, and rage protect myself. Lord, keep our heart of love alive, tender, open, reachable by your Spirit. Why? Why would I bother? Here's why. Because one of the primary ways of God that reveals the glory of God, especially to people who don't know God, is when the people of God like you and me wrestle with things like this and begin then to demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God. Paul says it this way. And let me just pull it in to close with this. In Colossians 3, 12, and if I could set your heart to this, I would hear this literally. as a word from God, the reading of Scripture, God's words to you. And so as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, that's you, put on like you would put on a coat, a heart of compassion. Put it on, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. Bear with one another, forgive each other, Just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive others. And beyond all these things, put on the coat of love, which is the perfect bond of unity. In addition to those things you need to put on, take some things off. In fact, I'm reading this out of order in Colossians. The things you need to take off come first. Take this off first. Take off anger and wrath and malice and slander, abusive speech from your mouth, and don't lie to each other, and don't lie about each other. As you therefore have received Christ Jesus as Lord, walk in him. Walk in a manner that is worthy of the gospel, consistent with the calling with which you've been called. What would that look like? It would look like humility, gentleness, patience, showing forbearance to one another in love, being diligent. Want something to work at hard? Be diligent. Work hard at this, preserving the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. why? Because there is one body, one spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all, through all, and in all. Last week I closed by giving you an assignment. I want to give you an assignment again today. Two things. First of all, identify one thing on the list that I just gave you out of 1 Corinthians 13 and Colossians chapter 3 that you need to put on. And then identify one thing on the list that you need to take off. Don't go crazy. Don't do the whole list. You'll just be overwhelmed. Just take one thing that you could put on. One thing that you could take off. I don't know what it is for you. Is it patience, kindness, humility, forbearance? Maybe something in your spirit says that, you know, I need to put that one on. Something maybe you need to take off. What is it for you? Maybe jealousy, arrogance, anger, wrath, malice, slander. I need to take that off. Second thing I want you to do, once you identify what would be good to put on and what you maybe need to take off, second thing is recognize now that you can't put it on and you can't take it off by yourself and bring it to God. Even in the quietness of your own heart, maybe even now as I'm speaking, Lord, I'm really struggling trying to get this on. I know, I know. It's ever before me, my sin. I know what I need to put on. But Dave talked about a coat. I can't get my arms back there to get it on. I need some help. God, would you help me on with this? Picture, somebody, come on. I'd like to help you on. Would you help me on with this? I don't wear this well. Lord, I just can't get this thing off. I really want to love but I am filled with anger could you help me could you help me off with this don't go for the whole thing just one thing God help me put this on Lord help me take this off why because one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God especially to people who don't know God is when the people of God like you and me begin to put it on and start to take it off thereby authentically demonstrating the love of God I'd like you to stand as we close the benediction this morning I'm going to read it is a prayer it's the prayer of Paul's it is my prayer let it be ours it comes from the same section I read in Ephesians that speaks about putting it on and taking it off. Here is our hope for having it come off and having it come on when Paul says, Now unto him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we could ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever and ever. The power of God at work in you and me can help us take it off and put it on. And all God's people said, Amen.
