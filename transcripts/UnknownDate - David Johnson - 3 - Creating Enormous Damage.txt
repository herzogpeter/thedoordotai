Open your Bibles with me to the book of James chapter 3. Picking our study up in the second verse through the 12th, James chapter 3 verses 1 through 12. We are entering this morning, the third week of a series of sermons born of this particular section in James that I have entitled, The Taming of the Tongue. It all began in verse 2 of chapter 3 with this acknowledgement from James that we all stumble in many ways We all sin in many ways. Indeed, if any one of us could manage to not stumble in what we say, we'd be a perfect man. But the fact is this, nobody is perfect. We all agree. James tells us why, verse 8, for no one can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil full of deadly poison. And that is why David in Psalm 39.1 said, I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle. That is why the writer of the Proverbs in the 10th verse 19 says, He who restrains his lips is wise. And that is why James in chapter 1 verse 19 says, Let everyone be quick to hear and slow to speak. for the tongue is a restless evil full of deadly poison. A fire held within its boundaries is a good thing. Indeed, a necessary for life thing. But that same fire released from restraint spreads and destroys and kills. And that which is burnt by the fire can never be unburnt. Verse 6, for the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity. Verse 5, behold how great a forest is set aflame and brought down by just a little spark. I invite you again this weekend, as we have been for three weekends, to marvel at the power of the tongue to do, among other things, three things. First of all, we have been marveling at the power of the tongue to set the course of a life into blessing or into cursing. The power of the tongue to speak life into people or speak death into people. Proverbs 18.21 said it this way. For life and death is in the power of the tongue. Like a bit in a horse's mouth, verse 3. Like a rudder on a ship, verse 4. Verse 5 says this. soul, also the tongue, though it is a small part of the body, yet it boasts great things. And among the great things that the tongue boasts is its capacity to set the course of your life and mine into blessing or into curse, into life or into death. The last time we marveled at the capacity of the tongue to do both, bless and curse, speak life and death. In verse 6, however, while acknowledging the tongue's potential to do both good and evil, to speak life and death both, James, in verse 6, begins to focus decidedly on the tongue's destructive potential. So point number two, marvel with me now at the power of the tongue to damage people. Verse 6, the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity. The tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body and sets on fire the course of our life. And the tongue is set on fire by hell. Stop right there. Is set on fire by hell. I wanted you to notice something that I haven't drawn any attention to at all so far in this series. And that is the involvement of hell in the damage that the tongue can do. The role of hell, if you will, is to, according to the verse, set the fire. It is set on fire by hell. say it a different way the role of hell is to light the match it's important that you understand at least the point that James is trying to make relative to the role of hell the role of hell is not to move my tongue indeed hell does not have the power to move my mouth so if with my mouth I do damage somebody asked me why I did that the devil did it, made me do it it doesn't fly It doesn't have the power to move my mouth. It does not have by itself the power to burn down the forest. Its role is to simply this, consistently and incessantly light the match. The picture I have of this is this. Enter into it with me, if you will. That right now, imagine, in this room, there is a not-too-bright, I've chosen to make them not-too-bright, lower level, hyperactive, little demon. And all he's doing is light and matches. There's maybe a few of them, and they're just kind of bouncing all over the gymnasium, light and matching. The fact is this, again, go with this weird picture here. They've been doing it all morning. They were doing it on your way to church this morning in the car. They were doing it in the hallway. They were doing it when you're trying to find a seat. They were doing it when you're trying to find a parking place. Just lighting matches. They were doing it during worship. They were doing it during the announcements. They were doing it when I began. They're doing it right now. And you know what? They're going to keep on doing it when you leave. And you walk out the door and you bump into people in the hall. And you have some fellowship in the center over there. And as you gather with your friends or family around dinner, they're just going to be lighting matches. And here's the deal. nothing's happening. I mean, you don't get to see what I get to see. If there's pictures, see, they're just doing it, and there's matches. See, there's little burned-out matches all over the floor. Can you see them? See, only the really spiritual ones can. I kind of feel like saying to this little hyperactive weenie of a demon, you know, I just want to say, you know, knock yourself out. It isn't working. In fact, during the worship time, as the hearts of men and women in this place began to soften and open, and we directed our spirits toward God, and the worship built more powerfully and more powerfully, the wind of God began to blow these little demons. They almost quit because they couldn't even get the man to let the wind of God was blowing. They're stupid. They just kept on going, and nothing happened. And here's the deal. 90% of the time, it's the way it is. Nothing happens unless the match that he throws on this day, in this meeting, in this circumstance, with the particular things stirring inside of me that on this day are stirring inside of me, unless that little goofy match finds my fuel. and then there's an ignition and then there's a fire and when that happens the fire is ignited and even with the fire ignited my tongue has not necessarily engaged but the tongue is aware that a fire has started and it's just sitting there talking to you saying basically this, can I go now? Can I say it now? Can I nail them now? I got some really choice words. I'm 43 years old. I got lots of words I know. And I'm even talking to my tongue because the fire got pretty big pretty quick. I'm pretty ticked. And I say to me, tongue, tongue, are you ready? And my tongue says, I was born ready. Well, it was. It was a restless evil full of deadly poison. And if the fire is ignited because the little match found your fuel, and then if the fire finds your tongue and your tongue is released, damage will be done. You didn't intend to do it. You didn't mean to do it. At least that's what you'll say. But damage will be done. Now add to this little scenario I've given so far the fact that not all demons are lower level. Not all demons are a little hyperactive, light matches all the time. And not all demons are not too bright. Some are cunning, wise, and subtle in demonic ways. The Bible talks about the schemes of the devil, the wiles of the devil. And what they do in demonic wisdom is wait for your fuel to leak. And if they're really wise, they will wait for the leaky fuel that you have to not only leak, but to accumulate for a little while. And then at the right moment, at the right time, maybe allowing this gas to leak for a few years. When it will do the most damage to you, to your family, to the kingdom cause. One match. Just one. Not hyperactive. Just one match. Finds that fuel. And when that match finds the built-up fuel of my selfishness. Or it finds the built-up fuel of my arrogance or my bitterness. Or my pride or that pool of insecurity. That has never quite been fully touched by amazing grace. Or when that match finds the unresolved conflict, the unhealed wound, the undealt with sin, whoosh. Now, when the match finds the fuel, the fire is ignited, the tongue is engaged, two kinds of fire are rather common. Now, this is not exhaustive. There are probably different kinds of fire, but two occur to me. Two kinds of damage can be done. The first kind of damage is explosive. Obviously, with this metaphor of a match and leaky gas, explosive kinds of damage is what we think of most. I mean, we've all experienced that thing on a summer afternoon where we're going to cook up to get the grill going, and it's a gas grill, and you turn on the propane, and you lighten your light, and it's not kicking, it's not kicking, and the gas is fuming, and it's building up, and you don't care. You keep on hitting the match, and you don't turn it off, and finally, what happens? The little spark does connect, and whoosh, it almost knocks you over. Whoosh! I don't even know the name of the movie. But the favorite opening scene of a movie for me of all time is this. Now, maybe somebody can tell me the movie, and I'll be able to go get it, because I don't even know what it was. But here's what it was. This guy who was disguised as a furnace repairman, or he was like a gas meter reader guy, was a hitman, in fact. and he knocks on the door of this unsuspecting person that they're supposed to nail, and he convinces this stupid person to let them in their house, and they're here to check the gas. There's a leak in the neighborhood, and we're checking all the furnaces, and, okay, fine, fine, fine. So the guy goes in there, and he checks the gas. Well, what he does is he unhooks the gas line and leaves the gas flowing, and then he runs out and leaves the house, and a few minutes later, a couple hours later, I don't know, somebody turns on a light, or a pilot light goes on, or some tiny little match goes, and this house just ka-booing. And you know what? They showed this thing. They showed this house blow up like five different times from five different angles. It was a thing of beauty. It was amazing. Here's the point. When the flame finds the fuel, especially if it's built up, it's going to go boom. There's going to be a lot of damage done. Especially, hear this, at ground zero. In that one little, it might not even spread to the whole neighborhood. Might just be between me and my wife, the kids won't even. But at ground zero, when it's explosive, big time damage right there. But you know what? Not everybody blows up. sometimes it's not explosive sometimes the fire that's lit is a slow burn and sometimes something can be ignited in you or me and to look at you we never know in the interchange we're having something's ignited some pool of whatever is found by the match that this little hyperactive guy's always throwing and something's lit and I keep on smiling There's no twitch in my face. Nothing that would indicate a fire got lit. And rather than an explosion, it's a little bit more like the burner on a stove. Very controlled. Even looks appropriate. But the way it works is this. Everybody who comes close to me, I will heat them up with what I'm hot about. And in that way, when my heat finds your gas, the fire begins to spread and spread and spread. And the damage of this kind of fire is that indeed it spreads to the point where you don't even know where ground zero was. You never do blow up. You know what, I'm convinced that there are some people who in their whole life never blow up. But they're really on fire. There's something burning. Their fuel has been ignited. And everyone who comes close to them gets heated up. You're in a conversation. It kind of works like this. You know, it wasn't even, it wasn't what they said. It was the way they said it. And the way they said it, the way they said it, found some little pool of insecurity, some strongly held opinion, because it seemed like they were disagreeing with your opinion, and the match was thrown, and it found this little pool of flammable gas. And you felt somehow slighted or hurt. The flame is ignited. It's nowhere near blowing. You're nowhere near blowing. But you go away from that little interchange that took four minutes at the most. And you go away with an opinion. He's a jerk. He's an idiot. He's insensitive. She's arrogant. They're mean. I wonder if anybody else feels this way about them. I don't know. I'm not going to go blabbing this all around, but I might ask a few choice people. You know, I have a spirit. It starts spreading. You get a little heat. It's not explosive. It's just a little thing. And you go and you heat somebody else. And, boy, it's incredible if you can find their gas. It's weird because all of a sudden they might even have a bigger flame than you do. And they didn't even have the original. You see where this is? This is scary. You don't know what I'm talking about, do you? You've never done any of this. Me neither. But actually what we do with this feeling that got ignited, it's not explosive, but it's a burn there. we indeed, we start looking for proof that that yucky feeling is really true, and they really are a jerk. It's an interesting thing, I kind of was thinking about this, talking to a friend of mine who told me, Mike Anderson, one of our elders, told me about a dynamic that is actually called the Pygmalion Syndrome, and it is what I'm talking about right here. The Pygmalion Syndrome is that you have an experience like this, And from that point on, everything you think about that person begins to be colored negatively. Let's say you just decide about someone that they're irresponsible, they're arrogant, they're untrustworthy, they're unloving. And even though they might have 25 behaviors that would speak to the fact that that's not true, that they maybe are responsible, are humble, none of those are, they don't count. But if you can find one in the 25 that kind of looks a little arrogant or whatever that thing you've decided to do, you grab out of that and it just becomes, you build your case. And it starts to color everything you think about the person. Let me kind of play this out between a parent, a child, and then a child and a parent. Let's say the parent decides, my son, my daughter is irresponsible. You are irresponsible. And I decide that about you. It's not an irresponsible behavior that we're going to deal with. You are irresponsible. So over the next month, even though there might be several behaviors that indicate that he does have some responsibility, he acted responsibly here, here, here, and here, those times don't even count, but the one time they didn't just begins to be the truth about you. And all of a sudden, under that kind of Pygmalion dynamic, you can't get out from under that. Now be the kid. because maybe your parents brought some discipline in your life. Let's say it's even an appropriate discipline and they kind of gave you some restrictions for your own health. You got kind of upset about that. And now you decide they just don't love me. They just don't love me. My parents are unloving. And even though in the course of a month you might have a hundred examples that they are indeed very, very committed to your welfare, doesn't count, doesn't count, doesn't count, doesn't count. One time they say no. One time they restrict. One time they bring discipline. Whoosh. Fire is lit. And the opinion is beginning to be more and more and more concrete. And then you go and share it with somebody else and find their guess. Proverbs 26 verse 22 I read a couple weeks ago says this. lack of wood, the fire goes out. But here's the problem. We can always find some wood. Here's the problem. You can always find somebody else, even though the flame in you isn't explosive, you're not blowing anybody up, but you can always find with your little flame somebody else's gas. Somebody else's insecurity. Somebody else's unresolved conflicts. It's just not that hard to find. Some of us, indeed, have formed friendships. This one hurts. Some of us have, indeed, formed friendships based on who we dislike together. People do that. Forming friendships out of this, who we agree together is a jerk. Forming friendships out of agreeing together who's wrong and bad. And the weird thing is, is that when you find yourself united in this instant friendship because you both agree she's really bad, you weren't even friends before. But now we have so much in common. It's weird, this is not a minor thing. People write books about this stuff. A guy named Eric Hoffer, in his book, The Passionate State of Mind, wrote this. Nothing binds people together quicker than sharing the same enemy. The quickest shortcut, that being the operative word shortcut, to feeling instantly close, it's a phony intimacy, the quickest shortcut to feeling instantly close to someone is to discover someone you know that they don't like and criticize them. Instant friends. It's false intimacy. When the match finds built-up fuel and it's explosive, as I said, lots of damage at ground zero. When it's a slow burn, it spreads broadly lots of damage. Can't even find ground zero. And so pulling all that together, we marvel at the power of the tongue to do a lot of damage. Finally, and what we're going to spend the next couple of weeks on with all of that as kind of our groundwork of understanding, marvel now, point number three, at the power of the tongue to reveal, number one, that you leak flammable fuel. And marvel at the power of the tongue to reveal where you leak flammable fuel. All of this is going to come out of verses 9 through 12. Let's read them. With the tongue, James says, we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who have been made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth comes both blessing and cursing, life and death. My brethren, these things ought not be this way. Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water? Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine tree produce figs? Neither can salt water produce fresh. The point here is this, simply, That bitter water, you need to understand, came from some place. It is not a mirage. There might be sweet water coming from you. But if there is mixed in with it bitter water, it came from a bitter place. Fig trees do not produce olives. They are incapable of producing olives. So if in the middle of your fig tree, by the way, there really is a fig tree. You really are redeemed. but if in the middle of your fig tree there comes sprouting up an olive and you find one in the branches don't be wondering about whether you got a problem with an olive root you have olives do not come there is a root of an olive I guess olives are bad, I don't know in there somewhere works like this the match is lit, it finds your fuel the fire is ignited the tongue is engaged, the damage is done. Sometimes people do that and never even see the damage that they did. They just kind of walk through life obliviously, starting fires blowing. Don't ever even see the damage they did. But let's say you're past that. Let's say your tongue has been ignited and you did some damage with your tongue, whether it be explosive or the slow burn, and now you see it. And you come up feeling what just about everybody feels when it comes to you. You feel bad. And you're really sorry. And you say you're sorry. And you say it profusely. Overall, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You cry even when you say it. And then we often find ourselves saying things like this. I don't know exactly why. Maybe to somehow minimize the damage. I think it's kind of to get ourselves somehow off the hook. We say this. I didn't mean it. I really didn't mean it. You even believe that when you say it. To which James, I believe, is saying in this section, essentially this. I'm really glad you're sorry. But I have every intention, if you're willing to hang with me here in these few verses, to push you past your sorry, sorry, sorry thing. And another thing I want to tell you before we even get going here, I think James is saying, is this. This business about I didn't mean it, I really didn't mean it, don't say that again. Here's why. Because that word you said in the heat of battle came from some place. Because that rage, that rumor you spread, that slander with a smile, that innuendo, that person you blew, that came from some place. See, here's the deal. A fountain cannot send forth bitter water unless there's something bitter there. Are you willing to wonder about that? A fig tree cannot produce olives unless there is the root of an olive there. So please don't tell me. It doesn't help. I didn't mean it. What would help, what would really feel like some repentance is if you came up wondering a little bit about where that came from. Just acknowledging that you did it is step one. But you have not gone very far. I'm simply doing that. Question of the day, therefore, is this. Are you willing to wonder about the root? I want to invite you into this, because in ways that I don't, quite frankly, even recall doing many times before, I want to pull you into something that's going to create work for you when you leave. It's not even going to be done here, but kind of, are you willing to wonder with me about the root, about the almost uncontrollable reflex that you have at times. Not every day, not all the time. You really are a fig tree. There really is a lot of sweet water. But that almost uncontrollable reflex you have at times to undermine him, to ridicule and diminish her, to expose them, that almost uncontrollable reflex you have from time to time that quite frankly embarrasses you even to embellish the fact. You ever do that? You walk away from interchange and you just kind of, you can just feel like a peacock. Puffed up and you made it a little bit bigger and a little bit better and you walk away going, why did I do that? Are you willing to wonder and press past just feeling bad that you did that again and wonder where that's coming from? Are you willing to wonder about this almost uncontrollable reflex that you have to jump to conclusions, to pass on a juicy morsel, to talk about her to him without ever talking to her. For the truth you know is this, that that particular arena of your life gets ignited over and over and over and over again. The assignment I have for you in terms of wondering, and it's my assignment too, is not to come to God and wonder about that time you six years ago did this once. That's a blip on the screen. I'm talking about inviting you into a process where you invite God into that arena of your life where over and over and over again you get ignited. Explosives sometimes, slow burn others, heat everybody else up. You still got a smile. People walk away from you obliterated because of your explosions, lots of damage, ground zero didn't spread very far off. You wanted to look there. Not just that you did it, but where it came from. Willing to wonder about what's fueling your fire. About where does you leak the flammable fuel? Well, I've been spending a lot of time on this myself. Wondering that very thing. About me, about the issue, about us. And I've thought so far of four things. And these are real big things, so under them are a lot of applications. Four things, four areas that routinely cause us to leak. I'm only going to get to one. In fact, only part of one tonight, today. The primary of them being, the primary place I think we leak, in my opinion, is hurt. When we get hurt. Hurt all by itself does not loose your tongue to do damage. Indeed, some people deal in incredibly healthy ways with their hurt, saying when the hurt happens, what you did really hurt me. And they say it out loud and they deal with it straight. I'm talking about a whole different... I'm talking about when our hurt gets ignited with the flame of anger and then that flame hits our tongue. Here's the deal. Seems to me as I reflect on me that there is no time at which I need to be more aware of my potential to do irreparable damage to my marriage, to my children, to my career, to my friendships, to the church, to the ministry, to kingdom cause, than when I have been for some reason hurt, and that hurt has been ignited and now is either smoldering or exploding with anger. If ever there would be an appropriate time in my life or in yours to know this is the time to put a muzzle on it, It's when I get my feelings hurt. Right now, shut up, Dave. Just know everything you say is not inspired. Believe me. Be quiet. Be slow to speak. Be slow to speak. Be slow to speak. Put a muzzle on it now. Now, even as I say that, however, I wonder how many of you kind of have the feeling, instinctively know that while putting a muzzle on it at a critical time when the match has been thrown and it found my fuel and I really, oh, I'm ready to give somebody some advice. Many of you instinctively know that as good of advice as it is to put a muzzle on it at that moment, that putting a muzzle on it is not getting anywhere near the roots of the problem. Because I could put a muzzle on it and not say the words, but the fire has still been ignited. So let's ask a deeper question. It's this. How does the hurt get ignited? How does the hurt that is so easily ignited even happen? Well, this is where these sermons become serious. Because, I mean, we could go on and on for all the different ways that we get hurt and then ignite it. Sometimes it's someone else's tongue. Someone else's slander. someone else's explosion and it creates an awesome wound and it's just not going away. Sometimes it is a truly abusive situation, an unfair, hurtful kind of treatment. And I'm going to tell you that next week we're going to deal with those kinds of things and the kinds of hurts that leave us wounded and for some reason the pool of that unhealed wound just keeps on getting ignited over and over. It shows up in my marriage. It shows up at work. I'm going to talk about that more next time because before I could even get to that, I thought of something that happens in some ways more commonly even than that. It's this. Sometimes the heat that so easily ignites me and I think you and then makes my tongue dangerous because of it is the hurt that is incurred because I just plain didn't get what I wanted. And when my plan is thwarted, and when my agenda is frustrated, my goal is blocked, my dream is dashed, my need is not met, when someone has the gall to say to me, no. No. Have you ever had anybody say no to you? No, you don't get the raise. Okay. No, you don't get the promotion. No, you don't get the job. Well, good. That's fine. Trust in the Lord. No big deal. Doesn't make us bad people. Doesn't make us evil. Doesn't mean we aren't a true fig tree. But little fire, little things ignited. Somebody said no to me. No, we're not going to utilize your idea in the next phase of the business. Say it in a nice way. You know what? You are a valued employee. We really care about you. We want you to be part of our future for years to come. And your idea was a really good one. But we're going to use Mary's idea this time. Hang on ears. We may get to it later. okay no problem nobody even knows the fire was lit smile on your face wonder if anybody else has been treated like this you think you'll be able to find some fuel no we're not going to accept your proposal no we're not going to have sex tonight no you can't have the car son it's okay dad love you little fire big fire no you can't go there with your friends no you can't no I don't want to date you anymore okay in fact say it a nice way you are one of the are you hearing this one are one of the nicest people I've ever met I adore you. You love God. You just, whoo, what can I say? But not only do I need to break up, the reason we need to break up is, you know, we have this thing about telling the truth. At Open Door, I tell the truth. I kind of like him. Okie dokie. You know, Tom announced it on Friday. Bonnie and I are going to talk about our courtship and how we fell in love. You know, you're going to find this unbelievable. But there was a time in our courtship that Bonnie broke up with me. She went nuts. She went a little mental for a while. I'm from the south side of Chicago. So all my buddies, they come up to me and say, Dave, I hear Bonnie dumped you. why'd she dump you well she said something about me being a selfish jerk but I know that ain't it you know I think she's getting into the drug scene oh that's a funny one get your feelings hurt get your feelings hurt and a fire is ignited and if the tongue gets engaged we can begin to lie and we'll even think it's the truth because out of that hurt when the tongue is released do you know I have more to my list of things that are flammable but do you know of anything more flammable than a hurt feeling that can't be dealt with straight like, that really hurts me and I need to deal with the hurt. No. Smile. Whoa. Explode. Feel big and strong because you did that. Tell them what for. When we were two and heard the word no, we had a tantrum. It did look good then. It was very unappealing then. And when you're 2 or 22 or 32 or 42, the tantrum still looks as absolutely, beyond belief, selfish as it is. But not everybody has tantrums. They do the slow burn, never blow, just heat everybody else up. I had an interesting time this last week with my mom. I was down in Florida this week. My dad is doing an interim ministry in Florida right now, and they had me come down, and I did a series of meetings last Sunday and then most of the week. And it was really a fun thing to be with him and kind of do some stuff with him. You know, it was really neat. But I had some unusually intimate times with my mom. I shared some stuff about where I'm at and some stuff that God's revealing to me, even about this stuff here. And even did some mom work with her, between her and I, and it was wonderful. I think partly because I opened up to her, she began to open up to me and shared some rather intimate things that she indicated was okay for me to share with you at least this. What she shared with me, among other things, was that how because of some real violent anger in her home that I kind of knew about a little bit, but the depth of it I did not know. But because of the violent anger in the family she grew up in, especially from her dad, she had a really hard time with anger at all. And just kind of determined, I'm never going to be, I'm not going to be. So she never learned how to deal with anger in an appropriate way, which would be to kind of go straight to the person you have the issue with and talk about your anger. And not just your hurt, but your anger. And sometimes righteously, we get angry or mistaken, but we go to the person. She could never do that. But a few years ago, one of the things she noticed in her life, and this is when all the kids are gone and she's just kind of doing her stuff. She's a wonderful lady. And she's doing her stuff. She just noticed that, and I talked to your dad about, I'm just getting my feelings hurt all the time. She said, I go to church, and three times, there's some feelings hurt, and I'll go home and I'll be ticked. But I'm not ticked. I'm not angry. I'm just hurt. I'm not ticked. And what she came in touch with, what she couldn't get angry, she just always got hurt. And hurt was okay for her. She really was angry, but anger wasn't okay. She could do hurt, and so she got... See, I would just kind of embrace hurt, and I would play the victim, and I would smile sweetly, and I had these little Christian things, but what I would do is I'd take my little stove burner, and I'd go to your dad, and I'd heat him up. And my dad was wired a little different. He had a lot of gas, and he'd go, I will save you now. and I'm saying to my mom wow what a great insight that explains a lot and then I shared with her how I feel like I'm just the opposite when she said that I says wow no I'm I'm we are we are we both have gas that leaks I'm the opposite you embrace your hurt hurt's okay for you to show. Hurts the last thing I want to show. I don't know if it's a guy thing or not. It doesn't matter about that. Hurts the last thing I want to show. Weakness is the last thing. I'd be scared to death if anybody got close to me feeling stupid or being looking stupid. And if anybody gets close to that, showing I'm hurt would be a wonderful relief. I'm far more prone to embrace a boom, which basically serves to keep people away from the places I feel weak and small and hurt. Wow, what an incredible insight. That is really helpful. You know what? It's really not that helpful knowing that. Let me clarify that. It really is important to know that. And at a certain level, it's important to know that I get ignited and that my mom gets, and so do you. It's important for her to know her tendency to withdraw, get hurt, put on a smile, heat somebody else up, and play the victim. It's really important for her to know that that's her way. And it's really important for me to know that my tendency is to do the opposite. But while those tendencies reveal that we leak flammable stuff, they do not. if that's all you've done in your process, you have not gone far enough. Because they don't reveal where you leak the flammable fuel. They don't reveal why you leak. They don't reveal the source. I mean, a lot of us start doing our things, and we kind of discover, well, you know, when I'm in this, this is how I tend to blame. And we almost embrace it. We go, that's just kind of the way I am. As if we're telling the people around us, so live with it. Well, yeah, that's the way I am. so what is the source what is the flammable fuel that's leaking in contexts like this feelings are hurt and somebody said no well as I search my own heart I think it's this I think that it is my I think that it is our relentless, obsessive, unyielding commitment to me my overwhelming preoccupation with myself, with my plan and my agenda and my idea and my wants and my whims and my dream and my desire and very few things on earth have more power to reveal my unbelievably militant and strong commitment to myself, very few things on the face of the earth have more power to reveal my arrogance, my selfishness, our preoccupation with ourselves than when someone like your husband or your wife or my wife says to this, to you, this. No. Or when someone like your boss or your friend or the agent at the ticket counter says, no. Very few things have more power to reveal how committed I am to me. James 4 verses 1 and 2 says exactly this. What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members? You lust and you do not have. You wanted it but you didn't get it. So you commit murder. And you're envious and you cannot obtain. You can't get what you wanted. Bottom line, source of the hurt, flammable fuel, is that you cannot obtain. I can't get what I want when I want it. I can't get the person I want. I can't get the position I want. I can't get the answer I want. I can't get the strokes I want. I can't get the flight I want. I went to the store and I couldn't get the color I want. Can you believe in this day and age, Dayton's didn't have my size? Sorry. I mean, what does that mean? And I mean, it's not almost embarrassing. It is embarrassing. And when these things happen, I almost take them like a gift and begin to wonder. They put a pickle on my hamburger. I told them not to put a pickle on my hamburger. Here and now I'm a block away from Burger King, you know this idiot. Take the pickle off. I heard about, somebody actually did that once. I heard about that. Let me pull it in. I'm starting to get the idea as I talk about these things and hopefully touch some very real chords in your heart. They are in mine. That in order for us as a people to walk deeply into these truths, that in order to genuinely cut off the leaks of our flammable fuel, are you beginning to get the idea that it's going to take something more substantial than a muzzle. David's advice was good. I want to guard my mouth as with a muzzle, and in the heat of the moment, at that critical moment, I need to have some self-discipline and just shut my mouth. But are you becoming a little bit more aware that for the long haul, if we're really going to get to the core of these things, we're going to have to do more than put a muzzle on it. A muzzle buys you time to discover where the leak is. That in fact, what it is going to take is a deep, penetrating, liberating, healing, and here's an operative word in the whole thing, an ongoing work of God deep in here. As I get in touch with some of my inner longings, deep longings, have-to-haves, and how it is when those things aren't met when I want them by you or you or you, how literally I can keep this man's face with rage. sometimes comes. Sometimes it's even a rage at God. Penetrating, healing, ongoing work of God inside. Rots come upon by honestly seeing the depth of our sin, the overwhelming breadth of our selfishness. And then, please, beloved, not to be left just smelling as Busby's been talking about these Wednesdays, just smelling our depravity. I'd blow my brains out if all I did was look at my depravity. But in looking at our depravity, then come up staggered, staggered once again at the power of amazing grace to come into those places where I leak gas. That is so easily, even by this low-level, not real bright deal, just lights matches, and I'm a victim of even stupid schemes. for grace to come into those places and heal and forgive and begin to literally cap off some of those places in me where the gas leaks? Are you willing to wonder about where you leak? Are you willing to invite God into that? I'm leaving you with an assignment. If you prayer journal, maybe you don't, so you just maybe think about this all week, But if you prayer journal, tomorrow morning when you get up or whenever you do it, write at the top a question. David Johnson, are you willing to wonder about, for some of you, you need to just even begin to recognize that you've done some damage. And God revealed to me those places, not just it was a blip on the screen six years ago, but I'm talking about those places that time after time after time, in our marriage and my relationship, that this thing really does show up a lot, this way of yours. Could be explosive, could be the slow burn. And now, God, I want to invite you into that place. And, Lord, I am willing to wonder about where it is I leave. About what the sort, would you begin to move there and reveal those things to me? And, God, I could never do this if it wasn't for grace. Could you bring your grace to it and help me look at it? And then, dear Jesus, by your spirit, and maybe with some friends, and maybe in a support group where I share these things, and go a little bit past, well, I've discovered my way. Well, this is what I do. No, no, no, to go past that and say, you know, maybe it's the source of this. I just need to say I am so overwhelmingly committed to me. It's even starting to make me sick. Are you willing to wonder? I'll tell you, you know what I believe with all my heart? As I invite God into those places, he begins to reveal some things and he begins to heal things. And I believe with all my heart, if hanging on to amazing grace, just invite God into some of those places, he'll continue and begin, and then he'll continue to do an amazing work of finding your gas and showing you where you leak. And maybe by yourself with God, but maybe with some friends, and maybe with some counseling kind of, you can cap that leak. Take a lot of work. We're going to talk a little bit more about that next week as well. I'd like you to stand as we close in prayer. And I'd like you not to leave because I want to pray over you a prayer that will kind of seal this whole thing and set us up for what we have to do this week. Would you close your eyes and just bow your head with me and pray together with me in your spirit. Holy Father, we invoke your name right now and believe that by invoking the name of Jesus, we have the power and authority to come into your presence. And Lord, we sang in the worship time about your holiness and your majesty. And it is amazing that we can stand in your holy presence. We're so grateful for grace. Who among us could stand without grace? Who among us would have the courage to look at where they leaked their gas without amazing grace? So first, we just bless you. We bless you for amazing grace that would allow us to even begin this process. But now, Father, we invite you into those inner places of our hearts. Quite frankly, we are afraid to look at ourselves. We're very afraid to show our friends. Lord we don't even want you to see even though we know you do we don't want to look at it Father God we invite you into that place those places that hurt feelings live and maybe very real abuses live that we guard and protect and defend and so easily are ignited around God we pray that you come into those places and reveal to us what we leak and where we leak and Holy Spirit move among us as individuals and as a body to begin to do the amazing ongoing work of capping some of those places where our gas leaks over and over and over again Lord I say this request and I don't think it is just going to happen with a wave of an arm but begin deeply to set us free from ourselves to really trust you with some of those wounded places so we really can authentically love people forgive people bless and not curse people. Some of us have work to do with forgiveness. Needing it for ourselves, for ways that we have with our tongues done damage. Some of us needing to extend forgiveness to people who have done damage to us. God, just do this work. I pray for real gifts this week, as some take very seriously even this assignment, that you would meet with us and everyone who wants a meeting with you, that it be done in Jesus' name. Amen.
