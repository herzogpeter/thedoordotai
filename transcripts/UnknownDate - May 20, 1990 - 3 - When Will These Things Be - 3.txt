We're dealing these weeks, as most of you know, as we've gone through our study in the book of Matthew, we've come to chapter 24, and we're dealing with the Olivet Discourse. It covers chapter 24 and 25, and in these chapters we have revealed to us by Christ the events that are going to be surrounding His second coming. The context of these events is two days before His crucifixion, so there is an amount of tension involved in this. We see in this context the disciples leaving the temple as this discourse is precipitated by verses 1 through 3 in chapter 24. They're leaving the temple and having come out of the great confrontation that was there, they are now ascending the Mount of Olives. And as they ascend the Mount of Olives late in the day with the sun setting, the disciples happen to look back on the temple buildings. They draw Jesus' attention to the temple buildings. and when they do that, Jesus gives them a frightening prophecy when he says, you see all those buildings? Take a very good look, because I am telling you that not one stone will be left upon another. He was prophesying the literal destruction of Jerusalem that was to take place in 70 A.D. And out of that prophecy came the question of the disciples that is the basis for the entire Olivet Discourse, because all the Olivet Discourse really is, is Jesus answering this question. And the question was this, When will these things be, Jesus, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age? We have pointed out over the last couple of weeks that the question that they are asking is a two-part question. When will these things be? That is, when will these things that you just prophesied about not one stone being left upon another, when will that happen? The second part of the question was this, and when is the sign of your coming? That is, when is the sign or the parousia, the full presence, When are you going to bring the kingdom in its fullness? And when is the end of the age? To the disciples, that was one question. They saw all of those events happening at one time. Through history, we're able to look back and recognize that that's a two-part question. When is the destruction of Jerusalem going to happen? And when is the end of the age going to happen? When will the parousia, the full presence of your kingdom, come? And so it is that in response to that question, Jesus answers. And like the question, his answer is twofold as well. There are two objectives that Jesus has. The first objective is to assure the disciples and to again say to them, disciples, the full presence, the end of the age is not yet. At the end of verse 6, at the beginning of verse 6, it says, you're going to hear of wars and rumors of wars in every generation all through time. Don't be frightened about that. For these things must take place, but that is not yet the end. Verse 8, these are all things, again, that will happen in every generation, but they are merely the beginning of birth pangs. The first point of the Olivet Discourse was to assure them the full presence, the full end is not yet. But the second point was to prepare them for what would be, not only in their lifetime, and what would be in their lifetime would be martyrdom and tremendous tribulation, but also to be preparing every believer and every generation following the generations of the disciples up to and including the end of the age. And what would be for every generation of believers up to and including the end would be conflict, would be warfare with the enemy of men's souls, would be tribulation of sorts. In John 15, verse 20, Jesus said to the disciples, Disciples, you need to understand something, that the servant is not above his master. And I'm not saying that you absolutely all will feel the same degree of birth pain, but you need to expect that what I get is what you might get as well. And that word goes through all generations to the end of the age, including the end of the age. John 16, 33, he said, Disciples, in me you will have peace, but in the world you will have tribulation. Take courage, I have overcome the world, but in the world you're going to have conflict. So it is that Jesus warns the disciples about the age they live in. The warning moves down the corridors of history to every age and every generation up to and including the end of the age. And so it is that as he begins in verse 4 and following to give signs or indicators, warnings of the end of the age, we have taken the position in our exegesis that Jesus is not saying these warnings or giving these warnings and signs to them so that they could be or so that we could become good sign watchers of the end times. He is not giving them these signs so that they could be or that we could be good parousia predictors. He is giving them these warnings and signs, and he is giving us these warnings and signs, and every generation these warnings and signs, so that every generation, us included, the end of the age included, could be prepared to hang on to Jesus for dear life their whole life. And the cry of victory in every generation of believers down the quarters of history into the end of the age is this. Our only hope is Jesus. Our only hope to handle the sin that we live in, the onslaught of the enemy, if it is the ultimate tribulation, even to overcome that, is that we overcome by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of our testimony, loving not our lives, even unto death, our only hope is Jesus, for whatever it is we face. Verse 4, through verse 14, he began to give general signs that to one degree or another would mark every generation. every generation disciples is going to have false teachers every generation is going to have wars and rumors of wars famines earthquakes luke added disease and increase in demonic activity but when we came to verse 14 there was a significant change there was a changing of the gears the very end of that verse it says and then after we see in every generation these general signs that all do indeed speak of the end, but they're only birth pangs. At the end, the end will come, verse 14. And that marks a change here. There's something different. There is a moving past here in verse 14, the general signs that will mark every age to more specific signs that will mark the end of the age. And in verse 15, it makes it very specific. Therefore, when you see this specific sign, the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place. The abomination of desolation. In some detail two weeks ago, we went into what this abomination of desolation is. And what we discovered is this, that while Daniel's prophecy here of an abomination of desolation was partially fulfilled in events that transpired 175 years before Christ even said these words with the abomination that was perpetrated by Antiochus Epiphanes, What we discovered as we went back to Daniel and learned what was being said there, that the prophecy of Daniel had a decidedly end-of-man's-day focus. It was not fully fulfilled in the destruction of the temple in 70 A.D. It was not fully fulfilled in the abomination of desolation by Antiochus Epiphanes 400 years after and 175 years before. 400 years after Daniel's prophecy, 175 years before the life of Christ. but that it would be ultimately fulfilled in the end of the age. The abomination of desolation that is spoken of here, in my opinion, by Jesus is a yet-to-take-place event that will mark the final three and a half years of man's day. The perpetrator of that abomination will be the Antichrist. Every generation will have Antichrist. In the last day, the ultimate Antichrist will rise. And that Antichrist, as we discussed a couple of weeks ago, will make a covenant according to Daniel 9, verse 27, with Israel. And the Antichrist will come on a platform of peace, preaching peace, and will seem to be the protector of Israel. And will even, in a three-and-a-half-year period, three-and-a-half years into the seven-year tribulation, come to the aid militarily of Israel and protect it and push back the armies of the north and the east and the south, as we read in Daniel chapter 11. But at the end of that victory, Israel looking at the Antichrist, again, not calling it the Antichrist, you're our wonderful hero, breathing a tremendous sigh of relief, the Antichrist will then turn and totally dominate Israel, setting up at that time what Daniel 11 describes as the ultimate abomination of desolation. At that time, not only will the desire of the Antichrist and Satan be to crush Israel, But also Revelation 13 reveals that at that time it will be given to him that is Satan, it will be given to him that is the Antichrist, to make war with the saints. Therefore, now we're back to our text, 24, verse 15 and 16, those of you who are here when these events transpire and you see the abomination of desolation, what you need to do is run. What you need to do is understand that something apocalyptic is about to happen. We are entering into verse 21, a tribulation. For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall. In fact, it was so powerful that unless, verse 22, those days had been cut short. Remember two weeks ago we said the days themselves were shortened. The daylight was cut back. Not the number of days. It was three and a half years. That was set. But the time of day was cut back so that there could be protection for the sake of the elect who, according to this, are there at that time. Verse 16 to 28, describe the events and give instruction and warning to those who would be here at that time. The book of Revelation then reveals that this seven-year period, which again is being described here in verse 16 to 28, is a time that for the world would be a time of great wrath. God's wrath will be poured out. It speaks of seven seals being broken, seven bulls. They are bulls of wrath being poured out onto the world. For the Jew, it will be also a time of great tribulation. It will also, however, for the Jew, be a time of tremendous redemption. It will be a time of powerful reclaiming for God these men and women, Jewish men and women. Zechariah 12 says of this time that Jews will mourn over Jesus as an only son, meaning this. They are then going to see what they didn't see before, and that is that Jesus is indeed the Messiah, the only Son, the only Messiah. And there will be powerful redemption for the saints during this period, described in verse 16 to 28. It will be, again, for them a time of great tribulation, tribulation that is through every generation, but in the end, more intense and closer together. Revelation 6, 9 says that in this period, I looked after the seal was broken, and under the altar I saw the souls of saints who were slaughtered during this time in Revelation 17, 6 of this period. It says that the false system became drunk on the blood of the martyred saints, the believers. It is also for the believers, however, a time of tremendous protection this period of time. Went into that a little bit last time. It says in verse 22, for the sake of the elect, the days literally were shortened. Time of protection. Revelation 12 spoke of the protection of the archangel Michael. I'm not going to go into that this morning, but just kind of recall the power of protection, even while these dastardly things are happening. Revelation 9, verse 4, discovered this this week, speaks of during this great tribulation that the saints are going to receive a seal from God, a seal of the Spirit some way from God, so that when all this wrath of God is being poured out, that wrath will not fall on the believers. If you're looking for an image to connect with, it's much like Egypt. When God moved with the plagues through Egypt to release the people of God, but if I see the blood sprinkled on the doorpost, I will what? Pass over you. Wrath was everywhere in Egypt. Wrath of God is being poured out in the tribulation, but there will be protection for the saints. There will also be a time of great power during this time for the saints as well. Matthew 24, 14 says this, and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached, and the whole world will get it, and then the end shall come. There will be a tremendous outpouring of gospel truth during this period. So there's this incredible paradox or contrast of evil and good rising to a crescendo, and after all of that happens, all of what? The tribulation of those days, verse 29. Immediately after the tribulation of those days that I just described to you, Something is going to happen. It's going to be wonderful. It's going to be terrible. The terrible part first. The sun will be darkened. The moon will not give its light. And the stars will fall from the sky. And the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then the good part is this. That the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And it will light the sky. And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn. And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. And they will send forth his angels with a great trumpet. They will gather together his elect from the four winds and from one end of the sky to the other. Four things I want us to see this morning out of this text. Number one, the sequence of events. The sequence of events. I need to grab it. A little teaching here. The second thing is this, the scene in the heavens. The third thing is the sorrow of the lost, the terror of the lost. And the fourth thing is the celebration of the saints. Let's begin with a word of prayer quick. Lord, I believe that this word is big. It's a powerful word. And it's one that in the flesh I cannot recreate and get big about or try to plant in people's minds some image that would make it bigger than life somehow. My words are so feeble. My words are so feeble when it comes to trying to proclaim the excellencies of this event. And so it is, we all recognize, even for this time of teaching, you as our only hope of getting a glimpse of the glory that is yours and that is ours as well. We pray in Jesus' name that you would release a spirit of clarity and teaching and glory so we can enter into this truth and be affected in our living by it. For your glory, we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. First thing I want to deal with is the sequence of events. When is this going to happen? It's very clear in the text. Immediately after the tribulation of those days. Stop right there. If you have grown up in an evangelical church, and I'm aware that many of you haven't, but many of you have. If you have grown up in an evangelical church, right about now there's probably a question on the tip of your tongue, and the question is this. Is the church going to be going through these events that you described in verse 15 to 28? Because the way you're talking sounds like you think they are. What about the pre-tribulation rapture? That the church is going to be caught up before any of these events take place and removed. Some of you are asking, what is a pre-tribulation rapture? Well, for those of you who don't know, sadly, it is an issue over which many believing, redeemed people have been very willing to divide over. I am not willing to do that. I do, however, think that I owe you my opinion and my view of this whole thing. So I'm going to give it. I also want you to know that there's all sorts of room here to disagree with me about this. And we're going to embrace and love each other. And I think even at leadership levels we'll have some little debate about this. But this is where I'm at. First thing about this pre-tribulation rapture, to give it to you briefly, It is a view that sees the second coming of Christ coming in two phases. It understands the second coming of Christ, but it comes in two phases. Phase number one, according to this pre-tribulation view, is that there is going to be a coming of Christ for the church, for the saints, before the tribulation. That's why it's called pre-tribulation. Rapture is just a catching up of the church to be with Christ. Phase two, according to the pre-tribulation position, says this, that after the first coming that raptures the church before these events in verses 16 to 28, there will then come a second coming, phase two of the second coming, where Jesus is coming with his church to set up his kingdom at the Parasite. If that's a little confusing, let me give it to you in a nutshell. The sequence of events would go like this. Jesus comes for his church somewhere between verse 14 and 15. That's where Jesus comes for his church. At that time, the tribulation is released. The abomination of desolation would happen somewhere in the context of the seven years. While that's going on, the church is in heaven, all of the saints experiencing and enjoying the marriage supper of the Lamb. At the end of the marriage supper of the Lamb in heaven, at the end of the great tribulation on earth, Jesus then returns with his church to set up his kingdom and put an end to evil. That's the flow. I do not have any time. I do not have the time and I do not have the desire either to get deeply involved with all of the weavings of Scripture that would either support that position, and there are many Scriptures that would support that, or get into all the weavings of Scripture that would discount that theory, and there are many passages of Scripture that would discount that theory. Every time I get confused, I've experienced this for nine years since I've been here, and I've experienced it again in this passage, as I think of all the theologies that kind of come at us out here, and I start examining all of them, The only time I ever find any clarity is when I start coming right back to the text and study the text. Suffice it to say that as I consider all of these different theologies that come to our text, this view of two phases of coming is woefully lacking in any support at all, in my opinion. That stand of two phases of coming would not stand as it relates to the Olivet Discourse. I do not believe. It is compelling to me that in the teaching of Jesus himself, when he decides to reveal the events that are going to surround the second coming, and in all three of the Gospels, not one time in any of the Gospels where Jesus himself is describing these events, not one time is there even a hint that the coming of himself is going to come in two phases. This is a little difficult for me because I come out of a background where if you weren't pre-trib, you were a communist. It was like, this is unbelievable. So this is a little bit frightening for me to talk like this. But as I studied and I heard all the arguments back and forth, I just began to think. Why don't you think that when Jesus was doing this teaching, it may be somewhere around verse 14 where he says, and then the end shall come, and then he gives the abomination of desolation text. wouldn't you think he'd say somewhere in there, in one of the Gospels, even veiled in some way, hint that, by the way, don't worry about this elect, even though he warns the elect in verse 22. Don't worry, because none of you are going to be there anyway. I'd look for that. The fact is, he doesn't say that, and the reason he doesn't say that, in my opinion, is because the purpose of this text is to prepare the saints in every age, no matter what place they are in the birth pains of history. This word is a word to prepare every saint in every age up to the end of the age and including the end of the age to hang on to Jesus for dear life their whole life no matter what kind of tribulation they come to, including the final age. Their view, this view, pre-tribulation view of two phases, that he comes, phase one, for the church. 1 Thessalonians 3.13 says that. He is coming for the church, for the saints. And then phase two, he comes with the saints. 1 Thessalonians 4.16 says he's coming with the saints to make that two separate things and somehow contradictory to each other or somehow taking those passages and using them as proof. See, there are two events. It's an absolute conflict with our text right here. In verse 31, it says, he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet. They will gather together his elect from the four winds. When is he going to gather his elect from the four winds? Stick to the text. Stick to the text. When? Verse 29. Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will darken, the moon will darken, the stars will fall, the sign of the Son of Man will come, and then he will what? Gather his elect. Matthew 13, the parable of the wheat and the tares. The servants are coming to Jesus saying, when are you going to get rid of the pain? When are you going to deal with the sin that is the tares. There is wheat everywhere. And we understand that God has planted the wheat. But when are you going to deal with the sin of the world? And Jesus says, not yet. It is not yet the time. But I need to tell you, there is coming a time when I will send forth my angels at the end of the age. The end of the age. And at the end of the age, the final end, I'm going to do two things. I'm going to gather the tares, and I'm going to gather the elect. And the tares are going to be bound up and burned, and the elect are going to be burned, and they are going to be burned, barned, and they're going to be... I make up words. I just make them up. I don't know if that's even... You can use that that way. And they're going to be spending eternity with me in this wonderful barn. Wow. The sequence of events, though, is that at the end of the age is when he's going to gather both the tares and the wheat. When? At the end of the age. Same sequence there. again not a hint not even a hint of a two phases see the fact is this in my opinion this one time full presence coming in that full presence coming he will indeed first thessalonians 3 come for the saints and at the same time will be coming with the saints you got i don't have a problem with that he is going to be coming for the saints who are alive and remain 1 Thessalonians 4.16 says, but he will be coming with the saints too who have been raised from the dead. The dead in Christ shall rise first. All of the Old Testament saints, you've got to picture this. There's no way I can reproduce this. This is something the Spirit's got to give somehow. And we're not going to get it until we see it. But Jesus is coming in power with all of the Old Testament saints. The Abrahams, Isaacs, Davids, Jephthahs, Samuels, all the prophets, Jeremiah, Isaiah, everybody's there coming with Jesus in power For the dead in Christ shall rise, they will be translated according to 1 Corinthians 15, given their resurrection bodies, come down, and those of us who are alive and remain will be caught up with him in the air and spend eternity with him forever and ever and ever. An interesting Greek preposition in this passage, 1 Thessalonians 4.17, when it says, Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them. The them are the saints who are coming with him. for the saints who are still alive and remain. But the interesting preposition is the preposition apontason. Apontason. And the preposition there is a word that was used in biblical times to describe the welcoming of a visiting dignitary to a city. Here's how it would happen. We'd be in the city. We'd hear about the dignitary coming. We were so pumped about this guy coming that everybody would run and run and run and get all excited and run out of the city and get out of the city and greet the dignitary before he ever got to the city. We'd meet him, we'd have a big party and celebration, and we'd come back dancing all the way to the city. A-pan-te-sin is what it means when we are caught up. The caught-up picture there for those of us who are alive and remain and have survived verses 16 to 28 is this. We're going to go outside of the city and meet our Redeemer, turn around and come back and reign with him as kings. That's the sequence. in my view it's one event in my view this text doesn't allow for anything but one event one phase after the great tribulation that the saints will endure you know I don't really have a problem by the way if you have a different view I did some reading this last week that was interesting to me though as it relates to people who worry about us who believe that we're all going to get raptured and we don't got to worry about any tribulation or hanging on to Jesus when it gets tough I read some writings of Corey Tenbull who in a particular place of writings wrote a particularly impassioned plea to the American church and said please American church please American church get ready because you need to know American church that you are the only church you are the only gathering of believers who really believes that we're all going to be raptured everybody else is getting ready everybody else is getting ready to go through some stuff that might be tough and if you're not ready, you're going to be so disillusioned if it comes to us. That's my view. That's the sequence of events. The second thing is the scene in the heavens. The scene in the heavens involves two things. One is wonderful, one is terrible. The terrible one first. It is cataclysmic. The sun will be dark and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky. Literally, the universe will disintegrate. A happy day for everybody. Hebrews 1.3 says something interesting in a contrast to this. It says, He, that is God, holds all things together by the word of His power. In this particular day, God is literally going to relax the powers that He has been energizing to hold the entire universe together. And at that relaxing, what's going to happen is the sun will be dark and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from the sky. so cataclysmic will this event be that Luke 21, 26 says that men's hearts will fail them. Literally, they will die. Other men will faint from fear. It is the ultimate, this verse, verse 29, is the ultimate and final birth pain. All through this, remember we've been talking about birth pains. They get closer together and more intense and closer together and more intense as we entered the tribulation and did some teaching on that a couple of weeks ago. In Revelation 16, Revelation 6, Revelation 8, it talked about that during the tribulation period, cataclysmic events were beginning to happen even then, where the sun was getting darkened. For the sake of the elect, the days were even shortened. Earthquakes were increasing, and all of these kinds of things were happening. But on verse 28, when the final end comes, it again fits in with that metaphor of birth pains. This is the final birth pain, the final explosion of the end of history. This is it, the final pain. The kingdom has come, the parousia is here. And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear, the sign. You know, it's interesting to me. The disciples started this whole thing by asking Jesus, what is the sign of your coming? And Jesus went on to answer saying, listen, listen, the first thing I want you to know is there's going to be wars and rumors of wars. There's going to be earthquakes and famines and all of these. Every time it happens, everybody's going to go, this is it, this is it. These things are just the beginning of birth pangs. Don't be frightened. Just hang on. Every generation is going to think that. He has simply right here answered their question. You want to know what the sign of the second coming is? Here's the sign so you can know. Here's the sign so you can predict. when the sun goes dark when the moon loses its light when the stars fall from the sky when the son of man appears in glory go write your book I know this I think it's close now that's the sign that's the sign you know what of that day and hour verse 36 no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the sun but the father alone you're looking for a sign wait for the stars to fall from the sky that's the sign until then hang on to Jesus for dear life your whole life no matter what birth pains you might experience severe or light it's really kind of simple in terms of how we should live the first part of his coming of the end of the age is apocalyptic it's cataclysmic the second part is wonderful the sign of the son of man will appear in the sky and when that sign appears it will be bright it will be light it will be shining remember matthew 16 it was a wonderful chapter turn to it real quickly here it's just before the transfiguration to give you a little context here what jesus is doing verse 27 what jesus is doing is needing to encourage the disciples because he has just given them some very frightening information he has said to them this while they were anticipating the kingdom to come in any moment he said guys you don't understand something. We must go to Jerusalem, suffer many things, and I'm going to be put to death by the hands of evil men. And they were discouraged and they were frightened. And that was even the point at which Peter said, no, you can't do that. And Jesus said, get behind me. But he came back with some powerful encouragement. I need you guys to know something, that while I am going to die and be put to death by the hands of evil men, I am also going to be raised up again the third day. And not only that, I am going to come again in the power and glory of my unveiled father. And the key issue for you, disciples, as it relates to your encouragement, and the key issue for you, church of the open door, as it relates to your encouragement, is this. I'm not going to come the second time the way I did the first time. Verse 27 of chapter 16. For the son of man, stop right there. Remember the teaching on that? The son of man is a designation of Jesus in his humanity. It is a designation of Jesus in his humanness. What he's saying to the disciples here, first of all, is this. My first coming, you guys, my deity, my majesty, my power and glory was veiled. We sing a song at Christmas. I love it. Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see. Veiled incarnate deity. He was deity, but it was veiled in the flesh, and you couldn't see it. In my first coming, I came as a little baby. Nobody would have noticed by looking at the baby that there was anything powerful. My second coming, I'm coming different. I'm going to ride on the chariots of God with power and glory. It's going to be different. Philippians 2, my first coming I emptied myself, took on the form of a bond slave and I was made in the likeness of man. Isaiah 53, the first coming, the son of man coming. There was no stately form or majesty that we should look on him. We didn't notice his majesty. He looked like George, Jesus, yeah Nazareth, big deal. There was no appearance that anyone would be attracted to him or notice that he well he looks like god nothing like that he came as a man veiled in the flesh the godhead was i but i got a word for you and it's for your encouragement my second coming is going to be different than the first you see in the second coming verse 27 the son of man is going to come in the unveiled glory of his father and all of the glory and all the power and all the majesty and all the praise that belongs to christ right now when he said those words right now as we sit here in this auditorium all of that glory and power and praise that belongs to him now will be seen by everyone then and every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father and he will reign forever and ever and ever it's going to be bright it's going to be shining it's going to be light revelation 6 describes this apocalyptic event revelation 6 14 verse 14 it says describing it metaphorically that it's like the sky will be rolled up like a scroll remember that i like that one it's as if god takes on this final day the the universe the sky itself like a like a shade on a window and he pulls it down just a tad and then he lets it go and the whole thing goes it's all gone i gotta see it's simple to get it and as that shade goes up as it were the sky is rolled up like a scroll the sun is gone the moon is gone, the stars have fallen, the wonder of it all is that it's not going to be dark. You know why? Because the sign of the Son of Man is going to appear, and when Jesus appears, it's going to be light, and he is going to shine like the noonday sun. You know why? Because Jesus really is the radiance of his glory. He really is. And in that day, the whole earth will be filled with his glory. We sing that song, and I love how it kind of rises to a crescendo as we sing that praise song. The whole earth is filled with his glory. The whole earth is filled with his glory. The whole earth is filled with his glory. Sometimes we get a sense of that in here, don't we? One day it's going to be all out here and everybody will see it. Revelation 22. I've got to read this verse. Speaking of the light that Jesus is and the light that he will be at the end. 22 verse 5. Speaking of the new Jerusalem where the kingdom is finally set up. Wonderful words. You need to know something. There will be no longer any night, and they shall not have need of light of a lamp, nor the light of the sun. Why? I'll tell you why. Because the Lord God himself shall illumine them. The Lord God himself, that is Jesus, shall give the light that the sun used to give, and they shall reign forever and ever. You know, after that teaching that we had in Matthew 16, some months ago. There were certain songs that were birthed in me as having even more significance than they had before. One of my favorite songs is Fairest Lord Jesus. The third verse says this, Fair as the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight, and fairer the twinkling starry host. If you want to get impressed, go out some late northern Minnesota night and look at the sky. Fairer as the twinkling starry host. But I've got some news for you. Jesus shines brighter. Jesus shines It's purer than all the angels heaven could boast. Another great hymn of the faith is Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty. The third verse says this, Though the darkness hide thee, though the eye of sinful men thy glory may not see, only thou art holy. There is none beside thee, but though the eye of sinful men thy glory may not see, his glory is there. The eye of sinful men doesn't see it because they don't want to see it. But every time I sing that song now, what I think is this, they don't see it now, but someday they're going to see it. Someday they're going to see the glory of the Lord. But the sad thing is this, that when they do, it'll be a different experience for them than it will be for us who are redeemed. Because when they see the glory in this context, they're going to what? They will mourn. Verse 30, And all the tribes of the earth will mourn, for they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. He will come with power. One of the things he's going to have power to do is judge. To judge. Beloved, we have got to preach the whole counsel of God. And I love to speak of the matchless grace of Jesus. But we need to know that Jesus is not only the Lamb of God. We need to know. We need to know he is the Lion of Judah. Matthew 25, just a page over, describes the same event this way. But when the Son of Man, verse 31, 25, 31, but when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne, and all the nations will be gathered before him and will separate them from one another as the shepherd separates sheep from goats, sheep being genuine believers, goats being pretenders. And he will put the sheep on his right hand, the goats on the left. The king will say to those on the right, come, you who are blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. But verse 41 says, and then he will also say to those on the left, depart from me, accursed ones. Matthew 13 says that of this same event, these same things, this way. In verse 30, again speaking of the wheat and tares, I referred to it earlier. Allow both of them, the evil and the good, the false and the real, the believers and the not, that of God and that of Satan, to grow together until the harvest, that is the end of the age. In the same time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers, First gather up the tares, that which is false, bind them in bundles, burn them up, but gather the wheat that is the redeemed into my barn. Move over to verse 41. In fact, look at verse 40. Therefore, just as the tares are gathered up and burned with the fire, so shall it be at the end of the age. The end of the age. The Son of Man will send forth his angels. He will gather out of his kingdom all the stumbling blocks, all those who commit lawlessness, and will cast them into the furnace of fire, in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. That's not good news. You see, it kind of depends on what side of the fence of faith you're sitting as to how you're going to receive this event. Because for some, it's going to cause mourning. I want to speak to believers just for a moment as it relates to this event and the judgment aspect of it. Believers, I want to grab your heart for a second. As redeemed people, we are aware of the fact that the ultimate motivator for everything we do is the grace of God. you hear it pulsing from this pulpit every single sunday after sunday after sunday and the word is this when grace lands on people they come up grateful titus it says it this way or paul says it this way to titus 2 11 to 13 the grace of god appeared to all men and when the grace of god appeared to me let's make it personal when the grace of god appeared to me it taught me some things what it taught me was that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present age i don't live godly in this present age because i got a long bony finger pointing at me grace grace taught me that looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ something we need to intersect with in our spiritual pilgrimage is that one of the motivators for for godly living was grace when grace landed on me i came up grateful and a desire to live godly in this present world another motivator was looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ those are powerful motivators but while it is grace that motivates and moves us to call men and women to christ and moves us to to to to with passion proclaim the excellencies of him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light paul also says this in second corinthians 5 11 beloved we need to know that because we know the terror of the lord we persuade men because we know the judgment of god is real that's another one of the motivators that i got in my spirit to proclaim the excellencies because judgment's real beloved believers we need to put that in our hopper we need to have it in our spirit it was in Paul's it needs to be in ours as we look at our neighbors as we look at our friends because of the terror of the Lord we talk we're going to say it out loud to the unbeliever in light of this word I need to say this do you know the Lord are you washed in the blood have you bent your knee to Jesus as your sovereign king because if you haven't and if you don't, the truth is this. According to this, someday you will. Someday you will. See, every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess that Jesus, even demons, are going to go down. The glory of the redeemed life is that we go down right now on purpose. You are the king. But one day he's putting everybody down and when he puts everybody down, that's not a happy thing. That's a crushing thing. and again if i'm going to give the whole counsel of god we've got to let that just land on us and feel as heavy as it is last piece here is the celebration of the saints verse 31 he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet i like this trumpet part let's look at that for a second first thessalonians 4 16 i refer to it earlier says this the lord himself i like that too the lord himself a lot of ideas about when the second coming comes some people think it's going to be a glowing cross i actually read that this week a glowing cross is going to appear in the second it's going to be all just just this you know i've talked about jesus being light it's just just just this glowing ball it's it's going to this says it's the lord himself it's going to be jesus we're going to see him the lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of god the trumpet of god here is in this passage too you know what the trumpet is it was a familiar or Jewish way, and I think it was used there, whether it's a trumpet or not. It was something that Jews would connect with because it was the way in those days that they would call an assembly. You like that? He blowed a trumpet and it was time to come home. I like that. You know, every generation, I've said this all through this series, every generation has had this sense with the trouble that they've seen in the world and the trouble they've seen in their spirit and the conflict they've had with the enemy, this must be the end. This must be it. Even so, come quickly, Lord Jesus. But I want to tell you something, that if I'm right about the saints going through this final thing, there will never be in the history of the world a time when the saints are looking for the heavens more than they are than the ones that are happening here. They're going through this. And as the power of God is released during that time and as the terror of the enemy is being released at the same time, there will be an ever-watching for the coming of the parasy of the full presence. And then they will hear the trumpets, and the dead in Christ will rise first, and we will be transformed and we will come with Jesus in power and glory on the clouds. The clouds are always a metaphor of the chariots of God. That's kind of what the picture is to a Jew. The chariots of God. And we will come and greet those who are alive and remain for this great assembly. He's talking to Tom Johnson about this. He says, it's almost like we all take the final lap together. It's like we all just kind of gather and boom. It's all there. From the four winds, meaning simply every conceivable place, Matthew 13, I referred to that earlier in a negative way. Talked about how he's going to gather the tares up and burn what is there. Cast them into the furnace of fire. I had to stop there. I didn't like that. But you know what? Verse 43 of Matthew 13 says this. The second thing he does after he binds up the tares and burns them up, he's going to gather the wheat. And it's not going to be this barn thing that we all laughed about. Verse 43 says this. Then the righteous will shine forth as the Son in the kingdom of their Father. Know what that means? It's good news. By the way, the righteous, you got righteous how? By trying hard? You got righteous by the blood of the Lamb. You were made righteous by the blood of Jesus. And I accepted that gift and I was washed clean by him. That's why we adore the Lamb so much. But it says the righteous are going to shine like the Son in the kingdom of the Father. What that means is, as I connect it with the sign of the Son of Man, We already know that Jesus shines, and he's going to fill the whole earth with his glory. Now I've just come to understand that not only does he shine, but when I'm glorified with him, I'm going to shine too, and you're going to shine too, and we're all going to shine in the kingdom of our Father forever and ever and ever. It's going to be bright, it's going to be light, it's going to be shining. Therefore, my beloved brethren, based on the fact that we are going to see him face to face, based on the fact that he is coming in glory one day, whether it be in our lifetime or not, but based on the fact that this is true, therefore, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. I know you get tired. I know you even wonder sometimes if it's real, knowing that our labor is not in vain in the Lord. You know what? I've got some good news. I read the end of the book, and we win. I think the way I'm going to close here I think it's directed to the spirit I don't often just read scripture but I was left after all of this exegesis and teaching with the question myself how then should we live how should this land on my spirit in terms of affecting how I live today whether he's coming or not in my lifetime and I think the spirit directed me to a passage in Colossians chapter 3 verse 4 I want you to turn to it if you have your Bibles and just read along with me as I read this it says in verse 4 when Christ who is our life I like that when Christ who is our source he's our only hope i love it when our language that god's kind of given us appears in scripture he's our only hope he's our source when christ who is our life paul talked like that when he's revealed that is speaking of the second coming the very event we've just been speaking of when the sign of the son of man comes here's some good news then you also will be revealed with him in glory that is speaking of the second coming that we've been speaking of the result of that is this verse 5. Therefore, because when Jesus, who is our life, is revealed and we will be revealed in him, with him in glory, here's what I want you to do, and here's how I want you to live. Consider the members of your earthly body. Would you consider them as dead to immorality, because they are impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry? For it's on account of these things that the wrath of God will come. What are you doing part of that? That's part of your old life. And in them once you also walked part of your old life when you were living in them. But now you also put them all aside, anger, wrath, malice, slander, abusive speech from your mouth. Don't lie to each other, since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the one who created him. A renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian and Scythian, slave and free man, but Christ is all in all. Verse 12, and as those who have been chosen of God, that's you, holy and beloved. Stop right there. As those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, you have been made holy, not by your striving, but you have been made holy by the blood of the Lamb. And you have been made children of God, chosen of God, because that is who you are. And because, back to verse 4, you will be revealed when he is revealed in glory. you know what I want you to do? I want you to quit messing around. I want you to quit getting all wrapped up in non-essentials and petty things. Because this is who you are and because this is our destiny, when he is revealed, we will be revealed in glory as well. I want you to put on a heart of compassion and put on a heart of kindness and put on a heart of humility and gentleness and patience. Would you bear with each other? We don't have time to be caught up in petty things. Because when he is revealed, we will too, in glory. Bear with each other. Forgive each other. whoever has a complaint against anyone, just as the Lord forgave you, we get so wrapped up in things that don't matter. Keep your accounts short in light of these events. And beyond all these things, put on love. Put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity, and let the peace of Christ, let that rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. Be thankful. Think about God's grace to us. Let's be thankful. Let the word of Christ, let the word of Christ dwell in you richly with all teaching and wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever you do, whatever you do, in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through him to God the Father. Why? Because when Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory. I'll tell you why else. because we have been made holy and chosen of God, washed in the blood of the Lamb. Let's pray. Our destiny, Jesus, is a glorious one. We sometimes look at the infirmity of our own flesh and our own failings, and we wonder how it could be ours, but it's because of grace that's how it can be ours. And we are thankful for that. but father the word as we close with here as we we consider the fact that when you are revealed we will be revealed with you in glory for the writer of colossians that that was a that was a motivator or a perspective a point of perspective that caused him to want to say i need to put away the petty things and i need to realize that time is short and we've got even a commission to fulfill of proclaiming the excellencies of him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light to bring that to the world. And God, I pray you release that here. We consider you who are our life. That you will be revealed and we with you. And Father, that would not just be some future hope that we kind of know is part of our future, but God, that that would have a profound impact on how we live right now today as we relate to our kids, our husbands, our wives, our friends, this body. Relate your spirit of grace and truth and holiness among us. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
