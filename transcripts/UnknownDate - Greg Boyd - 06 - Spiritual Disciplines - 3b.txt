not only sin in your life, but the reasons for the sin, the wounds behind the sin, what's causing you to have this thing in your life. And it's a healing process. Honesty is part of the healing process. It's the first step to really being healed from the stuff that binds us, the stuff the enemy has on us. Yeah. Okay. That leads directly to this. again these are recommendations we've been talking a lot about safe context and this goes into what you're saying part of what facilitates this healing process is if you have people there that are representatives of Christ who can give you feedback on it they can help you search out God uses them to search your heart But God also uses them to reaffirm that your worth is in contingent upon the stuff that comes out of the stuff that stays hidden, that your worth is there. And it's very beneficial to have a group like this. The reason it would be safe, I call it Sinners Anonymous because the model for it would be Alcoholics Anonymous, where you come together and everyone knows that you're there because you're an alcoholic. And you sit down and the first thing you've got to do is say, My name is Greg Boyd. I lost my wife, and I only can see my kids once a month, and I got in a car wreck, and I lost my job because I'm an alcoholic. You come out with a bam, and then they say, welcome to our group. The prerequisite is that you know that you're a sinner. And see, it's safe to do that because I know that you're a sinner, and you know that I'm a sinner, so we don't have anything on one another. And ideally, this is what the whole church should be like. But that's ideally. The starting point would be to have a group, close friends that are real, and where you can begin to talk out loud some of the stuff that you deal with in prayer, where you can bounce off of them and get feedback on stuff and talk about the issues that are there. Kind of a therapy group, if you will. But it's very important to have that. Now, we raised the question, what is the criteria? How do you know that it's safe? And I don't think you ever totally, totally, totally know. to speak truth. What was that? The principle here is, let's say you have four people. You're there for each other. You're there for each other and to hear each other's story. You can't be there for everybody and the job isn't to fix the world or to fix anybody. The job is to be there for each other. So if you're part of my group and we're speaking truth to one another and and you're coming out of a context of pain, I want to be there for you. Now, I know that your side of the story is going to be half the story. There's always other sides. And my prayer will be that whoever else is involved in this, that they'll get somebody who's for them. But I need to be for you, and I can't be for everybody. The commitment of a group is to be there for one another and to hear one another, to be each other's advocate, representative of Christ. Not to solve all the problems. In fact, you can't do this and try to fix one another. The purpose is not to fix. We can't fix anybody. But as you said, it's to be a sounding board, to hear, just to have a context, some context in this world, where you can speak truth, and you can be vulnerable, and you can be out loud about stuff. That's why one of the central ministries the church needs to have is support groups like this. And sometimes it's really good to have this when you get people who have the same kind of sin that you do, have the same kind of addiction that you do, to work off of one another, because you understand one another. You know where you're at. Okay, go ahead. There's also room in groups like this, and this is where if you have communicated unconditional love, there's a place for confrontation, where you say, it sounds to me like you are, and that's part of this whole confession thing, the role of the priest, the role of the abbot, was accountability. And this is not only a group that's going to hear you, but maybe confront and say, and Alcoholics Anonymous does this too. It sounds to me like you're playing tricks with yourself. From my perspective, it seems to me that you're evading this issue or what have you. Okay, let's move on. A final thing is to take daily inventory. And again, the journal thing comes up. To be disciplined about honesty requires consistency. And again, this isn't a rule here. If you miss a day, don't get down on it. Just record the fact that you missed it the next day. I was a sinner. I didn't do what Greg said, no. Regular inventory, where you take assessment of yourself. The inclination of deceit in the flesh is so strong, it's a magnet on our life, that if we don't consistently come against it, we'll find ourselves getting enmeshed in it. So to take inventory as a way of staying honest with yourself. Know yourself. Socrates even said, the life which is unexamined is not worth living. And let's say one final word here. About speaking the truth. Paul says, speak the truth in love. Speak the truth in love. Speak alitheus. Speak things that are uncovered. It can be that that becomes a license to be rude or insulting or degrading, and that, of course, is miles away from what Paul meant. You can speak the truth and have it to be total truth, but in a way that's not going to be demeaning to the person or insulting to the person or untender to the person if you do it in love. And so the rule of thumb here must always be in love. The purpose of speaking the truth even about yourself is not shame, it's love. And the purpose for speaking truth to one another is not shame, it's love. And even if I'm going to say true things about you, if we're in a context where I've got a platform where it's appropriate for me to say, it looks to me like you're doing this and to confront sin in your life, and there's a real need for that, the purpose can't be for shame or to degrade you or anything of that sort. It must be in love, especially when it's done in public. The motivation must always be love. Sometimes there's a need for that in a church. But the end of it always has to be in love. So ask yourself, not only is what you're saying true, but ask yourself, is what you're saying being said in a loving way? Is your motivation love? Is your motivation to help? Is your motivation to bring healing? Okay, any final comments about that? You give people permission. Exactly. And that's scary to do. It's kind of like you feel like you're standing naked. But it gives people permission. I found that to be a number of times where you say something out loud and bam. It's like, oh, this is a safe place. You listen for someone who's speaking honestly and they're not going to use it against you because they've already come up with it that they have similar kinds of things. In my thinking, one of the roles of people in ministry is to do just that, to give people permission to be out loud with stuff by themselves being out loud with stuff. It's the opposite of what the traditional model for the minister is, the holy man of God who's righteous in all of his ways and has the exemplar life of the exemplar family, all that does is it gives people the requirement of looking as much like that as you can. And it means that everything about you that doesn't conform to that has to be stuffed. So you become a model of a dysfunctional person. And this is why you sometimes hear about ministers, sometimes big ministers, blowing up. And they go, oh, how could all this stuff go on in their life when they look so good? Well, that's why all this stuff was in their life, because they look so good. but to model what it is to be vulnerable, to get your life from Christ, and then therefore to be okay with honesty. You were next. What helps you to do that is to always go back to your own sin, because even when sin has been done against you and you need to say it out loud, at the same time you're a sinner, and as much as they need to forgive you, or you need to forgive them, what am I saying here? As much as you need to be confronted, you need to be confronted, And so there's a humility that comes with this. People who are humble about their own sinfulness don't usually regurge on other people just to get back at them. That becomes kind of vindictive. Okay, let's move on to talking about prayer. There's three different facets of prayer that I wanted to talk about in terms of spiritual discipline. And again, this is all just things that are gathered mainly from the wisdom of people who have been very good at prayer. When you want to know how to fix the car, you go to the experts, well, when you want to know how to pray, it's good to listen to the experts, people who really do pray a lot. No one has a corner on the market here, there's no sort of elitism, whatever, but it's wise to listen to the words of people who pray and pray effectively. This is called centering prayer. The main function of centering prayer, we talked a little bit about this last week, is to bring yourself together. Our minds usually are scattered in a million different places. We're torn with many different thoughts. We have trouble concentrating on one thing for any given length of time. I think we're getting worse at that in this culture because our culture is getting more and more technological. I mean, I know this is with students. The threshold for boredom with students is every year going up and up and up, and it's because of Nintendo. You know, these kids grew up on Nintendo where they get, you know, 50,000 sensory inputs every minute, and everything's exciting, and they're, you know, oh, they're going to get eaten by this monster or whatever, and they're playing. And so they get an appetite for that, where they need stimuli. And then they come to a boring class, and you're supposed to keep these people interested. But their minds tend to wander, because they're searching for stimulus. We are all like that to a certain degree. Our minds get scattered. You've had this happen to you. It's happened to me a lot of times, where you go to pray, And you pray for 30 seconds, and bam, you're out shopping. And you pray for another 30 seconds, and then you're worried about this thing. And then you pray for, you know, your mind's just kind of scattered, and you get done, and it doesn't feel like you really accomplished anything. Centering prayer is a way of just being there, a way of being present with what you're doing. You've had this kind of happen when talking to people. You ever talk to somebody, and all of a sudden you realize you're not really there. You're going, uh-huh, yeah, what? But you're kind of in and out, you know. Genuine conversation occurs when we're present with somebody, when we're there, when we see them eye to eye, and we're communicating with them. It's the same thing with the Lord. Centering is a way of becoming present, of being there, instead of in a million different other places. Here's a couple practices, and I just want you to jot these down and try them throughout this week, okay? Try these. Some may work for you, some won't. Even if it doesn't work, try it a number of times, because it sometimes takes a while to get the hang of it. One is simply, and there's no title for these, I'm just kind of gleaned these from a number of different people. But I could call this objective observation of inside and outside. One beneficial thing to do, it might be beneficial for you, is to, before you pray, to sit down. Actually, I could do these two together. The second one we did last week. And simply sit. Be present sitting. We don't do this very much. Just be. Just be. And what will help you just be is if you go into an observing mode. Just relax and observe yourself. Look at the room around you and notice things. And notice what's going on on the inside as well. Notice your thoughts. Listen to your thoughts. You can become intentional about this, as we did last week, where you maybe close your eyes and then say to yourself, speak, I am listening. But you just observe reality. Observe external reality, observe internal reality, and just notice it. Notice how your thoughts bubble up. And when you notice it, find it amusing. Don't become attached emotionally to anything that comes up. Just observe. And what this does is it begins to quiet the mind down. The mind races because we are poured into, we're incarnated in our thoughts. We are racing with our thoughts here and there and there. But what this is doing is stepping outside of the whole thought process and just looking. And so you're watching your thoughts. And what that does, as soon as you notice it, it's like that itself begins to slow them down. You just notice it. Oh, there's a thought. Well, here's what I'm thinking now. And observe reality like a movie screen. You're stepping out of it. You're becoming a third party looking in on it. It quiets the mind down. It puts the mind more in a receptive mode. When you notice that you're concerned with things, all of a sudden you're worried about things, just notice them. Don't try to fight against them. Don't say, oh, I should not be concerned. I ought not to be concerned. Just, oh, there's my concern, and just notice it. You'll find that by becoming detached from it a little bit, you neutralize it. It's no longer that great of a concern. You're just observing it. That's a way of becoming centered, of becoming present. Your awareness is now inside, it's behind your eyes. Just like if you're talking to somebody. Try this sometime. If you're holding a conversation, talk to yourself while you're talking to the person, saying things like, I'm here to listen to this person. What is this person really saying? Get into the person. Be there. Put out other thoughts and stuff and just be there for the person. You'll find that you understand, you hear, you feel a lot more when you do that. Well, that's what we're doing here with prayer. We're becoming present because we want to talk to our Lord and he's deserving of all of our attention. Breathing exercises, there's a whole lot we could say about this. In the history of Christianity and also in the history of other groups that have practiced meditation, breathing has played a central role. One way of becoming centered is to simply pay attention to your breathing. Sit. Sit in quiet. Maybe spend a little time observing your thoughts, whatever, and then become intentional about your breathing. Breathe from the diaphragm, from the deepest part of your diaphragm. When you breathe with only the top part of your lung, that's sending a message to your body. We are physiologically connected creatures, and what we do with our body affects what goes on in our mind, and vice versa. That sends a message more of panic, of nervousness. When you're nervous, you breathe fast and shallow, or when you're angry or whatever. Breathing deep produces, it's the kind of breathing you do when you're in a deep sleep. That produces calm. So pay attention to your breathing. One way to do this is by simply being rhythmic about what you're breathing in and breathing out. Richard Foster recommends that you combine this with a sort of meditation exercise. When you breathe in, breathe in real deep, breathe in to relax, and breathe in to your diaphragm. And as you breathe in, say to yourself, I receive God's life, or I receive God's love. Or you think that to yourself. And as you breathe out, say, I release all other concerns, or something to that effect. I receive God's life, I relinquish all other concerns. He suggests, this doesn't work for me, but you try. I find myself feeling kind of corny with this. But he says when you breathe in, have your palms up. Again, you want to get your body as involved as possible because what you do with your body affects what goes on in your spirit. So you have your hands open like this. You say, I receive God's life as you're breathing in. And then you say, I relinquish all other concerns as you're breathing out. Or you could say, thy will be done, not my will. Or any variation on that. It's a way of being centered. When you find yourself drifting off, and you will find yourself drifting off, just calmly receive God's life and let go of that concern. Become centered about this. Another exercise that is frequently practiced is to think, to speak the name of God. Pennington, we mentioned him last week. He's a church theologian who has written several books on this form of prayer and meditation, which is preparing for prayer. He recommends doing this, doing the breathing exercises, but to take an attribute of God or a name of God, which is all names of God reflect different characteristics of God, and to say them over and over again and concentrate, become as focused on that name as you can possibly be. Become as focused as you can possibly be. If a name like Yahweh or Jesus, and you repeat the name, you focus on the name and focus on the character of God, and the goal of it is to begin to experience what that name is revealing. Experience the presence of God within you as you're reciting this. Get your mind to focus on this one thing. Now, sometimes we Protestants have trouble with things that are repetitious because Jesus said don't pray with vain repetition as the heathen do and and some have thought that any kind of repetition in prayer is is is is futile it's it's uh you know not good I've even had people in churches uh confront me when I I've done a lot of interim speaking and one of the things I try to do is try to get choruses uh brought into the church and and drums that's always the first thing get drums and choruses now the spirit can come um but people who are used to singing out of hymnals, I've had some people confront me. They say, why do you sing these choruses two or even three times? We get the point after the first time, and you shouldn't have just repetition for repetition's sake. But the purpose of singing a chorus several times isn't to get information. If you think that that's the point of the chorus, you're missing the point. The purpose of the chorus is a vehicle that you use to get into worship. As you sing the chorus a second time, You can be more poured into it than you were the first time. The purpose isn't cognitive information. The purpose is that the words are tools that can use something to affect your spirit. You get more into worship when you do it that way, when you don't have to always be thinking about what note comes next and what lyrics come next or whatever. I think singing choruses, a lot of times, is a real good thing to do. In fact, sometimes I do that on my own in prayer, just take a little chorus and sing it over and over and over again. The kind of repetition that Jesus was talking about, he tells us explicitly, he says, Don't be involved in vain repetition. But repetition that's about God, repetition that's helping you yield more to God, isn't vain. He had a real particular form of Greco-Roman religion in mind there, where they would just kind of babble on to induce a sort of psychological trance. And he says, that's not the kind of stuff you need. But repetition can be one way of helping you be centered, helping you be focused, helping you know what it's really all about. So to take a name of God or an attribute of God and to say it over and over again and explore your feelings about it, explore that is one way of becoming centered. I put here depth through repetition. You're deepening yourself. You're becoming more centered through the repetition that you're doing. Another way of doing this, and this is my favorite way, is simply to recite scriptural truth. and what that scriptural truth is it can be um it can be anything but to take it and to chew on it in fact the word meditation means to to uh to to uh to ruminate it's the word that's used for for cows when they chew things and they swallow and they regurgit again and they uh chew it and regurgit you know swallow and regurgit again well that's what you're doing with this you take something you chew on it you swallow you bring it back up, look at it again. You look at it from every possible aspect. You explore it. You digest it, and then you do it again. Take a scriptural truth. God's presence surrounds me right now. God's presence surrounds me right now. That's the scriptural truth, where I am filled with the love of God. I am filled with the love of God. And for five minutes, just explore that. I am filled with the love of God. And see what changes it begins to affect in your being. try to hang with it you'll have a tendency sometimes to to to wander just gently don't get mad about it because that just really blocks the flow of everything just gently release that and come back time filled with the love of god uh jesus christ well one uh one very popular one throughout church history was it has been the prayer uh not just in meditation but throughout the day and we'll talk a little bit more about that later on but it's uh g it's called the jesus prayer. Jesus have mercy on me, a sinner. Jesus have mercy on me, a sinner. Or I am a sinner saved by grace. I am a sinner. Or I sometimes say things like, I sit before God holy and pure. I sit before God and concentrating on that and just gradually release all the other thoughts, all the other cares, all the other concerns. There's a time for that. I'll worry about that tomorrow. But right now, this is God's time. And I want to be as present here as I can possibly be. If ever there's a time where it's appropriate to be present and fully invested in what you're doing, it's in praise, it's in prayer, it's in worship, it's in meditation. Because this is God's time. So as much as you can, invest in it and relinquish the cares and the thoughts of the day and come back to the scriptural truth. He holds me in his arms like a shepherd holds a lamb. I am held in his arms like a shepherd holds a lamb. Another thing that you can practice doing that I find very helpful is to take an object, a cross, or even a picture of Jesus, and to combine that with one of these other things, practicing my breathing in and breathing out, becoming relaxed as I gaze upon the cross, as I gaze upon a picture of Jesus. The whole point is to become focused here, become sharpened here. the stained glass windows throughout church history functioned partly for this the crucifixion church functioned partly for this ways of getting you in tuned, in touch, in focus with what you're about they're just tools here I don't think I need to even say this but they are not an object of adoration that's been a continual problem throughout church history where you begin to pray to the cross or pray to the picture and you know that that's totally inappropriate that is a way of getting you to focus on what the picture represents and what the cross represents. It can be very helpful. It's concrete. It's there. One final thing, and then I want to take questions or comments that you have. And this is, this I don't get from church history. This I'm giving you just from my own experience and my experience talking with other people. If you have the gift of tongues, speaking in tongues, this can be a way that many have found helps them focus in prayer. Helps them focus in prayer. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14 that when you pray in the spirit, your mind doesn't profit, but your spirit is edified. In 1 Corinthians 14, too, he says that the one who speaks in tongues edifies himself or builds up himself. It's the only gift that's mentioned where it's clear that it has a private use because Paul says in 14, too, that when you speak in tongues, at least when you're not in church, you're speaking not to people, but you're speaking to God. In fact, no one understands what you're saying. In fact, you don't even understand what you're saying. That's why when you say in church, Paul says you should pray that you have the gift of interpretation. In church, Paul says, I speak in tongues more than you all. So he speaks in tongues even more than the Corinthians, and they spoke in tongues a lot. So he's for speaking in tongues. But in church, he says, I'd rather speak five intelligible words than speaking in tongues, unless there's an interpreter. Okay, the point is this. There is a private devotional use for speaking in tongues if you have that gift. Not everyone has that gift. Be open to it. Don't be craving after it. It's not what you should hunger and thirst for. But if you have the gift of tongues, it's sometimes beneficial to use it as a way of being focused on spiritual reality. It puts your mind on hold. It lets go of some of the cares and concerns that you brought with you, and it can be a means by which you enter into the presence of God in a more full way. Okay, what kind of questions do you have or comments do you have about centering prayer? Probably that helps you get centered. Yes? You have to be critical, and everything has to be critical. You know, so just know that when you go to B. Dalton's and buy a book on meditation. I stick with Christian authors, but there could be practical insights there. I mean, you know who is most, the people that I've learned the most from in terms of centering and getting the mind to calm down, the ones who have been doing it the longest and are most explicit about it are the Buddhists. These people know how to calm their mind and how to be present. And hey, I go to a secular doctor when I'm sick because he knows a lot about my body. Well, these people know a lot about how the mind works and how to become centered, how to become focused. A lot of Zen Buddhists meditate, the priests do, 16 hours a day. The sad thing about that is they never go beyond this. They get centered, and they think that's an end in and of itself, and they're trying to attain satori and all this other kind of stuff. But as a means of just quieting yourself down, we in Western culture need some of that. And so there's nothing wrong with reading secular sources to find spiritual truth. As long as you do it with a critical eye, a critical mind, and you realize you're going to have to do some filtering stuff here. There's a lot of New Age stuff out about meditation, and some of it's very good, centering exercises. But what is sad is that it's wrapped up very frequently with pantheistic overtones, where, yes, become meditative, but now recite, I am God, I am God, or something of that sort. And so you've really got to be discerning if you're going to read secular sources on meditation. Yes? That just, and this is what I would say in response to it, when we throw out the baby with the bathwater, we are playing into the enemy's hand because that's exactly why he came up with the counterfeits in the first place. Even the early church fathers saw this, how there's different things in Christianity, but yet there's parallels in other religions and stuff. And they saw that it's to the enemy's advantage to either get people to follow the false one or to at least confuse the issue so much that people are inclined to throw them both out. And there's nothing that I know of that is significantly spiritual in Christianity that doesn't have some parallel someplace. Sometimes it's a counterfeit, or sometimes it's just something that, you know, a parallel, like meditation. But when we throw both out, we're completely being duped. We're doing exactly what the enemy wants us to do. It's important to be much more discerning. It's harder to be more discerning. and to have to judge right from wrong, truth from error. But that's, I think, exactly what we're called to do. It's really sad. It really is sad when, you know, because the word meditation today has a lot of Eastern connotations to it, or you talk about centering or being present. It's really sad to me when I hear people come against that because they associate it with Eastern stuff when it is so much what they need. it's so much a part of what they need and it would do them so much good and it makes me angry also because it's a notch for the enemy in terms of having due people there's a world of difference between Eastern meditation and Christian meditation this stuff is biblical I want to count it a number of times but I don't remember how many times it's in there but the idea of meditating it's throughout the Bible meditate on your precepts day and night I delight in your word I meditate on them day and night meditation is a regular part of of scripture. It's been a part of the Judeo-Christian heritage. It's been practiced throughout church history. And even these techniques. People who come against that don't usually know that. And often what fuels a person's concern is misinformation, but also it's not part of what they've been it's not something that they're in touch with. And it's sort of an assumption that among some that whatever there is to be true, I already have it. My way of doing it is the best way of doing it. And so what you're saying must be wrong because I've never heard of it before. Yes? One of the things that comes up periodically is people say that when you clear your mind, when you become centered, you open up your mind to demonic influence. That to calm down your thoughts is to open it up to the devil to get in there. And what that means then is that the way to be godly is to always have your mind full of stuff. So how can you ever hear from God? You've got to quiet yourself to hear from God. But see, and that's such a Western thing. The Western thing is to always be talking to yourself, always have your mind full of things. And the main purpose of Christianity is to have cerebral content here. And that's one major deficit in the church today is that we've got so much cerebral content and so little real-life experience to what we know to be true. Because we never give God a chance to put flesh on what we know by being quiet and letting Him do it, by resting, by meditating. We've got to sing songs that inform us cerebrally. We don't want to go into the repetition. It's just really disastrous. It's really sad to see that. Thank you.
