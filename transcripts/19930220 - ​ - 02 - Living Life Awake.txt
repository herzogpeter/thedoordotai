This morning we talked about living life awake and in different aspects of that. What keeps women asleep, lies that we believe about ourselves as women, lies that we believe about ourselves as individuals, and lies that we believe about life. That keeps us asleep. Another thing that keeps us asleep is choosing passivity. What I want to do this afternoon is to go through, We're going to go through some of the lies that we believe about life that keeps us asleep and the choice that we make to be passive and how that keeps us asleep. And then I want to look at living awake, what that looks like. Embracing truth about ourselves as individuals, embracing the truth that's out there about life, and choosing to live assertively and what that's all going to look like. Okay, where we left off was talking about lies that we believe about life. Okay, unless I understand the goal of a sport and what it takes to succeed at the sport and what I'll get penalized for and what's the big picture of the sport, I'm probably not going to be very good at that sport. I could be a very talented athlete, but I wouldn't be very good at the sport because I didn't understand what it was that made the game the game. It's the same way with life. unless I know what the goal of this life is, unless I know what it is that I'll get penalized for that will cause pain in my life, unless I know that, unless I understand what kind of choices I would make that could reward me, that could make me achieve in life in the way that would be meaningful for me, I probably won't live life very fully. Somewhere, many of us were told that life would be fair, easy, and happy. And you know what? None of us ever forgot it. Life would be fair, easy, and happy. Many of us are wasting our lives fighting the reality that it usually isn't fair. It's rarely easy, and you know what? The happiness part is really overrated. Sometimes it's going to happen. It doesn't necessarily mean you're living life to the fullest. It's overrated. We need to come up with a list of the lies that we believe about life that keep us from living it. The rules that we thought were part of the game that we keep doing, that we keep ending up in the gutter ball, and it's like, well, I thought gutter balls were good. Gutter balls are not good. We need to realize what lies we believe that keep us from going towards the goal. And we need to come up with a list of truths that are true, that will help us live this life. They will look different for all of us. It's not that truth is relative. Truth is not relative. God's truth will look different through my life than he will look through my friend's life. That's part of the beauty of it. That's why he wanted diversity in creation. So each of us can see, you know what, I get really moved when I see an ocean hitting against rocks. I love it. Stormy skies and oceans hitting against the rock. I see God, I feel God, I weep. You know what? Someone else likes an open field. Someone else likes mountains. Mountains don't move me that much. Give me the ocean hitting against rocks. Well, God has a lot of different ways that he's willing to reveal himself. He reveals truth through me, and it's going to look different in my life than it's going to look in your life. We have to be true to the truth that's being given us. Each of us have had a list of lies, a whole bunch of lies that come at us. Sometimes we took them in, sometimes we didn't. You know what? My list of lies that have affected my life are different than yours, and they're different even than my brother's. I have three brothers who are raised in the same family. We heard pretty much the same things. But their list of lies and of the truth that's true for them is different. Our personality affected it. Who we are affected it. So each of us needs to look at different truths in this way. I want to share one truth or one lie for me that kept me from living life. I thought, God, I could go through all these different lies that might be true for people, but it would be shooting in the dark and it might not hit anyone how about telling about one lie that kept me from living and I've got some hesitation about sharing it, because you know what, it's a lie I'm still getting freed from I still feel the tentacles on me sometimes, but it was a big lie it's the most significant lie that kept me from living that lie was God is responsible for my life sounds a little like truth, doesn't it Those are the scariest lies. When they sound enough like truth that we embrace them. God is responsible for my life. I believed that God regularly interacted with me in the external details of my life. That's how I looked for God. I looked for God working over there, over there. If things happened happily, God was blessing me. He would regularly reveal his will for my life in circumstances, and through coincidences. What would confirm that I was in God's will? Well, if things kind of went together well, he opened the door. There was coincidences around situations. That's how God showed me where I was supposed to go. Or it could be that there was tribulation around it. That could be the work of the enemy, but it also could be God testing to make sure if my commitment was strong enough. You get that? Tribulation could be the enemy's work, but it might be God testing just to make sure I really loved him. Does this sound confusing? it's confusing it's a theology of confusion you know what we know about our God? he said I am not a God of confusion I came to bring truth, I came to set you free if your theology, if my theology is confusing, it's not of God we need to know what we believe the problem with looking at circumstances coincidences or tribulation is a confirmation that I'm in God's will so you know what? The focus is always external. And you know what he told us about himself? He was going to work inside. That's God's primary mode of operation. He's going to do wonders. He's going to do miracles. But they're primarily going to be inside. And I was always looking outside. It only resulted in confusion. And you know what? I think God got blamed a lot for what Satan did. I think Satan got credited for what God did. You know what one of the commandments tells us? Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. You know what that means? It does not mean don't say, oh God, when something goes bad. That's cursing. That's not what that means. It means do not attribute something to your God which you do not know is of God. We've done it. We see little things happening over here and we say, God did it. Do not attribute anything to our God which we do not know that God did. Even if you think it's for a good reason. Know what you know. And when we see God work, you know what? Your spirit's going to leap. I think we all know. You know situations that you know it was God. Give him credit for that. But let's not attribute things to God which are not of God. Do not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. This confused thinking or this confused theology left me with some realizations that I had to deal with. I had a friend who gave me a little testimonial. She came home. She's a good friend of mine, and she's got a wonderful heart. It's not about her heart. She came home and said that that day she'd been driving in her car, and she'd been driving the car for about a month, and she knew the brakes were bad. She just hadn't gotten around to it. You know, it's a lot of money, it's time, and all that. She hadn't gotten around to it. Her brakes are bad. She was driving down the street, and she was coming up to a spot, and the car in front of her was stopped. And she looked in the rearview mirror, and there was a car coming. And she didn't think she could make it. And she just dodged in between, and she made it. And she goes, I just thank God that he opened up that space for me so I could get through. And she thanked God. And I was with a bunch of other women. They were saying, oh, that is so great how God protected you. You know what? God protects us. He does. I had to listen to that story. and I had to think of a five-year-old little girl that I knew who had her daddy molester in her bed. And you know what that little girl did? She cried to the God that she believed in with all her heart and said, God, keep me safe. Don't let my daddy hurt me in my private parts. Why didn't God answer her prayer? Is he too busy helping my friend out who couldn't fix her brakes? Opening up spots? He's a harsh God. How do I think about Auschwitz? Okay, Auschwitz happened. God allowed it. It was God's will. Okay, God's in control. He must have wanted that to happen. How can a little boy get physically or sexually abused by his own mother? How does he live with that pain? How could I see my best friend die of cancer? When my friend was at the final stages of her illness, I had another friend who shared with me how wonderful God had been. supplied a car for them. It had been a good price, and you know what? It was the right color. My friend is dying of cancer. She's a wonderful, beautiful woman. Was God too busy over here? What are we saying? Do we know what we believe? How does God normally deal with our lives? Is he puttering around in the little details of our life and moving cars and doing this, Or is he doing an incredible miracle and he's transforming me into someone this world has never seen before? A body wholly filled and flooded with God himself. That's what he promised. That's a miracle. I can worship that God. I don't know about a God who moves cars around so someone who's being irresponsible can get safe. I love my friend. I'm glad she was safe. I don't know if that was God. You know, I think she got kind of lucky. I think there's good things that happen. You know, there might have been angelic intervention. I don't know about that. I think we don't think about it. How do we deal with these things? Do you ever think about this and think, how can I believe this and how can I believe that? Do you ever let the pain come at you and say, what am I thinking? What do I believe? I had a friend who was having a great picnic for a bunch of kids. It was a really worthwhile cause. And she was praying and asking others to pray that it not rain on the day of the picnic. And it didn't rain. If I have a God who answers weather prayers and doesn't take care of five-year-old little girls who are molested in their beds, I cannot worship this God except with a kind of horror. And you know what I did? I still worshiped him because still in my heart I had the new creation inside of me that knew me that he'd made. And I responded to a God that I knew had promised more. I knew was full of love. I knew it must make sense, but I couldn't draw very near because the five-year-old was in the bed and it didn't rain on the picnic. It didn't make any sense to me. Okay, there's a lie. What was the cost of believing that lie? And I believed it because everyone said it. Just listen. People say it all the time. What was the price that I paid for embracing a lie of theology? That theology kept me from thinking too much. you know what I love to think that's just part of me and I couldn't think too much about it because I had too much pain about it and it made me think I was crazy I couldn't think too much about how Jews could get slaughtered in Auschwitz and how a little boy could get sexually abused and how good things could happen and people could get cars that were the right color I couldn't love that this theology made me passive if it's God's job to know who I'm supposed to marry and it's God's job to decide what job I should have and God's job to decide if I should go to college and God's job to decide what car I'm going to get why do I need to be responsible why do I need to take on his gift of wisdom why do I need any of that he's going to take care of me why did he promise us wisdom why would we need wisdom if this wasn't supposed to be how we were supposed to live it out I was supposed to appropriate the wisdom. I felt that all I needed to do was to be a good girl, wait for the red light, wait for the green light. God was in control. This theology made my view of God get diminished, greatly diminished. This God didn't seem to do much that was truly amazing to me. I'd hear people talk about miracles, I want you to know too I don't mean this in any harsh spirit I mean this with love I think we're falling short of who we're worshiping I hear people talk about and praise God that a florist had supplied flowers for a banquet that wasn't neat maybe he had a great heart maybe God moved his heart but they said it was a miracle that God provided miracles provided flowers for the banquet I hear people talk about that a family got in a car accident and there were a lot of broken bones, but no one died, and so God took care of them. People seemed to liberally attribute things to God that didn't feel like God to me. I would think back to the children of Israel when he called them out of Egypt and they obeyed the command of their father, and they went out. You know what happened? They crossed across the Red Sea. How'd that work? Did he open it up enough so the water wasn't too deep that the good swimmers could make it? Did he have it shallow enough that everyone made it without drowning? Did he have it just so it was up to their ankles? And they just got a little bit wet and they all could walk across. No. You know what happened? He pulled back the waters. They walked across and they choked on dust. They choked on dust. That's how he does it. He does it big. He does it complete. And you stand back and you say, my God, that is an awesome God. That's how God feels. He will also do miracles in my life that might not look like that, but I'll know them for miracles. That feels like a miracle. I hear that story and it's like, yeah, that's what my heart thinks God's like. And I keep responding back to that. But everyone seemed to be satisfied with a little God who half addressed and half cared for, half needs. I started to expect a lot less from the God of Israel. There are other lies that I know women believe about life. Some of them are my lies, some of them are some of yours. Some of them are from people I love. Some women believe that they need to be protected from life. They don't want to hear the bad, the sad stories. It'll hurt too much. We need someone to take care of us. Some women believe that we deserve better than we have. I have to stop for this one. This one bugs me. One of the things that I do for myself, which I can't believe, and who knows how much longer I do it, but every year I take a trip with two of my girlfriends, and we go to the Caribbean. This is something we can't afford. I mean, it's stupid, it's extravagant, but I do it. And I love doing it. And I had a friend tell me when she heard that I went for the second time, she goes, Carolyn, you know what? You deserve that. Things have been so rough for you. You really deserve that. You know what, guys? That is a lie. It's not that I'm a bad person and I don't deserve a trip, but you know what? You know what we can say we deserve? A child deserves to have a mother and a father who will keep them safe and keep them fed and teach them some truth and not fill them with lies. If someone says that child deserves that, I will say yes. You know what else? I saw a picture in the paper not too long ago. A Sudanese mother, a mother in Sudan, incredible famine. She's holding her 10-year-old child, and they are a skeleton. I've got a 10-year-old daughter. I looked at this picture, and all it is is these big eyes. You know what? I will stand with anyone else who wants to know and say that child deserves food. That mother deserves to have a way to get at food so her child does not go through this. That is someone who deserves something. We deserve to have food. We deserve to be able to take care of our children. I do not deserve a trip to the Caribbean. I might give myself that gift. That's a good gift to give myself. That's part of my choices. I also get consequences. We're broke for months afterward. When people talk to me about that I deserve to have nicer furniture than I have, it's like, what are we saying? Michael and I have a... I think there was a rule that in married couples, someone was supposed to care about having furniture. Michael and I, neither of us care about it. I mean, everyone who's been to our house knows we don't care about furniture. But when people feel bad for me about some of the sacrifices or whatever I've made for whatever, they say you deserve to have nice furniture. I was like, no, I don't deserve to have nice furniture. A child deserves a good mom, a safe dad. They deserve to hear truth. that they deserve to know that they're a treasure. I'll say amen to all of those. But I think we really get confused when we start telling ourselves that we deserve certain things that aren't important, that aren't essential. We need to think what we're saying. Other lies, I'll just go through these. We believe that things will get better if we'll just wait. I think we heard that from the fairy tales. Don't trust your perceptions. Sometimes people feel that other people aren't safe. They don't listen to it. They need to listen to it. You're not a good judge for setting your own boundaries. How you look is important. And it's okay to have a narrow comfort zone. Something I feel real sad about is women who keep restricting their comfort zones. I think there are certain ways that we are more sensitive to some things than men are. I think just by our body chemistry, sometimes we're more sensitive to cold and hot. But I'd just like to challenge myself and challenge all of you, let's not keep our comfort zones too narrow. Let's be okay if things get a little uncomfortable, if it's a little painful, if it's a little hard. I'm not saying everyone has to go on outward bound type of things. That isn't what it's about. But if you start not wanting to hear hard stories in life, if you find that your world keeps getting smaller and the things that you feel passionate about or sad about are less and less important. We need to start stretching those comfort zones. Another thing that keeps women asleep, only one more thing and then we can talk about being awake, is that women choose passivity. They're not just passive by nature. I know this. We're not passive by nature. We choose passivity. Passivity pays off. Why else would we do it? Why are we passive? Well, we've got a lot of fears that control us. What are some of the fears? We're afraid of failure. We're afraid of pain. We're afraid of responsibility. When you choose passivity and you have a difficult situation, you can point someplace else, my mom, my dad, my husband, the finances, and say that's the cause of the problem. and you can be in the pain and you don't have to do anything. That's the payoff of passivity. And you know what? A lot of times someone will come and rescue you. There's enough people out there that do that kind of thing. We won't ever run out of those people. If I'm more concerned about not failing, if I'm more concerned about not failing than I am with finding out who I am, I don't think I'm ever going to find out who I really am. I don't think I'll ever have a clue who God made me to be. And I believe God weeps. If I'm more concerned with having a good testimony with the Christians and non-Christians around me, I will probably temper everything I do with the question of how will this look to others. I grew up as a seven-year-old always thinking about how it would look to others and if I was being a good testimony. I was a good testimony before I even knew who I was, before I knew how to live. That cannot be our primary orientation. It needs to be us making the decisions. Intellectually, physically, and emotionally, we've got a fear of responsibility. I saw it physically one year ago. I'm in a position with my company that there's three women who have the same job, And one of the women, Paula, died of breast cancer a little over a year ago. It was a really hard thing. Paula was only 43 years old. She has a teenage daughter. There was a lot of pain, a lot of sadness. No one in our company has ever died. It was a pretty powerful thing. I remember standing outside the funeral home, and a lot of us women were standing talking about it and talking about the power that the event had had on us. And the comments were all on, I can't believe how many women are getting breast cancer. I can't believe how many women have cancer. It's like one in ten now. They're all sharing the statistics. And there's nothing we can do about this. God, smoking, at least you know, that'll keep you from lung cancer. There's nothing we can do about this. And I just thought, we're handing all our power out. We're handing the power out. And I did too. And I just thought, I got really upset about it. You know how women can get worked up about things. It's like, it just got worse and worse. And I just thought, what in the world is going on? We hand off our responsibility. We're passive about how our reproductive system works. We're on our monthly cycles. Do you ever get surprised that your period came, and it's like, oh, no wonder I've been so crabby the past week? I mean, everyone else in the whole family, all your friends, acquaintance, knew your PMS. And you're, like, surprised by it. We don't take control over this. This is something that happens every month. We can know what's going to be happening, and we kind of just get surprised by it. We hand over the power. We're passive participants in our own lives. This happens emotionally. We don't take responsibility for some of the pain that's happened to us, for some of the damage that's gone on. What if there's a lot of pain and a lot of damage? Why go back? Why stir it up? Why does everyone have to blame their parents? Why does everyone have to blame their families? Why can't you just go on? One of my favorite authors is Ayn Rand, wonderfully powerful woman. She's an atheist. I couldn't understand why someone who believes so differently about the most important thing in my life could feel so close to me. I love this woman. Ayn Rand, in one of her books, says, that which you do not know is not a moral charge against you. That which you do not know is not a moral charge against you. But that which you refuse to know is an account of infamy growing in your soul. What you don't know about yourself does control you. What we're afraid to look at will have a powerful influence on our lives and our ability to take back our own lives. Let's take an analogy. There's a house fire on the second floor of a brand new house. It looks like it was minimal of damage. The firemen come in and they say, you know, there could have been some other damage that happened in the walls. Maybe we should chop up this wall a little bit. Maybe we should look into the ceiling. And the person goes in and they decide, no, it looks like it was just restricted to this room. I've been tired. We've just built this house. I just want to get it fixed up. The electricians come in and they say, there could have been some wiring damage. We really should look into this. They decide, no, we're just going to close it up. It's not that important. They close it up and the house is beautiful again. And the house is beautiful. 10, 15 years. And it might be that house will always be okay. Maybe it was built so well that it could survive that kind of fire. Maybe there wasn't any kind of damage. There's no act ceilings. Everything looks good. But in a few years, better hope a strong wind doesn't come. Because you know what might happen? A strong wind might come, and the house might crumble. and everyone, all the neighbors will come in and say, what happened? It was such a strong house. If we have damage that happened to us in the past and we think we'll just rebuild the house, things like that happen to everybody, I don't need to look at it, I don't need to deal with it, I don't need to fight through this thing and get past it, you know what, we might be okay. It might happen. It's a wonder. your house might have been built well enough but you know what else might happen? you might go on 10 or 15 years and a strong wind of life might come along and your whole house might crumble and people will say, how could that have happened? it looked like she had such a strong house we pay a price for the passive approach we take to our emotions there's a lot of pain in looking at stuff that happened in the past and it's not about having this thing be the big thing, the focus of our life. It's being about getting past that, being able to go on and regain control of our life. A big thing to me is the fact Ernie Larson, the authority on family systems, has a neat way of saying it. He talks about when individuals get to go into recovery and reexamine what happened in their lives. It's not about blaming parents. They probably were playing the best hand they could with the hand that they were dealt. That's a graceful thought, isn't it? They were probably playing the game as well as they could with the cards they were dealt. You know what, though? It might not have been true for you. Maybe your parents didn't play the best hand they could with the cards they were dealt. But you know what we need to do? The goal isn't to measure how much of an account to lay at their feet or to lay at their grave. The goal is our recovery. The goal is to find out how much damage got done. What do we need to do to rebuild this? To recover our lives and to start living. It's what it takes. And if we look at what happened passively and say, I don't need to go into that, we will not be able to regain our lives. To the point that we look at dead-end jobs or bad marriages or children or any kind of other unfulfillment as the cause of our situation, to that extent we will be deadened to life. If the problem is out there for where I am right now, I've given up that part of power that I would have in my own life. It's not to minimize the pain that was involved. I realize that for some of us the pain was horrendous. We paid an enormous cost. What I want to say is you're worth surviving. You can't get on with it without the recovery. You can't get on with it without accepting responsibility for what happened and saying, it happened to me, what do I need to do? How do I need to take on this life again? People in recovery seem to be those who are able to regain responsibility. It's a powerful factor. They seem to take an assertive role in addressing generational patterns and finding a way to conquer over that. It's not a question of blame. It's a matter of assessing the damage and doing what it needs to be done to rebuild. Another way that we keep living passively is victim thinking. Someday, just for fun, listen to how women talk like they have no options. they do have options they just talk like they don't have any options I had to see my family for Christmas I can't go to the movie because I had to pick up my kids I confront myself and everyone I love every time I hear that I call it stinking thinking my mom just told me my mom was in town and she told me my sister Burrell her family is going to have a family reunion in Texas this summer and Burl wasn't going to be able, Burl couldn't go on her favorite vacation this summer because she had to go to Texas. Now you guys don't know Burl, but it's like Burl had to go to Texas. Burl is 40 years old. She's a strong woman. You know what? She didn't have to go to Texas. She might choose to go to Texas. If she chooses not to go to Texas, she might have to pay a relational price with her mom, her dad, with the rest of the family. She didn't have to go to Texas. When we acquiesce on these matters, when we say, I had to do this, I can't do that, we hand out our choices and our personal power by the bucketful. It's not a little thing. I had to do this. I didn't have to do anything. I chose to. You know, when I'm sick, I don't say I can't go out because I'm sick. I say, I want to stay in and rest. Is it semantics? No. It gives me my power back. And I say, this is what I'm choosing. I'm a capable, competent person, and I'm choosing to do this. We might have very limited options. You might be in an incredibly difficult marriage. You might have all kinds of problems with your kids. There might be financial problems. I realize some of us have different and more assorted, better options than others. but we always have options. We always have choices. And to the degree that we hand those away and say, I have to, I can't, we're handing our power away. Let's start taking it back and looking for the ways that we have alternatives in our life and saying, I'm choosing this. It's my life. Let's beat each other up if we catch each other talking like that. Okay. Okay, embracing truth, living life awake. Okay, how about finding about who we are as individuals? How do we do that? Now that we've looked at lies that we believe about ourselves and everything, it's like, okay, I've confronted the lies, I've done all this. Now what? How do we find who we are? How do we get reminded of ourselves? I remember about two or three years ago something like that there was some kind of church we were trying to do a kinship thing and we had a picnic and there was a volleyball game going and I don't know why I went over and did it but I just decided okay I'll go play volleyball I always try to be a good sport so anyways I went and played volleyball a really weird thing happened to me I cried on the way home I thought you know what I loved volleyball it was that I told you about it, I loved sports when I was a kid I forgot I love sports it's like, what do you know that's one way we're going to find out who we are we're going to all of a sudden look and recognize God, that's me if you keep your eyes open you'll start recognizing yourself you know, guys seem to receive a lot more permission to indulge their interests they play basketball, they go fishing they go hunting, they do all these things. You know what? Their lives seem a lot richer for it. We seem to have restricted our lives. You notice how easy it is for guys to kind of get together and do something and then women just don't do it? It's like, when do they get together? I mean, they do stuff like this, but it's like, when do they get together? When do they say, you know, let's go to the ball game together? Whatever it is that stirs their hearts. I don't know what it is. We keep our lives getting smaller and smaller. If you had a free day, you could wake up in any city in the world, and you had 24 hours to do anything you wanted, what would you do? Where would you go? Would you go biking? Would you go skiing? Would you go to an art institute? Not what would just be fun. What would be you? What would be you? If you're pulled out of your life and put in a blank spot, What would the splash of your life look like? How do we get reminded of ourselves? One thing is, what if we never knew who we were? Some of us got lost before we ever were able to find ourselves. How about starting out by confronting the lie that women are the enemy and making some choices and saying, I'm going to choose to have some friends and allowing those women to be a mirror for us of who we are. Do you ever feel that affirming touch that it is when another woman comes to you and tells you something true about yourself and it's like, that is who I am. Just that wonderful feeling of getting affirmed in that way. Sometimes those might look like compliments. Sometimes they might look like criticisms. Take them wherever you get them. If you find out who you are, just take them wherever you get them. I had a really dear friend that I had a discussion with a couple years ago. it was kind of a heated discussion, actually. And she confronted me. She says, Carolyn, why do you always have to be so deep? Everything has to be serious with you. And, you know, we were crying and yelling at each other back and forth. And, you know, fortunately, we had enough relationship that we survived it and stuff. And I felt really incriminated by it. I was like, Cal, what is wrong with me? Why do I always have to be deep? Why does everything have to be serious? You know what? I remembered something. I'm deep. I think deep. I love serious things. That's what gets my heart. That's who I am. That's Carolyn. It's like, hey, this is okay. It might not be who she is, but it's me. Thanks for the reminder. I don't think she meant it as a compliment. We also need to let go of some cultural perceptions that we have. One of the things that I know about myself is that I'm critical. Critical is not a real good way to be. We're told we're not supposed to be critical. We're criticizing all this. You know what? What if you're a seeker who's looking for truth? You've been told a lot of lies. You know, one tool you're going to really have to have, you're going to have to think critically. It's going to keep you safe. You know what? I weigh everything out before I let it in. Carolyn is critical. I'm not negative. and critical. It's an okay way to be. Society, the church might say that's not a good way to be. It's how I survive. It's going to keep me safe from all kinds of lies. Embrace who we are and don't believe all the standards that are out there that tell us who we need to be. Another way that we can get reminded of who we are is to listen to God. When God talks to you in your heart, I think you all know, you know it's him. When he does that certain stirring and gives you a word, it's like your spirit responds. I have a really neat friend that I love. And she shared with me a story. As she's been going out and regaining lost territory for herself, she went for a walk in the fall. And she said that she was just looking up and saw how gorgeous the trees were and all the colors, the orange and the yellow, just the beauty of it. And it was a bright blue sunny day. And she stood under one of the trees and she looked up and the sun went through the trees. And she said, God, it is so beautiful. This creation you made is so beautiful. And you know what my father told my friend? He said, you're part of the beauty. You are part of the beauty. And you know what I'll say? I'm her sister, and I'll tell you something. She is part of the beauty. When I see my friend and I see a beautiful scene, she's part of the beauty. She is a wonder. We need to listen to what God has to say to us, and we need to reaffirm it in each other, tell each other what is beautiful about them. And we need to keep our ears open, even when we're looking for God in other ways. make sure we're open to listen what he has to say about us. And when you get those words treasure in your heart, I've got little treasures of different things that God has shown me along my life. And I keep them in a treasure chest. And those are truths that I hold on to. And when the days are dark, I hold on to it. Van Morrison, he's a great singer. You guys should hear his tapes. He has a song, Hold on to the truth you know in the darkest hour. hold to the truth you know in your darkest hour I got some great truths to hold in my chest might not be enough to loom in the world but I hold on to those truths you need to hold on to who God has told you you were and when you recognize things in yourself that you know are true of you and recognize things that others can affirm in you and things that you know are true about God hold them, keep them safe repeat them to each other teach them to your children when you're waking up and going down when you're eating, when you pass each other on the way, share these truths. It's a battleground for truth. One warning I want to give you about the wonderful, when you're embracing truth and rediscovering yourself, you might find some parts of yourself that you thought you left a long time ago. You know, I mean, there's no real secret about this. Part of the reason we leave parts of ourselves behind is we didn't really like those parts. I got really surprised when I started being willing to regain me back. I started seeing this really loud, opinionated person that didn't look real appealing to me. It's like, God, you know what, I kind of remember that. I gave this picture of this 7-year-old, freckled and skinny legs, and she was really loud and really opinionated and kind of obnoxious. I could hear my mom saying, Carolyn, there were 20 kids out playing in the alley, and I could hear your voice over everyone else's voice. And it's like, God, I thought this was gone. You might find some parts that aren't as palatable as other parts. I had a choice. Was I going to choose me or was I going to choose some culturally palatable characteristic? You know, if I chose the less opinionated, quieter, less obnoxious, all those other things, they all fit. If I chose that, I think I would be more palatable to more people. Maybe more people would not find me offensive. But if I was me, there might be more people who really didn't like me. That was the choice I had to make. You know what I chose? I'm going to be me. I like me. It looks really familiar. Carolyn's back, and I remember her, and not everyone's going to like her, but it's really going to be me. think back to when you were six or eight or when you can remember you being really you. What do you remember about you? Do you see a lot of that in you? When I think about the six-year-olds that I knew, India and Linda and Sarah and Debbie and Doris, I think how different they were from each other. I wonder how different they look from each other now. Another way that we can get wakened up to life is by embracing truth about life. what are truths that we know about life I want to share some truths that set me free and like just with all the other things they're going to look different for you I'll share how they looked for me I told you the lie that was the strongest lie that held me back well the truth that replaced it it wasn't that God was responsible for my life I even get offended hearing that statement it's like what are you saying But the truth that set me free is that I am responsible to become a transformed one. I am responsible to become a transformed one. Can I do the transforming? No way. I've got a God above who's willing to do it. But I am responsible for putting myself in the spot that I can become a transformed one. At first, this realization was horrible for me. I felt like I was all alone in a huge solar system. It felt like I'd had this God hovering all around me and always diddling, I don't mean to belittle this, but he was always playing with my life details. And all of a sudden, he got on a spaceship and he went, whoo! And I was all alone. I had this feeling for months. You know now how painful that lie was for me, that I was willing to do that. There's always pain in these things. I had believed that I had a God who was primarily taking care of little details in my life, working in the externals, causing this coincidence, taking care of that circumstance, bringing tribulation, taking away tribulation, all those little things. Instead of taking care of the details of my life, telling me which way to go, the way he was going to work in me was to transform me. A really scary thought. This might have been how he'd been working all along. What if he hadn't been dabbling in my circumstances all along? When I decided to go on a short-term missions trip, and all these kind of things kind of went together, and coincidences happened, and I thought, God wanted me to go. that wasn't God telling me to go that's what I based my decision on for a bunch of coincidences God had opened the door that's how I said it he didn't work all the detail out that wasn't the miracle you know what the miracle was? he created in my new heart a heart that wanted to go work with those people I was a transformed one and I gave him credit for doing coincidences in my life and I didn't even see this enormous miracle that happened and he's changing me. He's giving me a love for those people before that I never would have had a love for. What's the miracle that three phone calls can come at the right time or that me, I've got a transformed heart and I'm full of love for those people and I'm willing to go and live there? What's the bigger miracle? I had based many life decisions on how the dice had rolled, how the cards had fallen. How big of a God is that? I realize now that God's miracles were going to be about becoming transformed. I could worship that God. I could worship that God. He was transforming me to become a vehicle of Christ on earth. There was aloneness, but despite the aloneness, I realized that it was a God I could worship, a God I could trust. a God I could welcome my daughter to. And things start seeming a lot less confusing. I had a friend who, three years ago, she was a single mom and was really concerned about what was happening to her kids. She was living in the city, and she wasn't able to have as much interaction with her kids. And she decided that she wanted to see if she could find another house, another place for the kids to be. And she ended up finding a house, which was out in the country, and details really didn't go that smoothly, but she saw that God worked, and she was able to get that house, and that God worked all the details out, and God opened the door, and she thanked God that he showed her which house to have. Now that's neat. I mean, it's neat if that's how God would work, but you know what? I saw a miracle. I saw a woman that used to be afraid. I saw a woman that wasn't competent. I saw a woman who thought she could not survive without a man. And I saw her take care of her kids. I saw her realize that what was best for her kids was not living in the city. I saw her know her kids well enough to say, if I have them in the country, I think that'll be good for them. That's what I want for my kids. And then you know what she did? She fought for it. She who was weak was strong. She fought it. She had all kinds of men in her way, and she fought them. That was a miracle. My friend, who before was incompetent, was competent. She who was afraid was strong, was full of power. She was victim to circumstances. She was assertive with her circumstances, and she lives in that house in the country and tells people how neat it was that God worked it out. And I say, praise God, the miracles inside of that woman. Now that's a mighty God. To me, that's like parting the Red Sea and you choke on the dust. There was a miracle that happened there. And when we look at externals, we get distracted about the miracles that are happening inside of us. Wonderful things, throw-you-against-the-wall things. Stuff that will make people remember the God that they kept responding to. Another truth that set me free. Life is difficult. That was a big one for me. Once I knew it was supposed to be difficult, I stopped being surprised by it. I stopped expecting things to go well. And sometimes I was even surprised at how well things would go. I have a brother that I love. I love him like a brother. I love this brother. And we went on vacation with him years ago. And we were all reading Scott Peck's book, Road Less Traveled. The first sentence in Scott Peck's book is, life is difficult. And I remember my brother, we were together up at the lake, about eight days or something like that. And every day I'd look in Clyde's bed, and there it was. The book was open to page one. And it's like, are you reading this book, Clyde? He says, yeah, I'm reading it. And I'd see him sitting up, and he's reading it. I'd see him at the dock, and he's reading it. and then I'd see the book, and it was opened up right here, and I'd look at it, and it was page one. My brother took three months to get past page one. It's that big. The lies trap us. They trap us so much we couldn't even get past that. It took me a couple years to get through that book. Life is difficult. And once I believed it, and once I decided to stop being surprised at it, it wasn't as big of a deal. and God it's true, life is difficult you know, I don't know anyone whose life is easy anyone that I really know I mean, your life might look easy to me anyone I really know, I don't know anyone whose life is easy why are so many of us surprised then that life is difficult I don't get that Carl Jung, the psychologist I think I'm married to a psychologist I've got to quote a psychologist says that at the heart of every mental disorder is the unwillingness or inability to accept the difficulty of life. The unwillingness or inability to accept the difficulty of life. Do you think we're paying a price for not accepting the fact that life is difficult? For thinking it's supposed to be easy, we're paying an incredible price. Another thing that set me free that's part of that was that I started to embrace pain or accept pain. Pain was going to be a constant threat in my life. It wasn't something good to surprise it. It was just going to be there. The important thing about life, about pain, is identifying how we got into it. If we can learn something from pain. Am I in pain because I made a bad choice? How can I make a better choice next time? We can learn from pain. And sometimes pain happens. Bad things happen. that's part of the fall bad things are going to happen just because I'm in pain doesn't mean I'm necessarily in God's will and he's stretching me it also doesn't mean I'm out of God's will it means I'm in pain that's what we do know we can know that much a third truth that I found about life that set me free was that life choices have consequences sounds pretty obvious doesn't it? We tell it to our kids. But I used to get surprised when it happened. If I choose to have four children instead of two or one, guess what? I'm going to have more demands on my time. I'm going to have more responsibilities. We're going to have less cash. I'm going to have less free time than my friend who has one child. And it's going to be harder for me to achieve at my job. I'm going to have more demands that's a natural consequence there will be obvious gains children are an obvious gift that isn't the issue the point is there's consequences for having four children there's consequences for every single decision we make and we get surprised when consequences come and we wonder why this strange thing has come upon us when we make bad choices there's probably going to be some bad stuff happening even when we make good choices there's going to be some consequences for it when I go to when I choose to go to the Caribbean which is a great choice for me there are consequences that I pay for months afterwards it's a good choice for me there's consequences and we sit with our head in our hands and say why has this come upon me it's a natural consequences and when we start accepting the fact that life has consequences and accepting responsibility for the repercussions of our choices, we take back control of our own lives. The last area in living awake is choosing to live assertively, deciding we're no longer going to be passive participants in our own lives. One way we do that is by taking responsibility. We've given up responsibility for so many areas. One way we've given up responsibility is in the physical area. I told you about Paula's funeral, and it felt like as women we were just victims of what was happening to our bodies. And I don't know, was it the radiation and the atmosphere? Who knows what it was, but it was happening to us. I got kind of mad, and fortunately my madness took me to a library, and I decided to get two or three books by experts on breast cancer. You know what I found out? They think they know some of the factors that give you a predisposition to breast cancer. No one at the funeral had said that. You know what? You need more fiber, you have less fat, you get more exercise, less stress. There's all kinds of different things. There are different things that I could do to reduce my risks. I thought I was walking around like a walking time bomb, but any day this was going to happen to me. You know what I did? I started to run. I started to notice I was eating less fat. I started doing all these things. But you know the biggest thing? I started taking power over my own life. I decided it's okay if I'm aging. I want to do it valiantly. I want to live life valiantly. Does that sound good? I want to say, it might come at me, but it's not going to come without a fight. I'm going to take back some control. It's also true with, I mentioned about our reproductive systems. I refuse to make life decisions in the four days before my period It's just a policy I've made I'll make light of most of the perceptions that I have during those four days I'll warn family members that I'm a woman under the influence I'll take PMS medication I'll try to get the two extra hours of sleep that they say helps this I'll do all kinds of things I promise myself I'll never initiate divorce proceedings during this period of time I won't quit my job. I won't take my own self-condemnation quite as seriously. I will make light of myself. I'm taking responsibility. It's my body, and I'm noticing certain patterns, and I'm taking control. My mind and my emotions will not be subject to my body. I still get affected, but I'm making some choices. It's credible the power that you get from that. I will value the insights this period gives me. You know what? During those four days, I'm a lot more sensitive to things that I really care about. I will watch what I weep about. Sometimes those are things very dear to my heart. They will give me insight. I'm not going to feel I'm betrayed by this time. I will embrace it, and I will make sure that I'm not the victim of it. Spiritually, How do I take responsibility for my life? I don't know why, but as women we seem especially prone to be tossed by every new persuasion that comes along. I'm really sad about that. But we do. I think we, I don't know if it's that we respond more emotionally or what it is, but that's true of us. We need to recognize the susceptibility. Recognize it's there. We need to make allowance for it. We need to be a little more suspicious and responsible about what we believe. We need to become critical thinkers. We need to challenge each other not to embrace a gospel of confusion. Like I said, he's not a God of confusion. And if our theology makes no sense, I don't think it's all of God. If your theology contradicts itself, I think you need to ask what you really believe. If you're constantly rewriting your maps and distrusting your navigational equipment, I think you need to look at where you got the information that's on your maps. And you need to have your equipment readjusted. Jesus knew his path. He seemed to know when his time was up in a place, and he seemed to know when it was time to stay. He spent time in seclusion. He had the mind of God. We have the mind of Christ. Do you believe it? We have the mind of Christ. Let's grow into using it. You might not feel equipped to fight the enemy, but I'll tell you something. If you can tell the truth from a lie, you're ready. if you can tell the truth from a lie you're ready the battleground is for truth and that's where we can fight it I'm not saying you should believe what I believe that isn't the point at all but I want you to know what you do believe know what your faith is based on know how you believe God works otherwise you'll be the victim of every chance happening or strange teaching that comes along don't let that happen know what you believe to summarize what it means to live responsibly in a sense we all live by a rule book not all of us know where those rules came from who gave you those rules did it come from your church? did it come from a dysfunctional family member? did it come from school? where did those rules come from? Were they a lie of our culture? We'll need to promise ourselves to examine the foundations that we've built our houses on and promise ourselves no matter what the cost that we'll get rid of shaky foundations and rebuild new foundations so that we can get on with the business of living life and we can redefine success we might start living assertively. You know what I thought success was to be the kind of woman or wife or mother or employee or whatever else that other people would respect and even better if they'd emulate, that they really looked up to me. That's what I thought it meant to be successful. That might happen. My standard for being employed was to have a work record that was exemplary and be thought well of, but I didn't get so obsessive about it that my kids were going to suffer. My standard for myself to take care of myself physically was to push myself, challenge myself, half admittedly to keep in shape for how I looked but not get obsessive about it. I had standards as a housekeeper that I wanted to keep the house kind of clean, decorate it in a unique way but not get too materialistic. Do you notice something about all this? the margin for error is pretty small. There are a lot of roles to live. There's a lot of achievements to live up to. How much of a chance will there be for my personality to shine through? How much of a chance will there be for God to break through and reveal himself to a sin-sick world that's starving for God? Another problem. My success or failure was pretty dependent on how others assessed it. it. It was couched in spiritual or supposedly appropriate terms, like being a good testimony, living a consistent life. You all know what the terms are. But I was handing the report card for my life out way too often. I was handing my report card and saying, how am I doing? My friends would report on me, my associates, my husband, my kids, my boss. I was successful when others thought well of me. What if the most courageous, right decision you could make this week would be one that others thought was totally wrong? What if? Would you make the hard decision? Would you make the right decision? What's important? What does it mean to you to be successful? I've come up with some of my own definitions of success. This is where I'm starting. Success for me is not giving up hope. Success for me is living up to who I was created to be. Success is unraveling the gift I've been given and appropriating it progressively. Success is learning to know God intimately and receive the identity he's given. You know what? I can do that. That gives me hope. That gives me energy. I can worship my God. I can put myself underneath his authority and become the transformed one. We need to redefine success based on who we are and what we value. Take some of your own time. Set up your personal goals. What's your life mission statement? What has God revealed it to be so far? What are you passionate about? How did God make you unique? And how is God going to look different through your life than he does through everyone else's? We need to see God in as many ways as we can. I need to see God in you. I need to see him in a unique way. What if I'm the person who needs to see the ocean splashing on the walls, and that person is trying to be the person who's the Alps? I'm not going to get to see God in that way. There's power in even writing these things down and setting our goals. What we need to do is set our stake in the land and say, in this territory, this is what matters. This is the standard by which achievements will be judged. And we need to hold on to that territory. Thank you.
