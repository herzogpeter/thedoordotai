I'm a speaker this morning. It's going to be a great joy. From deep within my heart, I have profound love for this man. I haven't spent a lot of time with him. He has profoundly affected my life and has affected your life. Because after he affected me, and raising the world was embarrassing, I began to pull him and pull him into the service. I don't know what he's going to say to you about the part of it. That's why I can talk about it so much. Thank you. and the roots of the U.S. I hope Ted is from New York and now in Transformation the U.S. and the audience is still true and I'm not going to say back, back, back, back and back I'm sure you know that Brooklyn New York is the largest American I was in the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think I'll be looking at you. Now make him as a boy. Now make him as a boy. Now make him as a boy. Speak a boy to us. One voice. And finally God says. Let me tell you what God is from this end. Thank you. I had this little friend with a Jewish kid who saw him. Whether he was a kiddie card, he had a whole bunch of t-shirts, he set a puck in the shovel, and set him the same guy with the play. And the shovel went out with his own lives, and we got big. It came quite close, but it was the years of the last part. In 1850, the Korean War came along. I was a sophomore in college, and the rest of the world, and I was here. I dropped that, I just had the green floor. So I went to the army. And more importantly, when I was, I was married. I got a niece to be married. I woke up the farm in my Catholic world. I went up in a Franciscan seminary in the Catholic Church. I got a native priest. So many years have passed since. So I had said one another. But one day, I remember like the words I was going to be met with the Muslim group. He had an animated conversation. And of course, I think he told me that he had recently become a convert from Jewish faith. He was gathered. Well, I was intrigued by how a Jew looks at Jesus as a Jew, because Jews in their aspects are better than 10 to be much more creative, poetic, imaginative, than we can barely stay in the rest of the questions. So I asked him, so I'm sure he said what Jesus said. He said, do you think about it? And the next day, he's going to think about it. He said that he said about it. Now what he told me, a piece of paper that I've heard is going to have published 10 a year later, is now written through this a time to fill up the world. It's become the largest selling book in the history of our heart and the book of the world. And I'm sure that many of you have this moment, as many of you, Peter, Saul, and name, Michelle, and so understand the same. He's a quiet, best-to-do, but Jesus Christ is a man. Once upon a time, there was a tree. She loved the boy. And the boy loved her tree. Every day would come. In front of the trunk. Just be from the branches. New rapids. He was tired. He was tired. He was ashamed. He was active. They had no sleep. One day, the boy carved in the trunk of the tree. Dream. I love being. And that bit of a very funny. That's for something. The boy stayed in the room. She really wanted to do this. When he came back, he treated me so bad. She didn't get it away. Sure. Sure. She said, come forward. I'm not going to swim with my branches. Yeah, that's really happy. What he said? Not right. Well, I just did it because I found out what the roof was like. It took me to my head. Yeah, it's like, I don't know what I said. I'm sure. But pump all my apples, I seldom am I sitting there, and get my candy hat. So I went to the other way, and the train was happening. But now the way is that I am in life. When you came back, you knew yourself happy. She called me to speak. She said, "Come to earth, and climb up my dream, and swing from my breath, and come to hell." Life's a lot more serious than the front man is a little sober. I want to get married, sell them out for the family, Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm saying, God, I know this stuff is in my temple. I'm feeling this stuff, and I'm feeling this stuff. I can't wait to hear you. I'm feeling this stuff. And that's what I'm feeling this way. It's my understanding. Jesus Christ. It is a beautiful, modern, and modern. And she calls the giving tree. When the tree freely surrenders our apples or branches in our trunk, Saul said, I'm reminded of Jesus, both with all women Philippians, he emptied himself. He emptied himself. He cried out his tongue, held in his hands, held out his foot, and helped us believe in Jesus. Significantly, Jesus chose the giving tree for his cross. as the demonstrative sign of his absolute love of the manhood. Whether they not count death to fireflies, or in the words of Sarah Rosen, the mightiest act of love, the wind will rise. So, so, do you see how goofy, how wacky, how crazy it is ever to imagine that Christianity consists primarily in what we do for God. You know, the poor, pitiful, puny things we sometimes manage to do for, and we trust God. Try this to. Making these very simple sacrifices, like coming to the 11th of the Christian Christian. God bless you. close enough to the fire to keep warm, but don't want to plunge in, because we know it can not burn, and can't just leave for it, and life will never get the same again. Is that what you're showing? Is this the good news of Jesus? Is this the king that he proclaimed, a community of men and women who go to church on Sunday? Read the Bible, I don't know. glory for his resurrection, why he poured out his Holy Spirit upon the church, was it merely to make nicer men and women with better morals? The gospel is sincere. The life of Jesus is the only ones. Unless we knew they lived, died and rose, with but one purpose in mind, pending cause to pour out the Holy Spirit upon the church, not to make nicer people with better morals, but brand new creations, a community of prophets and lovers. And in the middle of the sea, we have a mystery of the fire, the spirit of the earth. We live and every bring us all, and the on-the-end Christian world of God. We enter into the center of our lives, and in their very heart, the mystery of Christ, the center that flame, that consumes, verifies, and sets everything aglow with peace, joy, and extravagant love, which is really what it means. The claim name is true. Our religion never gets into it with what we do for God. It always starts with what God does for us. The great, wondrous thing that God created a message for us. He can praise Jesus. This morning, when the Lord comes straight into your life, in the power of his word, in the fellowship of his faith community, All he asks is that you can give stars to the body. The next time you have a cross, you learn at what price you are about. All God asks is that you have a surprise. Let's see how it's all about you. You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it. And we know this part of the planet that's for a second. I would suggest that in this moment, until you put your head in the pillow wet tonight, that the focus of your life is just on one truth. A staggering, mind-blowing truth. That God loves you, just as you are, and how you should be. That God loves you, just as you are, and how you should be. That God loves you, not the person next to you. That God loves Billy Graham, not the reason. And that God wants to cherish the world. Not that God wants us to pay way to hold you grace. But to treat that God wants you in such a way that he'd rather die than be without you. It's the end of the day that you were just a day. At least the Lord and the Holy God. The most difficult part of the future is to allow yourself to believe. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a loser. I'm such a wrong person. If you don't get to be the wrong people, you will find out there. There is so much in sincerity, so much in hypocrisy. I mean, from Sunday to Sunday, I only ever think about God, about Jesus. And this all talk continues. I think that's me. We're going to be talking about this. I'm going to be talking about this. When you speak of yourself, when you speak of all those things, all the dreams that you've ever realized, all the joy that you've ever realized, It all about it. It's amazing. Self-hapering is an enemy so much good. And notice I can just speak for it because self-hapering suddenly reestablishes me as the center of my focus of concern and building me. That's idolatry. Let me digress from you. And reflect on the image you have put yourself like you before Jesus Christ. I think it's accurate to say that every person in the building right now is getting a different kind of feedback from the risen Lord. In these past 20 years, the preaching of the gospel around the world, the wide and kind of setting, the Presbyterian Church of the Lutheran, Southern Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Evangelical Church of the Shoresquare, I've come to see with Roman clarity that the biggest single mistake that we American Christians fall into is this. It's an attitude, a mindset that says, if I change, then Jesus will be. He ever found himself in control? If I can just change, I can't. If I can just try and fight, then he will first. And he will be born and lost. If I could just give me those self-centered, ego-testing lectures, being inspired and what the thoughts of my mind had never told me pure art, then Jesus would love me. If you think of that way, you're not going to feel it. It's not a good feeling. It's not a good feeling. I'm going to be a good feeling. It's not a good feeling. I promise that it's going to be a good feeling. I'm going to be so kind and so patient. It was a compassionate, thoughtful, generous, wise and loving that I went on in my trances, but never sees you look like a pagan. That night, I was like, I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner, I'm a Greek, I'm a sinner. In my own, this kind of way I was saying, what if I changed? I love you. Because I was always friends. I was trying to be a friend. I was saying, I'm a dead. It's not a big mistake. through a serious delusion that triples our growth, Holy Spirit, presenting breakthrough, and a transparent Christian personality. Because every time you say, Jesus, if I change, you'll love me with you. He answers you go back. He's going back. He's going back. I'm going to be speaking. I'm going to be speaking. I'm going to be speaking. Actually, I'm going to be speaking. I'm going to be speaking. But we don't have to change. We're going to be speaking. I was 22 years old with a case of a new apartment in New York. The first members are against me. It's a matter of water. They're making me play. They're not going to say anything. There's something there. The apartment president says, I'm going to tell you something. He's like, he said, you're a table man. You're a table man. You're a table man. And then I feel like the question is about the next question. The start of that episode, that message is over. I don't even trust it. I don't think. No, he said, I didn't hear it. I don't sound as much. But I didn't properly make it all the words it was. As I was. Not as I was supposed to. However, I didn't say I have to. I got to. I ought. I must. Or I should. I said, I want to be my table etiquette because I knew that I was not. You don't have to change. We'll be good to be done by the Lord. You don't have to change. We'll be good. When you reflect on the unconditional love of God and find out of Jesus and after, it's going to turn the faith in the Gospels. Focus on characters and we do because if you look just like ourselves, I think we can just read every day. I do. You're right. Peace out. Thank you. Thank you. and men are loving Lord. Why is it good to focus on the biblical characters? Because God was in Jesus, affirming them all, forgiving them all, enabling them all, challenging them for going to force a life. And that Jesus, who was saved yesterday, today, forever, is in this moment right now, challenging human and every same reality to look up our idols, our superstitions, our cowardice, our gods of human manufacturing, and open to surrender to the God Jesus' face saying, I am so tired of you. I am so sick and tired of your broken promises, your unkind resolutions, your inconsistent discipleship. I've got one with Jesus right here. He's a business. I wouldn't have a run. If Jesus faces any one word in the word being, repent for what they say. Thank you. Thank you. What does Jesus face? What kind of feedback are you getting from? Just a moment. Just a moment. Not a front-end feedback. Great understanding. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, it's a Christ. It's a great spirit. It's a long way. You're running under your sins. It's a false. It's a great spirit. It's a great spirit. It's a great spirit. It's a great spirit. Even getting nervous for your life. Never can I have another sin? I'm going to church every Sunday. I read the Bible every day. When they bury you, you will look like a shriveled old thing. Why? Because Christianity was always a horrible color or an ethic, but it was never a love of faith. Never. Never. In the 39 years, it's a very bad way to go back to the church. It's a very good thing. It's a very bad thing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There are things there that block God's way to us. Do you see why it's so important to leave all of these basic truths of our faith? Because you're not going to be as big as your own concept of God. Remember the famous line? The French from us, the way is Pascal. God made man in his own everything. And we turned to the power. We don't have to make God in our own everything. He wants us to be as trusted, brown, narrow-minded, insensitive, judgmental, unforgiving, unblocking his will. The best of us for you is a good person out there. I've mentioned that you can't watch the same. The American Amplified is coming to our hospital. A thousand dollars in my room. I've been in church in Key West, Florida, Albuquerque, Seattle, San Diego, Portland, Oregon, Kansas City, Chicago, New York. And as the God of so many Christians I think, is a God who is too small for me. Because he's not the God of the Word. He is not the God revealed by Jesus Christ. Who loves his head to the Lord. And how he's with God. And as I say to you, may be the greatest of your life. The greatest of your life. Thank you. God bless you. And that's so we've seen what they actually do for the first time in this Christmas tree. We're going to be back to the beginning of the world. We're waiting to have been noticed in God's provisional love. And they've had some good brightness of Jesus Christ in the world of our lives. In 1982, we have a reception in the morning. The rise of life, Mary. The birth of the marriage of the Southern Catholic Church is going to be presented to God. And as a hierarchy of the people. The time for the great people. I was there for seven months. Thank you. And it's actually madness. It's not my strength to work with. It's never said that. I got up and we had a story. What we used to call the middle of the church. Not eternal. I don' t reason. Go to the chapel. My family is one hour. I pray is one of the sicker. On the night, 3-7-13, 18-62. Jeremiah began as a long, what we thought was. I heard, in faith, Jesus Christ said, Amen. Thank you. I realized that I was still a friend. That night of the family was invisible. Famous on a blood screener, every minute for his body, and I heard the cry of his blood. He said, It is not a lie. The longer I look for, I realized that no man has ever loved me, and no one can ever love me as he does, come out in the darkness and shout out in the night, Jesus, are you praising? Amen. Thank you. Thank you.. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's a lot of fun. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Amen. Thank you. Lord, we have been saved in the universe of the salvation. We have been rejected by our friends and prayed by our enemies. We have been saved and saved and saved. We are saved by the power of Jesus. I have certain things that we know there are. We know there are things we know there are things we know. I think it is us. Thank you. and themselves be loved by Jesus. It may be feelings that are bad. It may be remorse. It may be a radical inferiority complex or a profound sense of shame. It may be shallow faith, whatever. It really encourages you to be in that situation just to come forward as the service closes. And your shoes here are in your sensory culture. Really gifted. and your prayer and joy and love you and love you. My last word is a blessing written by my spirit of Director Williams very high. May all your expectations be frustrated. May all your plans be forthcoming. May all your desires be withered into nothingness that you may experience the powerlessness and poverty of the child and sing and dance in the love of God who is Father, Son, and Spirit. Amen. Thank you.
