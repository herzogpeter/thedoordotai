Nice. Good evening, everybody. All right, tonight we're going to do a little work on the learning curve that there is associated with learning to walk in the Spirit and just try to put together this vision that Dallas and I have been trying to give you of walking in both the character and the power of the kingdom with the simple vision that we've put before you of being the cooperative friends of Jesus, seeking to live constant lives of creative goodness. And that's all rooted in the covenant with Adam and Eve, the covenant with Abraham, Pentecost, you know, the sending out of the church filled with fruit and gifts. So we're trying to be the cooperative friends of Jesus through the power of the Holy Spirit and for the sake of the world around us. And as we begin to actually do that, to try to hear from the Lord, to tentatively speak for the Lord, to lay hands on people, it's just frankly, if anybody's ever really tried to do it, you know, it's a little bit scary. And there is a definite learning curve there that has to happen. And some perspectives that maybe need to change. I always, whenever I think about this, I think of this story not too long ago of a little boy who was in a wedding. It wasn't a church quite like this one. It was more of a traditional church, you know, with just one aisle instead of two. Can you picture that? You know, or four, whatever we got here, eight. So just one, you know, one main aisle in this little church. It's almost like a chapel. And, you know, the wedding parties come forward, and this little boy comes walking up the aisle. And as he walks up the aisle, he turns to one side and goes, roar. And then he takes another couple steps, and he turns to the other side and goes, roar. step, step, roar. And he gets up to the front and the best man looks at him and goes, what the heck are you doing? And the little boy looks up as him as if he's nuts. And he goes, well, I was being the ring bear. So you see the story that we think we're living in, what we actually think is going on, you know, actually makes a big difference or you know I I travel a lot and I I heard this story that of a woman who can you picture like uh you guys got to go through Chicago a hair a lot around here you know from getting somewhere to picture a place like Chicago you know where they have those black vinyl chairs you know that are sort of rounded like this like they're made for you to slip out of them you know what I mean they're like the most uncomfortable chairs in the world and you know how they'll have like three or four of those black vinyl chairs and then attached to it you know is one of those little tables are you with me here and then there'll be three or four more chairs well this lady finds out that her flight's delayed a big shock at O'Hare right her her flight's delayed and so she thinks ah shoot and so she goes into the store and she buys a magazine and one of those little packages of crackers you know or cookies where you've got like six cookies or crackers in it are you with me here and a cup of coffee and she comes and sits down and she puts her coffee and her crackers on the table and she begins to read her magazine and out of the corner of her eye she notices that the guy over there is helping himself to one of her crackers and she's already a little ticked off you know that her plane's delayed and so now she's like kind of steaming a little bit inside but it's so socially awkward she doesn't know what to say so she's saying ah the heck with it well then she sees the guy's helping himself to another one of her cookies and now she's like so boiling inside she doesn't think she can say anything or she'll be an idiot you know and then sort of like the last straw was the guy takes the last cracker he breaks it in half pushes half over to her side and eats the other half well just then as she's about to either commit murder or suicide you know she's sort of torn between which she hears her plane called and she gets up and she walks over to the jetway and as she gets to the uh the gate attendant she reaches into her purse to get her boarding pass and she finds her unopened package of cookies now not long ago i was telling that story in in san francisco and or somewhere in the bay area i think it was san francisco and this young couple you know like mid-20s came running up to me afterwards and said, Todd, Todd, I know who that happened to. That's a true story. And I'm like, well, duh, I'm a minister. I don't lie. And they said, they said, no, no, no. But when that got recorded, wherever I had read it, when it got recorded, they got some of the details wrong. So that was like my cousin. I can't remember. And here's what really happened. It wasn't a package of cookies. It was a Kit Kat bar, you know, break me a piece, you know, it was a Kit Kat bar. So this guy's like breaking off pieces of her Kit Kat bar and eating it. And the guy must have had a major sweet tooth because what happened is he got up from there and went over to the Cinnabon shop. You know what I mean? They haven't, those things ought to be illegal. Are you with me? How are you supposed to pass by one of those without, you know? So he goes over to the Cinnabon shop and he orders one of those big old sticky, you know, cinnamon rolls. And she follows behind him, just full of angry righteous indignation and he turns around with his coffee and his cinnamon roll and she looks at him with the nastiest look and takes a big bite out of his cinnamon roll like you know take that you ate my kit kat bar I'm you know eating some of your cinnamon roll well what happens she gets home that night and she puts her purse on her nightstand or whatever in her bedroom and goes to throw her keys in her purse and looks in and you got it looks in and sees her unopened kit kat bar what is up with that so the point is here there's a learning curve and uh you may find your world being rocked a little bit like the little boy who thought he was doing it just right or the or the lady who you know thought she was responding to what's going on but it's all good. It's all okay. That's what Dallas was trying to say this morning, that there's just, or this afternoon, there's just no pressure in this. And, you know, it's not an excuse to be, you know, completely bizarre. And it's certainly not an excuse to ever do anything that would hurt others. It's just to let us feel again a little bit like children, that this is like learning to walk or learning to speak or learning a foreign language, that you're just not going to get it perfect is all I'm trying to say. I'm trying to lift that burden off you of somehow trying to get that this perfect because it's just not going to happen. Nobody does. You know, the best thing we have to protect that, two things, communities of love and the pursuit of character and power. You know, I was talking to some friends at dinner and saying back to me, or was talking about, you know, just the 1 Corinthians law of love. And I was saying, yes, that's a big part of what's behind my encouragement for us to be tentative about this. I mean, think about it. God so values human personhood that he rarely like just picks a person up and shakes them like a rag doll and makes them do what he wants them to do. It is, it is unspeakably rare because he so values leaving us because created in his image, we have a kingdom or a queendom. And he so values that we learn to place that before him and to, and to be present and place it before others in ways that are marked by his character, that he knows that unless we grow into that, as long as he's like, you know, moving us around like chess pieces, we will never grow into the vision he has for humanity to be his cooperative people. So if we can keep those two things in our communities, building communities of love, and then secondly, if we ourselves can operate in humility then I think we're probably going to be pretty safe in this even with our mistakes along the way all right we'll get your bibles back out tonight and we're going to finish this little biblical survey of how this learning curve worked with Jesus and the disciples I read to you a couple of passages those kind of summary passages this morning from Matthew and I read you the passages from the upper room discourse where Jesus is explaining to the disciples that he's going to go away but he tells them remember don't be panicked about this it's going to be okay I'm going to send you the continuator the comforter the the person who will continue to lead the church he's going to come he'll show you what to do he'll teach you what to say and in the same way that I've been saying I only do what I see the father doing and I only say what I hear the father saying you too will be able to say that because the spirit will help you to live a similar kind of life that in a sense you will continue on the earth my incarnation and you will continue on the earth my ministry now obviously not the the unique parts of jesus's ministry the the death you know and resurrection and and a you know specific kind of death that he died but that we would continue on in the works that he was doing. Now let's turn then to the book of Luke and try to, I know this has been so much said today, as Keith was saying, it's a very long day and I don't know how you guys do what you do, but I admire you for doing it. So let's see if we can take in anything more in a day here and then we're gonna have a little more time to practice this and to minister to one another. All right, in the book of Luke, there's a, or first, I mean, I want you to place before your mind those kind of summary statements that we read of Jesus. To how he went about proclaiming the kingdom, embodying the goodness of God, and demonstrating the reality of the kingdom and its nearness. Through healing the sick, driving out demons, showing his mastery over molecules, in multiplying bread and fish, and walking on water, and calming storms. That this was the activity of Jesus. And one of the things where we're a little bit like the boy who was supposed to be being the ring bearer, where we're a little bit like that boy, is that we can tend to think that this isn't for us. That, well, you know, that's what Jesus did. And what I want to show you is a couple of the explicit places where Jesus told his disciples to do the same thing. So first in Luke 9. in verse one Jesus calls the twelve together and he gave them what two things did we talk about this morning that we can't do without power and authority he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. Now that was routine. Jesus was saying, this is what I've been doing and this is what I want you to do. Now you say, well, yeah, but I'm not one of the 12. There's only 12 thrones in heaven. My name's not on one of them. So, you know, I don't know that that's for me. Well, then you look at chapter 10, just turn over a page and look at chapter 10 and again at verse 1 we see the sending of the 70 or the 72 and it says after this the lord appointed 72 others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go he told them the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few ask the lord of the harvest therefore to send out workers into his harvest field go I'm sending you out like lambs among wolves you know I noticed once in the 70s or 80s when this was popular that I never found that verse in the Jesus people pocket promise book you know that's not a verse that makes you just want to go hallelujah you know Jesus is sending us out like lambs amongst wolves and you know this gets at the sort of learning curve thing that this isn't going to be a piece of cake, that there is a warfare that's going on here. And then he says, you know, don't take a purse or a bag or sandals. Then verse five, you know, when you enter the house, say peace. But then look at what they're explicitly asked to do. Verse nine, heal the sick who are there and tell them the kingdom of God is near you. Now what's the gospel according to Jesus? The kingdom of God is near. And he tells them, this is what you're to go preach and you're to do what I have been doing. But they weren't left as orphans to do it. So turn over to the last chapter of Luke, Luke 24. In the last couple of verses, verse 49, Luke 24, 49. you know this is kind of just luke's way of recording and talking about what we read from john this morning that i'm don't worry i'm going to send you the holy spirit here jesus says i'm going to send you what my father has promised but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high. Now again, this is similar to being baptized as Dallas was describing, or you yourself positioning yourself before God to be filled as he was saying. These are metaphors for a very similar kind of life when it comes to learning how to be the cooperative friend of Jesus who is living in your actual life as we've been talking about, constant creative goodness through the power of the Holy Spirit for others. That's what's going on here. Now, then, of course, if we turn to the book of Acts, we see how this continues on and that there was, in fact, an effect of what happened when people were filled with the Spirit or baptized with the Spirit or whatever your language might be. Now, this is something that's very important. Remember, Dallas said this afternoon at some point that the effect that comes out of it is actually the thing that's the most important. Now again, we've become friends here over the last couple of days, so let me just be a little bit candid and vulnerable with you again. In 1997, I think it was, or 98, when John Wimber died and I was taking over the helm of the Vineyard Churches in the U.S., I went to see a friend of mine who's a professor of evangelism at Fuller Seminary called Eddie Gibbs. Eddie's British. He had been a friend of John's and so I'd become a friend of Eddie's through John. And we were having lunch and I said to Eddie, I said, do you think John's thesis of power evangelism and our experiment with it is a failed experiment? Because towards the end of John's life, he was saying both to me and to other people who are close to him in private, but occasionally even in semi-public settings, John was saying that his biggest regret about the vineyard was that it didn't become the evangelistic movement he had hoped it would become i mean john is sort of controversially known as sort of you know in some settings is just sort of a wacky pentecostal or charismatic or something but he actually thought of himself as an evangelical and as an evangelical of course his highest priority was evangelism i mean his sort of magnum opus book was a book called power evangelism it was a book on evangelism not power power there is a modifier of evangelism it wasn't a book on power that happened to be about evangelism it was a book on evangelism that was suggesting that a way to do evangelism that could improve on our on preaching only that would also have the manifestations of the spirit would be a way to improve the state of evangelism in you know contemporary American evangelicalism. That was his basic thesis. But any of us who were around knew that it wasn't happening quite the way we dreamed of. And so I asked Eddie that question. And I mean, this is a long, you know, seven or eight years ago. And I'll never forget it. He said, Todd, I don't think it's failed. He said, I think it's left untried. I said, what do you mean? We've been at this for years, 20 years. he said yeah but I know you didn't mean it but something happened where it became all about meetings and Christian meetings and what happened like in what we did today in altars and you know people being filled and all that and it never really got out into the streets in our actual lives in the way that I was talking about last night so that's something we need to guard against and what I want to show you now is we move from the gospels where Jesus did it where there was this constant show and tell happening and the disciples were on a very steep learning curve as Jesus would do something modeling it for them send them to do it they'd come back and talk about it Lord the demon submitted to us in our name in your name yeah but you know just be glad your names are written in the book of life you know and there was this learning curve or Lord how come we can't cast these demons out? Or Lord, why was this man born blind? And so they were going through this steep learning curve of learning what it meant to minister in the spirit and in the power and reality of the kingdom. Well, now Jesus is gone. And when we get to the book of Acts, he's gone. He's left them with the teaching about the kingdom of God and how he will send the Holy Spirit to lead them into a continuation of his ministry in the kingdom of God for the sake of the earth. we see that it actually happens here. So look at Acts 1.8. First of all, he says, you know, hang in here with me because you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you. And again, this is why we can't make a ministry of the Holy Spirit into just sort of niceties or something that's merely inward. I don't know how to impress on you any stronger. I'm a little tired and you're a little tired. But central to this is power. And central to this is the authority or the right to use that power as God's deputies or his ambassadors under his leadership, which happens through the Holy Spirit. That's why when I give you that little mantra, it's very carefully thought out on my part. Cooperative friends of Jesus through the power of the Holy Spirit and through his leadership in our life. So he says here, you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be flung out, literally flung out by the diaspora and by the removing of these early Jewish Christians from Jerusalem. They're being literally thrown out all over the world. You're gonna be my witnesses. You're gonna testify to this. I would jot down there where it says that you'll be my witness. I would jot down those three key words I gave you this morning. Embody, announce, and demonstrate. That the way we witness to the kingdom and to the role of the spirit on the earth is we embody its reality in the kind of goodness that Dallas is teaching us about. And it becomes natural and easy to us. Nothing to do with works or meriting something. It becomes natural and easy to us. I'm going to be my witnesses through embodying, announcing, that is to say telling about the good news, and demonstrating it, which of course is deeds. Now in chapter 2, verse 1, you know, Pentecost comes. They're together. Suddenly there's a sound like the blowing of a violent wind from heaven. It fills the whole house where they're sitting. There's tongues of fire. All this happens. The Holy Spirit fills all of them and they begin to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. Chapter 3, verse 6. This has all happened. Peter now is at some point later going into the temple. And he walks by this man who he may have passed many, many times. Who is crippled. And so he, verse 5 says, So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said, silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. Now what do you suppose, just take a guess here, just try to take an intelligent guess. What do you suppose Peter has in mind when he says, what I have? What does he have at this point? What two really big things have been promised to be given to Peter and that he has? Power and authority. We just saw him receive power. And when he was given keys, I think Dallas mentioned this. What do keys do? They open something. They give us access because keys are authority. In any building, whether it's a church building like this or a business building downtown, not everybody has keys to it. only those who are authorized to come and go at their pleasure are allowed to have keys and so Peter now is having one of those good moments where he sort of gets it and he can't help the guy with silver and gold but he gets that he's he's just been imbued with this power that was promised him he's been he realizes that it's the sort of final sign or orientation to the fact that yes, he's also been authorized and given authority to work in Jesus's name. And of course, the man is healed. Chapter four, verse eight. This is another time where Peter again, as he's standing before the Sanhedrin, and it says here, then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said. Now, what did Jesus tell the disciples in John not to worry about? I'll send you the Holy Spirit and he'll do what? He'll show you what to say. He'll show you what to do. And so here this is just a perfect example of what it means to be filled with the Spirit. He then was able to speak on behalf of God and to explain what happened as that cripple was healed. Chapter five, verse three. Then Peter said, you know, this is the story of Ananias and Sapphira. And Peter says, Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit? Now, just, you know, a big part of Bible study is just letting your imagination work when the Bible tells a story like that. So what do you pick up with that? When he says, well, why did you lie to the Holy Spirit? Just let your imagination work with that in a minute. What is going on here? First of all, how do you lie to an it? You don't lie to an it. You know, you guys would never say to me, Todd, what has so filled your heart that you lied to the podium? So the first thing we learn is that the Holy Spirit is a person. And then, well then, what else does it say to you? That he was very present to them. Because you could say to me, Todd, you just lied to your son. Why'd you lie to him? Or, well, Todd, you just lied to your colleague. Why'd you lie to her? Are you with me here? You would say that. And what we mean by that, that's somebody I'm presently, you know, sort of routinely relating to. It's somebody who is in my sphere of conversation and kind of my ongoing life. And that is a very, very important insight from this passage. that the Holy Spirit is a person who is residing with them in this non-bodily way as Dallas has taught us. But it didn't make him less real. Are you with me here? See, we tend to think of matter, you know, wood, as what's really real. But here's what you need to think about. personhood is not dependent on matter matter is dependent on personhood there's a person god who he doesn't have a body have you ever thought about this like god doesn't have a brain and seems to do quite well without it you know not a brain like you know we think of you know the gray matter in our noggin. Are you with me here? So personhood spoke matter into existence. God spoke the material world into existence. So the material world is dependent on personhood. Personhood is not dependent on the material world. So the Holy Spirit being non-bodily was nevertheless very real to them. And, you know, several of you have asked me today because, again, I know that we come from backgrounds that are typically one of three backgrounds. We come from kind of Pentecostal backgrounds that either might have been fulfilling to us or very weird. We come from evangelical backgrounds who really hasn't known what to do about this. And in large measure has kind of rejected it. either they were cessationists or just kind of didn't do much with it and gave lip service to it. And others of us come out of more traditional or mainline settings where we're just sort of ignorant about it. We were never a part of the sort of evangelical, you know, Pentecostal fight. We were sort of living our own life over here and it never had much to do with us. Well, if you come from any of those backgrounds, it's very, very difficult to make this non-bodily person real in your life. And what I want to say to you, you kind of ask me, well, what's sort of the irreducible minimum or what's the thing that we really ought to be shooting for here? And I would just say, move from lip service to reality. Because, you know, if we had a little theological pop quiz here and I said, blank is the head of the church, you'd say, Jesus and if I said the Holy Spirit or rats the blank I was always the smartest one in the class just kidding I was never the smartest one in the class so if I said well blank is his present day you know continuator on the earth you'd all go the Holy Spirit especially since I already told you but but it's very crucial that we move from lips service to like theological correctness to actually having the guts to really interact with him see that's what i want you to see here he was very real to them so when peter saw them lying to the community of faith and in the context of the community of faith intentionally deceiving them Peter isn't firstly hurt for himself. He's hurt for you lied to the Holy Spirit. Like, how could you do that? Now, you see, you can't think like that if the Holy Spirit is not really real to you. And real to you in a personal way, not real like a pulpit is real. But he was real in a very personal, although non-bodily way. all right um verse 12 same chapter the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people as the people used to meet together solomon's porch and you just see that they went on doing what jesus was doing through the holy spirit verse 15 as a result of this the same thing that happened to jesus happens to them people brought the sick into the street and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as they passed by. And crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by evil spirits, and all of them were healed. Chapter 8, verse 12. Here, this is a story where the church is being persecuted and now beginning to be scattered around. And the apostles in Jerusalem hear that something's going on in Samaria. This is verse 14. They hear that they had accepted the word of God and so they sent Peter and John to them. And when they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them they had simply been baptized into the name of Jesus and then Peter and John placed their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit now that's what we're going to ask more of tonight in a few minutes where we're actually going to take time to lay our hands on each other that people would some people would be healed that some people would be set free from something because this was really important to these guys. Can you see this? Like they hear that, oh, some people are beginning to believe in Jesus. Well, we gotta make them know that Jesus' presence is still here with us, empowering us and enlivening and energizing us, animating us, showing us what to do and where to go and what to say. We gotta make sure that they get connected to this thing called the Holy Spirit. Because for these guys, it wasn't secondary or optional. You see what I'm saying? it wasn't like power steering on a car that you might want or not, or power windows. To them, it was all the same deal and that without it, this thing didn't work. And that's why I want to say to you, I actually don't know what each of you should do in each of your individual churches. There would be no way for me to know. But the irreducible minimum is you have to take it serious. You have to find a way to take serious the person and work of the Holy Spirit. And we're totally happy for you to do it within the bounds of your tradition. We're totally happy for you to do it within the bounds of your theological structures. I guess unless you come from some really hardcore cessationist background. Virtually any other theological structure has plenty of room for this. This is not a theological problem primarily. This is a practice problem. People don't know how to really deal with it. And mostly, frankly, as we've already said, it's a fear of being weird. And I've tried to say you don't have to be. Then chapter 9, verse 31. The church throughout Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. Meaning the persecution and the sort of flinging out that was happening. There was a lull in it. There was a time of peace. it was strengthened listen to this and encouraged by the holy spirit growing in numbers and living in the fear of the lord and then acts 10 we don't have time to read this but you all know the story of acts 10 of you know peter having this vision uh you know the sheep coming down from heaven and him being told to rise kill and eat and him being a good jew looks at these unclean animals and goes, no way, I'm not doing that. And you know, the thing goes on and then the people come from Cornelius's house and Peter finally feels, you know, like he can go there. And so he violates his whole tradition by going into this Gentile's house. And what I want to help you see here tonight is that this story is as much a story about the conversion of Peter as it is the story of the conversion of Cornelius. Peter struggled the same way we do. Even with all he's been through, when he has that vision, he thinks this can't be right because our whole story is that we don't socialize with these kind of people. We are the Jews. So he has no concept of being able to do this and be a faithful Jew. And so he himself, through the Holy Spirit and this activity of the Holy Spirit in visions, has his own conversion. His own conversion allows him to go to Cornelius' house. Cornelius is converted. Peter comes back and reports on it to the religious leaders of his day. And even then he's a little uncomfortable about it and says, look guys, you can't blame me. I was just telling them the story. And right in the middle of it, the Holy Spirit interrupted me and came on them with power. You can't blame me. But you see, he had to himself first be converted. And that conversion was a ministry of the Spirit through these visions. He then obeys and goes. Cornelius is converted. The Spirit comes on his house in power. And Peter then has to explain it. So this is what I mean by let yourself off the hook. that there is going to be a learning curve and don't beat yourself up for getting it wrong occasionally for not saying enough one time and maybe saying a little too much another time or chickening out a little bit in your prayer one time and maybe being a little too bold in another. Relax about it. And give each other grace both as givers and receivers in this. Actually create a community of love in which you are all together taking the risks that are inherent in the process of becoming fully actuated followers of Jesus, who really are working in a conversational relationship with God through the person and work of the Holy Spirit. Acts 11, 15, this is where Peter's explaining his actions. And he says, as I said, look, I began to speak and the Holy Spirit came on them as he'd come on us in the beginning. But then I remembered what the Lord had to say, that John baptizes water, but that you'll be baptized with the Holy Spirit. So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think I could oppose God? And then so for Peter, you see, he still was sort of not getting it in the sense that, you know, sometimes people say, you know, the disciples are like the disciples. You know, you laugh, but you wait till you get in this and you'll see how often you feel like the disciples. Because these things aren't just obvious to us. They really are something we have to practice our way into. But, you know, practice your way into them with good heartedness. You know, even when I was a little boy playing baseball, it didn't even matter if it was my friend who was on the other team and I could see him doing something wrong or where he might improve, I'd go help him even though he was on the other team. Because, you know, we were friends and we were all just sort of, our little minds and hearts were inflamed by being able to do this thing right. And that kind of childlike innocence of helping one another and helping people see when, you know, there's something that they could do a little different or a little better. And being patient with each other is enormously important in this. Because once you get sort of uppity with each other or impatient with each other, it will shut the Holy Spirit down. In fact, let me say this. This is definitely worth jotting down. This is just old Coach Hunter who's been around the block a million times. Let me just tell you this. The Holy Spirit is grieved in at least two ways. one is excess but the other is being ignored and you can get off the wagon either way and I think the way you miss both of those ways of falling off the tracks is that you create communities of love and peace in which he's not being ignored but you're sort of coaching each other into a reality that is I don't know any better way of saying that is naturally supernatural you retain your personhood you retain your tone of voice unless it's an angry bitter one in which case get Dallas's tapes and then you know your tone of voice will change and you're just you see what I'm saying you're just you so if you tend to be humorous, you're probably going to be humorous with the Holy Spirit. If you tend to be an intellectual and a thinker, you may be the one in your body who helps people think about these things and the objections to them or something. So you're not going to lose your essential you. It's that you begin to work with each other with who you really are. All right, a couple more, and then we'll stop and take a break and come back and have ministry time together. let's see acts 13 there's a group of people gathered together in Antioch sort of a new church so to speak verse 2 it says while they are worshiping the Lord and fasting the Holy Spirit said now how do you suppose that happened you know he sort of spoke from the sky in Peter's case you know with this vision um Peter pictures Ananias lying to him here the Holy Spirit speaking and frankly we don't know how he did it you know one inference that you could draw from the passage is that there were prophets there see in verse one there were prophets and teachers there so it's possible that he spoke through one of the prophets but we don't actually know but the point is they knew because it doesn't say here the prophets spoke or the teachers did a great job teaching on a passage and Barnabas and Saul knew they should go. No, however it happened, they knew they were being led by the spirit. And that again is sort of the irreducible minimum. And then verse four, two of them, the two of them sent on their way by the Holy Spirit. Again, it is very important to Luke here that they knew and that we know that this was an activity of the Spirit. Verse nine, then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, begins to speak. As we read that Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, began to speak and act. This, all I want to say is this becomes routine. This is the norm. That the disciples, the earliest followers of Jesus, kept on doing what he was doing. Teaching about the kingdom of God. Announcing it. Demonstrating it. Embodying it. And they did it while on a learning curve. They went on this sort of what the people at the Church of the Savior in Washington, D.C. call the journey inward and the journey outward. And what you see, for instance, in that passage in Acts 5 about Ananias and Sapphira lying to the Holy Spirit, that's journey inward stuff. Like Peter's like chagrined, like what is going on inside of you that you would feel the need to or to think that you could lie to the Holy Spirit? That's inner journey stuff. And then the outward journey is the last part of that vision that I've been giving you. Creative, I mean cooperative friends of Jesus, living lives of constant creative goodness through the power of the Holy Spirit for the sake of the world. That's the journey outward. And that's the part that Eddie Gibbs was trying to say, that for us to really embody this vision, that it needs to, some way or another, find its way out on the streets and out of the walls of churches. And there's a journey there. I've spoken so much, I can't remember if I, I think it was the other night when we were here, I said this, that I sometimes find myself, even after being at this for all these years, when I'm faced with really deep human pain and suffering that I don't know what to do with it. Did I say that here? I mean, it's still for me. I'm on a journey still. I don't know what happens. It feels like a switch goes off in me or something where I just sort of, like an electric plane, sort of freak out or something. Like, I just don't know what to do. I get paralyzed. And so I'm still working on, you know, what's going on in me when that happens. Why can't I somehow connect to the sufficiency of God in those settings? I don't know. I'm still working on it. I'm on a journey like you are. So I mentioned there the church of the Savior. So I want to say to you, but this has to be a little bit nuanced. For any of you who are leaders or who are people of influence in your church, who as you listen to this, you're thinking about how you can influence, where you have influence in this way, I really want to commend to you the writings of Elizabeth O'Connor. She's long dead, but she was one of, if not the key lay leader at the Church of the Savior in D.C. Not very many people know of them. The pastor there, he's still alive, but in his 80s, called Gordon Cosby. Not well known. He was well known after World War II in the 50s and the 60s. You know, some of you who come from more conservative backgrounds would maybe be a little uncomfortable with bits of his theology. But he's a total mainstream Orthodox Christian to my knowledge. But they are, just trust me, I've been reading and studying about this stuff for years. They are the best example that anybody knows of, of people who really tried to do this. To go on the inner journey of character and spiritual transformation into Christlikeness. and to do it in order to go on an outward journey through the power of the Holy Spirit for the sake of the world. And this little church that never got over 200 people to my knowledge, maybe 300, right now they don't even exist in the way they did. They've broken up into like five or six different churches. For them, it was never about being a big church. It was about being big Christians. When they thought of growth, they thought of growing really big followers, not growing big numbers. So that's not an issue here, but that's part of the reason you've never heard of them. But today even, if you go to the section of D.C. that they're in, and it just went out of my head. Does anybody know? They're just in a little section of D.C. It's a predominantly black and very poor area. Lots of street people, lots of elderly street people. And over the last 50 years since the end of World War II, That little church has adopted that area of Washington, D.C. and done the most incredible things that you can imagine. They've built free hospitals. They've built crack houses. They've just ministered to the last, the least, and the lost for 50 years as they embodied the message of the kingdom right there in that neighborhood. It's the most amazing story. Now, if you want to get her books, they're mostly out of print or only self-published, so you have to go to a website. Ready? pottershousebooks.org and I don't get anything for this. This is just my heart to yours. All one word, Potter's House, like the Bible story, pottershousebooks.org and any of her books, but you may want to start with Called and Committed. I think that's the title and Journey Inward, Journey Outward. But any of her books are worth reading. there amazing. All right, one or two more thoughts here, and then we'll take our break. When you think about this, there are a couple of concepts that you need to get. And the first one is what we used to call divine appointments, or sometimes power encounters, or sometimes they were the same thing. But by divine appointments, all we meant was this, that we've tried to go through our life being alert to the Spirit. Okay, you got that? That's all it really meant. And so it was just a sort of a playful way of saying, you know, we all have day planners or palm pilots or, you know, we keep our calendar on our outlook or whatever. So, you know, we all have these instruments through which we keep our calendar. And talking about divine appointments was just a way for us to remind ourselves that we expected to meet God somewhere there in our day and that we would have this divine appointment that could pop up at any minute. So that's the first thing. The second thing is, I think for many of us, we need to rethink our notions of the gift of the Spirit. And tomorrow morning, I'll talk a little bit more about this. But the main thing I want you to get tonight is this. We've tended to make Paul's metaphor of the body, you know, in Corinthians and in Romans. We've tended to do this with it. You have the gift of healing. You're like a hand. You have the gift of mercy. You're like a foot. You have the gift of giving. You're like an elbow. And we've just sort of said that, you know, like so that each member of the body has a gift, right? And a gift is like an elbow. And an elbow would never think to want to be a hand, right? And so that's what's known as a constituted view of the gifts. It means that they reside in you and in a way that you sort of own them. Now, I don't have time to do a long Bible study on this tonight, but I want to suggest to you that there's a better way of thinking about it. And the better way of thinking about it is think of the gifts as being situational. That any of you could be used in any of the gifts at any time. Now, I do not doubt that some of us have sort of routine gifts. Like I've been doing what I've been doing this weekend. I've been doing this, as I said, since I was 19 years old. I can't remember the last time I walked up on a podium and wondered, gee, I wonder if the gift of teaching will come tonight. Are you with me here? I mean, it's just so routine in my life that I don't even, actually, I don't even think about doing it. It's just completely natural. So I recognize that though I don't own the gift of teaching, it is sort of routinely used through me. But when I go to a hospital to pray for a sick person, I don't walk into that hospital room the same way, knowing that the gift of healing will come. Are you with me? I never know whether it will come or not. I absolutely never know. Or if I had to prophesy on the spot, you know, I don't know. So think of it this way. that you probably have patterns of the way that God uses you. And we could talk about maybe them as sort of gift clusters. And so like for me, I would know that, you know, pretty routinely in leadership, in teaching, to a lesser degree in evangelism, those would sort of be my dominant three ways that God uses me in terms of the historical patterns over my life. And maybe the most dominant one, people would maybe say his leadership. Well, actually, I don't know, but I'm okay with that analysis. But I have been used in virtually all those other gifts. I just never know when they're gonna come. So a divine appointment is something like this. You're going through your day. An opportunity for ministry presents itself to you. And at that point, you're like a plumber or an electrician who's been called out to a job. and so you get in the kitchen and you get under the sink and you start tinkering around and you see what's wrong and you reach into your toolbox which is empty knowing that the gift that you need in that moment will be there as you reach your hand into that empty toolbox and there God will put the tool that you need to do that job now I think that you can see that is a crucial paradigm shift because otherwise certain divine appointments will come up in your life and you'll excuse yourself because you don't have that gift see what I'm saying and it's honestly it's not like that you you just you're just God's person on the spot there and you just have to trust that you know that that's going to happen you just have to take your best shot at it now does it always happen of course not or does it always happen perfectly no but you will be surprised at how many more gifts you find yourself being used in if you take that attitude that divine appointments are going to pop up in your life and that you see um here's the big paradigm shift if you think of yourself as mere elbow that's one thing but if you think of yourself as a person of the spirit now you have the potential to be elbow hand foot whatever is necessary now for those of you for whom this is really paradigm shattering you again if we had the time but you can do it yourself just carefully read through first corinthians 12 13 and 14 and you'll find that paul says things like he asked those rhetorical questions well does everybody have the gift of healing what's the answer no well does everybody have the gift of teaching what's the answer to that rhetorical question no but he gets to the end of chapter 14 and he says but eagerly desire what well to prophesy or what eagerly desire the better or greater or best gifts now why would he be telling you to eagerly pursue being a hand if you're only an elbow see i i think we've limited him in what he meant as i've said i think paul was first of all in the corinthian passage he is definitely picturing in his mind a congregation of people and as i've said the interpretive key in 12 13 and 14 is the seven or eight times he says when you gather together so he's picturing people like us who have gift mixes or patterns in their lives but any of them at any time could be used in any of the gifts maybe what he's saying is something like like Todd you know you've seen the way the Lord is using you mostly leadership and teaching and evangelism you know don't go trying to switch that into prophecy discernment and word of wisdom but it doesn't mean that you'll never be used in those things that when you're in the moment where you need to do something, you will reach back and in confidence know that the Spirit will give you what you need. You know, the truth of it is, in a weekend like this where I come someplace and I virtually don't know any of you sitting here, you don't know this, but the whole time I'm talking to you, I have one ear on the Holy Spirit. And I'm tailoring every example. I'm trying to be with, be present with you um you know learn you know you let the spirit reveal things to me so there's probably eight or ten times in the last 48 hours that that even though i wouldn't consider it one of my dominant gifts i've probably said things that really are words of wisdom or words of knowledge but i wouldn't know i can't tell i mean sometimes i can but often i can't tell but I do have the habit in my life of trying to be, remember the triangle, I try to be present to you and I try to be present to the spirit. And in that triangle, I just wanna say to you, anything can happen and you should be okay with that. Understanding that you probably do have a dominant sort of gift pattern, but it's okay. All right, let's take a break and then we come back. I'm going to give you some juicy gossip from the 80s. I'm talking seriously juicy gossip. And we'll have a little time to pray for each other. So you can just take a stretch break if you want. If you need to go to the restroom, that's fine. We'll come back in a few minutes. I come from a long line of levers Out of the garden gate with an apple in their hands I expect a non-believer you can run out of love you can give me the shot that's the thing that lovers do and then there's you you found me cynical and jaded you lifted my mask and lightened me up And when my black eyes have faded I found they were in my mouth You have the cold in my mouth I've never seen the old age new And then there's you You're the only one My secret You're the only one I'm the only one Never leave and I'll wake up to this mystery I betrayed you with a little kiss I thought you'd find someone better You forgave me even for this Came to the upper room Drove me from the tomb There is none but good and true And there's you You're the only one Who's my secrets You're the only one You're the only one Who never leaves Now wake up to this mystery You're the only one You're the only one That's true You're the only one Who never leaves Never wake up to this mystery That's true You're the only one Who never leaves ¶¶ Thank you. Thank you. Because I don't know what I want But at least I know that much I'm afraid love came right off And it slapped me in the face But I did not know No Cause love is different than you think It's never been a song On a TV screen And love is harder than a word Said at the right time And everything's alright So love is different than you think So I won't expect a postcard from Trafalgar Square But I'd be lying if I said I didn't care Because you can't just turn it off And put a blindfold on your heart Yeah, but I walk to a good start And I can't turn that away But I do not know Oh no Cause love is different than you think It's never been a song It's on a TV screen And that love is harder than a word I said I thought I died And everything's alright I said love is different than you think Maybe you're the dream I'm waking from I see you everywhere I go Darling, you are such a mystery to me, you know Don't you know that love Is different than you think It's never in a song It's on a TV screen And love is harder than the word Said at the right time Everything's alright I said love is different than you think I said love is different than you think The Word of the Lord came one evening Concerning His bride's great son He sent down His Word to renew her To prepare for the bridegroom again The word said Repent Seeking vain glory By the gifts In the Lord's name you give Repent Of all the first stones Cast to kill While your own self-righteousness Lives Prepare The way For the Lord Repet the way for the kingdom Repet the way Repet the way For the Lord The Word said Repent Turn from your strivings Repent Turn from your hatred Repent From the doctrines of men that divide And tear like the wedding gown ring Walk in his love Like newborn children Walk in his love Let the wedding gown end Walk in his love Humility come with pure hearts And cast all your cares to the wind Prepare the way for the Lord Prepare the way for the kingdom Prepare the way Prepare the way for the Lord The word of the Lord came one evening Concerning His bride's great sin He assured me we will be forgiven And then let the marriage begin Prepare the way for the Lord Prepare the way for the King Prepare the way Prepare the way for the Lord Prevade the way for the Lord Prevade the way for the Kingdom Prevade the way Prevade the way for the Lord Prevade, pay the way I'm ready. Sometimes I fear Maybe I'm not chosen You've hardened my heart like Pharaoh And that would explain why life is so hard for me And I said that Esau hated Crying against what's faded Saying, Father, please, is there any left for me? Cast down my doubts Please prove me wrong These demons be so headstrong Make my walls fall Please prove me wrong This is the streets that we've been building And when I was your fire so strong Can the boat I avail Please prove me wrong I fear maybe this is all just a game Our friends and our families all play too Harness the young and give some comfort to the old Cast down my doubts Please prove me wrong Cause these demons can be so headstrong Make my walk walk Don't do me wrong It's like resentment's been building And you know it's your fire so strong If I can't, I fail Please prove me wrong Prove me wrong Don't let my doubts prove true And draw me close and hold me near to you Hear me still until the day you Cast out my doubts and build me wrong These demons can be so headstrong
