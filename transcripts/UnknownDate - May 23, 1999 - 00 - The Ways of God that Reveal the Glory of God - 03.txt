If you have been with us these last few weeks, then you are aware that we have been dealing with an episode in the life of God's people, born of Exodus 33, where Moses and the people of God were presented with what would seem to be an unthinkable possibility. It was this, that they could procure for themselves what looked to be the promise and provision of God without the active presence of God being involved at all. But it was indeed the case, revealed in verses 1 through 3, when it says this, you can go up to the land of promise now flowing with milk and honey, but I will not go with you. To that possibility, Moses and the people of God, to their credit, said no, and brought to God three requests. Number one was this, if the active presence of God is not going to go with us, then please, Lord, do not bring us up into the land. Because more than the land and more than the milk and honey, which we do want, we want you. Second request, verse 13, let us know your ways that we may know you. Third request, we pray thee, show us your glory. Verse 18. Now, those three requests crystallized for us a question, a question that has been driving our study for the last couple of weeks. The question is this. What are the ways of God that reveal the glory of God to the people of God? We've examined four so far, the fifth today. The first was this, that one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the way of desire for God. For God reveals his glory to people who singularly want it, who passionately pursue it, who have the gall to, like Moses, ask for it. The second way of God that reveals the glory of God was the way of humility before God. The third was the way of reverence for the holiness of God. The fourth last week was the way of dependence on the power of God. And today the fifth way of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is the sovereign choice or the sovereign grace of God to reveal His glory when He wills, to whom He wills, And catch this, not necessarily because you've been particularly humble, reverent, or dependent. Middle of verse 9 says, For I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show compassion on whom I will show compassion. Look at it, beginning in verse 8, Moses makes the request, I pray thee, show me your glory. God says, okay, I will. I will make myself now to make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim the name of the Lord before you. Now this isn't in the text, but I can almost hear Moses saying, I know I asked for it, but God, why would you do this? For we are an obstinate people. And that hasn't changed. God's response to that would be, listen, Moses, I will be gracious to who I will be gracious. I'm going to show him, don't tell me who I can be gracious to. I could be gracious even to, I don't know, you. Moses. And I was when I came to you in a burning bush. What right thing did you do when I called you? I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious. Now, just a little note here. This does not mean in any way, or it does not diminish the need for in any way, humility, dependence, or reverence. It simply highlights this fact, that we God's people cannot control the manifested presence or glory of God, by finally jumping through all the right hoops, by finally being humble, dependent, and reverent enough. For the fact is this, every time the glory of God is revealed and the presence of God is manifested, it is revealed and manifested to people who do not deserve it, who have not earned it, regardless of how humble, reverent, or dependent they may be. here's the way of God every time God reveals his glory every time he makes his goodness to pass before his people so that we can see it every time it is an act of sovereign holy amazing grace now that truth ministers at least two things in very practical ways number one it ministers humility to the best of saints number two it ministers hope to the worst of sinners. It ministers humility to the best of saints like Moses who knew in his bones that it was not by works of righteousness which he had done, but according to God's mercy that he was saved out of the desert in Midian to a high and holy purpose. It was God's sovereign grace that caused him to speak to him from a burning bush and bring his life from obscurity to purpose. Moses had to receive this sovereign work of God. Moses had to believe this grace. He had to walk in it, but for the glory of God's truth, to be revealed so Moses could see it or hear it. It was all grace. And I'm telling you, when you realize that it's all sovereign grace, it ministers to you humility, because you know it wasn't you. The same truth, however, ministers hope to the worst of sinners, because I'll be gracious to who will be gracious. I'll be gracious even to you. And if you're sitting here in this room believing that your sin is so far beyond reconciliation with God, you need to hear the word of God that says, I will be gracious. Don't tell me who I can forgive. I can forgive you. I can be gracious to you if you will let me. Like the thief on the cross who had no hope and no time to change his behavior, but to whom Christ revealed the truth of his glory even on the cross just before he died, he believed and Christ opened to him paradise. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious. A couple of things about this glory revealed. This experience of Moses in verse 19 I want us to touch on real quickly. First of all you just need to know as you kind of try to correlate this with your own experience that what Moses is experiencing here in verse 19 is not an everyday thing. Not even for Moses. While he experienced the presence of God on a regular basis, like you and I can as well, this glory revealed thing was unusual, out of the ordinary. Like you and me, Moses had to walk by faith. Like you and me, there were times in his life that he wondered what to do and wandered in a fog. But also like you and me, every once in a while, Moses got a gift of sovereign grace where the veil is removed and the glory of God is revealed and everything that is true but sometimes hard to see is revealed as being true. And we just get to see it. It can happen in the strangest places, at the oddest times, and if you reflect on your journey of faith, you would probably concur with that, that God has revealed things to you, sometimes in church but not always. Sometimes it's in your car for the strangest reasons you don't even know why on a walk in the woods. Often it is, in fact, in worship, but sometimes it's when you're by yourself for reasons you can't control or understand. What's unseen becomes seen. What's hard to understand becomes clear. And what you are experiencing at a moment like that is the glory of God revealed, the truth of God made evident. Second thing I want you to know about this experience, is that one of the primary purposes of these periodic grace gifts is to encourage men and women who, like Moses and like you, daily desire his presence, deeply reverence his name, desperately depend on his power, and humbly seek and submit to his ways, but who sometimes, again like Moses, walk in dark and lonely places, wondering even at times, God, are you there? God, do you care? Please, we pray thee, show us your glory. Help us see what's hard to see today. Now, my all-time favorite example of God doing this very thing for this very purpose of encouragement is found in Matthew 16. I want you to turn with me to that. If you have your Bibles with you, real quickly. We'll probably spend the rest of our, not probably, we will spend the rest of our time in this section. Allow this to do what it's designed to do. What this passage is designed to do is pull back the veil. It's designed to reveal His glory and encourage your believing heart to believe. This passage also is going to provide for us two more ways of God that reveal the glory of God, and we'll expose those as we go along. Let me just give you the context before we dive into verse 27 of Matthew 16. Jesus is preparing his disciples for his coming suffering and death. Verse 21, he says this, You guys, I'm going to go to Jerusalem, suffer many things, be killed by the hands of sinful men, and rise again the third day. What they heard most was the suffering and death, not the rising from the dead. They were understandably afraid and confused. Peter, in fact, in a flurry of misdirected love, tried to correct Jesus. In fact, the text says he rebuked Jesus. Matthew 16, 22. God forbid it, Lord, that you should go to the cross and die for the sins of the world and rise. God forbid that the redemptive plan happened. Peter didn't know that he was saying, God forbid, that the redemptive plan happens. He was trying to protect this one he loved, misguided love. Peter was confused. Peter was afraid. In an attempt to encourage, strengthen, and give perspective to Peter and his other beloved disciples, his faithful but frail followers, Jesus gives to them a couple of things that I would like to give to you in this text. The first thing is that he gives them a promise of coming glory. but more than a promise, the second thing, he gives them a glimpse of glory, much like he did to Moses in Exodus 33 where he caused his goodness to pass before him. He let Moses see it. These guys too. Let's look first of all at the promise Jesus makes designed to encourage these disciples and us as well. It comes in Matthew 16 verse 27. Here's the encouragement, you guys. the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels. Let me just do some teaching here. What do we have here is the first direct reference by Jesus to His second coming in the gospel record. And the point of this word is to ensure the disciples and thereby encourage them, you guys, my second coming is going to be different than the first. My first coming, The incarnation. I came as, here's the phrase, the son of man. I came, in other words, in the form of man. That little phrase, son of man, wherever you see it in the scripture, is a reference to Jesus in his humanity. There's other places, the son of God. Here it's the son of man. It's a reference to Jesus in his humanity. In that form, the deity, majesty, and glory of God was all there, but it was veiled by the man, by the humanness of Jesus. At Christmas time, we sing a song. It goes like this. I'm not going to sing it. Don't be afraid. Veiled in flesh, the Godhead, He. Veiled incarnate deity. The glory and power of God was there. You just couldn't see it all the time. A miracle here would demonstrate the glory of God. A deliverance there. ministry to multitudes, but even in the middle of glorious revelations of God's glory through Jesus, the truth was day to day, there was no stately form or majesty that we should look upon him, says Isaiah 53, nor appearance that we should be attracted to him. Remember when I was a kid, when I saw that verse, there was no appearance that we should be attracted to him, and maybe think, well, maybe Jesus was physically ugly. It doesn't mean he was physically ugly. What it means is this, that there was nothing physical about him that revealed him as God. It wouldn't be like in a crowd of people, I would be looking across and I'd see this glow on one of you. God! None of that. His glory was there, but it was veiled in his humanity. You couldn't see it every day. By the way, just for us to intersect with this, we need to understand something we do understand. Don't always put it together this way, but this, we live in a veiled time as well. You see, all the glory and all the power and all the majesty of God is real. It's there. But the fact is this, this side of eternity, this side of the second coming of Christ, we see the glory of God through a glass darkly, says Paul. And that is why Paul in 2 Corinthians 4.18 says, We need to look not at things which are seen, but at things unseen. For things seen are temporal, but things that are not seen are eternal. Here's the kingdom truth. We have to live with eternal things are real, but they're veiled. They're sometimes hard to see. And it's as if Jesus in Matthew 16 verse 27 is saying this, because I know it's hard to live that way. In this promise, verse 27, I want you to know that because it's hard to live this way, it's not always going to be that way. For my second coming is going to be different from the first. For you will see, verse 27, the Son of Man coming in the unveiled glory of the Father, and there will be nothing subtle about it. Matthew 24, verse 29 describes it. It says this. of that day. Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened. Think on that. It's going to be kind of scary. The moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Revelation 6.13 describes the powers of the heavens being shaken and the stars falling from the sky like unripe figs falling from a tree, shaken by the wind. Verse 14 of Revelation 6. And the sky will be rolled up like a scroll. I see it like a shade. God takes the shade of the horizon, pulls it down a notch, lets it go, and there it is, and it's all gone. And that's going to be frightening, I think. But here's the incredible deal. With no moon, no stars, no sun, it won't be dark. Do you know why? Matthew 24 verse 30 tells us why. For the sign of the Son of Man is going to appear in the sky, and the sign of the Son of Man is the unveiled glory of the Father. And this time, it's not going to be subtle. It's not going to be veiled. It's going to be bright. It's going to be light. Everyone will see it, and every knee will bow on that day, for He will shine like the noonday sun. He will literally replace the sun, the moon, the stars, as the whole earth will be filled with his what? Glory. Amen. But there is a problem with this promise of future glory. Know what it is? It's future glory. It encourages me. It lets me know in the end we win, but I got to go to work tomorrow. And I'm having a hard time seeing the glory today. The disciples lived with that same life reality, being occupied and overwhelmed with the reality of what is right now and all of this stuff about Jesus suffering and dying and going to Jerusalem, dark things they had to face. And so it is beyond the promise of coming glory, Jesus gives them a gift of sovereign grace, a glimpse of glory. That comes in chapter 17. Goes through verses 1 through 8. I just want to read verses 1 and 2 to get us started. Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, his brother, and brought them up to a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them. Now, the transfiguring here, I think, was probably very much like what God did to Moses when he caused his goodness to pass before him. And his face shone like the sun. And his garments became as white as light. We could easily get lost in all of the nuances and details of this marvelous scene where God reveals his glory, but let me just give you some of the key factors designed to bless your heart, to encourage your spirit. The key factor number one is this. Just let it in. Jesus shines. Verse 2, his face shone like the sun. His garments were white as light. The point is this. Whenever and wherever Jesus manifests his glory. It's bright. It's light. It shines. Whether it's out here or in here, there is about the glory of God a glow. Exodus 33, back to that. Moses, show me your glory. God did. Later on in the story, Moses comes down from the mountain to the people of God and the people notice something different about him. The glory of God was literally on him. It's bright. It's light. Exodus chapter 40, the tabernacle was built and the Shekinah glory of God came and filled that place. And the Shekinah glory of God was, among other things, bright and light. When the shepherds received the news of King Jesus being born, it says this, that the glory of the Lord shone round about them. Revelation 1.16, his face is shining like the sun. Here's the point. Just let it in. Jesus shines. I am the light of the world, not just figuratively, but literally one day. I will be literally the light of the world. Do you know that the light in heaven is going to be provided by God? He will be literally the light. From him will emanate light. One of my favorite songs is Ferris Lord Jesus. Third verse says this, Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight, and fair the twinkling starry host. But here's the deal, Jesus shines. brighter. Jesus shines purer than all the angels heaven can boast. And I bet if your spirit is intersecting with those words and they're getting in, there's something rising in you, even as I speak of worship. I love this Jesus. I love how he shines. And guess what? That just leads me to another way of God that reveals the glory of God. In fact, if your mind has been wandering, come back in and join me now. For one of the primary ways of God that reveals the glory of God is the blessed Son of God. You want to know the glory of God? Focus on the Son of God. You want to know the glory of God? Love the Son of God. Adore the Son. Study the Son. Honor the Son. Bless the Son. Serve the Son. And worship the Son of God. Why? I'll tell you why. Because He is the radiance of His glory, the exact representation of His nature, and He upholds all things by the word of His power. I'll tell you what. The primary way of God that reveals the glory of God is the Son of God. Back to the transformation. Amen. Amen. Moses and Elijah were with Jesus as Peter, James, and John were watching this amazing scene, this revelation of glory. And their presence affirms that one of the ways of God is the Son of God, that reveals the glory of God is the Son of God. Let me explain that with some interesting teaching, I think. Moses, and why he's there, was associated with, among other things, the law. In fact, references all through the New Testament speak of Moses and the prophets. You'd always hear those things together. Elijah who was also at this transfiguration event was regarded as one of the greatest of the Old Testament prophets Elijah took the law of Moses and preached it he applied it he rightly divided it he was known for his courage zeal, boldness and walk with God the point is this that together Elijah and Moses speak for and stand for the law and the prophets the entire Old Testament. So what we have in effect is this. The entire Old Testament law and prophets embodied in Elijah and Moses coming around Jesus saying this. You guys, he is the one. This Jesus is the one we have been pointing to. He is the one we have been speaking of. He is the one we have hoped in. He is the substance of the shadow. What they were saying is this. He is the primary way of God that reveals the glory of God. Verse 3 says they were talking amongst themselves. Elijah, Moses, and Jesus. Luke 9.31 tells us what they were saying. They were speaking, it says, of his departure, which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem. And what he was going to do in Jerusalem, as you know, was die and rise again. He was going to accomplish redemption. The significant word there, though, is departure. The Greek word is exousia. What does it sound like? Exit, exit, exit. It sounds like exodus. Well, that's what it means. They were discussing Jesus' exodus experience. Connect that up to Moses. I mean, Moses had an exodus of his own, redeeming the people, God's people, out of bondage to Egypt. And here is Moses, the leader of the first exodus, which was really simply a picture of the ultimate exodus discussing here with Jesus, the ultimate Exodus, redeeming mankind from the power of sin and death. You put this together, the picture is amazing. The law and the prophets, the entire Old Testament, Moses himself, who had had some prior experience to unveiled glory, is saying here, not just to Peter, James, and John, but because it's recorded in the text, he is saying it now to us. He's saying this, you need to know and understand that of all the ways of God that revealed the glory of God to the people of God. The primary way, the supreme way, the most excellent way is Jesus because he is the radiance of his glory, the exact representation of his nature. And then in verse five, God the Father chimes in as if to say, I agree, I love this, verse five. And while he was still speaking, he that would be Peter in verse four saying some really stupid things that we don't have time to get into. Behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice out of the cloud said this, this is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased, listen to him. My beloved son, just a little word on that, does not refer only to physical, it is not a reference to physical sonship as we would understand a child being born. It literally means this one emanates from me. Better said, this one is the full expression of me. This one is my very essence with whom I am well pleased. In other words, with whom I am fully satisfied. Listen to him. Why? Because his words are right and you can trust him. Because his deeds are right and you can follow him. Because his plan is right and you can trust his plan. Because his ways are right. When this one says, would say God the Father. When this one says, I am the water, he's right. When he says, I am the bread, he's right. When he says, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man comes to the Father but by me. The Father says he's right. Verse 6 says that when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and they were much afraid. You know, whenever the glory of God really does reveal, whenever the truth of God dawns on you, especially if it's a new way of thinking and it's a part of God's character or call that you've never considered before. It is a frightening thing. It's something that in different measures you've probably felt. But it's a wonderful, terrible combination of thrill and terror. I think we would call it awe. A frightening kind of thing. But most times that I'm frightened, I want to run. now I am in the presence of something that authentically stirs fear in me but I don't want to run in fact I would like to stay in this thing forever if I could sometimes you experience it in worship sometimes you experience this dreadful wonder in times when God reveals not only his glory but he reveals in the revelation of his glory he reveals your sin and you enter into a repentance that is deep and quite frankly, frightening. Sometimes we experience it in worship. Where for reasons we don't understand and can't control, and if we could control it, we would. We'd reproduce it, but we can't. For reasons we don't understand, can't control, the glory falls, the veil is removed, and we can see. and by the way this brings me to the next way of God that reveals the glory of God that's in this text you see one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God to the people of God is our worship of God they fell on their faces our worship reveals the glory of God and you know what that is why we do it that is why we value it here. That is why we give time for it. That is why we spend time in planning for it. That is why we pray over it. That is why we protect it. That is why we ache for it. That is why we care who leads it. That is why we wonder sometimes what's wrong with it. Why? Because one of the ways of God that reveals the glory of God is the way of worship for God. Verse 6 again, they fell on their faces and they were much afraid. Fear? Think about it further. Not so unusual and certainly not harmful, this kind of fear. Isaiah felt it in the year that King Uzziah died. It says, I saw God. And when I saw God, Isaiah said, I was undone. Woe is me, for I'm a man of unclean lips. He was afraid. but you know what? It was the kind of fear that he wouldn't trade for anything. I have fearful experiences that I wish I could blot out of my mind, don't you? This is the kind of fear that you think about and wish you could go back to, but it really was fear. It was an awesome thing that was happening to you when God revealed his glory, when God revealed his truth. Shepherds in the field, as the glory came round about them, were sore afraid. The fear was real. but I think if you interviewed them a few months later or a few years later it was a fear that they would never trade for anything Paul on the road to Damascus was knocked off his horse and blinded by the glory of the Lord as I said before sometimes the glory of God reveals himself and sometimes in the revelation of himself it reveals our sin that was Paul's experience on the road to Damascus he had no picture in his mind he had no perception of himself moving against God I'm going to see how bad I can get. In fact, he believed of himself that he was serving God, and when the light of God's glory came on in, he saw the truth that far from serving God, he was working against God. That was a horrible experience, and you know what? Some of you, wouldn't put this together, but that was exactly what some of your conversions were like. You're kind of going along being a good guy, thinking you're doing God's thing, thing and be a good person and all of a sudden the glory of God comes on you and the glory of God was simply God's truth that you are going entirely the wrong direction you know what that was a horrible revelation you were frightened when you heard that but it wasn't a frightening thing it's the best day of your life because because the other thing that came on was the reality of amazing grace and this God who just revealed his glory and my wrong direction is calling me to himself but there's a terror about this when the glory really falls Daniel 8.16 says Daniel collapsed in the presence of God's glory and God spoke to him there by the way I am in a medal that's probably the best passage I ever heard that is a proof text for the whole concept of being slain in the spirit you mean you believe in the slain in the spirit I thought you were normal God. Just a little word about that. Don't have the opportunity to address this very often. Yeah, I think that's real. I also think that much of what we see around that is fake and generated by the flesh. And because the real thing is real, it ought to offend us even more than others. Because the manipulation of that is a violation of the sovereignty of God. I just need to tell you though if the full blown glory of God falls on you if the full blown glory of God touches me if the glory of God touches you I just promise you you're going down you're going down and some of you have here's the good news you don't have to be afraid we call them God encounters as this picture came clear to me I just thought back on my own life when God, for reasons that I couldn't control, just moved on me. He just moved on me, and he would move on me in kind of what I would describe now as kind of a holy terror. He wouldn't get off my case, and he'd move on me and move on me, and he was bringing me to another place, and I got no other word for it but fear in me because he was going to call me to change. He was going to call me deeper. He was going to call me to take some risks. Sometimes the revelation of the glory was like Paul's on me and sometimes on you, where he was going to come to me, reveal his glory, but in the glory he was going to reveal my sin and he was going to call me to repentance. And I would move into a season of repentance and if you've ever experienced it, these deep times with God, you know what, physically you get affected. You know what I'm saying? Your heart begins to pound. The glory, for all I know, the glory may be being revealed to some of you right now. It has nothing to do even with some sermon I'm preaching right now, but there's a nervousness coming on you because the reality of God is exposing itself to you and you're going to have to respond and he's calling you out of darkness into light and it's a frightening thing because your whole life is going to be different now. Remember times of repentance where physically I would just shake and you wonder if you can survive and I don't like to go there and I hope I don't have to go there again but I wouldn't trade it for the world. I wouldn't trade it for the world. It's a frightening thing but you don't have to be afraid. Why? Because it's Jesus. That's why. Look at the text, verse 7, and Jesus came to them. They fell on their faces. They were afraid, and he touched them, and he said, what I just said to you, arise, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid of the glory coming on you. Don't be afraid of coming into redemption. Don't be afraid of facing your own sin. Don't be afraid of asking the glory to fall on the church. And lifting up their eyes, here's why they didn't have to be afraid. They saw no one except Jesus himself alone. That's why you don't have to be afraid of the glory of God because it's Jesus. And even though it may be frightening, it's going to be glory and it's going to be safe. Matthew 16 and 17, what we've looked on very briefly here, gave the disciples a promise of glory and a glimpse of glory. Let me close with this. Our hope for present glory, it's simply this. that he would manifest and reveal himself to the church. Paul prayed for it this way, Ephesians 3, 19 and 20. My prayer is that you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length and breadth and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up with all the fullness of God, to him be what? Glory in the church. And the key to the glory in the church is Colossians 1, 27, where it says this, Christ in you. That is your hope of glory, a mystery not known to ages past. Sandy Bernstein in our prayer time before the first service mentioned John 17, that God the Father gave his glory to the Son so the Son could put his glory by his presence in, oh wow, me. My hope of glory is Christ in me. Transforming me and you. 2 Corinthians 3, 15 to 18 says that this way. That even to this day, when some read the word of God, a veil lies over their heart. The veil is a veil of, they don't get it. They look at the word and go, what is this? They don't understand it. But here's the cool deal. Whenever a person turns their heart to the Lord, the veil is taken away. How many of you have had that experience? It didn't make any sense. You come to Christ, all of a sudden the word begins to open up to you. Now the Lord is spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all with unveiled face, because we've turned our hearts to the Lord, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, as we see the glory of God, we are by that glory, transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. And according to Peter, in 1 Peter 1.8, it all comes around and is expressed in worship. For though we have not seen him, we love him. And though we do not see him now, but believe in him, we greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of what? Glory. Say it. Full of what? Glory. Beloved, it all began when Moses, in Exodus 33, 18, had the gall to say, let me see your glory. Let me experience your manifested presence. but actually it began before that with a prior request. Let me know your ways. And we over the last few weeks have begun to discover that among the ways of God that reveals the glory of God is the way of desire and the way of humility, the way of reverence and the way of dependence, the way of his sovereign choice and the way of his precious son and the way of our unreserved faith-filled worship. Pull all that together. Stir it in a pot. Give it a little bit of time and you will begin to see glory. me.
