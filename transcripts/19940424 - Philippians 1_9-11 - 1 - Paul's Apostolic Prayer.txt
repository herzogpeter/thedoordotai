It is my judgment that in order to get anywhere near the depth of this prayer, we need, ironically, to keep it simple. If not for you, we need to keep it simple for me. With that in mind, there are three things I want us this morning to hear and understand about this verse and the concepts that are being dealt with here. First of all, I want us to hear and understand an explanation of the verse. I just want to work with the text a little bit, explain some words, so we get a picture of clearly what it is that Paul's praying for. Second thing I want us to hear and understand is a question of the prayer that I've already asked. Why did Paul pray this? Of all the things he could have prayed for them, given their circumstances and his, why was this the first thing out of his mouth? The third thing is this, that I want us to hear and understand, is an invitation, an invitation to respond to. For there is something around this verse that this morning before we leave, we can do. And I believe we need to do. So let's start with the explanation. Just getting into the verse. In this I pray that your love may abound. Stop in that word abound right now. It's important to get a picture of that to kind of get a picture of what's going on here. The word abound means literally to turn out abundantly. Forget that you know we're talking about love. Abound in anything means to turn something, whatever it is, out abundantly. It means to exceed in something, to increase in something, to have something overflowing. That's what the word abound means. Now, the word overflow is the one that caught me the most, and it kind of gave me a picture that I'll share with you. If it helps you, fine. If it doesn't, figure out another one. This picture of overflowing with something. Put in my mind a picture of a fountain coming up the top of my head. There's like this, I'm full, but abounding or overflowing means I can't be contained. So I have this picture in you, if you're laughing at me. I have this of you. There's over the top of your head, this thing is overflowing, whatever it is. That's what it means to abound. You abound still more and more, more and more, just adds to the sense of this thing being more than enough. Now, that which is overflowing is your love. Before I even get to the word love, I want to be nitpicky here. It's your love is abounding still more and more. The key here is that it's your love. The key here is that it's inside of you love. I want to split a hair here for a minute to get what I think is the point here. Paul is not here praying that their love would abound still more and more for each other. Though, if Paul's prayer is answered, their love for each other would abound still more and more. He is not praying that. He is not praying that their love for him would abound still more and more. He is not even praying that their love for God would abound still more and more. Though, if they do the prayer, or if the prayer is answered, that would happen as well. Specifically, what Paul is praying here is this. That inside of you as an individual, forget about everybody else. inside of you and coming from you, abiding in you, more than that, abounding from you, there would be this quality of love, this reality of love, that this thing spouting off of the top, this water, if you will, is love, and it is in you, more than that, it's abounding from you. The result of love abounding in you, coming like a fountain off the top of your head, is this, That people who cross your path have splash on them what is coming from you. You get that? So the picture isn't of me walking around trying to find people to love even, though that's not a bad idea. But it's not about me going, oh, I'll go over here and I'll go over. Oh, there's so many people to love. How many are going to get? No, no, just stay where you are. Just stay where you are and abound with love is Paul's prayer. So that everyone who crosses your path, or how about this one? Say it this way. Everybody who gets in your way gets love. Why? Because it's abounding in you. Abounding love that's flowing from you, splashing on other people, is not splashing on other people because they are particularly worthy objects of the love that's getting on them. The reason love is getting on them is because it's in you. And when people get close to you, they get on them what's in you. Tracking? This concept came clear to me through an odd comparison. In fact, it's a diametrically opposed comparison. Hear it, though. In Matthew 5, verse 27 to 28, Jesus is speaking to some Pharisees who knew very little of love. They knew very much of the law, but they didn't know very much of inner life. And he says to them, among other things, these words, You have heard it said, don't commit adultery. And all the Pharisees said, we have heard it said, And we think that's terrible. Jesus then took it a step further saying this. I say, however, to you that if a man looks on a woman to lust after her, he has committed adultery with her already in his heart. Now let me add to this, and I don't think I'm playing with the text, that that applies to women too. If a woman lusts after a man, she's committed adultery already with him in her heart. Now, the way I've always kind of understood that verse was that there was a sequence there. It kind of went like this. If I see a woman and I lust after her, the result of my lusting after her is adultery, meaning my lust equals adultery. And when I lusted, adultery happened whether I acted on it or not. Now, there is a way in which that's true, but the verse actually means something deeper than that, quite frankly, more confrontive than that. When the word there says in Matthew 5, 28, you have committed adultery already in your heart, it meant this. Before you ever saw the woman or saw the man, you had adultery abiding in you. You had adultery abounding from you. You had lust living and being very much at home in you. And when this woman or man crossed your path, you simply found an object upon which to put that which was already abiding in you, that which was already abounding from you. And when they came close to you, what they had splashed on them was your lust. and you want to know something? The lust that got on them, and they even engaged in, possibly, if it became a sexual relationship, for instance, was not because you, if you were the object, were a particularly desirable object. I'm sad to tell you this. If you felt loved because someone lusted after you, it has very little to do with your desirability. It has a lot to do with what's abounding in them. They had lust abounding in them. It just got on you. And if you've ever been in a relationship like that where someone's lust abounding in them splashed on you and you felt used, there is a reason you felt used. It's because you were used. Paul's prayer here is this. I pray that what abides in you, more than that, what abounds from you is not lust but love. And because it is abounding in you, It is going to flow from you, and it is going to land on people. And it is going to land on them not particularly because they are particularly desirable objects, worthy of love. The reason it's going to land on them is because it's in you. Okay, just kind of work that through in your mind a little more, and let's go on in the verse. That your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment. Discernment simply adds wisdom and insight to knowledge. The simplest level of understanding what this kind of qualifier to this whole prayer gives is this. It's saying, the love that I want to have abounding in you is not a naive love. The love that I am praying would abound in you is not a blind love. It is not a gushy love, even though I've used this metaphor of a fountain gushing. This love that I want abounding from you is not this, it's not that. It's not a lacking substance love. It is a love that is rooted in real knowledge and all discernment about at least two things. It is a love abounding in real knowledge about what real love is. First of all, that your love may abound in a real knowledge of what love is in truth. That your love may abound in an awareness that the love I am praying abound in you is not just puppy love. It is not just sentimental. It is not just warm and gooey. It is not just being nice love. Though those things may be a part of what you experience, it is more than those things. That the love I am calling you to and praying for you to abound from you is indeed agape love. I will define this more next week than this week. But it is in essence by definition self-sacrificing love. No strings attached love. Best picture of the kind of love he's calling us to. Praying for them is die on the cross love. Whatever that means. And I want the love to abound in you in real knowledge about what real love is. Puppy love. It was this morning, actually, that I thought of, what is puppy love? I mean, I hear that all the time, and I kind of attach it to young people who are, you know, thrilled. I thought, what is puppy love literally? Well, it involves a puppy. And my definition of puppy love is this. Defined, it is what you feel before the puppy starts to cost. Sitting in the pet store, looking a little old. I mean, who doesn't love a puppy? I mean, some of you are really hardened criminals and you hate puppies. Who doesn't love a puppy? Everybody loves the puppy. And as parents, we cringe when, you know, we don't even bring our kids to pet stores. and it's not that you hate puppies. It's not. You love puppies. I love puppies. I get tears in my eyes. But the problem is you know there's more. See, you have real knowledge and all discernment about where this relationship with this puppy is going to go. Real knowledge and all discernment. See, are you going to bring this home and then this little puppy, cute little thing, is going to start whimpering in the middle of the night, probably 10 minutes after I fall into my deep sleep. it's going to start to bark. It's going to want to go out, do its business, and I'm going to get up in the middle of the night and walk through my whatever room it is and step in its business. You know, all that work, and it is work, loving this little puppy, might be worth it. But it may never feel the same way again as it did. and with all the humor around that and the reality of those things and you know what I'm talking about I contrast that with Jesus dying on a cross love somewhere his love went beyond didn't it didn't it and that kind of love goes way beyond where I'm at too and Paul's praying he's on his knees he's saying God I pray for these people I love dearly and wish the best for not that they win the lottery here's what I pray that their love would abound more and more but I'm talking about real love here in real knowledge and all discernment of what real love is and some quite frankly if you actually heard somebody praying that for you you'd go don't Pray that for me. It's not what I need the most. I need to win the lottery most. Pray that I win the lottery. Pray that people be nice to me. Don't pray this. There's another way this applies in real knowledge of what real love is, but in real knowledge, I'd like this love to abound relative to who you are. What are you saying? What I mean is that this love abounds even in relationships where I begin to see more and more clearly the frailties of the people I'm in relationship with. And even after I begin to see the frailties of people I'm in relationship with, real knowledge about who they are, this I pray, that even then your love may abound still more and more. I haven't even defined what love actually is yet again deal with that a little bit more next week but already saying it this way it feels impossible Bonnie and I this last week had the joy of celebrating together 20 years of marriage and that was a very fun thing oh yeah Well, there you go. I'll tell you a little story. One of the things I'm not real good at, in fact, I'm terrible at it, and it's not even all that funny, but I don't remember things very well, like dates. You know? My wife tells me, I hear her telling people publicly, you know, he doesn't know the kid's birthday, ask him. he asked me he counts on me he doesn't even know their birthday anytime I hear Bonnie say these words Dave do you know what day it is? I hardly ever do and when I hear those words I hear them usually at the end of a day that she's wondering if I know what day it is but I do know this when she asked that question that I'm supposed to know what day it is I know something else and I'm in a lot of trouble because I don't know what day it is it was a while ago I was sitting on the couch with Bonnie the kids were gone, it was late in the evening, the fire was there we were kind of talking and reminiscing, speaking with one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs where did that come from whatever that's what we do and I was just being kind of nostalgic and I said honey 15 years she didn't get mad she didn't slug me She kind of pulled away from me, though. And then she looked at me and she said, Dave, you have a daughter who is 17. Do the math. Now, that is not the worst offense that I bring to our marriage, believe me. But you know what it illustrates? that the joy of 20 years of marriage is that her love for me is in real knowledge of me. She has real knowledge of what I'm good at and what I'm not and what the frailties are and what they aren't. And she even has some discernment about what my frailties are. Things that I haven't disclosed, she knows. And she's still there. you know why she's still there because at least on that level for her her love abounds for me the love is in her for me and it's in me for her it's in you but I want it Paul says and I pray that it be in real knowledge we're not talking puppy love here I'm talking real love hang in there love self-sacrificing love yes even in the context of knowing more and more what human frailty there is around you. I want love to abound even then. That's his prayer. And that's the explanation of the prayer. Move now, just with that kind of package of information, to the question that I want to ask of this. Why did Paul pray this? Of all the things he could have prayed, why this? I believe there's at least two reasons. Number one, because of love's priority. I think every one of us here would agree that according to our creed, that is, what we say we believe, nothing matters more than love. And we would all agree with that. In fact, one of the tensions I'm feeling as I'm preaching this for the third time, I felt it in all the other services, is that when I talk about love, especially now that it's really important, we've heard it so much, or I'm not sure the reason, but it tends to roll off our back. We all go, yeah, yeah, it is. But I think that's one of the reasons Paul is praying for it because it is important. Jesus said, By this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have all the right answers. No, I didn't say that. Wish he did because then we just learned. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, that you really are men and women who are followers of me if you hold the right doctrine. or if you build a big building or if you do signs and wonders or if you preach really good sermons that even affects people's lives. No, that's not how you can tell, says Jesus. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you love one another. John 13, 34, Jesus said, a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another. I don't know if any of you are doing this right now as I'm saying these words, but there is even a tension in me. I feel an urge to clarify. What do you mean by love? Love means this and it doesn't mean this and make sure it's not too hard and you better define this love here. And I am going to spend more time next week doing some clarification, what it means and what it doesn't. But it occurred to me that Jesus didn't define that word every time he said it. Sometimes he just said, a new commandment I leave with you, that you love one another. What does that mean? What do you think it means? It means love one another. That's what it means. Whatever it means, it is the highest and the finest and the best. And the reason Paul prayed this for them was because he wanted for them the highest and the finest and the best. I picture in my mind's eye Jesus speaking with Peter. It is after the crucifixion, after the resurrection. Therefore, it is after Peter's humiliating denial. And Jesus asks a question. And just like the question I have of Paul's prayer, why did he pray this of all the things he could pray? My question is, of all the things Jesus could have asked, why did he ask this? The question was, Peter, do you what? Love me. Think of the things he could have or should have asked. Like, Peter, why did you deny me? How could you deny me? Are you sorry that you denied me? Do you promise never to deny me? No, he asked this. Peter, here's what I want to know priority-wise. Do you love me? Why did he ask that question? Here is why. Because nothing is more important than that. Nothing matters more than that. In fact, Peter, this is good news for you. and all the people like Peter among us who really do love Jesus, the good news is this. That you love me has more power than even the fact that you've failed. So I ask you this. Do you love me? Because it's what matters most. Jesus, by his spirit in the book of Revelation, is moving among the church as he comes to the church in Ephesus and says these words to them. I know your deeds. They were, in fact, this Ephesian church, a powerful deed-doing church. I know your toil and perseverance, that you cannot endure evil men, that you have endured and not grown weary, but I have this against you, one thing, you've left your first love. And if you do not remember from where you have fallen, And if you do not change your mind about where you are going, that is repent, and return to where you have been, that is love, I will remove your lampstand. Now, I'm not sure exactly what that means, to have your lampstand removed. One thing that occurs to me is Jesus in Matthew 5 says to us, you are the light of the world. And among other things, what a light does, it draws people who are lost in darkness and don't know their way, and they're drawn to the light. You are the light of the world. He says to the church that's lost its love, I'm going to remove your lampstand, which may mean, among other things, your influence in the world for the kingdom is going to be put out if the top priority is not there. I don't care how powerful your deeds are, how able you are to endure and confront what's wrong. You've left your first love. Whether it's toward God, Love or toward one another, love. There's nothing more important than love. Again, I have this sense that it could just roll off our back and we could go, yeah, I agree with that. Let me try to say it in a way that might penetrate a little more. Think of your week and the things you're going to do. important things I would expect you will do and plan to do this week. Of all the things you are going to do this week, the most important thing you're going to do this week is love. What's going to show up of all the things you do this week on the radar of heaven, if you will, what's going to kind of glow is love. Pull it closer. Today, the most important, I don't know, what do you got planned today? The most important thing you're going to do today is love. I'm preaching a sermon today, and this is going to consume a pretty good part of my day and my energy, and here's the word to me. The most important thing I'm going to do today is not preach this sermon. The most important thing I'm going to do today, what will show up on the radar of heaven, if you will, is love. And that might not show up to you. It might be an interaction with my little boy, with my wife, with a friend. But you know what? It's not even about my wife. It's something, abounding love is in me. It's not me going around finding everybody on earth to love. It's in me. So the people who bump into me get what's in me. I won't do anything more important, and neither will you today. But of all the important things you're going to do today, this week, this month, this year, if those important things you're doing are void of love, they're more than flawed, they're worthless. 1 Corinthians 13, another section we've heard maybe too many times to have effect anymore. I hope not. If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I'm a noisy gong, a clanging cymbal. It's offensive. If I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, I see things, I know things. Other people don't see them. Other people don't know them. And if I have all faith so as to remove mountains but don't have love, These next words are interesting. It doesn't say those deeds you did are nothing. It says I am nothing. You are nothing. And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I deliver my body to be burned but don't have love, stop right there. How in the world could you give your body to be burned and give all your possessions? I mean, obviously, the only motive for doing those things would be love. No, this is what raises the reality that we need to better define love because this verse makes it very clear that some people out of a lack of love for people, really more maybe to make me look good, could sacrifice lots of things, have nothing to do with love. You could burn your body, but if you don't have love, it profits you nothing. Dan Allender in his book Bold Love paraphrases this passage this way. Talent without love is deafening. Spiritual discernment and power to do miracles without love is debasing. Sacrifice of possession or body without love is defrauding. It is pointless and worthless to live and not to love. Listen to that last line. It's the most powerful of them, I believe. It is pointless and worthless to live and not to love. My original question in this whole thing was, why did Paul pray this? The answer is because nothing's more important than this. And for people he loved and wanted the best for, it was as if he was spiritually asking God that they win the lottery. Because nothing could be of more value than abounding love in them, in me. But what dawns on me as I come to grips with what he's praying for is this. That for something that is so clearly our highest priority and greatest kingdom value, it is something that we don't do very well. Let me say that in another way that I think is more important for me. For something that is clearly our highest priority and greatest kingdom value, it is something that I don't do very well. And that leads to the second reason that I believe Paul prayed this prayer. because of love's difficulty. I am 41 years old. I've been a Christian for 33 years. I've been in full-time pastoral ministry for 17 years, and I've been a senior pastor at this church for 13 years. And I think that I've walked with God at a certain level of depth. But what occurs to me after all that time of knowing God and walking with God and doing what I do and being who I am is this. That really loving with real knowledge and all discernment of what it is and real knowledge and all discernment of how people are. After 41 years it has not grown easier. It has grown harder. It has grown more difficult, and I find it, in all honesty, as I look inside my spirit, more elusive. Now, the reasons for that are manifold. But sticking with the text, I'll give you two. Come right out of the text. Reason number one that love feels more elusive to me now than, say, five, ten, twenty years ago is because right now I know more about what real love is than I did five years ago. 20, I know more. I know a little bit more about love's priority, about its cost, and I know a little bit more about how it can hurt. I know a little bit more about the fact that the love to which God has called us, the love that He wants abounding in us, is not just sentimental, that it's not just being nice, that it's not just feeling warm and gooey. And because I know more now than I did a year ago about what real love is, just knowing what it is, I feel just by knowing more further from it. I don't know if any of you can resonate with that. See, the fact is this. I'm not trying to beat myself up. I'm trying to be honest. The fact is this. I would like to think that in the last 20 years, I love better now than I did. I like to think that. I think in some ways it's true. I love better now than I did 20 years ago. But my understanding and knowledge of what real love is has grown a lot faster than my ability to do it. There's another reason that I find it more difficult now than 20 years ago. And that's not just because I know more about what real love is. And feel further from it because of that. But I know more about you. Not you in particular. Nobody here in particular. But you in general. I know more about people. And how it is that you can feel when you're in relationship with people. See, 41 years has given me more time than I had when I was 20 years old. To find out that people can hurt you, and people can use you, and people can offend you, and people can revile you, and can hate you, and misunderstand you, and ignore you. And the fact is this, the longer you live, the more evidence you're going to get. That's a true thing. The more evidence you're going to get, an experience you're going to be able to add to the other experience you had. Of people who hurt you and use you and offend you and revile you and abuse you and hate you and misunderstand you and ignore you. When I had a definition of love that it was like, hey, hey, just kind of be nice to everybody. Hey, how are you? 20 years old. Hey, how are you? Yeah, I just love everybody. I didn't know anybody. I love you all. I thought I was a lot closer. I thought I was a lot closer. And then I began to meet more people. And people began to meet me. Not always have good experiences with me. And you begin to feel further and further from it if you're honest. So let's despair. No, no, no, no. Let me say it this way. Paul's prayer. And this I pray. That your love may abound more and more. Even in the real knowledge that you probably will be hurt. You hearing this prayer now? I pray that your love would abound more and more. Even in the real knowledge that you probably will be used. Probably will be offended. Reviled. Hated. Abused. Misunderstood. Or ignored. And as I put that whole thing together that way, I really know now why he prayed this. Among all the other reasons that he prayed it, he prayed it for this reason. Because the Apostle Paul knew that the kind of love he was describing and calling for and praying for was beyond their capacity. It was beyond his capacity to do it, even to want it, That without a supernatural engagement of their desire, of his desire to love and have it abound in them, without a supernatural involvement of God himself by his spirit in their lives, engaging their desire to love, they wouldn't even taste it. Maybe if they kept their definition of love down here as being, hey, how are you? They could feel like they're there. But if I give them the definition of love that speaks to self-sacrifice and a Savior hanging on the cross and call them to that and ask that that abound from them, that's going to drive them to their knees. It's already, Paul says, driven me to mine on their behalf. This is going to be a miracle that you have never seen. and that leads me to the third and final thing here the invitation and the invitation is really simple while we're going to deal with some of these issues again next week I want to start this week with this i want you with me to simply do this make paul's prayer your prayer and if you're ready to do that i want you to do that make paul's prayer your prayer i i i i don't even i don't even want to send you out that door with abounding love okay well wave a magic wand you all have it. No, no, no. Don't worry about it. I don't even know what it all means yet. Let's just start here. Make Paul's prayer your prayer. And I want to be real pointed here as I start. Make it your prayer for you to start with. I don't know if you're like me, but I thought about this this week. If I was sitting in the congregation this morning hearing a sermon like this, I know that at some point during hearing a word like this, I'd be saying this. I hope George hears this. Boy, I'll tell you, if love would have bound in them, boy, it would be easy. Well, I hope she, I hope Nancy hears this one. Boy, I'll tell you, I'm watching her, seeing if she's paying attention. That's pretty normal. That's pretty normal to do. I think you'll miss the point. My invitation is this, to make this your prayer. If it was your prayer, you'd say it like this. and this I pray dear Jesus that my love nobody else is in this room that my love would abound still more and more in real knowledge in growing discernment about what love really is and in full knowledge and eyes wide open about what people can do to you I want to say God to you that I want you to do this in me any of you ready to pray that then pray it and this I pray that my love may abound still more and more in all knowledge real knowledge and all discernment but I want to take you a step further than that because I think it is appropriate even important while it needs to start here that we need to see this corporately, that it is appropriate and important to say at some point in this, and this we pray. And this, because we together are the body. You are not, we are the body. And so it is appropriate, important to say, and this we pray, that our love may abound still more and more so that people who get in our way get loved. and the question that rises up out of my humanity is this why would anybody pray that prayer? well reason number one is because of love's priority do any kind of dance you want around this kind of word but we cannot get around the fact and I am speaking to believers now because I don't think a word like this would have any power in anybody who doesn't have Jesus in them The fact is this, we can't get around the word of Jesus when he said, this is the way you will know, I will know that you are truly followers of mine if you have love for one another. So the reason a Christian would with some passion pray a prayer like this is because from the lips of Jesus he has said there's nothing more important. But when he says there's nothing more important, if you really look at what it is And look at how you've been wounded. I know you've been wounded. There comes rising in you the second thing. It's impossible. And that's the second reason you would pray. Holy Spirit of God, you have got to do this in me. You have got to be in me doing this in me if this is going to be. I want you to stand as we close. I want to pray over us as we close but I think it is appropriate to do this weekend what we've been doing and enjoying for several weekends and not over the last couple but this coming together if you have time to meet with me and we're just going to pray we're going to have some time for words and things and this I pray is the point this morning and I want to spend some time with those of you who have time to hang around to pray over this this morning altar ministry I would like you to come and take some place on the sides so that people who need individual prayer can do that I want to encourage those of you who have children in the nursery to get them before you come forward but I'd like to pray together first Jesus I thank you for the things that you're doing in our church the ways in which you're moving among us we feel so many and this is the third service and I look out on the sea of people after three and I get overwhelmed with how would this get fleshed out in all the ways in which it needs to be. It starts with me. It just starts here. This I pray. That my love would abound still more and more. Just in quietness, those of you who are ready and desire and have that in your heart, just pray that. Just quietly to yourself. Make it yours. for some Lord praying that prayer is a very terrifying thing because they have been hurt and their fear is if they open up to love anybody anybody even safe people they will run the risk of being bruised again I pray your protection on this prayer but I pray a release a baptism in Jesus name of love among us and in us for your glory and your praise and your advancing kingdom in this place city, nation and world I pray it in Jesus name Amen
