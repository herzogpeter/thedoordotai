Let's pray as we go to the ministry of the word this morning. For an energy that is born of your spirit, I pray, and for words of life that call out life, I pray, and for courage to follow wherever you call, I pray. And I pray it all in Jesus' name. Amen. As I expected to be, I was affected by the presence of John Perkins among us last week. If you weren't here, John Perkins was with us last week in this pulpit for us for the entire weekend. He's a 75-year-old African-American preacher from Jackson, Mississippi, and he came to spend the weekend with us and give us insight into his journey and to kind of help us extend what is turning into a series of collaborations with other people who care about the least and the lost in our community and in our city and in our entire nation. The network is growing. And while his words, as he preached, were powerful to me at times, it was his presence. And the credibility of his life that moved me most, it's actually what I heard most from you relative to his impact on our church, particularly as it related to his relentless commitment, lifelong commitment, and movement toward the least and the lost to those outside the camp, which is a group of people we've been kind of focusing on in our study of Matthew 8 and 9 in the context of Jesus' healing ministry. If you've been with us for the last few weeks, you're undoubtedly aware that in the broader context of our study on the gifts of the Spirit, particularly of light, the gift of healing, we've been examining the healing miracles of Jesus as found in Matthew 8 and 9. But beyond the miracles themselves, what we have found of particular interest in the miracles is what I've been referring to as the messages in the miracles. And among the most obvious message in all of the miracles that we've been hearing is this, that every time God does a miracle, a healing here, it's as if the message of the miracle is that I care deeply, says the Lord, about the least and the lost, about those outside the camp. I care deeply about the very kind of people that John Perkins came last week to help us see more clearly, to move toward more effectively, be involved with more deeply. Related to these miracles in these chapters that we've been studying, I want you to remember, I want you to kind of dial back into the fact that it is no accident. It is not coincidental that the first three miracles in Matthew 8 that we've been studying involved a leper, a half-breed Samaritan, and a slave. That is intentional. And the intentional message of those miracles, dealing with lepers and half-breed Samaritans and slaves, the intentional message is that God cares about those kinds of people, those lost and leased outside the camp, lepers, Samaritans, and slaves. And the other message we've been hearing week after week from the miracles of Jesus is the things he cared about, he wants us to care about. The things he did with authority to bring healing to those arenas of life, he's given us authority to do the same. It is not incidental, but central to the story of the leper. That when he came to Jesus in Matthew 8, verse 2, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him. That wasn't just a quaint little gesture. And we even pointed out that in a number of the healing ministries of healings of Jesus, he didn't always touch somebody. When he touched the leper, it was intentional because the leper in that culture was considered by good, clean people everywhere to be untouchable, to be unclean. And that is precisely why Jesus said, Untouchable, well, I'm touching them, and I'm doing it in your face. I'm touching the leper. I want my people to do the same. It was not incidental, but central to the story of the centurion, who we were introduced a couple of weeks ago. The centurion who was not only a Gentile, which all by itself makes him unclean, but a Samaritan, and therefore despised by good, clean people everywhere. The centurion, it wasn't incidental that when he told Jesus about his paralyzed slave at home suffering and in great pain, It says in chapter 8, verse 6, that Jesus' first response to that in verse 7 was to say, well, I will come to your home and heal him. And on the surface, that doesn't look like a big deal unless you dial back into the fact that this Cornelius Centurion was a Gentile. He was a Samaritan. For Jesus to go to his home would have made Jesus a Jew ceremonially unclean. To go to his home would have been an act that would have proven to good, clean people everywhere that Jesus didn't care about holiness. Because holy people, we learned and have been learning in this section, prove how holy they are by how far they stay away from people and things that they don't think are holy that might just make them dirty like the house of a Gentile wouldn't go there. Or the presence of a slave or the skin of a leper wouldn't touch that. I mean, what would people think? What on earth would people think? if we were actually to be kind to, or what would they think if we actually made friends with the girl in the class who just had the abortion or the lesbian couple who lives across the street? But guess what? That may just be where the kingdom's coming, says these stories. But things haven't changed all that much when you think about it, because sometimes we still unconsciously even prove how holy we are by how far we stay. Even though it was while we were yet sinners, while we were yet sinners, Christ moved toward us, was willing to touch us, He died for us, He died for us, and then He says to His people, Don't just thank me for dying for you. Follow me in moving toward the same kind of people that you were before I moved toward you. Don't just cheer for me, says the Lord, that I died for you. Join me in caring about and moving toward these kind of people. For several weeks now, I've been making a real big deal of the fact and wanting us to notice over and over again that of the 35 healing miracles that Jesus did, or miracles in general actually, that are recorded in the Gospels, only two of them took place in the context of a synagogue or a temple or what we would maybe call today a church in a religious context. All the rest of his miracles took place out there, outside these walls, as it were, in the context of ordinary life. On the side of a road in someone's house, at a wedding, in a boat, in a garden, at a Starbucks coffee shop in a classroom of a junior high school, at a homeless shelter in a prison where Angel Tree Ministry went and brought a family back together. That's where it happens. Why? Well, to quote John Perkins last week, here's why. It's because that's where the suffering is out there. Which does not mean there isn't suffering in here. Does not mean that. But when you get the big picture of the kingdom of God and where it needs to go, the fact is this, that most lepers, most paralyzed slaves, aren't going to come here. And one of the reasons they're not going to come here is that they're paralyzed. So at some level, at a very deep level, at a level that speaks to what our fundamental mission is as the people of God, We need to go there. Our direction, our energy needs to continually be pointed out the doors, not toward this pulpit or toward the front of this church. That's why one of the primary metaphors I have for the church, particularly our church, because I don't have a lot of control over any other church. I don't have much control over this one, quite frankly. The primary metaphor I have is that this is a locker room. And like a locker room, the thing you dial into first about that is this is not where we play the game. We play the game out there. And sometimes in playing the game, as it were, and giving our life away out there, and moving toward the least and the lost in our communities and our circle of friends and whatever that means for you, sometimes in the process of giving our life away, we come up injured and wounded and we wonder if we can even keep going anymore and we get discouraged and we forget even what the mission is and then it's time to come back to the locker room. Halftime every Sunday. Every Sunday morning it's halftime. Get back here and let's talk about the healing that you need so you can feel better about yourself. I hope you feel better about yourself, but that's not the point. The healing that you need so you can go back out there and play the game and do the mission that is God's mission in bringing the light and life of God and love to people who nobody else will touch. Sometimes we forget the mission and we need to be reminded of what it is we do and who it is we serve. And that's the locker room that this is in order to go out there. But to do that, in other words, to go out there with this kind of vision, you have to have a sense of vision. You have to have a sense of mission. And you have to have a deep commitment in your heart relative to a lifelong direction that you want to make God's mission your mission. And it would also help to have the kind of heart that God has for the least and the lost. Because if you don't have a heart for the least and the lost, for those who no one else will touch, you'll never touch them. By the way, the heart God had for the least and the lost is precisely, indeed ironically, the kind of heart we discovered in the centurion when he came to Jesus on behalf of his paralyzed slave. Remember we talked about that a couple weeks ago a slave in Jesus' day would have been considered, as less than human, obviously, but not much more than a tool or a piece of machinery in your garage. Useful only as long as it worked. And if it didn't work, you throw it away. Here is a person who, in a metaphor, I don't want to be mean about this slave, but they're a useless person. In fact, the Greek indicated that this servant was a slave and the slave was a child. And if we measure worth by how useful they are, this person paralyzed even. As a child, useless. As a slave, not any value humanly and is paralyzed, which means he can't do any work at all. Useless. The fact that this centurion brought this kind of person to Jesus for healing means he's got the same heart that God has for the least. And the law is making his heart a lot more like God's than those who thought themselves to be sons of the kingdom, it says in verse 12 of chapter 8, which leads me to the second primary message in the miracles. It's this, that God blesses faith wherever he finds it. But he continually finds it, as we've been saying for weeks now, in the strangest places, unexpected places. You'd expect to find this kind of faith in the temple or the synagogue or in the church, among people of quote-unquote faith. But Jesus finds it and keeps finding it, and this is an intentional message in these miracles we cannot ignore or be blind to. He keeps finding this faith among lepers, Samaritans, and slaves who don't go to the synagogue, who weren't even allowed in the synagogue or the temple or the church. Indeed, in verse 10, he says, I have not found this kind of faith, the kind I see in this Samaritan Gentile centurion. I've not found this kind of faith with anyone in Israel. And then to make it perfectly clear that what he was saying really was as radical and as disturbing as it sounded, to these religious people, he said in verse 11, that many will come from the east and the west and will sit at the table of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In other words, many will come that you don't expect from places you would never dream of. In fact, the people from the east and the east, you're sure they're not, I'm here to tell you, they will be at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But some of the sons of the kingdom who think they're sons of the kingdom, because of all they know, will be cast into outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, and the weeping and gnashing of teeth will be because they're not at the table. They expected to be at. Matthew 7.22, which is just a few verses prior to Matthew 8. Again, it speaks to the consistent theme of this throughout the gospel. Matthew 7, 22 makes it clear that this is, in fact, a major theme of Jesus' message and ministry when he says, many will say to me on that day, what day? The day we're expecting to be at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. That final day, many will say, Lord, Lord, didn't we do this and didn't we do that? Didn't we even do miracles in your name? Jesus will say, depart from me. I don't know you. Matthew 25 reveals that this knowing, what do you mean you don't know me or I don't know you? Matthew 25 reveals that this knowing of the Lord is not just a head thing involving what you know about Jesus, but much more a heart thing. The way the centurion's heart was revealed to be a lot like God's heart when he cared for the least, when he cared for a paralyzed slave, Matthew 25. Remember Matthew 25? Beginning in verse 32, Jesus is separating, or God is separating the sheep from the goats, and that's a metaphor for those who are real, have authentic faith, and those who are false, have false faith, if you will. He's separating the true sons of the kingdom, as it were, from those who think they're the sons of the kingdom because they know something in their head. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. And then in verse 34 says, then it says this, that the king then will say to those on his right, the sheep, come, you who are blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom. Come sit at the table with me prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger. You invited me in naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me. Then the righteous will answer him saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink? When did we see you as a stranger and invite you in and clothe you when you were naked? When did we see you as a sick person or in prison and come to you? And the king will answer and say to them, truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these my brothers, and who are these my brothers, according to Jesus? The sick and the blind and the naked and the needy and those who are in prison. As to the extent that you did it to these my brothers, even to the least of them, you did it to me. By the way, you just need to get this. That this is a major theme relative to the kingdom of God. It was a major theme in the Old Testament. When Jesus would say, by the way, when Jesus would say things like this to people in his day, he was not saying a new thing. Oh my goodness, I've never heard that before. Isaiah chapter 1. Old Testament the Spirit of God is speaking to the people of God through the prophet of God when he says this in verse 11 I've had enough of your burnt offerings I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls and goats your religious ceremonies is what he's speaking to there bring your worthless offerings no longer incense is an abomination to me and the calling of assemblies verse 14 I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts. They have become a burden to me. I am weary of bearing them, which means sometimes even God can't stand going to church. So when you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes, he says in verse 15. Yes, even though you multiply your prayers, I will not listen. And the people of God rise up and go, oh my goodness, what do we do? Verse 17, Isaiah 1, he tells them what to do. Here's what you do. It's real simple. Learn to do good, seek justice, reprove the ruthless, defend the orphan, plead for the widow. Common theme. Common theme all through the prophetic utterances of God's anointed ones to God's people. Isaiah 58 verse 6 says the same thing. Is this not the fast I have chosen for you? And he was confronting the fast that they did so everybody could see how religious they looked. And then he says, this is the fast I have chosen for you. to loosen the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bonds of the yoke, verse 6, to let the oppressed go free, to divide your bread with the hungry, verse 7, to bring the homeless poor into the house, to clothe the naked, to give yourselves to the hungry, to satisfy the desire of the afflicted, it says in verse 10. And then it has this incredible word. It says, then, then, when you begin to move toward those kinds of people, Then your light will break out like the dawn, and your recovery will quickly spring forth. You will call, and the Lord will answer, verse 9, and you will cry, and he will say, here I am. It's as if he's saying, then you will be healed. We're all waiting for our healing so we can go. We're all waiting for signs and wonders so we can go out there. What he's saying is here, start caring about what I care about. Move toward the people I care about. Have the guts to put your hands on a leper. then I will heal you. Then I will give strength to your bones. Amen. In fact, he says what I just said. He says that in the next verse, verse 11. Then I will satisfy your desire in scorched places and give strength to your bones. Think on that for a second. I will satisfy your desire in scorched places. You ever get dry in your spirit? Sometimes you get dry because you've been given so much away and you need to back off and get replenished. That's why sometimes you get dry, scorched. Sometimes, you know why sometimes you get dry? Because you're living your life entirely for yourself and it's never enough. Sometimes the reason your bones get weary and they get weak is because you're overdoing it. You're given too much and you've got to find some boundaries and you've got to reel it in a little bit and spend some replenishing time with God so you can go back out and do life and give your life away. But you know another reason why our bones grow weak? It's because we're living entirely for ourselves. And we have this mentality. As soon as my bones are strong, I'll go. And as soon as I'm not dry anymore, I'll go. God says to these people who have begun to live for themselves, it isn't until you go that I'll give strength to your bones and bring replenishment to your scorched places. That's a different way to think. it's a weird thing I don't know if it's our culture I kind of pick on the American church our church I really do believe that many many people come to church and particularly mega churches like ours big churches not all certainly not all and I hope not even most but many come with this fundamental thing on their mind this is their big question what's in it for who? me hear me you make God's mission your mission verse 12 says here's what will happen you will rebuild the ancient ruins you will raise up age old foundations now think on that I don't want to just buzz over that let those words stir in you vision stir in you hope stir in you a sense of destiny for your life and the life of our church to rebuild the ancient ruins, to raise up old foundations. That speaks to things, old foundations, it speaks to things that the kingdom of God has been built on, Isaiah 58, Old Testament. The kingdom has been built on these kinds of things and this kind of focus, those are the foundations, but we've forgotten. But you begin to remember and God will use you to raise up old foundations and you will be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of the streets. You might even be called sons of the kingdom of God. Beloved, these are the things that stirred in me last week as I listened to John Perkins. Because these are the things I saw in him and desire to see far more in me than I do. Indeed, that's why I wrote this note to myself. Actually, it was a question I wrote on my notepad that I used for every talk that John did. John was here on the weekend with us, but he was also here all day Friday for several seminars and then all day Saturday, and then he spoke in our pulpit. So I heard him more than many of you did. But this was a question I had at the top of my notepad. For every talk he gave, it was this, and it was a question for me. Dave, how much do you want this? How far are you willing to follow? All of which brings me to our text today. The sermon's starting. I have 10 minutes left. I just say that to scare the visitors. Matthew 8, 18. It's right in the flow of our study of the miracles of Jesus. Right in the middle of these miracles, there's this fascinating picture, this fascinating interchange of kingdom life, interaction of kingdom life that reveals kingdom life that I don't think we can miss. And then this interaction raises the question that I was writing on the top of my notepad. How much do you want this? How far are you willing to follow me, says Jesus, into the dark places? How far are you willing to follow him into the desperate places where lepers live? Are you Really, are you willing to make my mission your mission? Really? It all begins in verse 18. Ashley read the beginning of this text. It says this, when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to depart to the other side. And a certain scribe said to him, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. Oh, that sounds so good. Stirrs me. Praise God for you, scribe. And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests. But the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head, and that guy disappears in the white space between verse 20 and 21. But back off and get the picture here of what's going on. Up until now in the story, the flow of the story, it's been pretty easy to follow Jesus. All you had to do was follow the crowd, which people do quite easily. The crowd that's been following him since Matthew 8, verse 1. It didn't cost a thing to follow Jesus so far. Some pretty cool things were happening relative to healing and people being delivered of demons. And the size of the crowd is compelling and encouraging because if the crowd is big, it must be good. So I'll associate myself with the crowd, and it's really not even Jesus. It's the crowd that gives me comfort. But now Jesus says we need to depart to go to the other side in verse 18, which in symbolic language to me means we need to now leave this comfortable place where the crowd is. We need to now leave this known place, this easy-to-follow place. So get in the boats, he says. In fact, he didn't just say it. It says in verse 18, he ordered them. Get in the boat. He ordered who? Well, anyone who wanted to follow him. Away from the comfortable place, away from the known place, away from where the crowd was saying, yeah, we're all for you. Turns out that one among the crowd who wanted to follow him was this scribe, who said, sincerely, I think, I will follow you wherever you go, which makes me think, whoa, we just got a new convert here. This is great. This scribe, I believe, if he was in our church this morning, would have been singing at the top of his lungs, like many of you did when we sang, if you say go, we will go. If you say come, we will follow you. Scribe would have been right in that chorus. Look who he is, too, by the way, just noticing that he's a scribe as significant, which means he's a catch. He's good for the cause. I mean, we've got a lot of lepers here, and I know we care for lepers and half-breeds and slaves, but, you know, half-breeds, it's really hard to build a ministry on those kinds of people. Scribe comes along. Scribes know the Bible. This guy could actually teach Sunday school. He could actually help us. This guy will bring credibility to the movement. If I tell people in the neighborhood, you know who goes to our church? You know how it works. I mean, if a wide receiver from some professional football team says Jesus is okay, then I guess he must be. And we get all at Twitter as if the scribe or the professional or the celebrity type person, as if those people validate Jesus instead of the other way around. Jesus' response was certainly not to run this guy off, Jesus you need to know this, was happy to have him follow. But he presses this guy and it's something I think we need to do more of. He presses him with a statement that I think is designed to raise the question that I was writing at the top of my notepad. Scribe, I'm glad you're going to follow but here's my question. How much do you want this? How far are you willing to follow? Because here's the deal. Foxes have holes, birds have nests. But the Son of Man does not have a place to lay his head. And the implication behind that is, if you follow me, it might be like that. Which hit this guy right in his comfort zone. And it's why, I think, he does disappear in the white space between verse 20 and 21. Beloved, life in the kingdom of God promises many things. Among the things it promises are things like peace and power, power of the Holy Spirit to do what we cannot do as we storm the gates of hell, as we go to the desperate and dark places, as we go there, the power of God is released, but it will cost us. It promises presence. I will never leave you nor forsake you, but my personal comfort is not one of the things that's promised ever. And neither is success. At least the way we define success. But the problem is this, that the gospel that sells today, particularly in our country, because I talk to enough people outside in different cultures to know this is a message that is really big in America. It really appeals to us. The gospel that sells today is a gospel of success that promises in a variety of ways that if you follow Jesus, you'll be healthy, wealthy, wise. You'll have a better life, a prettier wife, a bigger house, a nicer car. You'll even have better seats at the concert than mere mortals do because if you do it right, you'll have favor with God and man. And the proof of God's favor is that you're comfortable and successful in the way the American dream kind of thing defines that. It's how we sell the gospel. It's how we get people to buy it, because who would buy it otherwise? We just wet it all together. How different, how different was Jesus' pitch, his sales pitch? Here's my recruitment tool. Foxes have holes, birds have nests. Son of man doesn't have a place to lay his head. In fact, the son of man has been called to give his life away. Now, in the giving of my life away, I will find life. And in Philippians, it talks about how he emptied himself. But then, after he gave his life away and poured out all his life juice, God, therefore, raised him up again and exalted him. And there is this exaltation thing, but it comes as you give your life away. So come join, so follow that. Follow that. Follow me into that. If you hope to gain your life, says Jesus, you will never gain it by grasping for it. You gain your life by losing your life. why here's primarily why this gospel of the kingdom and all this stuff because it's not about you and your comfort the gospel of the kingdom and the kingdom life I'm calling you to is to have a preoccupation with and a passion for the same kind of people I did says the Lord that'd be lepers and centurions and paralyzed slaves the least and the lost people just like you before I came towards you. John Perkins, one of the things he said on Friday, and I wrote this quote down, it kind of stunned me when he said it. He said the most popular preacher in America today is a guy who has removed all prophetic edge from his message and come up with a message that says basically this, your personal benefit, comfort, and success is the most important thing to God and you can have it all if you just read my book, apparently. Why? Because it's all about you. Don't you love hearing that? it's not about the leper it's not about the least and the lost and the poor it's not about the whole body it's about you it's not about the community it's about you it's not about a city that we live in that we have some obligation to bring life to by simply loving somebody it's about you a couple weeks ago I was talking about this with a friend of mine this gospel of success thing and he said in the course of the conversation, he said, show me one. I said, show you one what? He said, show me one success. Now, the way we define success in the whole New Testament. I go, well, we ought to be able to find one. So he talked about Paul, who lived a life of faith and hope and was full of faith and hope until the very end. And if that's the way he defined success, which is the kingdom way to find success, that he was successful. But it's not the way you define success. Not in America, not in the American evangelical. It's not the way you define success. See, he was full of faith and hope and love right to the very end. But in terms of comfort and success, again, the way we defined it, he had neither comfort nor success. Hardly ever. 2 Timothy 4.16, it's just before he dies, he's in a Roman prison writing to his friend Timothy and he says this, all have deserted me, no one has supported me. And he's talking there about Christians who have deserted him. Verse 17 then he says, but the Lord stood with me and strengthened me in order that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished that all the Gentiles might hear. Make no mistake, he says in verse 18, the Lord will deliver me from this, from the Lord will deliver me from every evil deed and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. Hear that again. The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed and deliver me safely to his heavenly kingdom, which God did, but not before he was beheaded. And then we talked about Peter, who was crucified upside down, and Stephen, who was full of grace and power, It says in Acts 6, 8. So when he stood to preach full of grace and power. Would you like to hear somebody preach who was full of grace and power? I would. And he stood and preached full of grace and power in chapter 7. And they loved him. You know why? Because he was so nice. And he told them how if you do it right, you'll have favor. So to be first in line and have the biggest house and the nicest car. That was what he said. It's not what he said. You know what happened to Stephen when he was full of grace and power. He preached a sermon that cut them to the quick. They picked up stones and stoned him. Jesus' message to the scribe was this. Foxes have holes, birds have nests. Son of man has no place to lay his head. If you follow me, it might be that way for you. and in that following me and in that giving your life away, you will find life. And I'll give strength to your bones. And I will replenish the scorched places. Paul's recruitment speech to Timothy in 2 Timothy 2.3 was, come suffer hardship with me. He didn't say, no, I'm not going to say what he didn't say. Like a good soldier, come suffer hardship with me. And I just got to wonder, who would sign up for that? oh man that'll never work you know what while there always seemed to be a crowd of admirers around Jesus especially when he was offering them free food and what I mean by that is giving them what they wanted when they wanted it sometimes it was free food there's a crowd around him but at the end of the day the crowd left him the Pharisees hated him fans like this scribe applauded for him what a guy I'm not going to follow him but what a guy just a few followed him into the dark places in the desperate places just a few followed him into the boat but most of them were lepers and Samaritans and slaves some fishermen and prostitutes which raises this question how much do you want this? how far are you willing to follow him into the dark places and the desperate places where lepers live I'm not kidding verse 21 another disciple comes to him says this in verse 21 says Lord permit me first to go bury my father I will follow you but Jesus said follow me now and allow the dead to bury the dead what that doesn't sound very nice like described this guy is all full of all sorts of I will follow you and it sounds like what he's saying is just let me bury my father which sounds like a reasonable request to me just give me a few hours I have to go to a funeral and Jesus when he says let the dead bury the dead you know don't you care about his father he should go to the funeral doesn't sound very godly except that this what this really is here what this guy is saying is the meaning of it is captured in a Middle Eastern colloquialism that was popular in that day because what he's actually saying here when he says let me bury my father first is let me wait for my father to die first his father wasn't dead let me wait for my father to die and when my father dies I'll get my inheritance and when I get my inheritance I will be secure and when I am secure I'll follow you, promise and Jesus' response such a so sensitive I mean he would have made a great pastor let the dead bury the dead no I got no sympathy at all for you let the dead bury the dead no what he's saying there is this let those who are spiritually dead spend their lives making sure they have security now you want to move in the kingdom follow me now or don't just don't become and I will follow you. Do it or don't do it. Third guy came to Jesus that day in Luke 9.61. Luke 9.61 is a parallel passage. It's the same story. Luke includes this guy for some reason. Matthew doesn't. And this guy in Luke 9.61 comes and says, Jesus, I will follow you wherever you go, but first let me say goodbye to those at home. Again, sounds reasonable. And again, Jesus sounds mean, the way he responds. He says this, Anyone putting his hand to the plow and looking back is not fit for the kingdom of heaven. Which means it sounds like he's saying you can't even say goodbye to your parents. Just come now. They'll figure it out later. You'll call them on your cell phone when we're on the boat. Closer look at this reveals that those at home are friends and family. Literally what he's speaking of here is people's opinion. And what the God, the disciple here is saying is I need to make sure that everybody's okay with me. That they all get this before I follow you. Tell you who this guy is. This is a guy who really does hear the voice of God, like many of you and me. But he hears other voices too, like many of you and me. People's opinion voices. And when he hears their voices, he looks back. And when you look back, says Jesus, one of two things will happen. Well, Jesus doesn't say this. He talks about the plow thing. When you look back, one of two things will happen. Number one, you will stop plowing altogether because you just stop and you leave the plow and go back and make sure everybody's okay with you. Or two, you will plow a crooked line. This is what God's called us to do. This is the mission and it's out there. And then you hear these voices and you start going and all of a sudden you're way over here. You're way over here and you forgot completely about. A picture of this real vivid one is found in Nehemiah 4. Nehemiah got it in his heart and in his bones to rebuild the wall. That was the thing he was looking at. This is what God told us to do. We're going to rebuild the wall. Sanbillat and Tobiah were very irritated by this. And they became the voices in Nehemiah's life that were off the wall and trying to get him to come down. And they would say things. Their first track of attack was to say, This is a stupid wall you're building, Nehemiah. It's a weak wall. This will never work. In fact, you don't even know how to build walls. In Nehemiah 4, verse 3, it says, if a fox were to jump up on this stupid wall you're building, what an ineffective wall. If a fox would jump on that wall, it would fall down. So I'll tell you what, Nehemiah, why don't you come down and we'll reason together. We'll talk about how to build a better wall because we care about building a wall too, but just come off the wall, quit building. So we can talk. And Nehemiah says, no. so they come at him from a different direction and they say oh Nehemiah people are getting the wrong idea they're starting to think that you're doing this for yourself that it's all about your big ego thing and you want people to know what a big guy you are so you better come down in fact the king thinks you're preparing for war so you need to come down from the wall and we can talk and we need to make sure everybody gets the right idea let's just make sure we go and make sure nobody has the wrong idea and Nehemiah says I'm just going to build a wall. By the way, it doesn't mean that Nehemiah isolated himself from voices, from people who spoke to him. But he had around him people and he listened to people. But there are these voices, you know who I'm talking about, in your own life, that call you off the wall. Nehemiah said, no, why? Here's why, because anyone putting his hand to the plow and looking back is not fit for the kingdom of heaven. All of which raises this question. How much do you want this? How far are you willing to follow him into dark places and desperate places, into beyond your resources places where lepers live, but also where healing flows? Because this is the paradigm I see. I've seen this for a while. I've smelled this for a long time. I haven't always been able to say it, but it's like, you know, I think I see not just our church, a church. We come together and want to see the gifts come. And I think the gifts begin to flow and the power begins to come when we actually storm the gates of hell. When we move into those desperate places thinking we have nothing to give and God says, I'm going to strengthen your bones. I'm going to give nourishment to the scorched places in you. Those places that in your own mind you think your cup of cold water won't mean anything. You give a cup of cold water, I'll give them more than you know. The supernatural power of God begins. So how far are you willing to follow there? I will follow you wherever you go, said the scribe. Really? Close with this. Jesus told a parable in Matthew 21 about a landowner who had two sons. And he said to his sons, go into the vineyard and work. And the first son said, I will go, Dad. He was the good son. But he didn't go. And the second son, when he first heard the father say go into the vineyard and work, said, what are you, nuts? I ain't going in that vineyard. But then he regretted it and he went. What's the word? Here's the word. Just do it. Or don't do it. It being following him into the desperate and dark places. Don't make any big promises. You don't have to sing the song really loud this morning. I will fall. Get small. And decide. Either do it or don't do it. I'd like to pray. I'd like you to stand as we pray. And I'd like to close by entering into just a very brief moment of quiet. As you interact with the word this morning and respond in your way to the Father in a quiet way. So get small with God. how much you want this how far are you willing to follow Thank you. Lead us on Lead us on Into the darkest places Lead us on Spirit come, Spirit come Into our darkest places lead us all When you say go I wanna go When you say wait Help me wait If you say step out on the water And they say it can't be done I'll fix my eyes on you and come. Amen. Amen. And all God's people said, Amen. Amen.
