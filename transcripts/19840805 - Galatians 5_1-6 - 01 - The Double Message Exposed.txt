Galatians chapter 5 verse 1. Galatians chapter 5 verse 1. Paul says this, It was for freedom that Christ has set us free. Therefore, don't live any other way than that. Therefore, keep standing firm and don't be subject again to a yoke of slavery. Satan's going to do everything he can to do that to you. Behold, I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you and I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he if you decide to go that way is under the obligation to keep the whole law you have been severed from Christ if you receive circumcision you who are seeking to be justified by the law you have fallen from grace here's how we live here's how we live we through the spirit not through the law by faith are waiting not working and striving for the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. Here's what matters. Faith, working through love. You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? We're talking about freedom this morning. And I need to confess to you that this week for me has been a war. I don't usually go, I agonize over my sermons, I always do. It's something I just go through. But this week was strange, it was unusual. Something was wrong. I don't know if I'm caring too much about the results, making sure I can convince everybody I'm right. I don't know what it is. I know that I need to confess to you this morning that even while I'm speaking about freedom, I'm feeling bound up. And that bondage has been something that's characterized my weekend, That's not characteristic of me. I feel like Satan's moving against me in this. I believe that by the Spirit, we are on the threshold of uncovering things that Satan would just as soon leave covered, that Satan would just as soon leave Christians living their Christian life in their Christian flesh, working as hard as they can, and never breaking through to the Spirit. So you pray for me right now. Lord, I feel a certain liberty even in just confessing that. Clear the mind. Open the heart. By your spirit, do your work. Through this frail instrument, speak. Amen. A double message. You know what a double message is? We have double messages in communication Just with people A double message simply put is this When while I'm in a conversation Or in a situation with some person Something is said or something is communicated But while something is being said and communicated Really there's two things involved Two things are being said Maybe one thing is being said But another thing is being felt Let me give you an explanation I'll tell you that I love you But I'll do it this way What do you mean? You don't think I love you. Of course I love you. Can't you tell I don't love you? I love you. It's a double message. What do you mean you think I don't respect you? I respect you? Are you stupid? Can't you tell I respect you? It's a double message. Did you hear the two messages? The two messages were this. I heard words that said I love you. I heard words that said I accept you and I respect you. But I heard something else as well. There was a double message. I love you. And there was anger at the same time. When we get double messages, what it does is cause confusion. I get confused. I can't always sort it out because there's two things going on. And by the way, the characteristic of a double message is that they contradict each other. One of the dimensions of that message says, I love you. The other says exactly the opposite. I don't love you. The irony for many of us is when we get a double message from someone, instead of taking the time to sort that double message out and trying to sit down with that person maybe and saying, listen, I need to get this straight. You said words that indicate you love me. You give actions that indicate you don't. Which is it I need to know? Instead of doing that, generally what we do is we live trying like crazy to reconcile the tension almost as if they can live together as equal and they can really be okay. Telling ourselves in our mind, the person loves me, the person loves me. I tell it over to myself over and over again. But never really feeling it in my spirit. Never really feeling secure. Never really feeling like the love is there. The love is there, but it isn't. The security is there, but it isn't. The love is real, but it isn't And I just live in that kind of limbo All the time, a double message You want to know something? The Galatians had received And fallen prey to a double message They had been wonderfully saved They had received the Holy Spirit of God As indicated in chapter 3 of our study You could see the work of the Spirit Beginning to work through them As God was demonstrating through their lives As he transformed them With love and patience And joy and peace The internal work of the Spirit had begun in these people, and it was characterized by freedom and joy. And then the Judaizers came along and said this, Praise the Lord, you're saved. I'm wonderful. I'm really glad that that happened. It's wonderful. Isn't God good? That's just great. Ah, yes. But now that you're in, now that you have passed the salvation test, and you know it's all by faith, and that's all what we say, what you need to know, dear friend, is that now that you're in, Here are some rules that you need to keep, and here are some little rituals that you need to observe. You see, if you really want to be a Christian, of course you have to be circumcised. See, if you really want to be a Christian, of course you have to join the church. If you really want to be a Christian, of course you know you have to give a little bit more money. You have to get a little bit more involved. If you're really a Christian, you need to do this external thing that will prove to everyone else around you that you really are in. You've got to come not only to the morning service, but the evening service and something else as well. Something wrong with going to the morning service and the evening service and something else as well, nothing is wrong with that. Something wrong with being involved in church, nothing is wrong with that. Something wrong with giving your money, absolutely nothing is wrong with that. Something wrong with joining the church, absolutely nothing wrong with that. Something wrong with being circumcised, nothing is wrong with that. Unless, unless that activity that you do is done because you think that somehow by doing it, You can get God to like you more, to love you more, to be accepted more, to be a really good Christian. I'll do this external thing. And you know what? The result of that kind of thinking is what I call a double message. The double message is this. The Christian life, dear friend, is lived by faith. It is lived by the Holy Spirit of God coming into you, taking his residence in you and beginning to express himself out. But really, you live by the law. The Christian life, the double message is this. The Christian life is a life of God's gracious giving, and the Holy Spirit's empowering, but the real truth is this. It's up to you, buddy. It's up to you. And so we'll talk about grace, and we'll talk about faith, and we'll talk about the Holy Spirit of God in you, moving through you, producing freedom, and producing holiness as well. The bottom line, though, is all those things really mean it's up to you. You've got to do it. Work real hard. Have you ever experienced that double thing? you feel set free maybe when you first got saved you felt excited you feel full of jesus i even think that some of you could illustrate it with a worship service there are times when i'm sitting here we begin to sing praise songs and my heart just gets so lifted and i see jesus clear i just see him clear and i think man alive all the things i'm worried about and the things i'm consumed in are just trivial things they're external things that i have allowed myself to get bogged down in and my freedom is gone. I see Jesus real clear sometimes and I feel real sensitive to him and I feel real free and real alive. But then there's that double message that comes flying right behind you. We'll talk of grace and faith and spirit, but the truth is you better do it right. It's not up to the spirit at all. It's up to you, Dave. It's up to you. The result is this. Whether or not you're able to filter through all that stuff, the result in our living is this, that while you know you're a Christian, and there's nothing in the world that could maybe convince you otherwise, while you know you're a Christian, in your life there is no joy. There is no joy. Paul's biggest concern from them was what happened to that sense of blessing you had? There is no joy. There is no life. There is no freedom. There is no victory. Even though you seek after it with tears and try as hard as you can to be a good Christian, you just work so hard. And you begin to think, something's missing. Something's off. Is this all there is? Some of you are just scared to death to even ask that question, so you just keep on striving and keep on working. You kind of fade back into the woodwork hoping nobody will notice, living a totally defeated Christian life. Maybe somewhere in the back of your mind you think, is this thing real? Maybe this whole thing is just a bunch of phony stuff. Scared to death to ask that. Others of you do begin to ask the question. And into that Paul says this. into that double message, Paul says this. Listen, friend, it was for freedom that Christ set you free. Keep standing firm in freedom. Don't you buy the double message. Get on one track. You can't have it both ways. It is either spirit or it is flesh. It is either law or it is grace. It is either external control, getting people to do things you want them to do, or it is internal control, the Spirit of God getting me to do what He wants me to do. You can't have both. And if you mix them at all, it's over. It's over. In fact, Paul says more than I would say. Well, I'm going to say what Paul said. So I agree with him. If you try to mix law and grace, if you come at people with this double message, oh yes, it's spirit, but it's really you. If you come at people with this double message, you have not just confused the gospel. Listen, you have destroyed the gospel. It is no longer the gospel. He starts off the whole study with that in chapter 1. Chapter 1, he said this, I'm amazed that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel. This double message may sound just like Christianity, but it isn't. Chapter 5, verses 2 through 6 says this, If you start living in this double message, Christ is of no benefit to you. You're under obligation to keep the whole law. You're severed from Christ. You've fallen from grace. Pretty heavy stuff. This is an important issue. I feel in many ways that the Apostle Paul in the first four chapters has led us to this. He has set us up for this. Everything he has said thus far is kind of building a platform from which he can say this with clarity. We are moving into the final section. And I believe this section for some of you will be the most liberating if we grasp it, if the Spirit of God can teach us, and I believe he can if our hearts are open, some of the most liberating, powerful, joyful things that we could possibly learn. A new section. Three things I want you to see very quickly. The first thing I want you to see, and this is just basically an introduction. In fact, in many ways, I feel like the sermon is an introduction to this whole last section, in chapters 5 and 6. The first thing I want you to see is this. What is the issue that Paul is speaking to when he starts talking about freedom and keeps standing firm in freedom? Up to this point in our study, the issue Paul has been dealing with is that salvation is by grace through faith alone. Okay, we've gotten that for six months, seven months, however long we've been in Galatians. Salvation is by grace through faith alone. You cannot earn it. You cannot deserve it. You cannot accomplish it in the flesh. It is a work of the what? The spirit. That is all. Any adding of the flesh, any adding of your works to that process will negate it. I accept it. I receive it. The spirit of God takes his residence in me. And I move into being a newborn person. No one would argue with that, would they? No one would argue with that. But now, Paul uses that platform of establishing salvation by grace through faith alone to take another step into an arena where people might disagree. and certainly they misunderstand. He says this, Dearly beloved, the way you came. The way you came was what? It was faith, it was spirit, it was freedom. That is how you have to live. That is how you have to live. Chapter 5 says this, It was for freedom that Christ has set us free. That's how you came. Keep standing firm in your freedom. That's how you're going to have to live. Chapter 3, verses 2 and 3, he says the same thing. Friend, this is the only thing I want to know about you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Lord or by hearing with faith? Answer that. Answer that. When you came to Christ, what was it? Was it your own striving and your own working? No. The Spirit of God blasted you. You received Jesus Christ. There was a sense of freedom and joy. Are you so foolish having begun by the Spirit? Are you now being perfected by the flesh? That's the double message right there. They were involved in it. They had received the Spirit by faith and now they were working like crazy to be perfected, to receive their sanctification with their own effort. Paul says, guess what? Never work. Guess what? This explains just exactly why you're so frustrated. This explains why maybe some of you are right on a threshold of taking the whole Christianity thing and saying it doesn't work. The question that always comes whenever we talk about freedom, whenever we talk about it not being up to you, the question that comes is this this freedom from the law is great because what that means is I can just leave here and do whatever I feel like doing I can just do whatever I want it's wonderful I'm free Pastor Dave said I was free and I can just do any little thing I want to do and I can just sin and just get involved in all sorts of garbage that isn't free that isn't true that isn't true we are not set free to ignore God's moral law God's moral law Do not ever mistake this. God's moral law is still the standard. That is not even what we're talking about. The law that we're speaking of is the law that we would use to try to get me to be holy. God's moral law is still the standard. Love one another. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul and mind, and love your neighbor as yourself. That moral standard is the standard that we would move to. The question is not, do I keep God's moral law or not? The question is this. What is it, what is the dynamic in someone's life that would move him into obedience to God's moral law? What is the dynamic in someone's life that would really produce holy, godly living? There's two answers to that question. One is put him in prison. Put him under the law, okay? I can get people to behave a certain way by putting him in prison. Put walls around him, give him rules to follow, tell him what to do, what not to do, how to act, how not to act, what to care about, what not to care about, Put him in prison. Put little walls around him. And I can get him to act just exactly the way I want him to act. Put him in prison. That's one way. That's called external control. That's external control. There's another way. It's a bizarre way. It's God's idea and it's really great. But it's very, very hard to grasp sometimes. And many of us, even having come to know Jesus as our Savior, reject it. It's this. The other way to get people to live a holy life is to set them free. to set him free. But before you set him free, you see, if I set someone free who hasn't ever been changed inside, I'm just going to have anarchy. He's going to go off and do whatever he wants to do and it won't be anything about the Spirit of God. What I'm going to do first, Jesus says, before the foundation of the world, is I'm going to take these people and I'm going to make them brand new people. I'm going to make them a brand new creature in Christ. I'm going to give that guy a new heart. I'm going to implant the Holy Spirit of God in him and then I'm going to set him free. Think on that. Think on that. How do I get people to live holy lives? Put him in prison, that's one way. Keep the rules there. Keep all the little boundaries there. The other way is implant in him the Holy Spirit. Give him a new heart. Give him a new life. Make him a new creature in Christ and set him free. Do you think, do you think that someone in whom the Spirit of God is dwelling is just going to go off and do whatever he just feels like doing just any old thing? I don't believe it. Unless the Spirit of God isn't in them. And the problem for us, beloved, is that most people, quite frankly, most churches, do not function that way. Most of the time, we are not committed to setting people free. We are committed to putting them in prison. Because we're so scared that if we set people free, they're just going to go off and run amok. And so we tell them the rules, and we tell them how to act, and we tell them what to care about and what not to care about, and we tell them when to do it and when not to do it. And we put them under a legalistic bondage, and we just put them back in prison. You see, basically, there's two reasons why we do that. One is I don't think we really trust the Spirit. I don't really think we trust the Spirit enough to really believe that He's at work in you. Paul said, it's God who's at work in you. It's God who's at work in you, both to will and to work to His good pleasure. I am confident of this very thing, Philippians 1, that he who began a good work in you will continue it. I have no confidence that God is going to continue a good work in you if you're an Ishmael, if you're a natural born son of God, if the Spirit of God is not in you. I have no confidence that anything holy is going to come from your life. I have every confidence that if the Spirit of God is in your life, having set you free, it will lead to holiness. Absolutely, I've got to believe that. But we take people and we put them back in prison and Paul said, Don't you dare do that. If you do that, you have defiled the gospel. It is no longer the gospel. It is no longer good news. We don't trust the Spirit, so we put people back in prison. There's also another reason that we put people back in prison and don't really set them free. And it leads me to the second factor that I want you to know. The first factor I want you to know is what the issue he's speaking to is. The issue is this, that the way you came to Jesus is the way you have to live. It's got to be free. It's got to be the Spirit of God. It can't be your fleshly working. The second dimension that I want you to know is this. I want you to know who he is speaking to. Who he is speaking to. This is vital. He is speaking only to Isaacs from here on in for the rest of our study. He is only speaking. And by the way, if you haven't been here for the last several weeks, I'm using these little buzzwords, aren't I? Isaacs and Ishmaels and things like that. I don't have time to preach those whole sermons again. And Isaac is someone who is supernaturally born by the Spirit of God. It's called reborn. A new creature in Christ. And Ishmael is someone who is naturally born. Talks like a Christian, walks like a Christian, joined the church, has been in alliance all their life, maybe been on the board, probably taught Sunday school, but they are naturally born illegitimate sons of Abraham. There never was the implanting of the Spirit. It's always been their own little thing. So when I use those two words, you'll know what I'm talking about. Who he is speaking to here are only people in whom the Spirit of God has been implanted. Supernaturally born. Beloved Ishmaels, I don't care how religious they are and spiritual they sound, Ishmaels are absolutely incapable of the freedom we are speaking of for the next six months. Absolutely incapable of it. They are absolutely incapable of having freedom produce holiness. For an Ishmael, freedom will produce godlessness every time. Every time. You set an Ishmael free, and he's going to run amok. Guaranteed. Why? There's nothing else to control him. If you don't have an external control on him, what do you have? Nothing. Nothing. Ishmaels get terrified when you start talking about setting people free. Why? Doesn't it make sense? I think you already know. If you set people free, they're going to run amok. Well, the Ishmael wouldn't even understand that there could be another control because they don't have one. No internal control. No internal control. No presence of the Holy Spirit. The third thing I want you to know, I want you to know who he's speaking to. And again, I'm going to bring that up for the next six months as we go through this. Everything we're speaking of from here on in is the work of the Spirit, internal control. Ishmael's are just going to, what is this? Third thing is this. Every dimension of life that we are speaking of from here on in is a work of the Spirit. I guess I said that already, but I just want you to get it in your notes. Every dimension of life we are speaking of from here on in, everything is a work of the Spirit, internally indwelling the life of a true Isaac. for you Isaacs I believe this time is going to be a time of liberation I trust it will a couple of weeks ago when we were speaking of this Ishmael and Isaac mentality and the fact that even in our church there are those who are naturally born sons of Abraham illegitimate not truly born of God and there are those who are true born of God truly supernaturally born of God and that these people are always going to be at each other's throats and that unity can never be there because what righteousness, what common bond does righteousness have or Christ have with Belial? None. And we waged war a couple weeks ago. We said that the time has come for the Isaacs to quit being intimidated and terrorized by the Ishmaels in our church or in the church and stand up knowing that you are the heir. You are the one who has the promise. You are the one who has the internal spirit. We waged war a couple weeks ago. You know what we're doing now? we're preparing you for war. We, for the next six months, are going to be teaching and showing and building up the Isaacs so that the Isaacs can become strong. I want you to notice the theme as we go through this. The theme is this. Your striving did not bring salvation. Your striving did not bring salvation. Your striving will not bring sanctification. Okay? Your striving did not bring salvation. Your striving will not bring sanctification. It is a work of the Spirit. That's a buzzword, isn't it? Work of the Spirit. Control the Spirit. It goes, amen, amen. I'm going to get to that. I want to show you just the sense of this as we go through it. Chapter 5, verse 5, for we through the Spirit by faith are waiting. Chapter 5, verse 16 says this, but I say to you, walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. It doesn't say try hard not to work, not try hard, not to carry out the desire of the flesh. It says you walk by the Spirit, and you won't. Verse 18, but if you are led by the Spirit, you are no longer under the law, or you are no longer in prison. You don't need the rules. You don't need the external control. You've got an internal control, unless you're an Ishmael. Verse 25, if we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. And all God's people said, amen. A lot of other God's people said, what does that mean? What does that mean? Another double message. Walk by the Spirit. Really means it's up to you. But I'll say walk by the Spirit. And everybody will go, Amen. Be controlled by the Spirit. And everybody will go, that's right. Preach it. But everybody knows it's up to you. It's up to you. Is it just another double message? I hope not. No, it isn't. we're going to be dealing with this over the next several weeks and I hope it's going to come clear I am even in the state myself of exploring and understanding things that I've never seen before and you're going to have to be patient with me as the Spirit of God even teaches me some of the wonder of our freedom in Christ and so you have to forgive if the words don't all work but you open your heart as we keep going through this let's start with this let's just start with this control of the spirit spirit control has to do with internal transformation okay the spirit's control has to do with internal transformation laws rules flesh have to do with external pressure both of them are designed to produce the same thing okay the laws the rules everybody coming down hard on everybody is designed to produce holy living everybody's got a good motive right the most legalistic church you can possibly imagine has a good motive that's holy living that's what they want. They have opted for external control, though. If I can make them feel guilty enough, I can get them to do what I want them to do. Internal transformation requires a work of the Spirit that produces holy living. When a person is shot full of the Holy Spirit, wrapped around in Christ, he is set free from that prison. He is set free from that prison. He is set free from the law. He is set free from rules. Why in the world would a person who's got the Holy Spirit within him alive. Why would he need external control? Why would he need it? To send him back to prison is a defilement of the gospel. It is an insult to him. It is a slap in the face of the Holy Spirit. Let me explain it this way. In our society, when people break the law, we put them in prison, right? Why do we do that? The reason we put people in prison is because the people who have broken the law for one reason or another do not have enough internal control to keep the law on their own. So what they need in order to keep the law, I've got to give them an external control. So what we do is we institutionalize them, okay? We put them in an institution. What does that mean? What that means is this. It means that we need to put that guy in a box that he cannot get out of so that he keeps the rules or holds to the moral law. Again, everybody wants the same thing. We want to keep holy living. We want to have the right kind of living. This guy has no internal control, So I've got to put him in prison. I've got to give him structure. I've got to give him walls. I've got to give him restrictions. I've got to dump a lot of guilt on him to keep him in line. That's exactly what the law does. It gives you external control. As a believer, having been given internal control, having been given the transforming work of the Spirit of God, what I do when I got saved is I walked out of that prison. Do you remember when you first got saved, the joy? Do you? Some of you have forgotten it, but some of you can remember it. some of you are still even living in it because you're still living free but do you remember the joy the exhilaration of knowing that you were loved and it wasn't up to you knowing that you were accepted and all you had to do was receive it by faith knowing that the spirit of God had come and taken his residence in you and you couldn't explain it but you could feel it how long has it been since you felt it and you walked out of prison a free man free to break the law right no when we think that it just betrays that we don't have any idea what we're talking about here. You're not free to break the law. You're not free to just go do whatever you want. You are free now to fulfill it. Not because somebody's pounding on your head. Not because your mommy and your daddy are on your case if you don't. Not because your pastor's yelling and screaming at you. Not because your church pressures you to. But because you got a new heart from Jesus. And you hunger and thirst for righteousness. The word of God is your meat. now if you take an isaac and you put him back into a legal system to control his behavior you have just put him back in prison you've put him back into a cell and when you do that listen when you do that you have absolutely eliminated the need for the holy spirit in your life you have absolutely eliminated the need for the holy spirit in your life you've got all this external control what do you need god for what do you need him for you've got all the rules of the church telling you how to behave? What do you need? Why would you even be prompted to seek out what it means to be led by the Spirit? Why would you even consider that? You've got all these external things telling you what to think, telling you what not to think. I could give you the testimony of Christian after Christian who describes their salvation experience in glowing terms, and then they got involved in a church. I say it just like that. It's incredible. Then I got involved in a church. And all of a sudden, it became external control. How you looked, and how you dressed, and how you talked, that's what mattered. And whether you were circumcised or not, that's what really matters. When you do that, you've eliminated the need for the Holy Spirit. You put walls up to keep your control. You have opted for external control rather than internal. And that is what it means, beloved, to put yourself under a yoke of slavery. Verse 1. By the way, in many ways, it is much easier to live in a cell than it is to make the right use of my freedom. Isn't that right? Can you sense that? It is much easier to live in a cell than it is to make the right choices with my freedom. And I believe that's another reason why a lot of Christians just prefer to live under a legalistic structure. It's easier. See? I don't ever have to learn to be sensitive to the Spirit. I just obey the rules. Just do it. I don't ever have to make decisions. I don't ever have to develop relationships. I don't ever have to discern. I don't ever have to think. I don't even ever have to pray. It's all cut and dried. It's all real clear. I don't have to learn to hear the Spirit. Someone else does all that for me. Call them a pastor or an elder board or a mother or a father, whoever it is for you. Someone else does all that praying and that deciding for me, all that discerning for me, and they tell me what I should give, how much I should give when I'm not giving enough. They tell me when I should serve, where I should serve, how much I should serve, how much is too much, how much is too little. they'll even come to my house and tell me that they'll tell me what I should be involved in and what I shouldn't be involved in it's all wonderful and we'll make these the marks of what a true Christian they'll tell me what I should do and what I shouldn't do they'll tell me what is right, what is wrong and I'll just keep following along and if they say give 10% to the Lord then I'll give 10% and if they say 12% I'll say 12% and if they say give freely even I'll just make that another law that's fine but don't call that spirit control don't call that the control of the spirit I just wait for somebody else to tell me what to think and what to do but a spirit directed Isaac how much you give how much should I give what's the law 10% right what's the law 10% 10% though somebody else preached the sermon says 10% is what you're required you have to give more than that before you're really giving so I'll have to give more than that I'll give 12% maybe they won't even know what I make it'll be net or gross a spirit directed Isaac. Do you believe that if every one of us were living in freedom, if every one of us were listening to the voice of the Holy Spirit in our lives concerning what it was that God would have us give, do you think we'd have a financial problem? I don't. I don't. And never tell you once how much to give and never tell you once what it ought to be. and never get on your case one time, but that the Holy Spirit of God would be controlling you to such an extent that He would be ministering to you exactly what it was that you need to be giving because of the need, because of the ministry, because of the vision God's given us for the future, that you would get on your knees and say, God, you use me for what you want to accomplish through the finances you've given me. And you know what? He would begin to sort out all the little things that you're spending your money on that He doesn't want you to spend your money on, that the law could never gift you to give up. some people are sure that the way you get people to give more money and do more service and get involved more is to put pressure on them you know the problem with that it works you can get people to give more money and get more involved in the church by making them feel guilty if they don't but i'll tell you this it will never be a work of god it will never be a work of god if they do it because of guilt. We don't do things because we should. We do things because the Spirit of God has induced me to do things. He has induced me and stimulated me to be moving and serving and giving. That is crazy. Everybody's going, this is nuts. If you do that, if you just start telling people become sensitive to the Spirit of God in you concerning what you give, how much you serve, how much time you allot to the sharing of your faith. If you tell people just to begin to be sensitive to the Spirit, everybody's going, well, the Spirit didn't direct me to do that, and He didn't direct me to do that, so I'm not going to give anything, and I'm not going to serve anywhere. Everything's going to come to a screeching halt. You know what? That's absolutely true. If basically what we have is a bunch of Ishmaels who the only reason they ever respond to anything is because they get pressured to do it, and we take off that pressure, I guarantee the whole thing will come to a screeching halt. And if it does because of that, praise the Lord, because we need to know that the only thing that is moving us to do anything for God is because people are putting pressure on us externally. It's not a work of God. I'd just soon know that right now. The glory of the early church, beloved, was not that they had a campaign to double in a decade. Can you imagine the apostles getting together with all those people who were so excited about the Holy Spirit and just dynamic and filled with Jesus to say, okay, I'll tell you how we'll reach Jerusalem. We'll have a poster and a plaque and it'll just double in a decade, okay? You know why you need to do that? You need to do that when people aren't being sensitive to the Spirit. They didn't have that problem. When people are full of the Spirit, when they're full of Jesus, when they can't see anything but Him, when you set people free, you can't stop them. You can't shut them up. Those early Christians couldn't be shut up. When the Spirit breaks loose, you can't contain it. So mightily grew the Word of God and it prevailed. Why? Because they had a campaign. Because they put pressure on people and made them feel guilty because they weren't doing... It doesn't work that way, folks. It doesn't work that way. When the Spirit of God begins to possess you, and when you become more and more sensitive to Him, you do not need any external pressure. You need information. You need to see where the needs are so that you can respond. And so we inform you. That's why Paul said, stand firm and don't be subject again to a yoke of slavery because if you go back to the law, you know when people are in bondage, that's when they don't work anymore. That's when they don't work anymore. That's when they don't give anymore. They give just, when they're under the law, They just give exactly what's required, no more. I want to say one more thing about the control of the Spirit. And this is just something that's going to be verified as we go through our study in Galatians. The control of the Spirit means more than just restraint. Don't you think of it that way? Very often I think, well, if the Spirit is in control of my life, I won't produce the works of the flesh. I won't fulfill the desire of the flesh. And that's a biblical principle. But I want you to expand your thinking on what it means to be controlled by the Spirit of God. It means more than restraining me. I've got this idea that, again, it means like this. I see a pretty girl walk by, and I start looking at her, and the Holy Spirit goes, okay, that's what he does. He restrains me. He holds me in. You know, he keeps me from doing it. When I see food I shouldn't eat, I start salivating, and he dries it up. It's wonderful. When I'm under the control of the Spirit, he pulls me back. He holds me back. That is a biblical concept, but again, I want to expand that right here. When I am under the control of the Spirit, it is more than restraint. He sets me free and the Spirit of God begins to prompt me to see things I never saw before. To believe Him for things that are not seen. To walk in faith. He begins to prompt me to give when I can't afford to give. He prompts me to go when no one else is going and serve when no one else is serving and serve sometimes when the people you're serving don't even want to be served. We hear stories about great men and women of faith who accomplish great deeds. And I think those are encouraging and we need to hear them. But what we generally do, because we don't understand this very often, living in freedom, what we do then is when we hear of some great thing that was accomplished through some man or some woman of faith, we bring that accomplishment to the people and say, Now, commit yourself again and do the same thing. You ought to be doing what they're doing. You should be doing what they're doing. You ought to be like them. do what they did that's not what we need what we need is to be so consumed in Christ and so free from all the external pressure to do this or that that you can begin for the first time in your life maybe for the first time in your life begin to listen to that internal spirit that God has planted in you Isaac and begin to do the things that he is leading you to do and I guarantee you're going to begin to do the powerful things that those great men and women of God who were being prompted by the Holy Spirit did you'll do it not because you should not because somebody's putting pressure on you to do it, not because you're trying to be like George or be like Bill or be like Mary, but because God in you began to prompt you to do his work. Any other work is useless, weak and worthless. Finally, what if you never come to a point where you break loose to a spirit life? Verses 2 through 4 tells us what will happen. Verses 2 through 4 tells us to the believer, He is speaking here to Isaacs. What will happen if you never break through to a spirit life and the only reason you ever do anything is because somebody is making you do it? Here's what will happen. First of all, Christ will be of no benefit to you. What does that mean? That means you lose your salvation, right? No, it doesn't mean that at all. Not here. We're talking to believers. Listen, behold, I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, basically what that, what's the promise of circumcision? The promise of circumcision is this. If you get circumcised, you'll be okay. Okay? If you get circumcised, you'll be okay. What are some of the things we have today? If you go into the evening service and the morning service, you'll be okay. If you give a little bit more money, you'll be okay. If you wear a smile on your face and look a certain way, you'll be okay. If you buy that, Christ is of no benefit to you. Does that mean you're not redeemed? No. It means that in your living, beloved, in your living, if everything you're doing is because you're being pressured to do it from the outside rather than the Spirit leading you to do it, then there is no reason you even need Christ. You don't need Him. He's of no benefit to you. There is no work of Christ in you because everything you're doing is because somebody else wants you to do it, not because the Spirit's getting you to do it. You don't need Him. Christ is of no benefit to you. You're doing it because you're getting pressured and you want to prove you're spiritual. My heart breaks for so many Christians. I see them all the time. And my own heart is torn by this as well because there's a lot of things in me that are performance oriented. I even wonder if part of the struggle I had with this sermon was it's so important to me to preach good sermons because then you'll like me boy oh boy the Spirit doesn't bless that but my heart goes out to so many I see them so burnt out and the reason is they're not doing anything no they're working like crazy they're doing everything that they can possibly do but everything they're doing is so that maybe if I do this other thing if I work a little bit harder I'll feel okay they've never stopped their striving long enough to just even hear if God is speaking to them. To even know if God is leading them to do those things or not. They're involved in everything. But they've never stopped to say, God, is this something you really want me to do? Is this something you're really leading me to do? You just say yes to everything. It is only a spirit-controlled person who can say no. Do you know that? What a weird sermon. Pastors are up there telling people how to say no to stuff. You bet. I want you to say no. I want you to stop doing things that you're doing in the flesh in order to get people to know you're okay or getting your own self to feel you're okay. Because for one thing, it's not a work of the Spirit, so we don't need it. You ever feel in the midst of all your frantic doing, that Christ is of no benefit to you? Here I am, a Christian, and I'm doing all this stuff. And what good is it doing to me? I feel like Christ is of no benefit to me. I just don't experience His presence at all. maybe the reason that's happening is a gift from God if you feel in your life that Christ is of no benefit to you that it's just not you don't feel that joy you don't feel that freedom maybe it's because you went back to prison maybe it's because you went back to prison maybe you need to cease striving the second thing you become the debtor to the whole law you become debtor to the whole law he says I testify means this I protest I protest again to every man who receives circumcision gets involved in external control rather than internal. That you, when you do that, you are under obligation to the whole law. Have you ever felt under obligation to the whole law? No, I never have. I don't even know what it means. I don't even know what that refers to. I'll tell you what it means. When you feel like this, have you ever gotten involved in doing all sorts of things but no matter what you do, it's not enough. No matter how much you care, it's not enough. No matter where you go, you didn't go to the right place. No matter how much you say, you didn't say enough. You're never feeling peace. you're never feeling rest. You're never feeling joy. Would you take that lack of rest and would you take that lack of peace and that lack of joy and take it like a gift from God, a little note from Jesus that says to you, dear friend, it may be the reason you're not feeling any rest or any peace is because you're not living in freedom. The Spirit of God isn't the one prompting you to do all this stuff. Would you ever have the courage to stop all your activity and hear the Spirit's voice and no one else's. You've fallen from grace. Debted to the whole law simply means it'll never be enough. If you're going on external things, you'll never find enough external things to do. You'll never will. You'll never have peace. You'll never be okay with yourself. Falling from grace, again, does not mean lose salvation. It could. I don't have time to tear that all apart. For a Christian to fall from grace, what does that mean? It simply means that you can fall away from the experience of feeling God's experience in God's favor. Grace simply means that. God's free favor in my behalf. Question, in salvation, how did I get salvation? It was faith. It was belief. It says this, And God is able to make all grace abound toward you. Super abundant grace. That, beloved, is experiential grace. You will experience the favor of God. You'll feel it in your gut. You'll feel it in your heart. You'll feel free. What is it that produces that kind of freedom, that kind of joyous blessing from God? Let's move up a couple verses. Let each one of you, verse 7, do just as he has purposed in his heart to do, not grudgingly nor of compulsion. Don't do what you do because you should. That's a should verse right there. You don't do what you do because you have to, because you're compelled to do it, if somebody made you feel guilty to do it. For God loves a what? Cheerful giver. How do you give? And this could be service or anything. And God, I'm sorry, for God loves a cheerful giver, not grudgingly nor under compulsion. Then, verse 8, God is able to make all grace abound toward you. When you do it because the Spirit of God is inducing you to do it, that is where the grace comes. The fact is that you can be saved and never experience grace. Live in a prison all your life. never grow in grace peter said over and over grow in grace grow in grace so that more and more as you live your life all you do is the spirits prompting you not the law's pressure one final note to answer the critics who say if you set free p if you set people free like that they won't work it's not true if they're an ishmael that's true but if they have the spirit of god in them it's not true. We'll blow the doors off this place when people begin to be sensitive to the Spirit and do what the Spirit's prompting you to do. Because I, well, here's the verse. After he tells them the symptoms of their life if they're living in prison, he says, but we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, all those little external things you do to try to prove you're okay mean nothing. Here's what matters? Faith. Working through love. Beloved, faith that is sensitive to the Spirit always works. It will work. It will work. You were running well. What stopped them from running? Somebody set them free. When they were free, they were running and you couldn't stop them. Somebody came along and put them back in bondage. Then they stopped running. They might have been doing a lot of activity. They might have been doing a lot of churchy stuff. But none of it was the Spirit of God. Jesus speaks to the church in Revelation as he says over and over to each one of them, I see your deeds. I see your deeds. You're doing all sorts of stuff. I just don't see the Spirit. I just don't see the Spirit. Internal control, external control. It was for freedom Christ set you free. Keep standing firm. this is going to develop even over the next few weeks and pray with us that God will teach us more and more about what this means Thank you.
