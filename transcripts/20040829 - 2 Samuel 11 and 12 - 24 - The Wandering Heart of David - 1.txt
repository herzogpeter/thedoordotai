Hmm. A song of hallelujah that sounded kind of haunting. That song was a little disturbing. Supposed to be. Very fitting for where we're going this morning on the journey of the heart of journey that we have been on, as most of you know, for almost a year using the life of David as our guide for this journey. We come to a place this morning that is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is disturbing, quite confusing, that I would just as soon avoid, to tell you the truth. But having chosen a real-life human being with real-life flaws as our guide for this journey of the heart, that guide being David and his life, And seeing as the scriptures, which is our source for this story, never seems to hide or gloss over the flaws of the people it speaks of, not even its heroes of faith, we are dealing today with the story of David and Bathsheba, with what I was originally going to call the wandering heart of David. But having gotten into the story in a bit more detail this week, more accurate would be the adulterous, murderous, self-absorbed, deceiving heart of David. But we couldn't fit that title on the tape. Part of the impact of this word this week is that it is a far cry from what we spoke of last week as we visited and looked at the dancing heart of David who danced before the Lord with all of his might in the story behind the dance was he had a deep desire to have the presence and the power and the promises of God be central in his life and in the life of his people. So he danced before the Lord with all his might and now we're visiting a place that couldn't be further from that which raises for me a boatload of questions. Chief among those questions is this. What on earth has happened to David's heart? This heart that we've been examining for almost a year and seen it to be a good heart, a bold heart, a courageous heart, a worshiping, faith-filled, God-centered, praying heart. What happened to his heart? Second question, right on the heels of the first. Actually, it's a bigger question than the first. The second question is this. Could what happened to David's heart happen to my heart? could happen to your heart don't answer too quickly see reflexively I want to say no it couldn't happen to me it couldn't happen to you you have a good heart so do I we have pure hearts true hearts but even with a little honest reflection that response couldn't happen to me feels arrogant maybe even dangerous to think it couldn't happen to me couldn't happen to you actually the apostle Paul warns of that very thing in the book of 1st Corinthians when he says let him who thinks he stands let him who thinks it couldn't happen to him take heed lest in that false confidence you fall so so it seems like maybe one way to fall into this kind of sin is to blindly think you can't just to arrogantly think you won't but with with that reality there comes this charge of fear. I mean, could it be that I am on a path toward the very kind of thing that David is moving toward in this story or gets involved in in this story? Could I be on that same kind of path and not know it? Could I be on that kind of path and not see it? I mean, I love my wife. I'm open to God. But so was David, open to God, or so we thought. Maybe that's the answer. Maybe this whole thing we've been studying about his heart, maybe this whole thing's a sham. Maybe it was all pretend. He's just like everybody else who ever spoke of faith or looked a certain way. He really wasn't that way. It's all a bunch of garbage. Which is often the assessment we make, the answer we come up with when people we know and maybe respected stumble into some grievous kind of thing. Ah, a bunch of phonies. None of it was real. Liars all along, not even a good part of their heart was real. Well, if David was a phony this whole time, a pretender from the beginning, that would certainly explain what we're going to look at today. But I'm afraid the answers to what goes on in David's life are going to be a little more complicated than that. I mean, it might make us feel better if we just decide they're a phony and write them off. But I think the answers, the real answers, a little more complex and confusing than that. See, we've been with David for almost a year now, examining his life. And what's clearest to us about him so far is this. He really had a good heart. Referred to in Scripture over and over as being a man after God's own hearts. Indeed, it will ultimately be his heart as we continue on through the story. We're not going to get to this part today. But as we continue on through the story, it will ultimately be his heart that saves him and calls him back. When in brokenness and humility, he authentically and deeply repents. But all of that, even after his repentance, we are still left with this question that haunts. Really two questions. What happened in this season of David's life to his heart? Second question, could what happened to David's heart happen to mine? Could it happen to yours? Were there warning signs along the way that David ignored that we dare not? Were there little things that seemed like harmless things that soon became very big things? Well, just looking at the text, I don't know. But I've kind of plunged myself all week long in wanting to find out, and I need you to know, and I don't mind telling you, this story is very personal to me as a husband, as a father, as a pastor. I want to know if there are warning signs. I would like to know if I'm on some path and not aware of it right now, leading me to where David went. I think we're supposed to spend some time in this story. And for those of you who pray of such things, as we're going through certain series, and I know numbers of you do, particularly the Sentinels, the Sentinel Prayer Ministry, I want you to pray as we enter into this, what is going to be, I think, a series of sermons around this issue of David and this season of his life, that in this series we don't miss anything, that needs to be noticed, that we don't miss anything that needs to be seen. The story begins in 2 Samuel 11, verse 1. If you have your Bibles open to that portion of Scripture, 2 Samuel 11, verse 1, as you're doing that, let me set the scene. David's kingdom by this time is well established. He is no longer a young man, but neither is he old. Most of the scholars that I read put him around 50 years old, and yes, that gets my attention. Told you this feels personal to me. His enemies, for the most part, have been vanquished. He has still some enemies, but he's passed that season in his life when he's running for his life in caves, trying to get away from Saul. That's all passed. He's got some enemies, but for the most part, they've been vanquished. His people, for the most part, are united, but he gets emails once in a while. He is, by all accounts, successful. Then it happened. 2 Samuel 11, verse 1. I want to read through verse 5 to just kind of get us into the story. But as I read these first five verses, I want you to do some work. I want you to watch, just as I read, for any warning signs, any little things that may seem like harmless things. I wonder if it could turn into a big thing. Reading in verse 1. Then it happened in the spring. At the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab and his servants with him in all Israel. And they destroyed the sons of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Now when evening came, David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king's house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing. And the woman was very beautiful in appearance. So David sent and inquired about the woman and the daughter. And one said, is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? And David sent messengers and took her. And when she came to him, he lay with her. And when she had purified herself from her uncleanness, she returned to her house. And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David and said, I am pregnant. Stop right there. That gets us into the story enough for now. Did you notice anything? Any warning signs along the way? Well, I saw one in the first verse. Maybe you did too. in the spring when kings go out to battle, David didn't. I think it's significant. It may not be a big thing. It might even be a reasonable thing. It might be something for which David has a perfectly logical explanation. After all, he's the king. He's got the king's business. There might be perfectly logical reasons for him to not go off to war, but it's a noticeable thing. It's an odd thing in the spring. And what's implied by that is this. when it's time to get back to business, when it's time to re-engage and enter into the battle, whatever the battle for you might be, when it's time to re-engage in that, David didn't re-engage. Please note and just kind of try to keep this in the realm of real life and the flow of life. They weren't in battle all the time. No one can be. Whether it's a physical battle like David is waging or a spiritual battle or just the battle for your marriage or your life or your heart. The battle and the heat of it can't rage all the time. Ecclesiastes says, there is a time, there is a season for every purpose under heaven. There is a time to mourn. There is a time to dance. It's not always time to dance, but there is a time, it's not always time to mourn. But there is a time to throw stones to gather them up again. There is a time for war. There is a time for peace, a time for rest. There's also a time to refrain from resting, to get back to work, to re-engage in this story, first verse. This was clearly a time to go to battle, and David didn't. I think it's a warning sign. A little thing that may seem on the surface like a harmless thing. I wonder, is that part of what turned into a big thing? Eugene Peterson, in the book we've been referencing from time to time called Leap Over a Wall, that is about David's life, says this. David by now is well established as king and he doesn't need to prove himself in battle anymore. And besides, there aren't any important wars being fought right now. But in his withdrawal from frontline participation with his people in the battle for their lives, stop right there, because that's his job description as a king. From his frontline participation with his people in the battle for their lives, In his withdrawal from that, we see a shadow withdrawing from a page. Did something leave? I'm not sure. It doesn't seem like a big thing. And Peterson says that. Not that big a deal all by itself. But it raises a question. Is staying home symptomatic of an anema in David's soul? Is he pulling back from life? From the kind of life, robust and energetic prayer and daring faith in God that we've grown so used to seeing in David? well says Peterson we don't have to wait long for the answer to that question because we see what he did with Bathsheba and then things that followed that as well but before we get to that answer I want you to ask yourself a question trying to make this as painfully practical as possible can you tell when you've withdrawn Can you tell when, even before anybody else can notice, inside something turns off, when you've withdrawn from the battle, can you tell when you've withdrawn from people, from your marriage, from the journey, from your pursuit of God? Again, often it's an inside thing before anybody sees it, something just goes click. I'm checking out. I'm checking out. The reason I ask you that question is because I can tell. I can tell when I've withdrawn. let me ask you another question who do you tell that to do you have anybody that you tell that to like you know I'm a little bit afraid because I can just tell inside I'm checking out I'm withdrawing it I don't know how to re-engage right now who knows you well enough who knows you well enough to notice when you've withdrawn from your marriage or your life granted keep this in balance it really needs to be there are times when we need to withdraw. You can't be swinging the sword all the time. You just can't. There are times we need to rest, but I'm not talking about those times this morning. I'm talking about the spring when kings go off to war and you've withdrawn. Clearly, in my mind, this is the first warning sign that something has shifted in David's heart. We don't know why it's shifted. We can speculate. I mean, is he tired? Is he afraid? He's been doing battle for a long time. He's 50. Maybe he wonders if he can still do it. Is he complacent? Is he resting on his laurels? Has he become arrogant? I don't need to do this anymore. We don't know why this thing has shifted. And what we do know is this, verse 2. When evening came, David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of his house. I may be making too much out of this and looking too hard for clues, but I noticed that when evening came, he rose from his bed. Was he taking a nap? This is late afternoon, not evening. This is late afternoon. Was he sleeping all day? Sounds like my kids. He began to walk around on his house. I do think I'm right in this. There's something restless in David right now. He's not engaged in what he was supposed to be engaged in at this time. He's kind of withdrawn. He's sleeping all day or he can't sleep at all. There's a restlessness. He's looking for something to do. There's something lazy here. Rest of verse 2. And in that place in his life, from the roof, he saw a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful in appearance. Just note, right here, nothing has gone, he hasn't done anything wrong here. And neither has Bathsheba. He wasn't looking for her. He just noticed her. There's no sin in that. He's alive, so he noticed. So, good, there you go. Good for you. Verse 3, all that changes. All that changes. Because David sent and inquired about the woman. Well, guess what? Now he's engaged, isn't he? And he was quickly informed, this is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah. please note that that information is more than the facts. This is Bathsheba. No, this is emotionally charged information, as if to say, David, here's the truth about this woman you inquired about. You need to know she is not just a pretty face. She is somebody's daughter. What that information is designed to do is personalize her. As long as you don't personalize the person, she's a piece of flesh, I can kind of do whatever I want. We're not going to allow that, David. I'm going to tell you who she is. She is somebody's daughter. In fact, we know who? Eliam's. Not only that, she is somebody's wife, Uriah's. And by the way, she's somebody's wife, not yours. Sorry. David is getting here a gift. David is getting here what would normally be a very effective warning sign. Looking for warning signs? Here's one. Indeed, it's more than a sign. When David hears, she's somebody's daughter, she's somebody's wife, bells are ringing, lights are flashing. The yellow lights that was kind of going on when he glanced at her and inquired of her has just turned to red. But it doesn't matter to David. David runs the red lights. But one of the things I want you to know about David running this red light is this. He could never, ever say he didn't know that that light was red. As soon as he got the information, this is a real-life person, not just a pretty face. She has a name. She's somebody's daughter. She's somebody's wife. That was a red light. David ran it, and he knew he ran it, which, by the way, always happens with this kind of sin. You just can't get to where David is going, hear me, without running some red lights. so let me ask you another one of these irritating invasive questions are you running any red lights I mean right now I mean in your real life are you ignoring bells that are ringing and lights that are flashing see if you are running red lights you know that you're running them see there are certain places of life and debates about morality and right behavior and wrong behavior that are gray areas and we can sit around a philosophy oh I don't know it's kind of a gray area not this one there is nothing subtle there is nothing cloudy we're not dealing with a gray area here Bathsheba is Eliam's daughter Uriah's wife David knew that warning lights were flashing warning bells were ringing He did it anyway. He didn't care. I'm going to do what I want to do. Which raises again this question for me as I get a little bit deeper into what David's sin is. David's sin is adultery. It's so much more than adultery. There's the spirit in David. It makes me whatever happened to this guy's heart. That's my question again. I thought we knew this guy. It touches on the other question as well. could what is happening here to David's heart happen to mine? Could it happen to yours? What kind of weeds have grown in the soil of his heart to kind of choke out other aspects of his character that we've seen so clearly in the past? And another question, how long do you think it took for those weeds to grow? Well, the fact is, again, we don't know for sure. It's not spelled out for us in the text. But I think we can speculate a little bit in a fairly accurate way based on what we know about David, based on what we know about sin and how it works. One of the reasons I want to spend some weeks in this is I want to talk about sin and how it works. Based on what we know about human personality and behavior and psychology, I think we can develop some theories here. For example, I do not believe for one minute that this thing with Bathsheba is primarily about sex. Sex is obviously involved, but I do not believe that sex is what's primarily driving this behavior. In fact, I called a psychologist friend of mine this week, and I kind of ran my... Again, I tell you, Jim, I think I'm going to say that this isn't primarily about sex. And he says, Dave, he says adultery is hardly ever about sex. It says adultery involves sex almost all the time. All the time. But that's not usually what's driving it. There's all sorts of other things that are driving this thing. I believe that this is primarily about power with David. And what will turn into a more and more obvious misuse of power as he tries desperately to cover up his sin. And this misuse of power, and that's even still, I want to go underneath that because this power thing is being fueled by what I would call a narcissistic sense of entitlement. Now before I go into this narcissistic sense of entitlement that is fueling this whole scene, in my opinion, I want to say this. That you don't have to be a king to have a narcissistic sense of, I deserve this. By the way, that's the spirit of what I'm talking about. I deserve this. I'm entitled to this. I know the rules, but the rules are different for me. They don't apply to me. Why? Why don't they apply to you? Why do you deserve this? The reasons vary. Now, if you are a king, the reason might be because I'm the king. It's good to be king. And because you're the king, you deserve it. I'm entitled. I'm the king. Here's why I deserve it. Because I lived in caves for years, running for my life from Saul. I did that for years. And yes, I was faithful to God. And yes, I hung on to God. And yes, God took care of me. And my character grew. But man, I've been running. I've been running. I'm tired. And I deserve this. Because I fought long and hard to build all of this kingdom, and I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of fighting. So in the spring, when kings go off to war, David didn't. I deserve this. Because my marriage is lousy, and my wife is a creep, and my husband's a mean old guy. He doesn't meet any of my needs, so I deserve this. David could have easily. We met Michael last week, no prize. So David could easily say, having met Michael last week, because my wife is a cynical, sarcastic, dried-up old hag. That's saying it nice. Because of that, I deserve it. Because I've suffered. Because I've suffered, I deserve it. Because I'm tired, I deserve it. You do not have to be a king to embrace this narcissistic spirit of entitlement, because God didn't come through for me the way I thought he would, the way in my spirit. I demanded that he do. Because he didn't come through for me, I'm going to take it for myself. I deserve it. I'm entitled to this. Beloved, once this way of thinking takes root in the human heart, regardless of the reason, no one has authority over you anymore, not even God. It will not matter what God says. It will not matter what the Bible says. You are going to do what you want to do. Because you are now God. No one has authority over you. Your best friend can't talk to you, can't correct you, can't challenge you, can't call you out. You are going to do what you want to do regardless. And you don't have to be a king to have that spirit come on you. Needless to say, this is a very, very dangerous path to be on. But some of you in this room are on it right now. I am absolutely sure of it. Not because I have some inside information. Nobody called me about you this week. It's really interesting. People do say that to me every once in a while. They'll think, did you? No, they didn't. it's more about a God thing I don't have inside information about anybody here it's just that I don't think we're all that different from David on this score our capacity beloved for willfulness and self-deception is enormous indeed if you really do what Joel talked about when he led us into worship to let yourself look at your own potential for sin, it's absolutely frightening, the capacity we have for willfulness and self-deception. It's disturbing. And if this message is disturbing you, it's supposed to. Now when you first begin to feel that swell of entitlement, and even saying it that way is how I have felt it. It's kind of a swelling. Yeah, yeah, you can fill up with this entitlement spirit. When you first begin the journey down that particular path, it doesn't feel dangerous at all, especially at the beginning. In fact, it feels good, really good. In fact, for the first time in a long time, good. I deserve this. I'm entitled. There are some marriages in this room right now that are crumbling for the presence of this spirit in your marriage. Men and women who have built a wall of entitlement around themselves because they've been wounded or hurt or disappointed. You didn't get what you want, did you? Well, it's a lot more complicated. I'm sure it's more complicated than that. But you have, I know, have built a wall of entitlement around yourself. right in the context of your marriage. And here's the deal. Once that wall is built, and you deserve it, and you're entitled, no one has authority over you. Not even God. It won't matter what the Bible says. It won't matter what God says. And I'm not even going to give you Bible verses because I know it will be of no avail. If this spirit is on you or in you, or you've embraced it, your best friend won't be able to talk to you, confront you, challenge, or correct you. and if they do they're suddenly not your friend you're going to do what you want to do regardless of what God says what people who love you say you're entitled and you are in a very dangerous place good question at this point for David might be David I know you're a king and there may not be many people that you trust I understand that but who are you allowing to speak into your life right now well again it's not spelled out for us in the text but knowing what I know and knowing what we know about this story already the answer to that I can pretty much guarantee is nobody either because no one had the courage or he just wouldn't allow anybody in. Now this is a guy who knew about relationships and intimacy and being open with people. Who did we learn about covenant relationships from? David and who? Jonathan. David knew about this stuff. David had experienced this stuff. Now he's a king and I think I can relate to the king thing in terms of who do you trust? There's so many people who want something from me. David, who can speak into your life? One day Nathan would. Nathan would probably risk his life. We're not going to get to that. I want to hold off all the repentance stuff. I want to sit in this first. Good question for you. Good question for me at this point might be. Who are you allowing to speak into your life right now? Anybody? I don't just mean who do you hang with. I mean the person who does speak into your life might be somebody you hang with. But there's a lot of people we hang with. Guys are really good at this. Having buddies. but there never goes any deeper than that. Who loves you and knows you enough to be able to look you in the eye and say, you know what, Dave? You're full of baloney. Baloney. Baloney. Yeah, that's what my friends call it. No, my friends all use the original Greek. and if they don't I don't trust them and they don't mind saying that I'm full of it and it's not to be crass for crass sake it's to penetrate the veneer it's to fight for somebody's life I'm here to save your life you're full of it and it's time to come home it's time to re-engage David needed a friend like that he didn't have one possibly he didn't want one until Nathan came again we'll get to that in weeks to come back to the story I want to touch on this power thing for just a moment earlier I said this thing is more about power and control than it is about sex let me explain just a little bit as David is moving into this with Bathsheba I think he's feeling very much in control. It's part of what's intoxicating. I mean, the sexuality piece is intoxicating, but the fact that he's kind of controlling all this stuff and sending people and bringing people and having what he wants, using his power and sense of entitlement to take what he wants, and what he wants is this. Don't tell me her name. Don't tell me. I just like her to be a thing. and he takes what he wants primarily because he can that's power friend of mine I was talking about this with a friend of mine this week and told me about an interview he had seen on 60 Minutes some time ago with President Clinton and Mike Wallace I'm not sure who was in I think it was Mike Wallace in one point in the interview talking about the Monica Lewinsky incident that was such a scandal years ago as all of you know said, you know, why? Why did you do this? It cost you so much. In your marriage, in the public eye. Why did you do this? And his response actually was quite self-disclosing, I thought, and even self-aware, more than I expected. He said this, you know, my answer isn't very pretty, it isn't very nice, but at the time, I did what I did mostly because I could. Well, that's about power. That's about using you for me. Eugene Peterson, again, draws attention to the use of the word send or sent in the text. It happens over and over again. You'll notice it in just a moment. As being a symbol of David's misuse of power and the perception he had of himself that he was in control. Peterson writes this. By following the use of this verb, send or sent, we can trace David's descent from love and obedience into calculation and cruelty. Verb by verb, we watch David remove himself from compassionate listening and personal intimacy with others to a position outside others, above others, giving orders, exercising power. It begins in verse 1. You can notice it right in the text. So David sent Joab and all his servants and all Israel to go to war. Verse 2, it picks up momentum. Then David sent to inquire about Bathsheba. Verse 4, then David sent messengers and took Bathsheba. Later, David sent word to Joab, send me Uriah the Hittite. So Joab sent Uriah to David. I am the sender. You are the sendee. When I say jump, you say how high. Still in control, still using his power to manage his world and all of the people in it and ultimately to cover his sin. He's in control. And he's using his power to be in control, and that feels really good. I don't want to be crass, but it's better than the sex. The control is the deal. The power. But there are two other little itty-bitty occurrences of that word sin that are like spitting in David's soup. That subtly prepare David for the truth. That for all his exercise of depersonalized royal power, he really wasn't nearly as in control as he thought he was. The first one comes in verse 5. Tiny little itty bitty word sent. Then Bathsheba sent word. I am pregnant. Whoa. I didn't control that. Another little itty-bitty word sent. Just one, just one. 2 Samuel 2, 12, verse 1. Then the Lord sent. David did a lot of sending. David, the Lord does one. Then the Lord sent Nathan. We're going to develop this in weeks to come, but I just want you to let something in here. God love David. God's love for us is manifested in a number of ways. One of the ways his love is manifested to me as it relates to this story occurs to me is this, that if you don't come out into the light, God, if he loves you, will expose you. He will expose you. That doesn't feel very loving. You don't understand love at all. Because David is about to lose his soul here. We haven't even begun to get into his sin yet. basically what Nathan says to David is David you're not in control and you're not God even though right now you're acting like you are a couple of thoughts before we move on it's this very unorganized sermon I suppose I hope the flow of thought is flow follow you're able to follow it but I just have these noticings that come up one is this I don't I don't think it's necessary I don't think it necessarily takes a long time for a heart to turn like this. See, generally, I believe that when people fall into sin, the truth is that they've been walking that path for quite some time. They've had to take many little steps to get to this big step, and I do believe that's true, but you can get to that place of a lot of little steps. You can get there really quick, And that's a little frightening to me. The fact is this, once you have embraced that, I deserve this spirit of entitlement. Once you have embraced that, it does not take long to start running red lights. And once you start running red lights, you are not far from a car wreck. You can start running red lights over the summer. You can start running red lights in a couple of weeks. You could do it in a few days. I was thinking about this in relationship to the things I care most about in my family and with my wife. And I was just thinking, you know, you had to fight with your wife. You had to fight with your husband. And, you know, you both, you close them off for like a half an hour or an hour. And you decide, am I going to humble myself and go and say I'm sorry or find out what's wrong? Or I'm just going to hang on to this. I deserve this. I deserve this. Just stay mad for a day. It's no big deal. It's a little thing. It's a little. It's a harmless thing. Everybody gets mad. Do it for two days. Do it a week. How about two? How about three? How about a month? You're gone. I don don't think it takes long to close somebody out. But we're saved. I don't think it takes long to close God out. Another little quick noticing. The less connected and involved you are in grace-filled, truth-speaking relationships, the more susceptible you are to this. It's a danger zone. Third, a little quick noticing. David had to run a lot of red lights to get to this. The point is that these things don't come without warning. You don't just fall off a cliff in the middle of the night. The first and most obvious red light he got was this. David, she's somebody's daughter, she's somebody's wife, not yours. The second real obvious warning sign he got was this, the one I just talked about, I'm pregnant. Now that information is an opportunity to stop. It's saying this, David, you're busted. It's time to quit running. It's time to quit hiding, quit denying, quit managing and controlling. It's time to come back home to God. You've wandered far enough away. It's time to accept the consequences, and there will be many, but it's also time in the accepting of those consequences to be healed by the amazing grace of God that always comes to people who quit hiding and pretending and managing and pretending that they're God. But David doesn't do it, thereby entering into the next level of sin's downward spiral. Think about that, just a word about sin's downward spiral. Sin always sets into motion spiritually destructive forces that you cannot control, no matter how in control you think you are. Sometimes it will be visible and undeniable like a pregnancy. Sometimes it will be invisible but still undeniable like the erosion of your soul, like the loss of integrity and innocence, like an inability to look someone in the eye. And you always looked at people in the eye. There is so much here, beloved, about the nature of sin and the insidious ways. It draws us deeper and deeper into its web, literally having the capacity to change the kind of person we are. We talk about transformation here at Open Door a lot, and as we open our heart to God and let Him in and live a life with God, partnering with Him in our life, we are becoming different kinds of people. We talk about that all the time. We need to also understand that when you begin to move down these kinds of paths, sin has the capacity to make you a different kind of person. think about it with me David as he goes deeper and deeper into his sin is becoming exactly that a different kind of person he is becoming a manipulator a pretender a liar ultimately killer doing everything in his power to not get caught to not be exposed when ironically the only hope that David has to save his soul is that he gets caught that he gets exposed and to then in brokenness turn to God come back to life and to regain his heart. But that's not going to happen for a while for David. Look at verse 6, pulling this to a close. Then David sent to Joab after he heard that Bathsheba was pregnant, send me Uriah the Hittite. So Joab sent Uriah to David. When Uriah came to him, David asked concerning the welfare of Joab and the people in the state of the war. Then David said to Uriah, go down to your house and wash your feet. In other words, just go home and relax. and Uriah went to the king's house and a present from the king was sent out after him but Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of the Lord and he did not go down to the house. David's obvious plan is he's going to go down to Bathsheba, sleep with his wife and then everyone will think when Bathsheba is pregnant and has a baby that Uriah is not his. So when he doesn't sleep at his own house, David asks him why. Verse 11, Uriah said to David, the ark in Israel and Judah are staying in temporary shelters and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house and eat and to drink and to lie with my wife by your life and by the life of your soul? I will not do such a thing. David doesn't stop. He tries to get him. Well, he does. Get him drunk. He still won't do it. This has got to be killing David. Not just because his plan isn't working, but because Uriah's nobility is a rebuke to David's duplicity. Uriah's nobility, unless David is completely dead in his spirit right now. and I don't think he is. Uriah's nobility is reminding him of his own at a different time. I used to be like this guy. Lights are flashing, bells are ringing, but David runs that red light too and seems to be accelerating as he does because he is quite literally now hell-bent on managing and controlling and covering this thing, but he won't be able to do it because the wages of sin is death. The wages of sin is death. I've always used that verse or heard of that verse in some eternal context or salvific. The wages of sin is death. No, no. The wages of sin in your everyday Sunday afternoon life is death. Because that's what sin does. It kills everything. Verse 14. Now it came about in the morning that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by way of the hand of Uriah. Uriah himself carried the letter. And it was written in the letter saying this, place Uriah in the front line of the fiercest battle, withdraw from him so that he may be struck down and die. The plan worked. Uriah was killed, thus raising the question once again, what on earth happened to David's heart? Who is this guy? And could it happen to mine? Could it happen to yours? The answer to that is yes, it could. And if that disturbs you, it's supposed to. I'm going to leave you with four questions very quickly. Let them be your work for the week. Question number one. Have you withdrawn from things that you need to be engaged in? Have you withdrawn from your marriage, from your kids, from your life, from your pursuit of God? See, it happened in the spring when kings go off to war that David didn't. It's a warning sign. Second question. Are you ignoring the bells that are ringing and the lights that are flashing? are you running any red lights? Relationally are you running red lights with some guy or some woman or man at work? Financially are you running what about the internet? For some of you your Bathsheba is the internet. Third question have you embraced the spirit of entitlement that of your sin says I deserve this. You're in danger. fourth question do you have anyone in your life have you allowed anyone in your life who knows you well enough and loves you deep enough to look you in the eye and say no more running no more pretending, no more denying it's time to confess, it's time to repent it's time to turn around it's time to come home because you still can it's time to come back to life it's time to recover your good heart. Final word. Today, if you hear his voice, don't harden your heart. Let's pray. Father, I pray that by the power of your spirit, you would land on every single thing that needs to be landed on relative to this word and our lives. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. The altar team will be here for you.
