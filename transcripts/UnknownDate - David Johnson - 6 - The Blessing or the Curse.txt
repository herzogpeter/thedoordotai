Open your Bibles with me as we continue our study in the book of Galatians, chapter 3. Picking up again in verse 6. It's been quite a while. The context is this, and we need to catch up just a little bit. But he has come into chapter 3, and he's a little bit frustrated. And he says, You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed? This is the only thing I want to find out from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith? And he goes on to appeal to their experience in Jesus to make them realize again that their walk with Christ cannot be one of following little rules and codes, but it's got to be the Spirit of God within them. And then he appeals not only to their past experience, but picking up our study in verse 6, he appeals now to what they know about their fathers, specifically Abraham. Even Abraham believed God, and that was reckoned to him as righteousness. Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham. And a scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, All the nations shall be blessed in you. So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer. And two verses I want to read following that. Verse 10. For as many as are under the works of the law are under the curse. For it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the book of the law to perform them. And verse 12. However, the law is not of faith. On the contrary, he who practices them shall live by them. There are some things that I believe we need to learn this morning. This text teaches them. But my heart is really in tune this morning with people in our church. And it isn't even specific people, but I believe that what we're going to be dealing with this morning is an issue that is very pertinent to many of us. And even the struggle I'm having in my own heart is that this is speaking volumes to my own life. Would you just join me in prayer that the Spirit of God, with power, would be able to communicate to our hearts? In some ways, Lord, I don't know where to begin. I have my notes right in front of me, but I want to rush through certain things and get to other things. And I pray just now that by your divine energy, you would give words to say that would be appropriate and keep me from saying that, which would be peripheral. I pray that we would hear from you, that your text, this precious word of God would ring clearly in our hearts. But Father, more than an intellectual understanding, something would happen in people's hearts. And we would be broken indeed. In Jesus' name, amen. I hear that song of Simon who comes to church and puts on the show and does it very well, and someone else who's sitting in the corner and is very, very quiet, and God's doing a work in his life, and his heart begins to break, and he has come to the end of himself. And Simon left a little wrinkled, and the other guy left reborn. And the guy who left reborn left reborn because he came to the end of himself. All of his delusions about his ability to attain, his ability to perform, his ability to keep the law, his ability to please God were absolutely banished. And he finally came to God and said, I need your help. He came to the end of himself. What does that mean? What does that mean? I came to the end of myself. You know, as I was flipping that phrase around in my mind a little bit, I became aware that as evangelicals, we use a lot of little phrases like that, that somehow we're supposed to understand, but sometimes we don't understand them. I grew up on those things. And if you grew up in the church, you know the same ones. I grew up hearing things like this. You need to be saved. You need to be surrendered. And everybody knows what that means, but nobody ever asks, what does that mean exactly? We're just supposed to understand. You need to be surrendered. You need to be sanctified. You need to be spirit-filled. You need to be yielded to the Spirit. That's the one I heard all the time. You need to be yielded to the Spirit. And the pastor would constantly implore, yield to the Spirit. Yield to the Spirit. We're told not to do it in the flesh. We're told to do it in the Spirit. We're told that we are dead to the old life and we need to come alive to the new life. We need to let go and let God. You ever hear that one? Millions of times. You need to let go and let God. And you need, here's another one, the one I just gave you. You need to come to the end of yourself and then begin to walk in faith. The problem is this, that every once in a while some smart aleck comes along and does what is unthinkable. He asks a question. He comes up to me, are you, and he says, what does that mean to be yielded to the Spirit? What does that mean to be surrendered? What does it mean to let go and let God? What does it mean to come to the end of yourself? And secondly, how do you do it? As a young man having grown up in the church and having heard those phrases thrown around all the time to the great delight of everyone, every time anybody said, what you need to do is let go and let God, everybody go, amen. And I did too, you know, amen. Because you're supposed to. The fact is this, that as I grew and began to move away from the shelter of my mother and father, as you are as a young person, you kind of just take everything you hear and you accept it and you kind of go along for the ride. but you kind of hit a point in your thinking where you start questioning the things you're hearing. And I became decidedly dissatisfied with what appeared to me to be a lot of mindless cliches. In fact, one of the things I struggled with was that I saw so few people who actually appeared to me to even understand themselves what those things meant. And I began to do the unthinkable, and I had a father who was a wonderful person who could let me do the unthinkable because I used to sit down with him and say, Dad, what does that mean? You're sitting there preaching all the time. You need to be yielded in the Spirit. You need to be filled with the Spirit. And I go, what does that mean? And how do you do it? Let go and let God. What does that mean? And I remember him having a bit of a perplexed look on his face as he would look at me and say, Dave, what do you mean, what do I mean? I mean, when you yield to the Spirit, Dave, When you yield to the Spirit, what you do is you yield. I mean, it's like a yield sign. You know how you let the other guy go? It's like just, don't you get it? No? Okay, let go and let God. Okay, when you let go and let God, there's two things involved here. You see this one coming. There's two things involved here. First, Dave, first, you let go. And then, you let God. Get it? Let go, no. No, I don't get it. And you know what? I remember him being real frustrated. And I remember some other things about him sharing with me some of the deep dimensions of spiritual life. Two things I remember. One, I remember that when he would explain these things to me, they made all sorts of sense to him. They did. He understood it. And he was perplexed that I didn't. The other thing I remember was this. I forgot what I remembered. No. The other thing I remember was this, that he was deeply moved by those things. Those things that were stammering off his tongue, and as he was trying to explain to his son what it meant to be yielded to the Spirit, he wanted so hard to communicate that to me because he had found life there. Why was it that he could understand it and I couldn't? Well, it's easy. He was a pastor. He had theology. He understood the theology behind the yieldedness to the Spirit. He understood the theology behind the filling of the Spirit. He had Greek. He'd been a pastor for years. Of course that was why. It had nothing to do with why he knew it and I didn't. It was because he had an encounter with Jesus Christ, and I hadn't. I want you to know something. When I was asking these questions, I was about 18 years old, and I had encountered a lot of Christianity. I had encountered theology, and I knew the theology of the filling of the Spirit, and I knew the theology of salvation, and I knew the doctrine of God. and I know how to act I had been confronted face to face with evangelical Christianity and you know what I was? I wasn't evangelical what I wasn't was a Christian I had never had an encounter face to face with Jesus Christ I had never had a time in my life where I came to the end of myself and said Lord, my only hope is you. I had a lot of external stuff and looked good, but it wasn't alive, it wasn't real at all. Then something exciting happened. I was seized by Christ. I was apprehended by Christ. I met him face to face. I don't know how it happened, I don't even know how to explain it, but there came this personal encounter with Jesus Christ alive. And you know one of the first things I remember happening? One of the first things I noticed in my life when that happened was I understood what yieldedness was. You know why I understood it? Because I was. Because I was. For the first time in my life, I was yielded. And I understood what surrender meant because I was. And I understood what brokenness meant because I was broken. And I understood what it meant to come to the end of myself because I had. Now, theologians can argue back and forth what that experience was that I had. Some would say, Dave, that was your second, that was kind of your filling of your spirit. I know that you were a little Christian when you were a little boy. That may be. Some would say that was your conversion. Some would say that's your crisis experience. I don't care what you call it. In fact, I get real, I'm almost, I wonder if my theology is changing a little bit or what, because we keep trying to find little tags or little cliches, another new cliche to explain what it is I've experienced. What I know is this That when I was 18 I came face to face With Jesus And I came to the end of myself And I saw that the only hope I had was him And ever since then I've been perfect Ha ha ha Baloney That's not true You who know me know that Ever since then though I have been walking with him And he's been real to me And I know what yieldedness means And I know when I'm not being yielded And I know what surrender means And I know what it means To come to the end of myself But you know what else I noticed When this happened to me I noticed that I started sharing That kind of stuff with other people and then something else happened they started asking me questions David I see a change in your life would you please explain to me what it is that you mean when you say all you did was yield to the spirit would you please explain to me what it is that you did when you say that you surrendered to the spirit and I would have a perplexed look on my face and I would look at them and I would say yielding to the spirit means you you yield to the spirit it means you yield and letting go and letting God means you first let and I could tell they weren't connecting and I could tell it wasn't making any sense. And even as I was trying to explain, as I would open my Bible, I would feel it very deeply, but I could tell that they weren't satisfied and I would be frustrated. Why don't they understand? Am I not saying it right? Am I not explaining it right? You know what, beloved? I believe that we need to be committed with all our hearts and souls and minds to take the Word of God. And this is not to be some sort of cop-out because what I'm driving at is the Spirit of God has to be the teacher. Somewhere along the line, the Spirit of God takes scales off our eyes and we see things we never saw before. That is not a cop-out to say that we just kind of go mushy along through things and never think and never disseminate Scripture. I've committed my life to taking the Word of God and making it understandable and explaining it to people so that somehow maybe the Spirit of God can take that and help people see. But one of the things that overwhelms me, every Sunday when I get in this pulpit, is that words don't work. Somewhere the Spirit of God has to come and do something supernatural. The real life and work of God in a person's life cannot be captured with words alone, no matter how understandable and compelling they are. The only thing I know that does that, that makes the reality of the spirit life come alive in a person and start bearing fruit in a person is a personal encounter with Christ face to face. Paul experienced that frustration. That's why I had Chester read that text in Ephesians 1. Paul had already in that chapter delineated all these incredible riches that were ours as believers, being redeemed by his blood, being sealed in the spirit, being chosen before the foundation of the world. And then he stopped and he said, these words don't work. I could explain this, the Apostle Paul himself could be here and explain theology and grace to us. And some people still wouldn't get it. So he stops and he says, I pray that the eyes of their heart might be enlightened. Something else has to happen, something deeper. In 1 Corinthians, he acknowledges the same thing when he says this, This natural man receiveth not the Spirit of God, for it is foolishness to him he cannot understand. Why? Because it takes spiritual eyes to see spiritual things. And now, I say all that to say this, now we come to the book of Galatians. And here we are, Paul is trying to explain the glorious freedom that we have in coming to Christ and coming to the end of our self-effort and coming to the end of our performing and coming to the end of our trying to earn some sort of favor with God and resting fully in the work of Christ. But here's the question. How do you explain that? How do you explain freedom? As soon as you start talking about freedom, people think you're talking about letting people go and do whatever they want to do. How do you explain that holy living is born from within by the Spirit of God and not by setting up a bunch of external rules and codes for people to follow. How do you explain that? I'll tell you one thing you do, you try to explain it. You try it like crazy. And I feel like all the way through the book of Galatians, we've gotten up here every week, and we've tried to delineate what it means to be free in Jesus and how the law kills. And I remember when I was going on vacation and Jeff gave me the two tapes that he preached when he was here, and he delineated the same kind of thing, and they were powerful. And then I come to the Apostle Paul, and I see all the way through the book of Galatians, he's trying to do the same thing. He comes to chapter 2, verse 19, and he says this, You need to understand about freedom. For through the law I died to the law that I might live to God. Get it? Get it? No? Well, how about this? I have been crucified with Christ, and it's no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live by the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and delivered himself up for me. Get it? No How about this? I don't nullify the grace of God For if righteousness comes through the law Then Christ died needlessly Get it? No Paul comes into chapter 3 verse 1 And I think he's frustrated I think he's frustrated He says how do I explain this to them? I'm doing everything I can to use my intellectual capabilities To make these words clear And I can tell it's not getting through they're still moving back to the law. He gets mad at them. He says, you dummies, you foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed? Verse 2, it's as if something dawns on him. What dawns on him is this. I am trying to explain to them a spiritual truth that takes spiritual eyes to see. And I need to be aware of something. And if I don't become aware of this right now with these people, I'm just going to go nuts trying to explain something that they can't understand. You see, if people have only come to an evangelical Christianity, if all they have come to is a bunch of theology that they intellectually give assent to and have never had an encounter with Jesus Christ, have never really come to the end of themselves, there is no way that I could explain it well enough for them to understand. What I am going to have to understand, you know what Paul is doing here? It's almost as if he's funneling down and focusing on the people he really has a ministry with. And those are the people who really have come to the end of themselves at one time in their life at least and know what it feels like to have the Spirit of God do a supernatural work in their life and set them free from themselves, having come to the end of themselves. And he says to those people, I can explain this because what I'm going to do is appeal to that experience. I'm going to appeal to the fact that at one time in their life, maybe all it was was their salvation experience when they realized that there was nothing they could do. They came to Christ and asked his forgiveness and claimed his blood and they sensed a sense of release. They're not living that way anymore. Because this whole dimension of freedom is something that it takes spiritual eyes to understand. Starting in verse 2, we enter into an appeal by the Apostle Paul. for these people to live in liberty by coming to the end of themselves. There are people in this congregation this morning, I believe, who need to come to the end of themselves. They may be believers. Some of you may not. But Paul appeals to them on the basis of three things. First of all, their past experience. We did that several weeks ago. Second of all, their history. And third of all, their scripture. First of all, their past experience, Verses 2 through 5. Remember when you first encountered Christ? It's as if he says, you remember when you were saved? Was it because you were finally qualified? Was it because you finally did enough? Was it because you kept the rules? No. In fact, it was just the opposite. You finally realized you didn't qualify. You finally realized there's no way you could ever do enough. And you finally realized that you could never keep the rules, no matter how hard you tried. And you came to what? You came to the end of yourself. And you said, the only hope I have, Lord, is you. That's the only hope I have. And you rested in his grace and you took it by faith. Do you remember that? Do you remember that? Maybe for some of you, I can make this even a little bit more fresh. For some of you as believers, you can remember a time in your Christian life when you were going through a spiritual desert and your life was just full of anxiety and your life was full of strife. Maybe some of you are there right now. And your life was just characterized by things like envy and insecurity. And if you were to look at your life, if you were to kind of get outside yourself and look at how you're living, you'd see someone who was frantically thrashing to keep up some sort of spiritual show. And finally, somehow God broke through. You slipped. Maybe you made a mistake that everybody saw. Maybe somehow you just got sick of it. Maybe you had a nervous breakdown because you couldn't pretend anymore. And you couldn't keep it up, and finally you just screamed and you said, I give up, I quit, I can't keep it up. You know what you did? You came to the end of yourself. And I can appeal to that. If any of you have ever experienced that, when you just said, I just can't take this anymore. And you came to the end of yourself and you said, the only hope I have is you. You were free then. Paul is appealing to their past experience in that. And you know what he's saying now? He's saying this. You know what that feels like. what happened to it? What happened to it? Who has bewitched you? You know about that kind of joy. You know about that kind of freedom. Why'd you forget? Verse 2, this is the only thing I want to know from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law? Your striving and thrashing, or by hearing, by coming to the end of yourself and just taking the gift. That's how you got it. You know it. Are you so foolish then? Why did you forget? Are you so foolish than having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? Because that's exactly what you're doing and that's why you're miserable today. Did you suffer so many things in vain if indeed it was in vain? Does he then who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you do it by the works of the law or by hearing with faith? You know from your own experience that the spirit life is one of freedom and joy, and you have moved away from that for one reason or another. The second thing I want to appeal to you with is an argument from history. Abraham. Abraham. I love Abraham. This is great. Please hang with me here, because this is really the sermon right here. This is the thing I want you to take with you. Even so, Abraham kept the law, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. It doesn't say that, does it? Even so, Abraham did it right. and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. It doesn't say that either. Even so, Abraham performed well and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. It doesn't say that. In fact, the fact is that Abraham did not keep the law. One of the things we're going to discuss next week as we deal with the text coming up is that Abraham didn't even have the law. That's one of the reasons the Apostle Paul is using Abraham. He's saying way before the law, God's way of dealing with man was always by faith. So don't come at me with all these rules and regulations in order to somehow get your standing before God. Abraham did not keep the law, in fact. Not only that, Abraham did not do that well. Not only that, Abraham did not perform very well. But a wonderful thing happened to Abraham. It took a long time, and it took a lot of pain. And I'll tell you something, this is one of the dimensions of Abraham's life we don't talk about very often, but eventually Abraham came to the end of himself. And when he came to the end of his own striving, That was when faith was engendered. That was when he was set free. And that was when he received the promise of grace. You remember him? The old patriarch. Father Abraham. You know, I was thinking about this. He got a song about him. You know, I was thinking in the word of God, if you get a song about you, you either have to do something really good or really bad. Think about all the songs we sing. You know, if you did something really bad, we'll make a song about you, and it'll be a lesson to the kids never to be like him. And if you did something really good, Abraham did something really good. Abraham, Father Abraham, had many sons. And many sons had Father Abraham. And let's just praise the Lord. So he was great. Everybody knows about Abraham. He's the one who lived by faith. He got the promise. You remember the promise? Genesis chapter 12, verses 1 through 3. The promise was this. God says directly to him, Go from your country, Abraham, and go from your relatives and your father's house to the land which I will show you. And I will make for you, I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great. And you shall be a blessing, and I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. And through you, all families of the earth shall be blessed. Genesis 15, verse 5, that promise gets more specific. And he took Abraham outside and said to him, Abraham, look toward the heavens. Count the stars if you can. He gave them about three hours. You got it? So shall your descendants be. Now that's quite a promise. That's quite a promise. One thing I want you to know about that promise, again, we're going to deal with this in depth next week. It's going to be exciting. Come back next week to understand some things about the Abrahamic covenant. But one of the things you need to know about this particular covenant is that it was unconditional. It was unconditional except for one thing. there was nothing that Abraham could do to make this come true there was nothing Abraham could do to earn this promise there was nothing he could do to speed it up there was nothing he could do to slow it down there was only one thing expected of Abraham and that was this, that he had to just take that promise and believe it, you got that? he couldn't earn it, it wasn't because he was good it wasn't because he was bad, what he had to do was believe it and those of us who know about Abraham and know about the songs, know that that's exactly what he did. Abraham is the one that demonstrates that God operates on the basis of faith. Romans chapter 4. Let's turn. This is great. Romans chapter 4. I don't know about you, but this is the text that makes Abraham famous in my mind. Chapter 4, verse 17. And it is written, a father of many nations have I made you. Obviously, he's speaking to Abraham, or of Abraham. In the sight of him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist. In hope against hope, he, Abraham, he believed in order that he might become a father of many nations. According to that which he had been spoken, so shall your descendants be. And without becoming weak in faith, powerful Abraham, great faith, he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead. He was about 100 years old, 99 to be exact, and the deadness of Sarah's womb. Yet, wonderful Abraham, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief. but not only did he not waver, but he grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform. Therefore also, it was reckoned to him as righteousness. What was? His faith. Now, not for his sake only was this written, that it was reckoned to him, but for our sake also, to whom it will be reckoned, as those who believe in him who raised our Lord from the dead. Again, that is simply alluding to the fact that God's plan from the beginning was that men would come to him on the basis of faith. And Abraham is an example of that. And we need to catch it. So we look at that and we go, wow, Abraham was really some guy. Good for Abraham. He did it so well. You need to know something, though, right now. It wasn't always that way. God had to bring him to that point. Abraham was not only an example of faith, but I believe Abraham, and I trust you're going to understand this when you leave this morning, more than a simple example of faith, he is an example of someone who had to come to the end of himself before he even understood what faith is. You see, Abraham is an example of a striver too. He is a striver of strivers. Genesis 15, remember? I just read it a little while ago. That's when he got the promise. Remember? He got the promise. And it was unconditional. All he had to do was believe it. All he had to do was say this, Lord, I don't know how this is going to happen. I don't know how you're going to do it. But you told me this is who I am. You told me this is what I am called to do. You told me this is what is going to happen. And I don't see the strength in myself to pull that off. But I'm going to believe you that that is who I am, that that is what I'm called to, and you're going to have to work that through me somehow. I don't know how. That's what he was called to do. Believe it. And let God work through it. What did he do? he did what an awful lot of you and I would do he thought he could help God out you see Abraham had a problem the problem was simply this he hadn't come to the end of himself yet he looked around and he didn't see anything happening he didn't see any moving he didn't see the kinds of things that he thought would be happening if he was going to be the father of all the world you know the father of fathers and all this great stuff and so he thought he'd help God out and in Genesis chapter 16 you need to turn to it you need to catch the excitement of this Genesis chapter 16 we don't see father we don't see Abraham the father of the faithful we see Abraham as being God's little helper God's little helper isn't this wonderful remember he had already received the promise here chapter 16 verse 1 now Sarai Abraham's wife had borne him no children and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar so Sarai said to Abram let's help God now behold the Lord has prevented me from bearing children please go into my maid Perhaps I shall obtain children through her And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai Verse 12 This is the result of that A child was born from that union And he will be a wild donkey of a man His hand will be against everyone And everyone's hand will be against him And he will live to the east of all his brothers It was a curse Chapter 17, look at verses 1 through 4 Again, this all happened after the promise was given to Abraham And he didn't have to do anything He had just messed it up with his striving and his manipulation. Chapter 17. Here's an example of grace. Now when Abram was 99 years old, the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless. And here's my promise to you again, Abram. I will establish my covenant between me and you, and I will multiply you exceedingly. And Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, as for me behold my covenant is with you unconditional all you have to do is believe it and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations and now the father of the faithful this great pillar of faith says in verse 15 then God said to Abraham I'm sorry then God said to Abraham as for Sarah your wife you shall not call her Sarah but Sarah shall be her name and here it is again the promise. I will bless her, and indeed, I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations, and kings of all of peoples shall come from her. And here's Abraham's response finally. Then Abraham, the father of the faithful, fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart, will a child be born to a man 100 years old? Ha! And will Sarah, who is 90 years old, bear a child. Ha! Beloved, something important happened in this man's life between Genesis chapter 17 and Romans 4. I believe it was simply this, that somewhere along the line Abraham came to the end of himself. Somewhere along the line he said this, God, I have tried so hard to make this happen. I have tried so hard to work this thing out. I have heard your promise. I have heard what you have called me to. I have heard what you have called me to live like. And I have tried so hard to do it. I have tried so hard to work it out. But I am at the point, I'm 99 years old, Lord. I see now that there is no power in me to do what I've been told to do. There is no power in me to be who you called me to be. I am at the end of my resources. and the only thing I have left to do is to believe you because I don't have any plans anymore. When he was younger and he thought maybe the potential was there and he saw a way to get out of it and work it out himself, he did. He had to be 99 years old until he finally said, I don't have the resources anymore. The promises of God to me say that I am called to do something important and vital and spectacular. But I don't have it in me and God finally said, that's exactly where I've been wanting you all the time. Abraham, an example of faith I think more than an example of faith he's an example of one who had to come to the end of himself before he could be set free and when he did, guess what happened? the promise was given what about you? do you know that it's God's desire for you to come to the end of yourself? my question is this what's it going to take for you to get there? you know what Abraham had to do before he came to the end of himself he had to turn 99 years old have absolutely no resources left to function then he said Lord the only hope I have is you you know what Abraham had to do before he finally came to the end of himself he had to get involved in adultery and deal with the guilt of that he finally came to the end of himself Lord I give up I'm going to let you do this sometimes people have to come to the end of their marriage you know that sometimes people have to come to the end of their life sometimes people put a gun right to their head before they say this is it I'm going to have to trust you God for something people strive and work and try to work you as believers you as people who come to church at the open door we're here week after week after week what it is that God has called you to the kind of lifestyle that God has called you to one that is exemplary of Christ one that is full of honor and glory and holiness and we go home and we go oh that was good oh I want to be holy and we try and we try and we try and we wonder what is the matter how come I can't do it I'll tell you one of the problems you're having is maybe you haven't come to the end of yourself yet people come and say Dave it just never lets up it never stops it's one thing right after another I can't sleep anymore I'm not happy anymore I don't have any energy what's going on maybe this is what's going on maybe God is trying to bring you to the end of yourself well you'll stop all your striving and all your thrashing and all your trying to make it all work out and rest in Him and believe that what He said you are is what you are. Others come and say, Dave, I need you to pray for my husband. I need you to pray for my wife or my kids. Our marriage is turning sour. I look at my kids and I look at my husband or I look at my wife and I think, Lord, what's it going to take? What's it going to take to bring them around? I'll tell you what it's going to take to bring them around they're going to have to come to the end of themselves and I don't think a sermon is going to make them do that it may be that whatever pain that you are in right now or whatever pain your husband or wife or children are in right now it may be that if they aren't responding to God now that it may take more pain until they do I want to tell you something if God loves you he's going to bring whatever it takes into your life to bring it to the end of yourself Abraham believed God but I want to tell you something he had to come to the end of himself before that righteousness was reckoned to him. Therefore, verse 7, be sure. Therefore, know beyond a shadow of doubt, let there be no mistake about this. It is those who have come to the end of their performing and the end of their pretending and the end of their thrashing and striving and self-sufficiency and have walked into faith who are sons of Abraham. and again I just direct it right back at us are you ready to cease the striving have you come to the breaking point yet if not then you can expect it to get worse before it gets better whatever it is you're in if God is the God of this scripture and his discipline on our lives and his wooing of us and his disciplining of us is true he's going to bring it to the end of yourself Are you ready to lay down your frantic efforts to appear acceptable and lovable and worthwhile and just believe and rest in who Jesus says you are? The only rest there is, the only freedom there is, is when you quit pretending and say, Lord, I am like that one that Angie sang about. The only hope I have is you. The only hope I have is you. If you're not there, Paul appeals to one more argument, and that's the argument of Scripture. Verse 10. If you want to continue thrashing, and if you want to continue performing, and if you want to continue pretending that you can somehow make it by being a good person, whether it be for your sanctification or your salvation, you know, these things just overlap. Fine. If you want to live that way, fine. But know this. Know this. Verse 12. He who practices them shall live by them. If you want to live by the law, fine. You're going to live by the law, though. And you're going to pay the penalties of the law. Verse 10 talks about that. As many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things in the book of the law to perform them. The curse of the law is this, that if you choose to base your acceptance before God or your ability to even please God about how well you're doing and your little performance, fine. But you better know that if you go the performance route, you better do it perfect. You better never slip up because you slip up once and it's over. The curse of the law, the burden of the law is this, that by your fretful striving, you can never do it right enough. You can never do it enough. That by your fretful striving, you can never pay the debt. That's the curse of the law. If you want to go that way, that's how you're going to live. Fine. But here's the good news. Verse 13. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law having become a curse for us why? in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles so that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith what about you? have you had enough? I would just invite you without a big emotional pull or any kind of manipulation I know there are some here just because in a congregation this size there is no way this is as if this is a problem that is common to every one of us at one time or another I would invite you this morning to come and lay down that striving I would invite you to come this morning and lay down that thrashing to cease striving and receive the promise and walk in the freedom of faith. And it may be that some of you are here this morning and you have never encountered what Paul was appealing to at the beginning. You have never encountered that first encounter with Christ. You've never moved into salvation. You've never come to the end of yourself to even accept him as Savior. But I believe that in a congregation like ours, more of you have done that than not. And the striving that some of you are struggling with as a striving in your own life, that whole process of holy living, that whole process of sanctification. How is it that I can please God as one who loves the Lord? And all of your efforts are sincere, but it's just eating you up inside. You want to know something for your salvation? You need to come to the end of yourself. For your sanctification, for your sanctification, you need to come to the end of yourself. It's God who is at work in you. I close with this. Deuteronomy chapter 30 verse 19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life, freedom and death the blessing and the curse therefore choose life cease your striving I don't know how the spirit of God is working in some people's hearts again I would just have to fall back on the fact that my words feel real feeble I don't know if I expressed at all the kinds of things that were pumping through my heart. But I believe the Spirit of God can be at work in some of your hearts, and some of you can be striving and fighting with things right now that have been plaguing you and threatening your very life. I invite you to lay it down this morning. And if you're in that position and you need to talk and pray, I want you to come. And I'd just be more than happy to pray with you and help you, and we'll work through this thing. And I'm also aware that some of you may not know Christ at all. and this morning I don't know how the spirit of God is speaking to you either but I think the biggest tragedy there could possibly be would be that if you would come this morning and hear the gospel have a tug at your heart for you to ignore it if you feel that tug and you want to lay down that struggle I'd like to talk to you too the invitation is open Thank you.
