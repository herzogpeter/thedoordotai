We are dealing again this morning with an apostolic prayer. That makes it an important prayer. All prayers are important. An apostolic prayer is one I would pay attention to. By the Apostle Paul on behalf of a group of people he deeply loved, the Philippians. A group of people for whom he desired the very best in life. Began in verse 9 when he said these words, And this I pray. And through verse 11, he is going to pray for them five things. The first is this. I pray that your love might abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment. The second thing is I'm going to pray that you may approve the things which are excellent. The third thing I would pray for you is that you be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ. Until the day of Christ said a different way, that you be sincere and blameless your whole life. I pray this for you that you be filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes from Jesus Christ and I pray this for you that all of those things work together to the glory and praise of God imagine if you could in fact pray those things into a person and by praying them into them they would be there that would be quite a person full of the fruit of righteousness sincere and blameless until the day of Christ abounding in love approving what is excellent pray for someone else I would pray for me those things to be we began last week with this word aspect of the prayer that your love may abound still more and more the word abound means to exceed in we had a picture, at least I did of a fountain coming out the top of my head that is more than you need There was nowhere else for it to go. So whatever it is that abounds, it's pouring out all over the place. That your love may be like that. That your love, it is your love. It's inside of you coming from you. So that when people get in front of you, what's in you gets on them. What's on you is love, so that gets on them. The reason, therefore, they get loved, if love is abounding in you, is not because they are a particularly worthy object of the love, But because what's in you got on them and they got in your way. That your love abounds still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment. Real knowledge and all discernment relative to two things. What love really is. And real knowledge and all discernment relative to what people are really like. And what people are really like is this. Sometimes they hurt you and sometimes they disappoint you. And what I pray for you is this, that in real knowledge of what people can sometimes do to you, and in real knowledge of what love really is, I pray that love still abound in you. That's what I pray for you, says Paul. Last week I indicated that I was going to teach the text and come back and define what it is this love actually is, that Paul is praying would abound in them and spend some time on that. And we are going to get to that. But I need to ask your indulgence this week as I push that back just a little bit. So as to make a connection that I think is very important to make for us to be able to, I think, absorb, quite frankly, some of the definitions we need to make. The connection is in the text. It comes in verse 10. So that you may approve the things that are excellent. The prayer goes like this. I pray that love would abound in you and that love would abound in you so that you would be able to approve what is excellent. I don't fully understand this yet, but what it seems to be saying is this. That love abounding in me somehow puts me in a position where I will be able to approve what is excellent. Now, that connection raised three questions for me. And it put my need or desire to define what love really is on hold for a minute. I've got to answer these questions. For me, if not for you. The first question that came to mind was this. What does it mean to approve what is excellent? The second question is this. What does abounding in love have to do with approving what is excellent? The text indicates that there is some connection. The third thing is this. What are the excellent things Paul is praying they would be able to approve? Therefore, that we would be able to approve. And when we answer these, we'll be able to move on to some deep understandings of a definition of love. Let's start with some definitions. What does it mean to approve what is excellent? Start with the first word, approve. Dokimazo. Dokimazo is the Greek word. Literally, it means to test. It means to assay. As in the case of metal, to determine what the properties of the metal are, to determine what the purities in the metal are or aren't. It means, in some sense, just to determine something as to whether it has value or not. Best way, I think, to grasp what this word means is to picture yourself watching a cowboy movie, and the crusty old geezer, one day after months being gone, comes out of his hiding in the hills, Only to reveal he wasn't hiding, he was digging for gold. And he's got in his hand a big rock that he is absolutely convinced is gold. Lots of activity in the town about his find is there. He brings it to the assayer. And the process the assayer uses to determine whether this chunk of rock that this geezer guy has is gold or not. The process he uses to determine whether it has value or not is what is behind this word to approve or to assay. I pray, says Paul, that you would be able to assay things. That you would be able to discern what? What is excellent? That's the second word. Let's define that one. The afero is this word. It literally means to differ. That which differs. That you would be able to discern that which differs as you put them together. Excellence means that which stands out, that which rises above, that which is of transcendent value and transcendent worth. Kittle, in the Theological Dictionary for the New Testament, cited a number of usages of this word, diafero, in classical Greek and in the vernacular. And often, often, here we are, we're back, often, the use of a certain word in the vernacular kind of gives us a better handle on it. One of the things that he cited was from an Egyptian archaeological find years ago where they unearthed crates and crates of government files in Egypt with Greek writing of all things. One of the things that he cited was from a government memorandum. It said this, send us lists of individuals in your district conspicuous for honesty and steadfastness. And that word conspicuous was diafaro. Send to us lists of people who stand out, who rise above, who are conspicuous for honesty. That's what the word excellence means. Another example Kittle gave was from a legal brief that, as I read, it sounded like what would today be an inter-office memo. It said this, and I quote, Send us the essential parts of the proceedings of the trial. Essential parts is the Greek word diaphero. Pull approved and excellent together. And approving what is excellent means simply this, an ability to assess, to test out and determine the things that matter most. Moffat said it this way, approving what is excellent is having a sense of what is vital. It is having a sense of the essential part in life. It is having a discernment to be able to tell what is that which has transcendent value. To clarify what Paul is saying here even further, he is not here saying or praying for them to have an ability to discern between right and wrong, though that is an ability we desperately need. It is not what he's praying for. It is a capacity to look at the world and among many things that are good. At least that looked good, like the chunk of rock that this old geezer thought was gold. It could be fool's gold. It could be glittery and shiny, but of no value. It is a capacity to look at the world and among the things that are good to discern what ascends, what transcends, what is the highest, the finest, and the best, what is in this world really gold, therefore worthy of me investing myself in it, giving myself to it, sacrificing to get it and to keep it. Letting other things go so I can have it. Because it's gold. Hear now the prayer of Paul. And this I pray, Philippians. And this I pray, Church of the Open Door, that you might live your life in such a way that you can take the chunks of life that inevitably will come to you, that you, because of life, will have to sort through. And among these chunks of life, I pray that you will be able to discern the things that really have value and the things that really don't. Picture yourself, if you will, kind of rummaging through life and rummaging through a bunch of options and a bunch of things that all say to you, this is the best, this is really good. And the ability to take this and go, No, that's not... No, this is good. But this is... That's it. That's it. To be able to find... Just to know... That at the loss of everything else, I would hang on to this. For I have tested and I have discerned that this thing, whatever it is I have defined, whatever it is I have found to be of value, transcendent value that this really is the essential part of life and if you're a Christian of the kingdom life. Hear the prayer of Paul from a different angle with a negative spin. Negatively spoken that doesn't necessarily mean bad it's just another way to look at it. I hear Paul saying this and this I pray that you don't spend the resources of your life on things that aren't valuable. I pray you'd be able to discern what is so you don't waste your life. I even pray that you don't spend the resources of your life on ordinary things. I pray that you would be able to see what is excellent. As I say that, I need to make a qualification. There is nothing sinful about ordinary. We're not talking about sinful and good, righteousness and evil. There is nothing sinful about ordinary. He is simply saying, I hope you can see what's excellent. Discern what transcends. Back up with me for a minute and imagine something that I did this week as I was just kind of grappling with this concept and laying it into my spirit, wondering how it might apply. Wonder with me this. What if we actually could give to someone the capacity to discern between what is good and better and the best? What if we could actually give that to someone? Pick in your mind, in order to do this exercise well, someone for whom you want the very best. I hope you can think of somebody. A good friend, a mom, a dad, one of your kids. For me, the easiest thing, and you're just going to have to indulge me. You do your own work around this. I think of my kids right off the bat, my four kids, the easiest place for me to move. They are the people in whom I invest the most of myself that I want for them the very best. For the sake of this exercise, this little imaginary thing, I am picturing myself with my children at a time in their life when they're ready to leave home. They're about to go to college, and though this will still be their home and they can come home anytime, they are leaving now. And I would see a moment in their life like that as special. And I would want the event where we say goodbye to them. We are launching you now to be an occasion where my wife and I would, and again, this is kind of imaginary, we're kind of wanting to give them a gift. We want it to be helpful, lasting. We want it to be of value. We want it to be something that is going to benefit them even if we're not there with them. and I speak to my children these words we have no money or land to speak of but what we have we share with you we have no name of great importance to give you except among a few but quite frankly you are going out on your own now and you are going into a different sphere of life where this name Johnson will mean nothing it's not going to do much for you but here Here. And I imagine in my mind a package that I hand to my daughters and I hand to my sons. And in this package is the capacity for the rest of their life to be able to sift through the chunks of life, the options of life that are going to speak to them saying, we have value. this is worth it this really makes a difference they are shiny and they are glittery but I have given them something in this package in this imaginary picture that is going to give them the ability to tell fool's gold fool's gold no value some value high value highest value if I could in fact give that to my children if I could give it to you if I could have it given to me by you my children would be you would be I would be set for life. For that capacity would determine every decision they make, every direction they go. It would determine who they married. It would determine whether they married. For my sons, to be able to give to them the ability to look past the glitter and the shininess of fool's gold and to be able to discern what is of transcendent value and worth in the life and the heart and the character of a woman. If they had the ability to do that, they would be able to sift through. If I could give to my daughters the ability to look past that which glitters and is fool's gold and to be able by the Spirit to discern what has transcendent value and worth in the heart and the life and the character of a man. What kind of pain might they avoid? What kind of richness might they enjoy? It would affect where they went, where they didn't go. It would affect what they desired, what they didn't desire. It would affect what they said, even when they said it. For if they had this gift, would be able to discern what was good and better and best. It would affect their career choice. Without me making suggestions or knowing what is best, if they had the discernment to discern what is excellent, what transcends. sins, they would be able to spot the gold and spot the fool's gold. But discernment like that doesn't come in a package. And that's part of the reason Paul said, I pray this for you. Because the sad fact is this. While an ability to discern what truly does transcend would make us rich beyond measure, not in things of the world, but in things that would make our lives rich, the sad fact is that most of us spend our lives on things that are not gold, that have little value, that are not the essential part, that do not matter, And yet we invest vast resources of our life into getting them. Howard Hendricks, fairly well-known professor at Dallas Theological Seminary, several years ago, it was 18 years ago, I heard him tell this story of an extremely successful businessman who came into his office in Dallas, sobbing. And in his $1,000 suit and everything that any human being would say you need to have to be fulfilled, this man recounted this story. All my life I have climbed the ladder of success and I have reached the top. The problem is this. When I got to the top of the ladder, I found out that my ladder was leaning against a wall I didn't care about. I lean my ladder against the wrong wall as I give that illustration some of you might have something rise in your spirit that sounds like this I've done that let me ask you a question is there grace for a man like that or a woman like that well let me tell you what there is for a woman like that or a man like that amazing grace amazing grace and there is healing for him and there's healing for you if you've put your ladder on the wrong wall. He may not, you see, get his wife back because he lost his wife. And he may not get his children back because his children he did not know and now they were of age where they didn't want to know him anymore. But there is healing for him and there is amazing grace for him. But what a gift it might have been to him to have known at an earlier date. At that time, he was putting his ladders against the walls of things he valued and wanted more than anything. He would have valued more what he lost now and now deems as being the gold. His children and his wife and relationships like that. You know, it occurs to me that that businessman utilized some very positive attributes to get to the top. You don't get to the top of anything without discipline. Discipline is a good thing. You don't get to the top without self-control. I think I can assume of a man like this with the success he had that he had perseverance. That is a powerfully positive trait in a person. You don't get to the top without sacrifice. You don't get to the top without integrity. Now, sometimes you get a lot of money without integrity. But in terms, I'm just going to assume of him in the business world, to get to where he got, he had to have a professional integrity that was admirable. But because his ladder was up against the wrong wall, he spent those wonderful attributes, discipline, self-control, perseverance, on things that didn't matter. The wall in this picture of things that we value are our values. They are the things we want more than anything. They are the things we have determined really is the gold. I will invest in this. This is it. And for the things we value most, we will sacrifice. Think on that. For the things you value most, you will persevere. For the things you value most, you will discipline yourself. Every once in a while, you hear the preacher, discipline, sacrifice. Here's the deal. You already do discipline yourself for what you value most. If you want to figure out what you really value, just take an inventory. What do I sacrifice to get? What are the things I let go in order to get? That's what you value. most? The question is, then, what do you value? There's a bigger question than that. Do the things that you value have value? Or have you put your ladder up against the wrong wall? What to you matters most? Paul's prayer was this. That you, that we, would be able to tell what really is valuable, what really does transcend, what really is the essential part. But as I give you that progression of thought, I need to stop you and make you think about something else just for a minute. You see, the way I've been bringing you along here so far, I think I've communicated an assumption that is not necessarily true. The assumption is this, that if we really did know what was the most valuable thing, we would choose it. By simply knowing it, we would choose it. I don't think that's true necessarily. The fact is this, people can, you do, I do, I have seen and affirm things that matter and I would say with my mouth, that is indeed what matters most. And still not chosen that as the thing upon which I lean my ladder and the thing for which I will sacrifice, the thing for which I will discipline myself, the thing for which I will persevere and wade through, let other things go in order to get it. Know it's valuable, but still not move toward it, still not choose it. Imagine in your mind's eye this businessman I'm picking on this morning. I'm in Dallas 18 years ago, poor guy. Halfway up the wall, the ladder of success. someone shouts up to him and says George what are the things that matter most in life and he would shout down from his letter my family and my children they matter most and from his heart he would mean that he would discern that's the gold but that's not what he chose so my question now is What is it that empowers us to choose the thing that has the most value? Not only to discern, though that is very important, but what empowers us, enables us, opens the door for us, puts us in a position where we can choose what matters most. And now I'm leading to the second question I wanted to deal with this morning, and that is this. What does this abounding love have to do with approving what is excellent? Because the verse, remember, said, I pray that you would have love abiding and abounding in you in real knowledge and all discernment so that you may be able to discern and approve and choose the excellent thing. What's the connection? Let me explain. It's just this. That if love really is abiding in you, and again, we have not yet fully defined what love is. We are going to get to that. But if love is abiding in you and abounding in you, by virtue of the fact that it is there, it is in you, it puts you in a place whereby you will not only discern what is excellent and valuable, but you will choose it. Do you know why? Because of this. Because what matters most, what rises above, what is the essential part, is in fact the very thing that is abounding in you. And that is what Paul prayed for, and that is love. And if that is what is abounding in you, the most consistent thing for you to ever move toward, desire, and then to choose and embrace and sacrifice everything else to get would be the very thing that's already in you. Love. That's what the verse means. And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more. Because if it does, you not only will discern what is excellent, You will choose what is excellent because what is excellent is already abounding in you. It's already abiding in you by the Spirit. And if you're a believer, that love is in you, whether you even recognize it or not. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, Paul said in Romans. It's already there. now with that I've answered the third question I wanted to answer and that was this what is the excellent thing that we need to approve that is to discern as being most valuable and then to choose it what is the excellent thing well among a very long list of excellent things at the very top of the list is love 1 Corinthians 12 31 says it very clearly and it says it this way I show you a still more excellent way. Now what captures me as it relates to what we're talking about in Philippians is the still more excellent. Meaning among many excellent things there is one that's more excellent. What is interesting about Paul saying that in 1 Corinthians 12 is that in 1 Corinthians 12 he is speaking of excellent things. Things that arise above. Specifically he is speaking of the gifts of the Spirit. He is speaking of words of knowledge, gifts of prophecy, gifts of faith, miracles, gifts of healing, the gift of tongues and the gift to interpret tongues. And all of those things are excellent. I would say more than excellent. Those gifts of the Spirit are necessary. We preach this over and over as being the way God gets his work done in the church. By empowering his people with supernatural gifts to storm the gates of hell. But Paul says here at the end of chapter 12 and then through chapter 13. Church in Corinth, as important, vital, and excellent as those things indeed are. There is something that rises above all of them. There is more that is more important than any of them. There is more vital that is more excellent. And then he writes 1 Corinthians 13, probably the most famous passage in all of the scripture relative to a definition of love. And the place it sits intrigues me because it is right couched in the middle of a corrective by Paul and the Corinthians around their misuse and preoccupation with supernatural things and their misuse and chaotic occupation with and participation in tongues and prophecy. not that anything's wrong with either one of those things. In the middle of those correctives, he speaks on the thing that matters most. That is the excellent thing. I want you to turn in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians 13. As you do, I just want to connect you with something as it relates to the course of our study over these weeks that now as I turn you to 1 Corinthians 13, I'm getting now to what I said we would do last week. And that is we would start to begin to define this love that Paul is praying would abound in us. But the fact is even this week, we're barely going to touch this. I'm not going to get deeply into this. And with that in mind, that we're still not going to get into the definitions in a deep way, I need to share a picture with you that God, I think, gave me this week relative to this whole issue that I think God is speaking by His Spirit to our church. More than just speaking to us, I think God by His Spirit is desiring to do in us this work and do in me this work of abounding love. For I see this whole thing of abounding love and what he's speaking and desiring to do in us as an egg. I know it doesn't sound very profound. I see it as an egg. I wish I saw it as something more exciting. But when I think of love abounding in real knowledge and all discernment in order to approve things that are excellent, like an egg, those things he wants to do in us and is speaking to us has the potential for life. That if allowed to run its course, will fully develop in you and will fully develop in me and will come to bloom in our church. If allowed to run its course. If allowed to go through the process of gestation. With that in mind, I felt like God gave me two words. Warnings, if you will. The first was this. David, as I speak these words to you of abounding love, in real knowledge, and of an ability to discern what matters most, don't rush it. First word, don't rush it. This little egg that's being laid, don't rush it. For among many of you, and me as well, there will be, as God's word comes, even in the desire to please God, a desire to make it heck before it's ready. Never mind. Remember when you were a kid? I've got to slow down here. Remember when you were a kid? You'd get a little robin's egg, and you'd try to make it. It's going to ruin it. Slow down. Slow down. For some of you, what I'm saying right now is a very important word. It may not land on everybody, but for some of you, this is vital. For God to do some of the deep, deep things he would like to do in you and in me around this thing, Some of the wide ways he wants you to expand your thinking and your experience for you to make big promises. I will. I will. What in some ways abort the deep thing God wants to do. Don't rush it. As we get into chapter 13, more deeply next time than today, you are going to hear some things about love that you feel are not true of you. Love is patient. I wish that wasn't the first one. It drives me crazy. I hate that. But I will come to love it, I am sure. Love is kind. Love isn't jealous. You're going to hear things that aren't true of you, at least in terms of how you feel about how you live. And some of you, because you really desire to please God, are going to go, I promise I'll be patient from now on. I will. We look for magic wands. I'll tell you what I'm saying. In some ways, it's more than a word about what God's saying to us. It really is a confrontation on sometimes how we think. I really do believe the deep things of God that he's ever done in me have taken way more time than I wish they did. And I think we can abort them by trying to make them hatch before they're ready. But some of you need to hear another word, and that's this. Don't crush it. Don't crush the egg either. See, the fact also is this, that as we go through 1 Corinthians 13 over these next several weeks, some of you are going to hear things about love that make you mad. Love is patient. Something when you hear that will rise up in you that says something maybe like this. No one was ever patient with me. No one ever was patient with me. Now I'm supposed to be patient. How am I supposed? I don't, I'll give you patience and you're crushing. Love is kind. And some of you could honestly say, no one was ever kind to me. Some of you could say, have rise up in you like bile in your throat. Oh, Dave, you preach this kind thing, but if I were to leave this gymnasium and go home and be kind, as I think kindness is and what I think it looks like, if I were kind, I would get steamrolled. I would get destroyed. And some of you, when you hear the word begin to come like an egg with potential of life, I think, some of you will crush it or want to crush it. And I can't keep you from doing that. But I can ask you, this time, when you hear the word implanted, when the egg of truth here gets laid, the seed of truth gets imparted, this time, don't crush it. Get mad. Fight about it. Wonder about it. Struggle with it. Wonder, wonder, how do you love an evil man? How do you love a foolish woman? Wonder, struggle. Don't crush it, though. Don't disregard it. Let us sit. Not to push the metaphor too far as the truth comes. Just sit on it. Just sit on it. Ponder it. Pray over it. Ask God what kindness in a tough situation might look like. and now this morning in addition to everything else I've said I want to plant the seed I want to again excuse the metaphor here I want to lay the egg what occurs to me is most of the time when you lay an egg it's not a good thing just go with me here and the way I want to do that is to just read 1 Corinthians 13 just hear it I'll make some comments but I'm not going to go deep I show you a still more excellent way if I speak with tongues of men and of angels but don't have love I'm a noisy gong and a clanging cymbal I think he's speaking there of the gift of tongues and you want to know something the gift of tongues is an excellent thing it is something we preach, it is something we embrace but I'm here to tell you that if you speak in tongues of men and of angels but you don't have love the gift of tongues ceases even to be an excellent thing it's an offensive thing and if I have the gift of prophecy and I know all mysteries and all knowledge. And if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but I do not have love, I am nothing. I'm glad I'm able to touch on this just a little bit now because we do sometimes get fuzzy ideas of what love looks like, and especially in a difficult situation. I'm glad the word prophecy is there and prophets are spoken of. Because this helps me affirm that love is not mush in the face of evil or in the face of what is wrong. because prophets and prophecy speaks the truth. Prophecy, by its very definition and nature, reveals sin and stands against evil. And in vernacular that we understand at Open Door, it breaks the silence of things that are wrong and hurtful. But without love, truth spoken, I'm talking something that really is even true, without love, means you are nothing. What does that mean? and you have no value as a person. I don't think that's what it means. I think it means this. You who speak truth prophetically without love, you are not the prophet you think you are. You who really see the truth and say it straight and without love, you are not the truth teller you think you are. Feature with me for a moment in your mind. If you've only caught a glimmer of this ever, that's maybe all you can do, but feature with me the power of a true prophet oozing with mercy and oozing with love. I think of Jeremiah. He was called the weeping prophet who says hard things and true. The power of a prophet to do spiritual surgery with words that penetrate the heart of a man or a woman that expose hidden places and touch wounded places and bring healing and life and light. Those words that were spoken, however, were not light and fluffy. Everything's okay. but without love those same words can do horrible damage to rip and expose and to destroy without love you're not a prophet you're not a truth speaker and your prophecy and your truth are no longer counted among things that are even valuable and if I give all my possessions to feed the poor and if I deliver my body to be burned but I don't have love profits me nothing. And then in verse 4 he begins the closest thing there is in the Bible to a definition of love and it's not a definition of it it's a description of love that gives us a picture. Love is patient. Love is kind. Is not jealous. Love doesn't brag and it isn't arrogant. It doesn't act unbecomingly. It doesn't seek its own. It isn't provoked. It does not take into account a wrong suffered. It does not rejoice in unrighteousness. It doesn't get a kick out of unrighteousness. Rejoices in truth. We're going to talk about truth and love a lot. It bears all things, believes all things, it hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. and that's a verse we're going to have to do some work around. If you've ever had a relationship that failed, you're going to call that verse a lie. But I'll tell you, before I even describe it, love never fails. But if there are gifts of prophecy, know this, they're excellent and they're needed, but the fact is they will be done away. And if there are tongues, they are excellent and they are needed, but they will cease. And if there is knowledge, what an excellent thing to have knowledge of God and of the Word and insight into people and life. But that's going to be done away too. For now we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when the perfect comes and the perfect is the culmination, when we see Jesus face to face on that final day, at that time the partial will be done away. When I was a child, I used to speak as a child. I used to reason as a child. I used to care about the things a child cared about. It's kind of my rendering of that. But when I became an adult, I did away with those things. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but one day face to face. Now I know in part, then I will know. If I'm struggling now with discerning what is excellent, I'll know then. By the way, that's a hard word. If you never get it, one day you're going to get it, and it might feel sad. but then I shall know and fully be known just also as I have been fully known but now abide faith, hope and love, these three but the greatest of these is love what is the excellent way? what is excellence? the greatest of these is love and just quickly what flies through my mind as I think of the walls I put the ladders of my life against, how often love, which here says is going to be the one thing that lasts forever, think with me how often that's the first thing right now you're willing to let go of. You ever think about that? How love sometimes is the first thing you're willing to let go of to get this thing you really want. When that's the only thing that mattered, what you just let go. But the greatest of these is love. And now pull it back to Philippians as I close. And this I pray. That you would be able to discern that that is true. That what is true? That the greatest thing really is love. And this I pray. That you would be able to do more than just discern that what is excellent is love, this I pray that you would be able to choose. Love. And this I pray that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge of what love is and in real knowledge of what people are like in order that you may be a people who are not walking blindly through life, but that you be a people who can discern and then choose the things that matter most. And the greatest of things that matter most is love. I'd like to close this week the same way I closed last week, with an invitation. Two invitations, though. The first invitation is that I would invite you to invite God into bringing life into this egg that has just been laid, this seed that has been planted. With all of your desire to rush this, with all of some of your desires to crush this, would you just now invite God into doing a deep work in you? And the second invitation is exactly what I said last week, that you join me in making Paul's prayer your prayer. And this I pray, that my love would abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment, so that I would be able to discern and then to choose the things that matter most. Would you stand with me as we close? I'm going to ask the altar ministry to come and meet with those of you who need individual prayer. I'm going to do again this morning what we've been doing these last weeks and months, and that is just be down here. We're going to have a time of prayer. The rest of you will be dismissed. But I want to pray. I want to just pray over this whole thing first. Let's pray together. Jesus, I have among many senses just this sense that to get into this as deeply as I think we need to go, it is deeper than we can go. And to get our arms around as wide as this word to us would extend, it's too wide for us to reach. And so Jesus, in every way we know how that would release the work of your spirit among us, I pray that your spirit would be powerfully at work to do this deep work. Some of us will from time to time as we hear the words coming out of 1 Corinthians relative to Philippians 1. I want to rush it and maybe even come dangerously close to breaking the egg. I just pray you protect us. Some of us, God, might hear things from time to time that we don't fully understand yet. and maybe we fully understand them, and it just bumps up against so much of our own rage that we just want to crush it. God, I pray you'd protect us around that as well. But I pray, Father, that from this seed you're planting, you would bear fruit, that we would indeed be a people full of the fruit of righteousness. Not a legalistic performance, external show for everybody else to be somehow thinking we're something hot, but the fruit of righteousness in us, your people in this place, what a thing that would be. Give us courage now just to pray the prayer, just to let you in. In Jesus' name, I pray these things. Amen.
