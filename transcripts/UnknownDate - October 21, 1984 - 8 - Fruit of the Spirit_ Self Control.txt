Open your Bibles to the book of Galatians, chapter 5. This has been, for me, a very helpful study. As we've gone through Galatians, the book itself has been exciting to me. I feel like I've had my understanding of the gospel, of grace, of my relationship to the Lord deep and profoundly by the things I've learned in this book. And it's as if this little series we've done and gone very slowly through the fruit of the Spirit has really kind of been the crowning effort of this whole thing, as in a real practical way, we've brought some of these theological concepts and placed them into our living. We're concluding them this morning. Chapter 5, we would start in verse 16 just to stay with the context. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. For these are in opposition to one another so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you're led by the Spirit, you're not under the law. Now, the deeds of the flesh are obvious. They're evident. Which are these? Immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, which simply means that list is not exhaustive. There's more things like these, of which I forewarn you just as I have forewarned you that those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God, but the fruit of the Spirit, the evidence of the Spirit walk, the evidence that you are doing what Paul told us to do in verse 16 is this, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control, self-control. Let's look to the Lord as we begin. I get to this point Father every Sunday morning and I feel exactly the same way a real sense of exhilaration flows through me as we are dealing with your word to us and because very much for me the worship because of the worship we've had this morning my heart is really full and it's hard to contain. I would simply ask this, that as we continue this time we have together this morning, getting into your word that your spirit would continue to touch and to move and to change us into the very image of your son. By your spirit, in Jesus' name, amen. Self-control, self-discipline is one of the things you might call it. It's very intriguing to me to consider the fact that self-control is one of the very important aspects of the fruit of the Spirit. I'll be very honest with you, when we were going through these aspects, I was a little bit frightened about coming to self-control. Not that I don't think it's important or don't think that I could think of something to say about it, but really, how do you integrate the concept of self-control and spirit control? Spirit control has been the theme of our entire study from the book of Galatians months ago. How do you integrate self-control with spirit control? It kind of sounds like maybe when we come to self-control, we'll take everything back and say, just kidding, it's really up to you. Some people have real problems with self-control. One of the problems I think we have in terms of understanding self-control is that we never do try to integrate it with spirit control. But very often people have problems when you start talking about discipline. They start thinking that you're dealing with debilitating restraint. You're legalistic whenever you talk about self-control. I could see being accused of being many things, but I don't think many people would accuse me of being legalistic. Not after Galatians. What about freedom, though? What about all these kinds of things we've been talking about and reconciling them, integrating them with this concept of self-control? this may be one of the most important aspects of all the fruit of the spirit that we've dealt with I believe it may be one of the most important because of these two facts one because of the fact that we may have a tendency to ignore this one how many sermons have you ever heard on self control millions how many sermons have you ever heard on self-control self-discipline that really was integrated with our freedom that really was integrated with spirit control I haven't heard very many. I've never really gone into it myself to try to reconcile those things. But there's another reason this aspect of the fruit of the Spirit to me is vital. And that is because of what I would call the spirit of the age. The spirit of the age is simply this. Do what you feel. Do your own thing. If it feels good, do it. The wisdom that is handed down from the spirit of the age, from generation to generation, if I were to put it in a little capsule and give you a little cliche, it would go like this. Let your glands be your guide. If it feels good, do it. Pay attention. Here's the wisdom from the spirit of the age. Pay attention to your impulses. Let them govern your life. If you see something you want, buy it. If you see something you like, eat it. It's great. If you see something that you need, take it. If you see something you don't like, Destroy it. Write all over it. Ignore it. Ridicule it. If you see, if you're doing something you don't like doing, forget it. If you find yourself in the middle of a task that's a little bit difficult, drop it. Do what you feel. Take what you want. Self-control. Self-discipline. I think every one of us recognize when we begin to talk about self-discipline, we recognize the fact that the person who is simply living his life in response to every little impulse that comes to him, every little glandular secretion that tells him, I really need that thing. People who live like that, and by the way, people who do live like that generally live like that in the name of freedom. See, I can just do whatever I want and I can just feel whatever I want to feel and I can just go wherever I want to go because I'm free to just express myself fully. I think most of us are sophisticated enough to realize that people who live their lives, who let their glands be their guide, are not free at all. They're in bondage to their glands. They're in bondage to their impulses. The thing that tells them what to do and where to go and how to think and how to react are their impulses, are their emotions. They're in bondage to their little glandular things, you know, just kind of moving all over the place like little puppets to themselves. when we talk about self-discipline we need to understand something else too we need to understand that when we talk about this in the realm of being just a healthy person this is not just a Christian virtue people who deal with healthy kinds of attitudes understand very well in the world that self-discipline is a real important part of health Epictetus, the Greek philosopher, said this No person is really free who cannot control himself If you are a victim of your impulses Of every little thing you feel like you just have to have Then you are not a free person You are in bondage to all of your impulses You're not a free person Secular people understand that Some people are totally controlled by their emotions No control They are totally controlled by their impulses. They are totally controlled by circumstances around them. If something is going wrong at all, they just come unglued. They have no inner strength at all. They're dominated by things outside themselves or even their own passions. All of us struggle with this at some point. Self-control. I remember the time that I was first introduced to this concept. I was in third grade and I brought a report card home. It was great On one side, you know, you get the grades for math and writing and spelling And all these other things, and they get A, B, C, D, F On the other side of the report card I never got in a lot of trouble with the grades It was the other side that I used to get in trouble all the time The other side had this thing at the top that said conduct And one of the little conduct things that they were always checking you up on Was this thing called self-control And if you weren't real good at self-control You got a little check from third grade to eighth grade, and that was when they quit doing it, I got checks for self-control. What that meant was, I figured it all out. What that meant, and I realized right away what the problem was. The problem was this. My teacher didn't have a sense of humor. Because I know that was the problem because I really had good stuff. She couldn't take a joke. But, you see, See, the thing is, later I discovered that she had a wonderful sense of humor, but she knew something that I didn't. What she knew that I didn't was this. There is a time to laugh, and there is a time to refrain from laughing. And there is a time to work, and there is a time to refrain from working. And my perception on life in third grade was this. It is always the right time to laugh. And I used to get checks in self-control. There are more serious dimensions of that, though. There are dimensions of our life where if we do not ever have self-discipline, they can mark our lives for life emotionally. You ever find yourself saying something like this, I just lost my cool. I just lost my cool. We say things sometimes to people, and we look back on what we did, and we go, I didn't mean that. I didn't mean to say that. Sometimes the things that come pouring out of our mouths are full of venom and full of hate, and the kind of wound we inflict is something that does not heal very quickly. Sometimes it is to a friend, sometimes it's to a brother or a sister in Christ, and with one word, a relationship sometimes is severed for months or even years, and sometimes forever. Sometimes with our wives or with our kids, we say things that bite and devour, and it hurts. No control. No control. You wonder, where did that come from? And you were just in bondage to that emotional, boom, it controlled you. It dominated you. The Greeks, when they would speak of self-control, they had three specific areas that they saw the need for self-control being really pronounced. That was in the area of sex. Whenever they spoke of self-control, it was in regard to sexual things, it was in regard to gluttony, that's kind of interesting, it was in regard to gluttony, and it was also in regard to the tongue. Sex, gluttony, and the tongue. Self-control, those three areas are what the Greek thought of. James chapter 3 verse 6 says this, The tongue is a fire. The very world of iniquity. The tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body and sets on fire the course of our life. And it comes straight from hell. Some people are driven, are dominated, are controlled by their emotions, by circumstances, by people. And they're just surly. They get touched off with nothing. Self-control. There is none. There is none. Sometimes it even comes in the area of managing our time. I think every one of us can relate to that. But sometimes, I remember in my family, my mother could never be on time. It was incredible. Just never, couldn't do it. Managing our time. You know, we could talk about all sorts of things in terms of just a real simple area in our life like that. Being able to be prompt to something indicates real clearly a lack of control. It means something outside me is controlling my life. I am incapable of handling that. I think it's real clear that we don't have to go very far to find undisciplined people to find dull thinking to find flabby bodies to find distorted emotions to find perverted values people who are governed dominated by their desires their whims their passions their impulses Christianity Today in the October 7th issue said this and I quote that the self-control is the forgotten fruit of the spirit Self-control is the forgotten fruit of the Spirit And again, he said this It is the blight of the church So Christians are not exempt Okay, there's the problem Self-control And I just would ask you a question After all of that, do you feel duly chastised? Do you? Do you feel really that Oh boy, I better be more disciplined Do you? If you need some more, I can give you some more You ready? I mean, I can motivate you a little bit more With a lot of this stuff You bunch of unrestrained hedonists You fleshy, flabby people you degenerate, undisciplined, undisciplined. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what. Oh, I didn't discipline myself very well when I was doing this. You undisciplined dregs. I wanted to say that so bad. You know, stomach in, chest out, eyes straight ahead. What are you slouching for? Get up, get some discipline into this church. I'm out, hold it, hold it. You know, I can feel myself when we get into something like this already. You know, I started this sermon by saying we need to integrate the spirit walk with self-control. And as I begin to focus on nothing but self-control, all of a sudden we're moving into some things that would indicate I'm not going to talk about the spirit control at all. Just kind of get a big pep talk here and get you all pumped up to discipline yourself. We need to back off here for a minute. Consider what we've been doing every time we've gone through this when we've done a fruit of the spirit is, first of all, get a solid definition. It is impossible to make appropriate applications unless I know what I'm talking about. Solid definitions. Examine the counterfeits. There are innumerable counterfeits to this particular fruit. And thirdly, integrate the concepts. And I've been mentioning that. Meshing what it means to be self-controlled with spirit control. Point number one, a definition. I encourage you to take notes. I think there are some real helpful things. What I want to do for you this morning, this is basically what I always do, but I deal with a concept like self-control or love or anything else. and you just look at it and then you try to find ways to make that concept begin to be a little broader, a little deeper, get a little bit better picture of it and we put all sorts of things together. Hopefully by the end, we've got a real grasp of it. The Greek helps. It isn't the end in itself. I mean, it doesn't just solve the problem but it begins to paint the picture. So I want you to come along in this process we're going through. The word in the Greek is this, ekratea. The root of that word means this, power to rule. Think on that. Write it down. As we go through this, that's going to make even more sense. The root of that word means power to rule. So, if I'm talking about self-control, and I'm using that word literally, what it would mean would be this. Self-control is this, having the power to rule myself. Okay? Having the power to rule myself. That means that my impulses and my situations and my circumstances and the people around me and the food in my kitchen do not rule my life. I have self-control. I have power to rule over them. Guy cuts me off in the highway and I have power to rule how I respond to that. He is not going to ruin my day. We talked about this extensively on Wednesday night when we went through this thing. But he, if he cuts me off on the highway and I go berserk, I have just given him all sorts of power to rule me, to ruin my day. Self-control is power to rule myself, my responses. It also means this in the Greek. By the way, it means several things. There's shades of meaning. That's what helps the picture get better. It means inwardly strong, inwardly strong. So I have this. I have power to rule. I have an inner strength. When I think of inner strength, connected with that first concept, power to rule, I begin to get a picture that sounds, when somebody has self-control, I think I'm talking about someone who has a strong sense of independence. Okay? Along with this word is a strong sense of independence. I am not a slave to, and I am not governed by anything or anyone. Got that? I'm not a slave to or governed by anything or anyone. I may be in a difficult circumstance. I may be around obnoxious people who ruin my day. Inner strength. Power to rule. Self-control means that even if I'm around obnoxious people, negative, the kicker for me, being around negative people drives me nuts. And they ruin my day. You know, they said a negative thing and now I'm all done like this. Self-control says I've got enough inside me to be okay whether they're not or not. I'm not governed by, ruled by them. Wayne Dyer, real popular psychologist these days, wrote a book called Pull Your Own Strings. And I believe that much of what I read in that book was simply this, a secular reading of biblical principles. You're in charge of your own responses and responsible for them. Kittle said this in dealing with how the Greek dealt with self-control. He said this, to a Greek, a self-disciplined person was one who in self-restraint, listen, maintained his freedom in the face of evil delights. That's a real powerful concept. He maintained his freedom in the face of evil delights. That thing is not going to govern me. That thing, my impulses are not going to tell me what to do. 1 Corinthians 9, 24, we start getting biblical. Paul says this, Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win. And everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. Therefore, I run in such a way as not without aim. I box in such a way as not beating the air. Here, verse 27, the key. But I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest possibly after I have preached to others, I myself should be disqualified. The thing I want to focus on there at this point is this. I buffet my body and make it my slave. Excuse me. The converse of that would be this. That I wouldn't buffet my body, I wouldn't discipline myself, and I would be its slave. He is saying here, I have looked at my body, my physical body, and determined that my body is here to serve me. I am not here to serve my body. My body doesn't tell me what to do, I tell it. That sounds independent. My body doesn't tell me what to do, I tell it. That sounds independently, innerly strong, power to rule. I mean, I hear the Rocky theme, you know, the Apostle Paul. I don't tell it. I mean, he doesn't tell me. I tell it. Buffer my body. Strong, independent. Ta-da. My body comes to me and it gives me a message. It says this. A little more sleep. We're going to deal with this tonight. A little more sleep. A little more slumber. A little more folding of the hands. And I go, okay. Okay. I don't have any power to rule my body. Okay. And I do it. No. Independently strong says, no, I'm getting up. Ta-da-da-da. Okay. By the way, that's where they got your little song. Ta-da-da-da. You had to be here. I'm not going into it. My body comes to me and it says, eat that piece of pie. You have to have it. And I go, okay. You know, I'm just ruled by it. You know, it dominates me. I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it. I was dominated by it. Self-control says I choose whether to or not. My body doesn't tell me what to do. I tell it. Self-control, power to rule, inwardly, independently strong. Neat definitions. Helped me a lot. But as I go through this process, got to come into my process again here, I got a problem arising. You see, I could see myself at this point in our sermon again getting off track, soaring into a magnificent dissertation on what it means to deny yourself, grit your teeth, crack the whip, and we would miss something very, very important if I did that. The very, very important thing we would miss would be this, the point. And the point is a very important thing not to miss. Wouldn't you agree? I hope. See, the whole point of this text, not just this word, but this entire text that we have been discussing is this. If you walk by the Spirit, you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. If you walk according to the Spirit, discipline will be the result. That sounds so mushy. I mean, there's got to be something I do. Yes, there is. but we need to understand that undisciplined Christian living undisciplined Christian people if I want if you're undisciplined this morning and my intention or the word of God's intention is to introduce you to discipline the point would not be to stir up in you all sorts of teeth gritting behavior okay I better get going that wouldn't be it that would be a fruit of your work that wouldn't be a fruit of the flesh I mean that wouldn't be a fruit of the spirit and if we don't integrate again I've been saying this from the beginning if we don't integrate and we just talk about self-control you're going to have all sorts of counterfeits let me introduce you to some right away real quick asceticism would be a counterfeit of the fruit of the spirit which is self-control asceticism is simply this an ascetic is synonym the synonym of that would be self-abasement self-denial self-mortification austerity nothing wrong with austerity nothing wrong with mortification of the flesh, nothing wrong with denial of self, all of that kind of stuff. But asceticism is this. Asceticism is the practice of these things for the purpose of attaining a higher spiritual value. Okay? If I were to be an ascetic, the reason I would be doing what I was doing, the reason I would be buffeting my body, would be because then, after all of that, God would like me. Then I'd be okay. That is nothing less than earning your salvation. Colossians 2, 18 is real tough on that. It says this, Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement, and the worship of angels taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind. Verse 20, at the end of the verse it says, Don't submit yourself to decrees, external legalistic decrees, such as don't handle, don't touch, don't taste. These are matters which have, to be sure, an appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement, and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence. A counterfeit of the fruit of the Spirit that is self-controlled would be asceticism. Just some sort of, oh, I'm just really bad, and I would just mortify the flesh all the time. Another perversion of the fruit of the Spirit that is self-controlled would be legalism. That's real obvious. Matthew 23, verse 23 through 26, Jesus is dealing with the Pharisees, and he says, you guys do great. You're wonderful. You tithe your mint and your dill and your cumin, and you do all your churchy stuff. You are very disciplined in those things. You come to church. It would be the person we talked about last week. Remember when we facetiously spoke of a faithful giver and a faithful attender as one who is just here all the time, but never full of faith. Jesus looks at them and says, oh, you got all sorts of disciplines. You tithe this and you tithe that, and you're always there, but you have neglected the weightier matters of the law, like mercy and justice and love and on and on and on. Self-control is not some external restriction that we place on people to really get them to look like they're holy. It's not true. I want to tell you another counterfeit. I don't really have a word for this. I made one up. It's called absenteeism. It doesn't work, but I want it to rhyme with isms. We have asceticism and we have legalism and now we have absenteeism. What I mean by that is this. I'll tell you what, this is a real good practical way to deal with this. If you're wondering if your disciplined lifestyle is a fruit of the spirit or if it's a fruit of the flesh, a real good way to tell is this. Is your discipline in conjunction with or is it, I'm going to say this, is the disciplined lifestyle you have coupled along with the other fruits? If discipline is the characteristic of your life, but there is no love, and there is no joy, and there is no inner peace, and there is no patience, I guarantee you, whatever it is that you have, it's not a fruit of the Spirit. You may have all sorts of regimentation in your life. You may have all sorts of real firm control of your emotions and your feelings. But if it is not coupled with love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, then you do not... Whatever it is that you have going on in your life is not a result of the Spirit's work. It is your work. It's real possible for people to be real regimented and real disciplined and have nothing to do with God. Classic example would be a marine sergeant. Marine sergeants can be spirit-filled people. Please understand that. But I have a little type. When I think of a marine sergeant, I think of someone who's rigid, who is cold and calculated, who is the epitome, the classic definition of a disciplined person. Their collars are sharp. Their jaws are square. They don't look to the right or to the left. They're real disciplined. If, however, that's all you have and there is no love, joy, peace, gentleness, on and on and on, it's not a fruit of the Spirit. People can do that in the flesh. Not necessarily God-induced at all. Okay. So I've done some stuff here. We've defined it a little bit. I've given you some counterfeits. The question we have to have now, if we're trying to integrate all this stuff, is this. If all that That I mentioned Asceticism, legalism, absenteeism Is a twisting of the fruit of the spirit Is a perversion of the fruit of the spirit How do I straighten it out? How do I integrate the freedom of the spirit walk Into self-discipline? Here we go, ready? It's easy, it's real easy When I say this to you If you've been here, especially the last few weeks When we've gone through this I think it's going to click right now Let me take you back To our definition of what it means to walk by the flesh And walk by the spirit walking according to the flesh simply means this that I live my life on the basis of according to that which is natural what that means is this I live my life according to what I taste touch feel possess and achieve right? that's what the flesh walk is that's what the natural walk is therefore in the flesh life to me is what I taste touch feel possess achieve and have okay? that's what life is to me but also follow then as well that if those things are life to me, if what I taste, touch, feel, possess, and achieve are life to me, then I would do anything to have them. Huh. Get it? If what I taste, touch, feel, possess is life to me, whether it be my job or my family or some relationship or a car or a house, if that is life to me or an athletic endeavor, I would do anything to get it. I would discipline myself. I would sacrifice time. I would sacrifice money. I would sacrifice effort. I would let my body be burned to get what I think I have to have. That anything, I would do anything to get it. That word anything is where discipline is. That word anything is where discipline is. That's discipline. Let me explain. Let's look at an athlete. I know that there are many people here who are athletes. I used to be one. long time ago but I'll tell you something if the goal in your life is to be a good athlete if the goal in your life if life to you is winning if life to you is the glory that comes with that if life to you is that imperishable wreath that crown that imperishable crown anybody here who's ever been involved in athletics of any kind realize that if that really is your desire you know what you'll do anything to get it I would have I remember when I was working out for all these goofy things I thought were so important they were life to me at the time. They were life to me at the time. And I would have done anything to get it. I worked. I beat my body. I lifted weights. It didn't do any good, but I tried like crazy. When I would go into a game and play the game, I would do anything to win. I lost my button. I would do anything to preach a sermon. Hmm. Hey, just remember that. I'd do anything I would do anything I remember when we would play these sports I would just lay my body out I would go berserk it was worth it to me everything I did to get what I thought I had to have was discipline I disciplined my body see the same thing in business the businessman if life to him is money if life to him is power if life to him is position if life to him is security if that thing is life I'll do anything to get it that means I'll buffet my body to get it I'll sacrifice my time I'll sacrifice my family If I have to If that thing is life to me If success in my business Is what tells me I'm okay I'll do anything to get it Discipline Discipline It isn't spirit induced discipline But it's discipline I could get more and more Abased with this kind of thing Those are kind of High lofty ideals But if life to me Is pleasing people If I feel real insecure And it's real important For everybody to like me And oh my goodness I gotta just walk around And make sure everybody Thinks I'm okay and likes me and all this kind of thing, if that's life to me, I'll do anything to make sure you like me. I'll do anything. I'll sacrifice my integrity. I won't be honest with you. I'll pat you on the back when I don't mean it. I'll never confront you. I'll do anything. If life to me is physical pleasure, if the glands are my guide, I'll do anything to get pleased. I'll sacrifice, again, my family, my job, my health, to get it. And we get into the deeds of the flesh. immorality, impurity, sensuality, drunkenness, on and on and on. We could define discipline this way. Again, this isn't necessarily connected with the spirit walk, but we could define discipline this way. The process I am willing to endure, the price I am willing to pay to get that which I want to have. Simple. Discipline is simply the process I am willing to endure, the price I'm willing to pay to get what I think I have to have. But I say, walk by the spirit. And you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. But I say walk by the Spirit. What that means is this. We've gone over this over and over. What that means is this. I realize that while what I taste, touch, feel, possess, achieve is nice, enjoyable, good things. The one who is walking according to the Spirit understands this real clearly. None of those things can give me life. No matter how good and how noble, none of those things that I do can give me life. None of them can give me meaning. It means this, walking according to the Spirit. It means this, life to me is Christ. To gain him is to gain life. To know him is to know life. And you know what? I would do anything to know him. I would do anything to know him better. Philippians 3, I want you to turn. Paul is talking about a time in his life when life to him was all his legalistic endeavors, all of his external performances. And he did it all. Circumcised the eighth day, the tribe of Benjamin, that's the right family, a Hebrew of Hebrews, a Pharisee, a persecutor of the church. And when life to me was being recognized for all the good things I did, I did it. I disciplined myself. I gave myself fully to it. But I've got a different goal now. Whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted loss for the sake of knowing Christ. More than that, I count things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of what? Knowing Christ. And you know what? I'd do anything to know Him. I'd do anything to know Him. I'd buffet my body. I would discipline myself to know Him. This is not some legalistic thing that says, if you do this and this and this, and if you read your Bible so many hours a day, then you'll be okay. That's baloney. That is the wrong approach. That is a fleshy approach. If you've got people to whom life is Christ, you don't have to tell them to read their Bible. If life to them is Christ, they're there. because that's where they find out who he is. Here's my goal, that I may be found in him. Not having a righteousness of my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of working hard. No, on the basis of faith. I put all my achieving aside. I come to him by faith. But you know the lifestyle I adopt now? Because life to me is Christ, more than anything in this world, I want to know him. Here's my ambition, verse 10, that I may know him, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being conformed to his death. Discipline is simply the process I'm willing to go through, the price I'm willing to pay to know him better. Philippians 121, he says, to me to live is Christ, to me to live is Christ. We've heard that verse a million times. He might as well have said, life to me is Christ. life to me is Christ nothing else life to me is Christ picture something here if you would the way we usually try to stir up self-discipline in people picture picture someone coming to the apostle Paul with what we know about him and what we know about his source of life picture someone coming to him in the traditional way we might come to people saying this Paul you really ought to do this and you really ought to do that Paul you really ought to pray and you really ought to get in the Bible and you really ought to serve the Lord. You know what? A guy like Paul, to whom life is Christ, would look at that guy like he came from another planet. What are you telling me that for? What are you telling me I ought to read my Bible? What are you telling me I ought to pray? What are you telling me I ought to serve? Life to me is Christ. I'd do anything to know Him. If we have to prod people to give and if we have to prod people to care and if we have to prod people to serve and to read, you're wasting our time. We are wasting our time. Because when we do that and we just focus on that external behavior, that external lack of self-control, all we do is treat the symptoms. Self-control or lack of same is just a symptom that I am either not walking by the Spirit or I am walking by the Spirit. If life to me is Christ, I'll do anything to know Him better. Spend time in the Word, spend time in prayer, spend time among God's people. That's just what happens. It's the fruit of the Spirit. discipline will be there when I'm walking according to the Spirit I'd like you to refer in your mind back to 1 Corinthians 9 24 through 27 when he likened this whole lifestyle to a runner we run some people run to win a perishable crown but we run to win an imperishable crown when an athlete runs when I remember I can see myself running and working out and things like that and going through all sorts of pain. And in my mind, I would literally go through a process. This is worth it. This is worth it. This is worth it. This is worth it. This is worth it. And I would buffet my body and it would be worth it. And there was a way in which when Jesus says, come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I'll give you rest. My yoke, take my cross upon you. But my yoke is easy and the burden's light. This works with athletics for me. So bear with me if it doesn't for you. But just transfer it to whatever works for you. When my deepest desire was to be a good athlete, whatever it was I had to do was an easy burden was a light yoke you mean it was easy? you never breathed hard it doesn't mean you never breathed hard it never means you didn't work it meant this it meant it was reasonable I was willing to do it I was willing to do it that yoke that burden was reasonable I was willing to take it because life to me was athletics or life to me now is Christ whatever goes along with that I'm willing to do it's easy it's light it means I never breathed hard no it doesn't I give and I care and I serve and so do you when life is Christ. If life isn't Christ, then we try to hit people over the head. You really ought to serve. You really ought to give more money. Yeah. One thing I think you'll notice, I hope you do, is that we don't twist people's arms to serve around here. I am totally, and our elders are committed to the fact that if people aren't willing to serve because life to them is Christ and all of their service and all of their giving comes from a heart that is saying simply this, I'd do anything to know you. I'd do anything to grow. If your service is coming from anything than that, then this isn't even a church. It's just a whole big fat work of the flesh. God doesn't need it and neither do we. Rather let the programs die. That's your definition. That's your definition. The application, I'm not going to spend time on this. We just don't have the time. The application, I've given you application. All through the definition, I gave you application. One thing I'd like you to take a little special note of as we look at self-control, and this is just kind of a way of teaching, just to give you something that's really interesting was to me, is that I want you to notice that when we talk about self-control and everything I've defined here, the antithesis of self-control can be seen in the deeds of the flesh. Okay? Sexual immorality is just blatant lack of self-control. Okay? Immorality, impurity, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, if anything is a lack of self-control, a demonstration of the lack of self-control, it would be that. I just want you to take note of that. It's really interesting. When outbursts of anger are characterizing you, it's a self-control, spirit walk problem. The last thing is this, the cultivation. We've got a definition, the application, the cultivation. What I want to know is this. I'm sitting here Sunday morning, and we're hearing this stuff on self-control, and I understand that life to me is Christ, and if life to me is Christ, discipline will be there because my attitude will be whatever I have to do. I want to know you. How do I cultivate that attitude in me? I am a believer. But I'll tell you something, Dave. Sometimes when I come here on Sunday morning, I get it really pumped up in me, and then I lose it, and I lose my focus. There are times we need to sit back and talk about the kind of mentalities that cultivate this kind of attitude. Two things real quick. Comes down in verse 24 and 25 as we close this whole chapter out. Paul says this, as he wraps up the fruit of the Spirit, now those of us who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. I believe the soil within which these fruits grow and flourish are first of all a soil or an atmosphere that says basically this, I realize whose I am. I realize whose I am. I need as a believer in Jesus Christ to be saturated in the fact, like a plant, like a fruit that would take in things from the atmosphere, I need to saturate myself over and over again with the overpowering awareness of whose I am. Now those who belong to Christ. You belong to Christ. If you're a believer, you belong to Christ. I am his property. That's an awesome concept. It's one that's lost on us unless we dig just a bit. John 17, 24, Jesus and God are conversing. And it indicates in that particular verse that I, David Johnson, an individual, have been given to Christ by God as a gift. He says basically this, I belong to Christ. How do you know that? Because I was given to Christ as a gift from God. Body of Christ. I want you to get a good definition of a body. A body is the means whereby a spiritual entity can function in a physical environment. You got that? A body is the means whereby a spiritual entity can function in a physical body. I was given by the Father, God the Father, to the Son, so that I could be the means of Christ's dwelling on this earth. You got that? That ties in with everything we've said about the spirits living in me. I am the body of Christ. While we are the body of Christ, Christ lives in me. I am the means by which Christ would express himself to the world. I belong to him. I belong to him. We're called the temple. Paul said this. Don't you know that you are the temple of God? Don't you know that your body is the temple of God? Temple is simply a place. the physical trapping in which the high priest does his work. That's exciting to me if you take that theologically. The temple is the place, the physical trapping in which the high priest does his work. My high priest, Jesus Christ himself, living in me, doing his work of ministry in me, and not only in me, we talk about our relationship with the Lord and all the blessings that come to me, but Christ is living in me, I am the temple, he is the priest, and he is expressing himself. All of a sudden, this temple gets to be known as a place where God is. How do you like that? All of a sudden, this temple begins to be associated in whom God lives and in whom the high priest does his work. Pretty soon, this temple gets to be known as a place around whom supernatural things take place, godly things flow. I belong to him. I belong to him. I was given to him by the Father as a gift. His bride. I love this. a wedding, the bride and the father come down the aisle, and I always say these words, who giveth this woman to be married to this man? And in the relationship that Christ is trying to demonstrate between Christ and his church, he uses a bride and a groom. And when that ask question is asked, it never is. But if it were to be asked, God would lean out of heaven. As the question would be asked, who giveth this person to be married to this Christ, God would lean out of heaven and say, I did. I belong to Christ. And every once in a while, I need to get reaffirmed in and saturated in whose I am. And I believe that if we are not exercising self-discipline in our giving, in our coming, in our sharing, in our caring, it's real possible you forgot whose you are, whose you are. Lastly, who you are, who you are. You might have forgotten who you are. Verse 25 is 4. Now those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions, have crucified. We've gone over this so much that I don't want to get into it again because of time, but we've gone over it before too. So I don't want to be redundant. But it basically says this. When you became a believer, you became a new creature. You have a new identity. You have a new value. You have a new purpose in life. I am a son. I am an heir. I am a priest. I am a saint. I am holy and beloved, totally acceptable before God. And verse 25 says this. Okay. you got all that down you know who you are you know who you are then here's my suggestion to you if you live by the Spirit put it right in the vernacular of everything we've done so far literally that means okay friend if you are affirming in your own spirit that life to you is Christ if you live by the Spirit then let us walk by the Spirit I don't want to get into this real deeply either but there is a difference in verse 16 and verse 25 when it says walk by the Spirit in verse 16 what that means is your lifestyle let life to you be Christ okay it is a totally different word in verse 25 when it says walk by the spirit it means there it means to get in line with verse 25 the beginning of the verse assumes that you did what verse 16 commanded got it it says live by the spirit verse 16 literally in the Greek verse 25 says if you do that then let us also walk by the spirit means to be in step with who you are. The result of that is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, on and on, and self-control. And so we end our study. Thank you.
