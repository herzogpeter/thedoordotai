Well, I'm very aware that if this is going to work this morning, it's going to have to be more than my words. It's going to have to be the words of God. So I'm not going to blame him if this doesn't go well. That's not what I'm saying. But I really am very aware that the things of the heart, the deep things of God, aren't about my words, but about him. and so I'd like us to pray and invite him to speak to us this morning. Let's pray. God, give us eyes to see and ears to hear what you would have for us this day. Give us hearts that would receive. Thank you for being who you are and may we see that this day. Amen. Well, over the last several weeks, we've been blessed to have Peter Kapsner lead us on a journey from the book of Genesis to the book of Revelation, showing us and talking to us about the big story of God and how from the very beginning we saw that our God was entirely good and that what he made from the very beginning was entirely good. We learned a new Hebrew word together, didn't we? The word is? Tov. It means good. And if you remember, Peter talked about as we interpret scripture, we need to look at the earliest usage of a word to get at its importance. So just how important is it that we understand this word tov and the good of God? Well, this word is used seven times in the first chapter of the book, laying a foundation, painting a picture, so to speak, that from the very beginning, what comes pouring out of the heart of God is goodness, that what comes oozing out of God is this creative beauty all from the heart of God. Every bit of it comes from who God is, all flowing from the source of all goodness, all beauty and all love, all of creation is this majestic overflow of goodness coming straight from the heart of God. It's so important. Seven times in the first chapter, from the very beginning, we're told that God, the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and the end, the one who was and is and is to come, our God. Who is our God? He is the one who is good, the essence of his being. It's that important. So it should come as no surprise to us that also towards the beginning of the book, we see that Satan plots and initiates a strategy that at its core attacks the goodness of God. That's what he goes after. You know the story from Genesis 3, Adam and Eve. so what does he do? Satan flips it around doesn't he? He flips it and subtly paints God as actually everything that he is making God out to be the one who is selfish the one who lies the one who cares about only himself a God who's all about power and control not looking out for our best interest, but only out for his interest. What a strategy to flip it around. Not only saying you can't trust what he says, but actually going at his heart, at his goodness, at his character, saying you can't trust who he is. It's an all-out assault on the good of God. God is good? Ha! You can't believe that. He's actually playing you for a fool. He's actually holding good things from you. You better not believe him. You better not trust him. In fact, he's angry. You better keep your distance. You better hide. You better play it safe. That's been his strategy from the beginning, and that's his strategy today. His tactics have changed. Like, he doesn't need to do what he did back then. Like, I don't think any of us probably have had him approach us in the form of a snake in the last week or two. Probably not. But I would say he doesn't need to do that because we live not in the garden. We live in a world where questions about God's goodness just flow freely. We're surrounded by questions, attitudes, events, belief systems, ways of living, activities, even some Christian teaching that calls into question whether God's really good or not. leads us to doubt if we can fully trust him. The end result is the same for us as it is for Adam and Eve. You see, as long as we don't see how good God really is, as long as we don't see his true heart, we too will keep our distance. Full of shame and fear, we play it safe. Trusting God with parts of our lives, maybe even most of our lives, but there are these little places, these little parts of us that we protect and we keep a distance, we pretend, we hide, we control, or we give up. A lot of people today believe that you can't really know God or what God is like. God is unknowable. You can't really know. Well, if that's the case, I would say then that God is not good because a truly good God wouldn't do that to people. A truly good God would want to be known and would want to know. A truly good God would reveal himself, making himself known to people. So is it possible to really know what God is like? We live in a world where everyone has an opinion about this. Everyone can tell you what they think God is like. Everyone can paint a picture for you. But how do we know? Where do we start? What I love about this is that it's not a random guessing game. It's not a subjective speculation. God is good. He wouldn't do that to us. Instead, God reveals himself, taking away the questions of where do we start? Where do we look? We can know what God is really like, and it's not that hard. We look at Jesus. Scripture is explicitly clear. You want to know what God is like? Excuse me. You want to know what God is like? Look at Jesus. Look at him. The sun is the image of the invisible God. Okay, Al, I get it. Jesus is the image of the invisible God, but he's not exactly like God, right? He's an image of God. He's not exactly like God. Well, Scripture couldn't be more clear. The sun is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being. The way we know what God is like is by looking at the God that is revealed to us in and through Jesus Christ. We have to look at Jesus. In Jesus, we get the true picture of God. In Jesus, we find out that God is for us, that God moves towards us, that God will do whatever it takes for us to be able to be near him, that God will stop at nothing in order to create a way for us to experience his goodness. And Jesus, we learn that in spite of everything, in spite of everything in our lives, he continues to love us with a never stopping, never giving up, unbreaking, always and forever love. And even though we forget him, don't we? And we wander away. He is always waiting with arms wide open for us to come home. That's the goodness of God. It's who he is. It's his nature. To know what God is like, we shine a spotlight on Jesus, put him center stage and we shine a spotlight on him and we look at Jesus. But then we take that spotlight, don't we? We take that spotlight and we turn that beam and we make it like a laser pinpoint. We take it and we put it right on Jesus, but we look at the specific spot because we realize that while Jesus' entire life is a revelation of the heart of God, his life is also building towards this grand finale. This life is building towards this, it's like a symphony and it's the crescendo. It's like a firework display and it's the grand finale and you can't take your eyes off of it is because we see that the heart of God is ultimately displayed. once and for all, in an epic display, fully displayed on the cross. That is the heart of our God, the cross, the wonderful cross. Words can't express what the cross means to us. There's a mystery and there's a beauty in the cross, but we have to try to catch a vision. We have to try to press in and see how amazing it is. It's brilliant. It's so amazing. Follow this. you remember Satan's strategy to twist it around and make God out to be the selfish one, right? To make God out to be the one that is not good, the one who cares only about himself. It gets so rich and so beautiful right here. For centuries, Satan has been spreading these lies, causing people to doubt, lies about the heart of God, deceiving people, painting God to be the self-centered one. But at the cross, at the cross, All truth is revealed about everything. At the cross, Satan is seen for who he really is, for he is the one who's been tirelessly at work, planning and scheming and manipulating, full of rage and hatred and anger, doing whatever it takes to see Jesus, an innocent one, put to death. The hatred, the evil. Colossians 2 says that having disarmed the powers and authorities, he, meaning Jesus, made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. He made a public spectacle of Satan. How? By exposing him. Can you imagine what it must have been like to be this one who's for years is just convincing people and showing that God is it and then to find out, no, you are the one that's full of rage, hatred, selfishness. You're the one. After years of lying about God, saying God is self-centered, angry, full of himself, the whole time Satan is pushing for the cross, having no idea that at the cross it would all blow up in his face and that he'd be exposed as the fraud and completely humiliated. Everyone would know that he is entirely evil while at the exact same time the heart of God is revealed. For the first time to this extent, the fullness of who God is, not just a God of love, but a God of a special kind of love, the deepest, richest, purest, supremest form of love, selfless, sacrificial love. And not just for those who love him back, but for the entire world, even those who are directly opposed to him. At the cross, the heart of God is definitively revealed as being entirely good. This is the character of God, the nature of God, the essence of who God is, revealed to us for all to see. Any question about the heart of God being good, any wondering about the heart of God being good, Look at the cross. Today, look at Jesus. Self-centered? No. Try selfless. Only caring about his own needs? No. Caring about everyone else's but his needs. Withholding his love and goodness from you? He's pouring it out. This is the heart of God on display. Jesus is saying with his entire life, look at me if you wanna know what God is like. And then in one supreme demonstration of sacrificial love, Jesus puts on an epic display of the heart of God and it is entirely good. The cross is God's deepest, truest and unsurpassable self-revelation. In the face of all of Satan's lies and deceptions, right in the face of it, intended to paint him out as being the one who is selfish, Jesus faces every single one of those lies and simply says, watch me. Watch me. This is who I am. And the goodness of God takes center stage. And the debate over the heart of God, with three simple words, Jesus drops the mic. It is finished. When it comes to the heart of God, the definitive statement has been spoken. The decisive blow has been dealt. The final word has been made. But it gets even better, folks. It gets even better. You see, the heart of God that was displayed on the cross that day is the heart of God right now, at this very minute, at this very moment. That is the heart of God for you and for me. It isn't some event that just happened back there that took care of our sin issue. It's who he is and it's right now who he is. The invitation is still the same for us today. Will you trust my goodness? So what would it mean for you and for me to experience that heart of God for us today? What would it mean for us to trust the heart of God, that he is really that good? For the first many years of my life, the reason I would look at the cross and what Jesus did was because of my sin. And I would run to the cross with my sin, seeking forgiveness. And you know what? That's a really good reason to go to the cross. You may be here today and you maybe have never experienced that in your life. And you need to know if you are carrying a weight of sin and you have all these regrets in your life and you look and you go, I can't fix this. You're right, you can't. Your sin needs to be dealt with. And the heart of God dealt with it on the cross. In this very day, you can bring that to the cross. But Jesus doesn't just want to take away our sin. He's bigger than that. He's more than that. He wants his goodness to permeate every part of our life. Every bit of us. And we all have those places of pain, of frustration, of fear, of disappointment or hurt. We all have those places where maybe we've given him access to most of us, but boy, it's really hard when you start pushing there, God. I think there are places in my life, I know there are, where I resist the goodness of God. And the reason I resist the goodness of God is because I know that if I let the goodness of God in there, it's gonna change me. And quite honestly, I don't know that I wanna change. Quite honestly, there's some things that may not be right, but I kinda need them to survive. It's kinda how I do life. Maybe you would feel the same way. Some might sit here and you'd say, I see that if I let the goodness of God into every part of me, I'm guessing his goodness won't leave me any room to feel superior to others. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm actually a quite humble person, and I don't do it very often. And when I do do it, I don't let anybody else see, but there are times if I'm feeling kind of a certain way in life, I kind of like to look around and kind of see that compared to everyone else, I'm doing okay. I think I might not be able to do that anymore. You know, I think God would like to bring his goodness to my work. But if he does, I guess, my guess is that his goodness isn't going to leave much room for some of the things that I kind of have to do to get my work done and to be successful at it. I mean, I wouldn't exactly call it lying, but sometimes I have to, you know, kind of succeed by alternative methods. It's kind of what I have to do. It's how I get things done. If I bring my anger to God, I'm gonna, I could get hurt again, and I've been hurt so badly that if I bring my anger to God and I can't grab that anger to protect myself, who's gonna protect me? And you know what? I like what you're saying, but honestly, if God really knew how badly I was hurt, he would understand. Look at the cross. Look at the cross. He understands. It's who he is. And he's still inviting you and me. This issue of pain and hurt and disappointment, I think is a real thing for all of us. It keeps us from letting God into the certain parts. Let me get really, okay, I'm gonna get really personal with you. And I'm doing it in just this really fun way because this is all really kind of brand new to me, like a week old. And so I feel like I've been somewhat of a failure most of my life with this. And so I'm gonna be vulnerable. How much sense does that make? But I'm going to do it because I just know that every person in this room, we're on the same journey together and life is hard. And there's painful things that we experience. And I think those things do keep us from God. If you've been around here very long, you know that my journey is a journey that involves pain. It does. My mom and I were in a car accident and most of you know that my mom was killed. and I've spent an enormous amount of time in my life wrestling out all this goodness of God stuff. Come on, God, how can this be? And all the big questions, wrestling it out and the pain that I experienced from that and wrestling it out and wrestling it out. And I came to a place and I've been at this place by his grace and by his mercy where I've come to receive some wonderful things about the goodness of God. I'm just some really powerful things that have changed me and continue to change me. And I've come to believe that he is good. I've come to believe that he was there that day, watching over me. I've come to believe that he's been with me. I've come to believe that there's a day when he'll set everything right. And so I was feeling pretty good about myself. But the goodness of God goes deeper. So last week is a part of a retreat that a few of us pastors attended. The gentleman who was speaking began talking about the cross and how it reveals God to us. And then he talked about this little phrase that shows up all through the New Testament that I've read hundreds of times and I haven't thought all that much about it. But there's this little phrase about Christ in you. It's all through the New Testament. I've thought a lot about me being in Christ. I haven't thought a lot about Christ being in me. And this gentleman, as a gift to God, I believe, started to share and he said this, basically, this is how it landed on me. I don't know if this is exactly what he said, but basically he said this. Could it be that this little phrase of Christ in you means that Christ was in you? He wasn't just there that day as an observer watching over he was in you he felt every bit of your pain because he was in you he experienced it with you all your hurt all of your sadness that's a whole different level of goodness than I've been thinking about and so I've got a lot of work to do. I've got some sitting with God to do and maybe you do too. Could it be that if we really believe that Christ is in us, that his real presence is in us, that he hasn't just been watching over you, he's in you experiencing your life with you. I know it's mysterious, but I got to believe that there's more to this verse in Isaiah when it says, surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering. Not just on the cross 2,000 years ago. He's in us. He's that good. And you know what? That scares me. Because if I have to go there with the goodness of God, that starts to feel really out of control to me. And that's my invitation. And that's the question for us today as we come to the real presence of God at this table is where in your life, where does that sacrificial, selfless love of God need to enter in? Maybe it's not because you're ashamed or feeling sinful or in pain. Maybe it's just because you didn't know he was all that interested. in certain parts of your life. Maybe you didn't, you know, it's kind of like we sometimes just think, well, that's kind of my responsibility. I don't know that God would necessarily want anything to do with that. I mean, as parents, right? Parents, it's our job to raise our kids. Seriously? You think you know what you're doing? As a parent, I'm going, oh God, oh God, help me not mess up this kid, right? I need the goodness of God in me, living through me, in my marriage, in my job, in my neighbors, in my life, in the deep things. I need the goodness of God. I need the real presence of God in every part of my life. Maybe a great question to ask yourself would be, where are you working really, really hard to come up with a strategy of life? Because you're kind of on your own and it's kind of up to you. Because the real presence of God and the goodness of God would say, I don't want you to be on your own. I want to be really present to you, in it, with you. You see, if God is really this good right here, right now, today, if the cross was more than just an event that happened that took care of our sin, if his heart for us right now, right here today, really is this good, then we've got nothing to hide. We've got nothing to lose. And we've got nothing to prove. We can be exposed. Knowing that we are fully embraced and loved, knowing that it is a selfless, sacrificial love that none can compare to. So here's the invitation. Many of us around here have found that it's actually quite helpful and more personal if we can actually name that place. If we can actually name that place where I need the real presence of God here and to say it out loud, to name it. And maybe that would be helpful for you as well. So today we're gonna do something a little bit different and we're gonna invite you to do it if you so choose. And that is that on your way to the table this morning, which by the way is a beautiful symbol of Christ being in us. That by faith we receive the elements that aren't truly, that aren't his body and his blood, but there's a mystery in the table that says somehow or another, these symbolize the life of God, the life of Jesus, that he really is in me. I don't doubt that I'm actually putting something in my mouth and it's going in me, but he's more real than that. He is really in me. Christ in you the table is a beautiful picture of his sacrifice on the cross and his real presence available to us this very day and so what we've done is here on the stage up front on the stage are some blank cards and some pens and if you want to write down if you want to name it if you want to say this is where I need the real presence of God the good, good presence of God in my life. If you want to write it down, write it down. And you're writing it down not as a way of saying, so this is going to be like a magic trick that takes care of everything. You're writing it down as a way of saying, I see it, God. I'm asking, God. I know it. And I'm coming. I don't want to be in this alone anymore. I'm asking for your real presence in this part of my life, in this relationship, in this addiction, in this marriage, in this whatever your thing is the real presence of God is available to you this day and so you come up and you take a piece of paper and you write it down you name it and then as you go to the table on your way to the table you pass the cross and you may want to stay at the cross for a little bit but you sure don't have to you can just walk by and just drop it at the foot of the cross we're dropping it there today as a way of saying I know this is what I'm asking I need the real presence of God the good good presence of God and so we invite you to do that today this is where if you're carrying that sin that we talked about earlier you write it on the card and you go to the cross you go to Jesus his real presence you can trust him simply drop a card at the cross and then receive at the beautiful table receive this unspeakable selfless sacrificial love for you today I want to invite the communion stewards to come and as they do I just want to have a brief moment of silence and then I'm going to pray and just know that this day the presence of God is here He is real and He invites you to come and receive from Him let's pray and as I pray I just remind you as well that if somewhere in this the spirit of God moves you that you need to pray with someone or talk with someone there will be a prayer team down front as well the prayer ministers wear a purple cord and so you know around their necks, you know who they are. But we invite you to come this day. Holy Spirit of God, give us eyes to see and ears to hear your goodness, that you are so for us. And God, maybe you want to even open our eyes to your goodness that goes much deeper than we dreamed before, that maybe you have been with us in a way closer than we've ever dreamed. help us to see you and know you this day
