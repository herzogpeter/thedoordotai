Let's pray, okay, as we move to the ministry of the Word this morning. For the kind of life and energy and power that can only be generated by your Holy Spirit, I pray be released into and through this word, and I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. Book of the Acts, the Acts of the Apostles, what I think could be more accurately termed as the Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles. Today, the second chapter, the first verse, where today we come to an event in the life of the church that is viewed by most as the birth of the church of Jesus Christ, which makes this text pretty significant when the Spirit comes with power. We call it Pentecost, and think of Pentecostal power because today, on this Pentecostal day, the wait that we've been talking about for the last several weeks is over. That space between the power or the promise of power and the fulfillment of power has been removed. It's been filled in because today the promise of the Father that Jesus said would be the Holy Spirit, but not just the Spirit, but the baptism of the Spirit that brings power arrives. And among the most fascinating things that we're going to discover about this event is this historically verifiable fact. That 2,000 years ago, in a day that was known by first century Jews as Pentecost, there was a small band of uneducated and uncultured men and women from a marginal class, from a marginal people group in the Roman Empire who had absolutely no political power. They had no economic, educational, or cultural power. They had no social status or political platform from which to wield power. But who, within two centuries of Acts chapter 2, not only turned Jerusalem upside down, but they changed the world. They're becoming one of the most influential forces in the Roman Empire by the time of Constantine in the second century. And it all began in Acts chapter 2, beginning in the first verse. Let's read it together. And when the day of Pentecost had come. They were all together in one place That is the 120 of them that we were introduced to last week And suddenly there came from heaven a noise Like a violent rushing wind And it filled the whole house where they were sitting And there appeared to them tongues as a fire distributing themselves And they rested on each one of them And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit And began to speak with other tongues As the Spirit was giving them utterance And there were Jews living in Jerusalem Devout men from every nation under heaven The nations were in Jerusalem that day, and when the sound occurred, the multitude came together and were bewildered because they were each one hearing him speak in his own language, and they were amazed and marveled, saying, why are not all these speaking Galileans? Galileans don't know other languages. They don't even speak their own language very well. And how is it that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born? and Parthians and Medes, Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the districts of Libya, around Cyrene, and the visitors and visitors of Rome, even. Both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs, we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God. And they continued in amazement, great perplexity, saying to one another, what does this mean? Others were mocking, however. This is a bunch of baloney. These guys must be loaded, full of sweet wine. But Peter, taking a stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them, men of Judea, and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words. For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day. Indeed, this is something far more significant than that, for this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel. And it shall be in the last days, God says. I will pour forth my spirit on all mankind, and your sons and daughters shall prophesy. Your young men will see visions, old men will dream dreams. even upon my bond slaves, both men and women, I will in those days pour forth my spirit and they will prophesy. And I will grant wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth beneath, blood and fire and vapor of smoke. The sun shall be turned to darkness, the moon into blood before the great and glorious day of the Lord shall come and it shall be that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Wow. All of that, if you just read it the way I just read, it sounds a bit like the stuff of science fiction, actually. Blood and fire, vapor of smoke, indeed, a word that some might use would be not just science fiction. To some it sounds like fiction, actually, because it actually makes you wonder how much of this is real, as in literal blood and fire, vapor of smoke, and how much of this is symbol when the moon turns to blood. We know for sure, digging into this, that some of this is metaphor. The language of metaphor, actually, is the best language to access transcendent things because it wasn't a violent rushing wind. It was a sound like a violent rushing wind, and it wasn't tongues of fire that rested. It was tongues as of fire, something like tongues as of fire resting on them, which doesn't mean it wasn't real because something very real happened that day, and it's been reverberating and rippling out for the last 2,000 years, Pentecost. Pentecost. An event that some people in our day, at least some Christians, believe happened for the very first time right here in Acts chapter 2. Indeed, some in our day make reference to Pentecostal power, and when they do, they're almost always making reference to some charismatic expression of the Holy Spirit marked often, if not always, by speaking in tongues and other ecstatic and euphoric experiences and expressions of the Holy Spirit's power and presence, all of which actually, under certain circumstances, can be legitimate manifestations of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit's power. And when they are legitimate, we call it Pentecostal power, as in Acts chapter 2. But here's what I want you to understand as today we just begin to kind of wade into this text, and it's this, that Pentecost was already Pentecost before Pentecost. Sounds weird. Let me say it this way. That the day of Pentecost, referred to in verse 1, was already the day of Pentecost before Acts chapter 2, verse 1. A fact that we really need to understand before I think we can really understand what's happening here in Acts chapter 2, because what's happening here is marvelous. But it may actually be bigger and better and richer than we know, rooted as it is in Pentecost. So actually what I want to do this morning is deal with the text. Actually, in the bigger picture, what I want to talk about, what I want to teach this morning is about Pentecost. Because when the day of Pentecost had come, Acts chapter 2, verse 1, it was already, before Acts chapter 2, verse 1, a very special day in the life of first century Jews because it was a feast day. Indeed, it was one of three pilgrimage feast days that the entire household of Israel would participate in, which explains actually why Jerusalem on this particular day was filled with people because they had all made pilgrimage from wherever they lived, wanting to be in Jerusalem for this very special day, for this feast day, this day they called Pentecost. And it was always the same time every year, this Pentecost day, 50 days after Passover. Passover, very significant time, day, season, celebration in the life of Jews. Pentecost, 50 days later, happened every year, 50 days after Pentecost. So you can mark it and look forward to it like you would any feast day, like we do Thanksgiving, like we do Christmas. Indeed, the word Pentecost comes from the word penta, which is five. Pentecost is the 50th or the 50th day. And on the 50th day after Pentecost, there would be this feast day that they would celebrate and remember actually a number of things that I'm going to unpack for you this morning. And the first thing that they were celebrating in this 50 days after Passover celebration was God's provision. which referred to, first of all, I think, in Exodus 23 as the feast of the harvest. It says this also, you shall observe the feast of the harvest of the firstfruits of your labor, and you are going to celebrate that harvest 50 days after Passover. I want you to stop and give thanks, but it wasn't just harvest that they were going to celebrate. It was the firstfruits of the harvest, the significance of which I need to explain, because Israel was an agrarian society, which I think you maybe knew about that, making the harvest of wheat not just a nice thing, but quite central to their very existence. They didn't have the farming equipment that we have today, so they couldn't get into their fields as quickly as we do today, so they would stagger their planting when they planted, when they sowed their seed, so that when part of the harvest would come due, the rest was still growing. And that first part of the harvest that came in before the rest, while the rest was still growing, that wasn't ready to come in yet. The first part of the harvest that came in was called the firstfruits. And that kind of dynamic brought with it some things. Among other things, it brought with it this, that built into this firstfruits celebration, was kind of built into it a promise for more. the firstfruits would come in, and the firstfruits kind of carried a promise for more. This wheat that we just brought in is wonderful, but the message in it is this is just the beginning. This is just the taste of more and more and more to come, because this is just the firstfruits. And that firstfruits concept is spoken of other places in Scripture. Remember 1 Corinthians 15. 1 Corinthians 15, 20, the Apostle Paul refers to the resurrection of Christ as the first fruits of those who sleep. But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who sleep, which means that what we celebrate when we celebrate the resurrection of Christ isn't just that he rose. Though we are celebrating that, what we're really celebrating, however, is this. He was just the first fruits. He, because his resurrection brings with it a promise for more. Because he rose, the real good news in that is that we will too. He was called the first fruits, which means his resurrection was just the beginning. It was just a taste of more and more and more to follow, and you are part of the more and more and more to follow. So now, with me, start to connect the dots of all of this stuff around Pentecost. Indeed, now, I want to start answering a question. Quite frankly, when I started studying this early in the week, I didn't know it was going to be a question. When we came to Acts chapter 2, the question is this, relative to Pentecost. Why did God choose this day to pour out his Spirit on all flesh? Why not the day before or the day after? Why did he tell his followers to wait and to pray? Not many days from now it will happen, but actually it was going to be, not some general time, it was going to be on this particular day. Why did he tell them to wait and to pray until this particular day, until the day of Pentecost? Here's why. Because God had chosen as part of his sovereign will and design to take the day of Pentecost. It already meant so much to the people of Israel, to the people of God, And to take that very special day and to expand it beyond what anyone could ask or think or even imagine. Not to change it or to make it now mean something different than it did before. But to now take Pentecost, this is God's design, and make it now mean something more than it ever meant before. Because this is the feast of the harvest. the Feast of Firstfruits, that every year, every year, like clockwork, 50 days after Passover, reminds us that God is good, that he provides for our needs, that he cares about our bread and our provision. So sing and dance and laugh for joy and be very grateful. But as long as we're talking about a harvest, says God, I think in his mind, how about a harvest of something more valuable than firstfruits of wheat, of something more consequential than physical bread. Again, connect the dots with me. Let's do the math. Jesus was crucified. Rewind the tape. On what Jewish day calendar? On what celebration of Jewish life? He was crucified, as you know, on the Passover. That most holy of days in the life of any Jew, and they would remember what sometimes we are called to remember, the moment of our deliverance, our redemption, when they were delivered from slavery into freedom, from death to life, from Egypt to become a people of God. And what made their deliverance possible, and this is what they celebrated at Passover, was that when the angel of death passed over them, because when I see the blood of the sacrificial lamb, I will pass over you. They remembered that, and it made them grateful to God for his provision of life. So when Jesus is crucified on Passover, I think you know what's happening there. He is now becoming the sacrificial lamb. Behold, the Lamb of God, said John the Baptist, who takes away the sin of the world, that the blood of bulls and goats could never take away the sin of the world, but he, Lamb of God, took away the sin of the world for all time, but now do the math relative to Passover and Pentecost, 50 days. Three days in the grave was Jesus, and then he rose. Forty days, Acts chapter 1, verse 2, he spent presenting himself alive with many convincing proofs, and then he ascended to the Father and told his followers to wait. Not many days from now, but what are we waiting for? Pentecost, the 50th day. after Passover, Acts chapter 2, verse 1, and when the day of Pentecost finally came. They were all together in one place, and suddenly there came from heaven a noise, like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. This is crazy stuff happening here. So Peter took his stand with the eleven and began to explain that this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel, that in the last days, God says, I will pour forth my Spirit on all mankind. And that is what you're seeing here. But dial into this. By way of teaching, understanding of Pentecost, the ultimate sign of Pentecost wasn't just the signs and wonders. It wasn't the tongues as of fire. The ultimate sign of Pentecost that actually made it Pentecost is that when Peter was finished with his explanation, that turned into a sermon and finally ended in verse 41. It says that when he was finally done with this explanation, 3,000 souls were added that day. In other words, 3,000 men and women came to life that day, went from death to life, from darkness to light, and there's your harvest. Something more valuable than wheat, something more consequential than bread, souls of men and women come alive, redeemed, because God didn't change Pentecost into something different. God changed Pentecost into something more, but there's more, because Pentecost isn't just a feast of harvest, 3,000 souls. The real thing about Pentecost is that it's the feast of the first fruits, because the real excitement is that 3,000 souls in one day, as marvelous as that was was just the beginning. It was just a taste. You haven't seen anything yet. But it's bigger than that, because this Pentecost event is also a picture of a taste. It is, this way I can say it, it is the first installment of, literally, heaven on earth. the kingdom of God come to earth in ways we can see and sense and experience, so that from Pentecost, Acts chapter 2, Pentecost, to the end of the age, at the culmination when everything is made right, there are, from Pentecost to the end of the age, there are, and we can expect, inbreakings of God's kingdom and God's power. And every time you see one of these inbreakings, this sense of God's presence and power. Every time you hear one, experience one, you need to know that you're experiencing first fruits. It's a taste. It's only a taste, but it's a real taste of what one day will fully be. It's the first fruits of more because first fruits are only the beginning. I'm going to explain it like this. Romans 8, kind of an odd place to go, but it'll help me kind of paint a picture here where Paul is talking about the fact that everything in this life is subject to decay. And it's kind of a depressing thought, but he's kind of telling you the truth. Here's the deal. You need to just deal with the fact everything in life is subject to decay. Indeed, the whole of creation, he says in Romans 8, 22, groans. We groan, he says in Romans 8, 23. You can feel it in your body because the whole universe is kind of running down. You are running down. Good news. because everything is subject to decay. Think of it like this. Most of you in this room right now look great. I mean, I can't actually see you, but I'm assuming you look great. But you can't hold on to it. You may try, and some of you may go to great lengths to try, but you can't hold on to it. You know why? Because everything is subject to decay. So some of you in this room right now feel great, but you can't hold on to it. Though you may try, and maybe you should, you can't hold on to it, because everything, everything is subject to decay. Some of you are part of great families, but you can't hold on to it. Though you may try, and you should try, but families break up, sometimes through sin and selfishness, sometimes because one of the family members dies. It's time to go home because everything is subject to decay. But one day, the Bible says, this is eschatological stuff. We don't talk about this a lot. One day, the Bible says, there will be a glory that comes from the throne of God when the air of heaven will come down enveloping the whole universe. at the end of the age, a new heaven, the Bible says, and a new earth right here in those days, liberated finally from this bondage of decay. And the reason we know that's true, says Paul, now back to Romans chapter 8, Paul is talking about the fact that we're going to decay in Romans 8, but the reason we know all of that is one day going to be liberated is because Romans 8, 23 says that right now we have the Spirit, and the Spirit is the first fruits, the first tastes of what will ultimately culminate at the end of the age, which means that any time you have any kind of experience at all with the Holy Spirit, maybe in worship when you weep and you don't know why, and you don't know why you can't stop, maybe in some deliverance or healing of your body or your soul or your mind or your marriage, every time you experience anything like that, and I think you all have had experiences like that, you just got a taste. It was only a taste, but it's a real taste of heaven. And when you taste that, you are tasting first fruits. And with first fruits, what comes with that is a promise. There's more to come. There's more to come. all you're getting in this life is a taste. It's a good taste. I want to taste more. I really do. But every time you get it, there's in it a promise. There's more, there's more, there's more. In heaven, we will see him face to face. We will know and be fully known in heaven. So I guess we have to wait for heaven. But with the Spirit, here, now, We are capable right here and right now of experiences with God that are absolutely transcendent, wonderful, joyful, and real. And these experiences are first fruits. And what first fruits do is give you a taste. It is only a taste. But it's a real taste of heaven, of what one day will fully be in heaven. We will be like him. It says in 1 John 3, 2, Wow, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. So in order to be like him, I guess we have to wait for heaven. But with the Spirit right here, right now, we have the capacity to experience becoming like him right here. And right now, it's called the fruit of the Spirit. Things like love and joy and peace and patience. and every time you see it growing in yourself or see it in another person, in the context of even our body or the world, you're getting a taste of eternity. It's only a taste. And it makes you thirsty for more. And I want us to be thirsty for more, but it's only a taste. But it's a real taste of what one day will fully be because this is the first fruits, and the first fruits are only the beginning. There's more. There's more in one day face to face. 1 Corinthians 13, 12 says that now we see through a glass darkly. We know and prophesy in part, but then face to face we will know fully and be fully known. So now I guess we have to wait. But with the Spirit, right here, right now, come the gifts of the Spirit. And yeah, we know in part, and yeah, we prophesy in part, but the gifts of the Spirit are here, right here, right now. So they are available to us while we wait for the fullness of this harvest to come. And we have access to words of knowledge, words of prophecy, gifts of healing, Acts 2.17, your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Young men will see visions, old men will dream dreams. and historically these things I'm describing are referred to as technically in breakings of God's kingdom right here right now and they take on different forms they're experienced in different ways as the wind of God's spirit begins to blow as the gifts of God's spirit begin to flow in a marriage, in a family, in a city in a church and every time they do even if the flow is just a trickle what you're getting is a taste. It's only a taste, but it's a real taste. What will one day fully be, they're the first fruits. And every time you taste the first fruits, there's a promise. Hang on, hang on. It will be worth it all. Now there's another thing I want you to see about this Pentecost picture, however, because Pentecost, in addition to being the Feast of Harvest and first fruits, was another thing as well, because it was also a time that the people of God used to remember the meeting of Moses with God at Mount Sinai. Because guess when that happened? When did Moses meet God on Mount Sinai? Yeah, you maybe guessed it. 50 days after the original Passover, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, 50 days after the original Passover with Torah, the Ten Commandments. Remember that? The Ten Commandments, which was not a rule book. They were wedding vows as we've come to see them. And I will be your God, says Tore, and you will be my people. He was creating and calling out at Sinai on this 50-day Pentecost day after the original Passover. He was calling out a people. He was making a covenant people, which is precisely what he is doing in Acts chapter 2. For in Acts chapter 2, he is calling out a people from the nations. Acts 2 verse 5, from every nation under heaven were these people in Jerusalem. But he's not just calling out a people, it's a covenant people. It's not just a covenant people, this is a new covenant people because this is the covenant. Hebrews 10, 16, this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord, that I will put my spirit in you and you will come to life and I will put my laws upon your heart and upon your mind I will write them and their sins and your lawless deeds I will remember no more washed in the blood of the Lamb are we the spotless Lamb behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world which means among other things this that God in Acts chapter 2 is not changing Pentecost into something different He is changing Pentecost into something more, because I want a covenant, says God, with the world. I want a covenant, says God, with the nations. Acts 2, verse 9, Parthians and Medes and Elamites, residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia and Pumphila, Egypt, and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and even visitors from Rome, both Jews and Greeks, Cretans and Arabs, and they were all hearing the mighty deeds of God in languages, they could understand their own languages, which is a fascinating picture, particularly when you come to understand that much like the rest of what we're studying here this morning, this event of these languages being spoken is rooted in the Old Testament. Because this is not what we're talking about in Acts chapter 2, to be confused with the gift of tongues that the Apostle Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 14. And we will talk about that as we go through the book of Acts. 1 Corinthians 14, he is talking about a gift of tongues that is a prayer language. But this is in fact not that, because this is in fact Acts chapter 2, much bigger than that. Because Acts chapter 2, this tongues thing finds its roots or its origin in the Old Testament. Genesis chapter 10 and 11, Genesis 10. The tower of Babel, where we're told about how the nations of the earth decided to be their own masters, to find their own way, to become their own God. And as a result, God kind of moved there, and the languages were changed. Their tongues got confused. They couldn't talk anymore. And if they did, they couldn't understand each other any more. I mean, what are you talking about? I don't understand. What? I mean, you talk weird. You look weird. You are weird. And the ultimate result of that you talk weird and you look weird and you are weird was separation. The fracturing of community for the very first time. A separation of languages and culture. You go your way. you're an idiot anyway I'll go mine and be with people who talk like me and think like me and look like me they're just so weird and there you find the roots of racial, cultural, linguistic division, discord, hostility all which gives birth to this incredible sense of superiority because I like the way we look and I like the way we sound and I like the way and not so much them because they're weird they look weird they are weird they are wrong they are out all of which puts a whole new spin on what's happening at Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 because what's happening there was, among other things, this, God is reversing the curse of Babel. The confusion of language, the division of culture, the hostility of races through this baptism of His Spirit that helped everyone who was able to see to see. I am not superior to you. Even though you look different than me and act different than me and talk different than me, I am not superior to you and I am not less than you. Because we all stand in need of this grace. So this reversal of the curse of Babel does not eliminate nationality, ethnicity, or culture. It simply demotes it. Because now the most important thing about you and you and them isn't nationality, ethnicity, culture, or language. The most important thing about you and me and them, whoever them, they are, is the cross of Christ. And this grace we need because every single one of us are the same there. Neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free. and every time you get a taste of that you are tasting first fruits. I'll expand it a bit further. This ability to communicate to people who aren't like you and wonder with me, just dream with me and give you some ways I think about this and maybe you can expand it in your own mind about a baptism of the Spirit that empowers ordinary people like you and me. And the ordinary people's in the text. So aren't these just Galileans? Galileans don't even speak their own language very well. How are they doing this? Ordinary people like you and me, by a baptism of the Spirit, to communicate the mighty deeds of God to people whose language I don't speak, to people whose culture I don't understand. You know, this is maybe a weird way to share it, but every week here, we kind of wonder about this. Steve and I, when we're prepping talks, when we're putting a worship thing together, You wonder and you pray. And how on earth do we communicate the mighty deeds of God? Because we're trying to do more than Colossians and more than Acts. I mean, those are the kind of tools we use. But what we really want to do is somehow proclaim the mighty deeds of God so people would see and believe. How do you do that? To so many people with so many different needs coming from so many different places in life because there's young people here and old people too. We've got single people and married people, divorced people. We've got heartbroken people here. We've got happy people and sad, believing people and agnostic. We have antagonistic people here. And angry people, scared people. How on earth to communicate the mighty deeds of God in a language that all those people would understand at the same time? You better be good. Come up with culturally relevant stories. Yes. But what if there was a baptism that somehow went beyond the teaching and the culturally relevant stories and the jokes and the way we connect? What if there was something else going on that was somehow able to communicate the mighty deeds of God to all the different ways we think and see and live and speak? So that's Wednesday at our all-staff meeting. We talked about service learning ministry here. Jen Linwall and Rebecca Charbonneau shared these wonderful stories of getting suburban moms connected to urban moms and middle class people, even wealthy people, connected and just kind of let's talk with homeless people. It's just fascinating to me. I mean, that's just such a good thing. But you kind of wonder, what language do I use? I mean, we all speak English. That's not the language barrier here. but there's still a communication barrier between these kinds of people, these disparate kinds of people. How on earth do you communicate the mighty deeds of God to someone whose language you don't know? No, I don't know how to talk to that person. We speak a different language. And I'm not talking about English, and then I start to wonder if maybe there's a language born of the Spirit that involves no words at all. And so we pray. Holy Spirit, come and give us the power to do this mission you've called us to do that we cannot do. Acts 2 verse 1. When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a noise. And that noise has changed the world. And that noise has changed me And that noise has changed you Having given to you and to me and to us A taste It's only a taste But it's a real taste Of what will one day fully be It's just the first fruits And the first fruits are just the beginnings So sing and dance and laugh for joy and it makes me want to sing a simple song actually a quiet song of thanks to God for all of this that you have done thanks Thank you.
