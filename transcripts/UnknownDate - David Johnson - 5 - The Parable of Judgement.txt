The rest of you open your Bibles with me to the book of Matthew chapter 13. We are coming today to the seventh and final parable in a series of parables that we have found in Matthew chapter 13. Parables as we have come to know them are methods that Jesus uses to teach deep truth. And the way he teaches the deep, profound, even unfathomable truth is by using paradoxically very simple, elemental pictures drawn from real life. We've seen Jesus tell us that the kingdom of God is as simple as a sower sowing seed. And the seed is the word of the kingdom. And the soil is the hearts of men and women who sometimes are hard and other times there's hidden hardness. and sometimes there's weeds and sometimes there is a brokenness and an open to the word of the kingdom and life is born. And we've seen that the kingdom is also like a field. And remember that one was designed by Jesus to communicate to the disciples a cleared up theology. Their view of the kingdom was that Jesus was going to come, establish the kingdom in its fullness and he had to warn them and prepare them for ministry recognizing that the kingdom is here in power and you are wheat and there is life and authority in you. But you need to know that Satan has oversown and there is wheat and tares and you're going to have to live with that tension until the second coming of Christ. But the kingdom is also like a mustard seed and although it is small and insignificant, it grows and grows and grows and nothing can stop it and it's like leaven and it gets planted into the loaf that is the world and it leavens and permeates the world and that is great encouragement. Last time we found out the kingdom was like hidden treasure and it was like a pearl. And today in verse 47 through 50 and then 51 and 52, he kind of culminates all his thinking on the parables. We find out that the kingdom, verse 47, is like a dragnet, cast into the sea and gathering fish of every kind. And when it was filled, they drew it up on the beach and they sat down and gathered the good fish in the containers, but the bad they threw away. So it will be at the end of the age, just like that. The angel shall come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, and will cast them into the furnace of fire, and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Have you understood all these things? And they said to him, Yes. And then he said to them, Therefore, because you understand these things, and literally in the Greek it would read like this, Therefore you are like a scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven, and you are like the head of a household who brings forth out of his treasure things that are new and things that are old. Let's pray as we begin. Father, as we prayed earlier, asking you to bless our worship, we recognized in our minds that the kingdom is like a treasure hidden. It's underneath the surface. Again, we're going to move into a text and we will hear words. And that is what we will hear and that is what we will see. But the real work of your spirit is somehow underneath that where the life and the energy and the changing and the conviction happens. and we ask that your kingdom work under the surface be done among us. Be moving here with freedom and power. We ask that in Jesus' name. Amen. I came into my office Tuesday morning to do what I do on Tuesday mornings and that is to crack the books and get going on the next text. I don't know if you know this, but there are certain pastors who know what they're going to preach years in advance and I've always kind of envied that and there is a way in which I do too. If somebody asked me, what are you going to preach a year from now, I'd say Matthew. That's what. But literally, I just go to the next verse. It's like a workman who gets to his stuff and he starts building a house again. I was coming off a weekend that was kind of difficult for me. Those of you who know, know I was gone last week. I was in Chicago with some family things that were for me, kind of unsettling and scary. And that's enough. Unsettling and scary is good enough. And I came back and I remember sitting in my office and kind of feeling a little bit disjointed and reading this 49th verse. So it'll be at the end of the age, the angels will come forth, take out the wicked from among the righteous, cast them into a furnace of fire. And I thought, boy, that's going to really put air in your tires, Dave. This is a good encouragement for you. And then I began to think of how people would respond even when I read this and thinking of the way you might come from different walks of life and different perspectives. And now we're going to hear a sermon on hell. Isn't that good? And a lot of impressions that we've got when it comes to the kind of teaching that is being laid forth in us. Some of you mentioned to me, I wasn't there, but a number of people mentioned to me, not knowing I was preaching on this this week, but they were at the State Fair or something for the 4th of July. And there were some people there with this big placard that said, Repent or Burn, something like that. What a blessing that was. The fact is that I, like you, have certain passages and certain kinds of sermons that I really enjoy to preach. I love to preach sermons that I know going in is going to just exalt Jesus, make Jesus look bigger than he normally is, make him look as big and enormous and wonderful and graceful as he is. And I know going in, it's like I've got a spring in my step. I just know I'm going to bless you. And if I were left to myself, I doubt very seriously that I would choose a sermon. I think I'm going to talk about hell this week. I don't think like that. But the fact is, I don't choose the sermons. Because we're committed to an expository method, the Spirit of God chooses our sermons. And so it is today we talk about what we're going to talk about. I want to bring you through the process like I did because something happened. As I initially looked at this passage and kind of felt, I don't know if I want to do this. This doesn't even resonate with where my spirit's at this week. Something began to happen to me that turned into kind of a conviction and a sense of intrigue as to what was really going on here. Because while in verse 50 it speaks of being cast into a furnace of fire, while that disturbs me, as I began to study, something disturbed me even more. It was the fact that Jesus said it. Jesus said this, that there are going to be people cast into a furnace of fire. And my impression of Jesus is somehow incongruent with that kind of language. Jesus is graceful. He is peaceful. He is gentle. He's talking about a furnace of fire. I began to look into that a little bit deeper, and as I studied, I found out not only did Jesus say this kind of thing here, but he said it all over the Gospels. He said it all over. He said it all the time. In fact, I studied a little bit more, and I found out that more than any other teacher or preacher in all of the scriptures, Jesus spoke of hell more than anybody else. And I've got a conflict in my mind now, and that's the confrontation as well. The conflict and confrontation is this. Jesus is the most graceful, gentle, loving, caring person, the Godhead that you could possibly ever know, and yet he spoke about hell. And something got communicated to me, and it was this. David, you need to know something that graceful kingdom people talk about hell. It's one of the things you need to do, because if you love people, you need to have as one of your motivations the realization that unless they are redeemed and washed in the blood, hell is a reality. One of the troubling but very real aspects of this text and of Jesus' life was what dawned on me late in the week. And that was this. There were two primary motives for all of Jesus' ministry. Number one, his unbelievable, unfathomable love for people. and second, an awareness of the reality of hell. And that moved him to give and that moved him to care and that moved him to die. And in this text, what he is doing with his disciples is saying essentially this, I need you to have the same motive. I want you to understand and move through your kingdom ministry with the same kinds of things pulsing in and through you that pulse in and through me. Know these things. I'm going to break the text into the simple things that we've been doing. First of all, the picture that is being presented. Second of all, the principle that is in the picture. And then third, there is a proclamation. Let's look at the picture first. Verse 47, the kingdom's like a dragnet cast into the sea, gathering fish of every kind. Stop right there. Again, what he's doing is using common everyday imagery out of their life. We've talked about farmers. We've talked about merchants. now we're going to be talking about fishermen. In those days, as in these days in that part of the world, there are three ways to fish. The first way to fish would be with a hook and a line. I can go with a fish and a line. It's not that bad, but it's going to get worse. So Matthew 17, verse 27, Jesus said to Peter, I want you to put a hook and a line in the water and pull out a fish. And that's the story of how he pulled out the fish. and there was a copper coin in the fish's mouth. Remember that? Just telling you that to establish that was one of the ways they fished. There's also the method of casting a net. The casting of a net would have been a circular net. You've seen it in pictures or in movies. And the net is cast out onto the sea and it's done with such skill that when it hits the sea it's in full circular form. It's weighted on the perimeter so it sinks to the bottom. All of the fish that are in that area get caught. There is a cord that is tied to the fisherman's hand. He pulls it in. It comes in like a sack and all the fish are in it. That's what the disciples, Andrew and Peter, were doing in Matthew 4.18 when Jesus said, come and follow me. It says in the scriptures they were casting a net. It was that kind of net that they were doing. In this passage, it is called a drag net. It's a very specific kind of net. It is a troll net or a seine. To call this net large would be an understatement. Lenski indicates that these nets extended as far sometimes as one half a mile out into the sea. The way it would work would be this. The net would be all bundled up in the ship or the boat that they were fishing in. It would then, with one end, be attached to some sort of a tree or a rock, and then this boat or this ship would extend itself, let's say it's a half a mile long, one half a mile away from where it was secured on the shore. Generally, the movement of that boat would be parallel to the shore. Do you follow that? Here's the shore, it's attached here. The boat would move out this way, parallel to the shore a half a mile. Then what it would do, and by the way, the net was corked at the top and weighted at the bottom. So what you've got in your mind is a vertical wall. It would go out like this, and then it would just begin to slowly move this way. All the way around, however long it took, I don't know if it was all day or what, but it would move all the way around, come to this end of the shore, and then come back like this with a circle. So what you've got in your mind's eye with these fishermen, and these guys we're going to connect with this, would be like a big pool, and everything in the middle of that pool is coming onto the shore. Everything in the middle of that pool doesn't know yet that they're coming into the shore. It is a huge net, and some of the fish are just kind of swimming around oblivious. That's a great day. Think I'm going to eat a perch, you know? But slowly, imperceptibly, silently, that net starts getting drawn, and on the front end, some of the fish all of a sudden are in for a rude awakening, kind of fishing along, or just swimming along. They're doing their thing. All of a sudden, before they know it, they're flopping up on the beach, and there comes more and more and more. the picture I want to have in your mind is that this net is immense it is immense room in the middle for fish to swim freely it is sweeping it is silent the fish are totally unaware of what's going on but it catches everything both living and dead 48 indicates what happens when it is filled that gets drawn up on the beach. The fishermen sit down, gather the good fish and the containers. The bad fish are thrown away. The distinction between a good fish and a bad fish, a bad fish is simply a useless fish. That's what it meant, in fact, in the Greek. Just useless. What would make a fish useless for a fisherman, we're not talking about kingdom stuff yet, is whether it was if it wasn't edible or if it wasn't sellable. That's the only reason a fish would have any value to a fisherman, if it's edible or if it's sellable. As these fishermen, skilled at what they do and able to spot good and bad fish right now, some of the fish that were piling up on the shore were real easy to spot. Some of them were junk fish. You just don't eat them. Some of you go fishing, and I know about this. I'm not the great fisherman. I love fishing, and I'm getting into it more and more. But some of you pull certain kinds of fish up, and before you throw it back in the lake, you cut it in half. It's a garbage fish. I don't want this back in this lake. You hate it. You throw it away. You spot it right now. It's not edible. It's not sellable. There are other kinds of fish, however, that are not quite so obvious. It's a little bit more subtle. Have you ever caught a perch? Pulled it in. It's a nice-sized perch. You're going to keep this one. You get it up on the shore. You start to fillet. It's full of what? Worms. It's a worthless fish. That one gets cast off, too. Looked real good on the outside. You know what I'm getting at with that. So that's the picture he paints in verse 47 and 48. A common scene every day. What's the point, though? what's the principle that begins to be revealed in 47 but also in 48 the kingdom of heaven is like that well in what way is the kingdom of heaven like a dragnet that moves through the sea pulling everything in verse 49 tells us that it's going to be that way at the end of the age the end of the age is eternity it could speak also of death and death in eternity is like that dragnet. So make that connection right now. Eternity, death is like that dragnet. It's slow, it's silent, it's inevitable, it's relentless, it's moving through the sea of life, gathering everything and everyone, living and dead. Those who are in the middle of it don't see it, they don't hear it, they're not aware of it, and before they know it, like a thief in the night, they're flopping like a fish on the beach. The imagery is vivid, if not frightening. Clearly in this parable, we are the fish. Get a picture of yourself as a fish. Swimming along. One of the pictures that came to me real clearly was a picture of me fishing on top of the water. I'm a bizarre person. I throw the lure in the water and I start, and I kind of wonder, I wonder what's going on down there. You know, I wonder what it feels like to be a fish looking at this thing going by, and I wonder what makes them jump on this thing. And I'm kind of thinking of what's going on down there. I doubt very seriously that they're thinking about what's going on up there. You know, I wonder what's going on up there. They're not even aware of another existence. They're not. They're totally oblivious to the net. They're totally oblivious to another existence that's greater than their own. We live like that, like fish, totally unaware of a whole nother existence in the spirit realm that's far greater than our own. We live like fish, eating a little perch all along the way. And like fish, we move through life, chasing our little dreams, having our little plans, buying our little Corvettes. All the time, the net is moving. The net is coming. Every once in a while, that net brushes up against the gill. You know? You kind of come up against it. And we handle it so well, we flick a fin and we're gone. Feeling free again. oblivious to the fact that the net is closing in and that there is another reality beyond the one we are living in. I think it's important that you enter into this imagery of a fish and see yourself that way just for a little bit, even if you're among the redeemed. Especially, by the way, if you're the redeemed. Because I want to point out in this text, this is not even being spoken to unredeemed people. It applies to unredeemed people, but this is being taught to disciples who are going to do the work of the kingdom. And they need to know about this net. I do love to fish. It's something that's kind of new to me. Being from Chicago, I didn't have much chance, but now I do. And I love catching northerners and walleyes. And where we fish, there's this big live tank. You put your fish in this live tank. Tim Lundberg uses this old washing machine inside. He sticks it in the water and he's fishing it. So I'm looking down on the fish. I love to do that. And they're all swimming around. And again, I have a bizarre mind. I look down there and I see some big northerns, a smaller bass, a couple of perch, sunfish. And I just look down there and I go, I wonder if they're nervous. You know, I bet the big one is saying to the little one, we're in deep serious now, boy. You just better hope they knock you in the head before they fillet you. No, they don't do that. They don't do that. Why? They're oblivious. They're oblivious to the danger, they're oblivious to the reality of a life above them, and before they know it, they're flopping on the beach. There's three things about the dragnet, and the principle of the dragnet that I want to speak to. First of all, this picture speaks to the inevitability of death. It speaks to the inevitability of eternity. The Word of God says this, It is appointed unto man once to die, and after that to judgment. There is no way you can get around that. But like fish, again, we're oblivious until we're flopping on the shore. This applies again to the redeemed as well. More than we like to admit it, I believe, and this is where this confrontation came on me this week. I live like a fish sometimes. And even though I am redeemed, and even though I have been given a new nature, and even though I have been washed in the blood of Christ, and I've been made a whole different kind of fish, if you want to stick with the metaphor, Sometimes I live as if this life under the water is all there is. And I pursue my little things with no consciousness of the net closing in on my neighbors, on my friends, on myself. There have been few passages that I've come across in the last year that have caused me to refocus on what my priorities are more than this one. As a believer, as a disciple to whom Jesus is speaking, as one who is coming to an awareness that one of Jesus' primary motives was the fact that the net was closing in and people were going to be lost, I need to take this and look at the fact that sometimes I look and live like a fish. Oblivious to the net and oblivious to this eternal life that I'm going to move into and so are my friends. The oblivious nature of my existence sometimes is reflected in my priorities and yours too. It's reflected in your commitments or lack of commitment to anything but yourself, anything but what we live for right today, what we spend our life on, what we spend our money on. Just think on that. Let that sink in. It is compelling to me. And I can't get around it that the primary motive, again, of Jesus was directed by an awareness of the net and judgment and death. James said it this way, life is like a vapor. And you like to not think about that, but that is a true thing. 2 Corinthians 5.11, Paul indicated that it was one of his motivators too. Knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. The net is coming. Judgment is coming. Later on, he goes, it is the love of Christ that constrains us and moves us. And then he began to talk about grace. So it is the love of people. It is the love of Christ. It is the fact that people can be made new creatures in Christ. But it is also the awareness that the net is coming that moves me. To minister. I'm having trouble. I need some water. hello take this i'm going back here for a minute i can't yell today doesn't that break your heart this dragnet speaks to the inevitability of eternity it speaks to the reality of separation. Verse 49, the angel shall come forth to take out the wicked from among the righteous. The angels are the fishermen, and they have gathered the net, and they are separating the fish. I think about the ministry of angels right now. The ministry of angels right now is wonderful, and it's something you need to see. The ministry of angels for the redeemed is to protect, it is to minister to. It is to do spiritual warfare. It is to literally fight against the angels of hell and angels minister on our behalf. But they are very much like the slaves we met a few weeks ago in the wheat and the tares who are looking at the field and they're saying, Master, why can't we go in there and nail them tares? And they are restrained. While they minister and while they do spiritual warfare, they are in a posture right now of keeping the sword in the sheath. But one day, Jesus is going to say to them, The harvest is now. Go. And they will be the ones who mete out the judgment and make the separation. One of the things we need to understand is how they even distinguish between the good fish and the bad. Thank you, thank you. It's pretty classy, isn't it? Romans 1.28 makes it real clear what a wicked fish would look like. It says this, And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind to do things which were improper. They were filled with unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil, full of murder, envy, strife, deceit, malice. Their gossip, slanders, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful. And although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but they give hearty approval to those who practice them. Good fish or bad fish? Pretty obvious. Just like the fishermen, there's some fish that are garbage. Right now, easy, we throw them out. Those are easy. See the same thing in 1 Peter 4, 3-7. Same thing in Ephesians 2, 1-3. It speaks of people whose God is their belly. They live for satisfying themselves. That's all there is. It is an evil, depraved, sinful lifestyle that bears witness to an evil, depraved, sinful heart. But wait a minute. As we're watching these angels or these fishermen sort out the fish, all of a sudden I'm watching him and I say, yeah, okay, I can understand those. Those are pretty grubby. But all of a sudden he starts throwing fish that look good to me. I go, wow, wait a minute, that fish looks good. That one's okay. And then I hear the passages like Matthew 23, 25, when Jesus said to the Pharisees, You clean the outside of the cup and of the bowl, and you look like that perch who looked wonderful, and you got all the behaviors and the religious stuff, and you pray, and you fast, and you give, but you're full of worms. You're full of venom and strife and anger and malice, and you have no heart. What you need to do, perch that are full of worms, Pharisees that are full of venom, You need to be made clean from the inside so that the outside may be made clean as well. You're a worthless fish bound for destruction. Same picture in 1 Corinthians chapter 4, 4, where it says that God is going to bring to light the things that are hidden and the motives. And these fish that look good on the outside, but their hearts are full of venom and they do not walk with God and they have not received the grace of God. The inside things are going to be disclosed. It's as if the angels have the ability to fillet the fish right there and spot it, and that's garbage that's going away. Hebrews 4.13 says the same thing, that God is going to open up, and everything will be laid bare before the eyes of him with whom we have to do. But then there's the good fish. And this text doesn't describe to us, by the way, the distinction between a good and a bad fish, and so I'm not going to go into that deeply. But you need to know the good fish is not just a fish that got all polished up on the outside. And again, the metaphor breaks down here because we don't have any parallel to a fish that was bad and then became good. But in terms of redemptive history, a good fish would be a fish that got washed in the blood of Christ, redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, made new. It would be a fish, if you will, that recognized the inevitability of eternity, the inevitability of separation, the inevitability of judgment. And it recognized also that as a little fish, there's nothing they could do about it. I can't change my identity. I'm full of worms. My only hope is you. That's the message of the gospel. People who come broken, hungry, mourning, not thinking they can somehow generate it in their flesh by being good enough, they recognize their sin, they recognize the worms in their heart, and they say, God, you need to make me a new fish. You need to give me a new identity. I have no capacity unless you work in grace and power in my life, regenerating you. And fish like that are put in a container and saved for glory. And to them God says, you were dead, but now you're alive. You were lost, but now you're found. 2 Corinthians 5, 17, Therefore, if any man's in Christ, he is a new creature, not a fish anymore at all. You need to know about the inevitability of eternity, the inevitability of separation and also the inevitability of judgment. But basically what I want to give you here is the nature of judgment. Verse 50. They will be cast into the furnace of fire and in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. As I did my study, and again becoming aware that Jesus spoke of hell often, there were four things that I saw Jesus teach about hell that I want us to know. And as disciples and workers in the kingdom of God, There's four things that we need to know about hell and let it begin to be a motivating force in your life for ministry. The first thing that Jesus said about hell is this. It is a place of outer darkness. It is a place of darkness. Matthew 22, verse 13, he says that Pharisees, these people who look real good, but they're defiled on the inside, no real heart for God, just religious, are going to be cast into outer darkness. What is that like? I have no idea. Cast into outer darkness, total darkness, no light whatsoever. I think it speaks of being totally alone. If I were to close my eyes and try to figure out what total darkness would feel like, I picture somebody being flung out in outer space. I don't know. He taught that it was a fire. It was a consuming fire, even in verse 50. A furnace of fire. One of the questions that always comes up in these kinds of discussions is this. Dave, do you think that hell is going to be real dark? I mean, like it's actual, literal darkness? Or is he kind of speaking metaphorically of some sort of darkness of the soul? Is hell really going to be fire like real fire, the kind of fire I feel on my flesh? Is it going to be real fire like that or not? In fact, you know, if you want to mix those metaphors, you've got total darkness and then fire. How do you have them together? If there's fire, there's going to be light, wouldn't there? So maybe it's just a metaphor. Well, if it comforts you at all to know it's not real darkness or not real fire, go ahead with that. Believe that. But know this. It's just like real darkness. It's just like real fire. Feel better? I couldn't possibly say for sure. Yeah, physical fire. I mean, that metaphor is used over and over again. Couldn't say for sure. It's absolute outer darkness, darkness, physical. I don't know that. There's a picture here that Jesus is trying to produce that is real and horrible. Not only did he say it was darkness and fire, but here's the issue. It is unrelieved darkness and fire. unrelieved darkness and fire for the body and the soul. What are you driving at? Here's what I'm driving at. Mark chapter 9 verse 44. Jesus said this. This is a place, hell, where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched. What does it mean that the worm dieth not? Why wouldn't the worm die? Real sturdy worm. No. Here's the picture. You die. You go into the ground. Now we have coffins that are supposed to seal us up so we don't decompose. What a great thing. Who cares? In those days, they didn't have that kind of stuff. They'd go into the ground. Whatever they were covered in was easily penetrated by a worm. A worm would move in there and consume the body. Delightful thought. Guess what happened when there was no more to consume? The worm died. Why? Because there wasn't anything left to consume. Hell's going to be different than that. The worm isn't going to die because even though it's consuming the person, the person's not going to be consumed. Wonderful thought. Fire's the same thing. It isn't that the fire is so great. It's the fact that even now in a physical fire, when the fire is burning, it burns as long as it has something to burn. When there isn't anything left to burn, it goes out. In hell, it's going to be different. It's going to keep on burning and keep on burning, but even though it burns, it's not going to burn it up. What a wonderful thought. How does that work? Let me explain. I need to do some teaching about the resurrection of the dead so you understand how it is that those two things could happen. That's a culmination of history. The Word of God teaches that all men are going to be raised from the dead. Not just believers, but unbelievers as well. Everybody gets raised from the dead. And at that point, the redeemed of the Lord, those washed in the blood of the Lamb, are going to receive their glorified body. We talk about that often. You've heard of that. And that glorified body that I'm going to get is going to be fitted for heaven. It's going to be equipped so I can live there. Stay with the metaphor of the fish. Under the water, I'm a fish. I got fins, I got gills, I got now as a person lungs and whatever I am. I get flopped onto the shore of eternity. Guess what I am? I am a fish out of water. The fish who get on the shore that are good fish are going to get new lungs. They're going to get a new capacity to live on the shore. You understand that? I'm going to get a new body that has capacity to live in heaven. It's a good thing. The problem is this. The rejecters of Christ are going to receive a new body too. But their body is going to be fitted for hell. and that body is going to be such that the worm can eat it and it won't get eaten and the fire can burn it but it won't be consumed. And again I ask you, real worms Dave? Real fire? I'll give you a no but it's just like real worms and it's just like real fire that even though it eats, it isn't eaten and even though it consumes, it isn't consumed and that doesn't make me feel any better. The picture has to stay. Jesus also taught one other thing about hell, and that is that it has varying degrees. Again, just like heaven, there are people who will have different rewards. Every one of us will be in glory. Every one of us will be delighted, but there will be levels of reward. And I think, by the way, the reward that we have as believers is a capacity to praise. It's just going to be a capacity to take it all in. I have some scripture on that. I don't have time for it, but I even see that played out here among the redeemed. I see people who worship. When they worship, they just go nuts. It's like they can see God. It's incredible. the same people we're going to see them in heaven they're going to have that same capacity only greater and I see some people when we worship they just go you're going to look the same way in heaven you're going to be glad you're there but you're going to wonder why I don't get this I really think you just watch we'll talk after okay when we're in heaven we'll go hey you were right the sad thing is just like we're going to get new bodies fit for heaven they're going to get new bodies fit for hell we're going to have all glory but some a greater capacity they're going to have all torment with some a greater capacity for torment. You need to know that broke Jesus' heart. He looked on the multitude and he felt compassion. And he said the harvest is coming but the labors are few. Go, go, go, go, go. It motivated him to lay down his life. It also motivated him to call his disciples to do the same. the varying degrees is referred to in Matthew 11 remember that just a few weeks ago woe to you Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum if they would have seen the works that you saw and heard the messages you heard in Sidon and Tyre and Sodom they would have repented but you heard and you saw and you understood the grace and the power of God and you still rejected it and it's going to be worse for you than for them Hebrews 10.29 how much severe punishment will those receive who have trampled underfoot the Son of God they have regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant and insulted the spirit of grace what that means is they knew about grace they knew about the blood of the covenant and they knew about the Son of God and they said nah maybe the punishment of those who have been enlightened of those who have heard and seen and experienced and been around, but they said, nah, I don't want that. Maybe the punishment is that they will have, like the reward is an awareness of the glory, they will have an awareness of what they missed. The kingdom, beloved, is like a dragnet that silently, invisibly, imperceptibly, but relentlessly sweeps and gathers. And people like fish are oblivious to the inevitability of eternity, separation, and judgment, but disciples, don't you be oblivious to it. And so it is that the third point, if he comes in verse 51, and he gives to them a pronouncement, and it is a call, indeed it is an affirmation of truth, and a call for them to understand that hell is real, and therefore begin to pass out the treasure that has been given to them. Let's just take it apart, verse 51. He says to them, Have you understood these things? First of all, these things are all of the parables that he just gave, not just the parable of judgment. but all of the parables from the beginning. Have you understood this concept of the seed and the word of the kingdom and how it gets planted in people's hearts and how it's planted in your heart and brought forth life? Did you put that one together? And they would say, yeah, we got that. And did you understand also that the kingdom isn't going to be this nirvana that you thought? It's going to be wheat and tears and your life is going to be some disillusionment and discouragement and you're going to have pain and you may not end up your life with a banquet and a gold watch, okay? You might end up on a cross and you might end up with your head cut off and you might end up like John the Baptist in a prison somewhere wondering if your ministry was worth anything. Do you understand that? Yes. Do you understand that the kingdom is also like a treasure? Do you understand that the kingdom is an encouragement? It's like a little seed. And you might go through your whole life feeling like you didn't do very much, but all along the way, you planted little seeds that you thought were insignificant in your kid's life, in your church's life, at your workplace. And that kingdom grew and grew and grew. Do you understand that it's like leaven? And that's your influence. And it permeates in ways you won't see. And it is like a treasure. And it's like a pearl. And do you understand also that it is like a dragnet that moves through history and calls people continually to judgment? Understanding means have you put these things together? And they said this, yes, we understand. Now I want to make a comment about their yes. Question, did they understand all these things? no in fact we know they didn't understand all these things completely especially as it relates to the wheat and tares remember that we told you that that it was this tension and the kingdom was going to be a mixed bag of good and evil living together and yet after that teaching in acts chapter one after the resurrection they're going are you going to do it now are you going to bring your kingdom now and it's all going to be established and everything is going to be great and he remember he again had to say it's not for you to know it's not now you're going to receive power now but you're going to be weed and tares. It's going to be a mess. It's going to be hard. So they didn't understand it completely. But let me say it this way. They understood what they were able to understand at that point. And Jesus, we need to also understand, accepted their yes. Okay, you say yes, you understand these things. I accept your yes. Now, you might wonder why I'm doing this. This is very important because it's going to help apply to you and to me. His accepting of their yes and going, okay, I believe that you understand these things, even though he knew they didn't, would be like you or me talking to an eight-year-old child and saying, son or daughter, do you understand who Jesus is? Yeah. Do you understand about redemption? Yeah. Do you understand what happened when Jesus died on the cross for your sins? Yeah. Do you understand what it means to walk in obedience? Yeah. Do you understand what it means to have your sins forgiven? Yeah. Do they? Understand all these things? Yeah. And no. Yeah, the capacity at which they're able to understand they do understand. The disciples didn't understand, but the level at which they were capable at that time to understand, they did understand. They were the kernel of truth about what the kingdom is, and its life, and its treasure, and its judgment. All of those things, they had the seed of it. They were going to know more, and more, and more, and there was going to be greater power and expression of what they already knew. But you need to know, I accept your yes, even though I know you don't know very much. And now, here's where it really gets exciting. Because I accept your yes, And because I really do believe that you understand these kernel truths, I want to tell you something. You are like a scribe who has become the disciple of the kingdom. They just got promoted, folks. A scribe in that day was somebody who spent their entire life not only studying scripture, but memorizing the counsel of God. The scribes were the theologians. They were the experts. They were the authorities. Jesus is saying, if you understand, even at a seed level, These basic principles of the kingdom, I want you to know that in the kingdom, you are at the point of being a scribe. You have something to say. You have something to share. You have something to give. The kingdom's like a dragnet. I don't care what level at which you see that, you see it. Share it. Let it motivate you. The kingdom is like a field, and the word of the kingdom needs to be spread. You're not real skilled at spreading it, but spread it. The kingdom's like wheat and tares, and some of you are around more tares than others. The kingdom is like a treasure and some of you see the grandness of that. Some of you see it like a seed. Whatever it is that you've got, you are valuable in the religious life of Israel. No one was more valuable than a scribe in terms of understanding the truth. You get these things, you've got something to say. You've got something to share. you're like the head of a household who brings forth out of his treasure his storehouse literally his inheritance things new and old he brings forth that word brings forth is ekbalo and it means to cast out to scatter to spread you're like a householder who looks at his inheritance and the treasure that is in his inheritance and the inheritance here for the disciple would be what he knows about the kingdom that it's a dragnet that it's a treasure that it's a pearl of great price that the word of the kingdom brings life that's like a treasure and you're like a householder whose responsibility is is to take your inheritance and scatter it the old and the new for the disciples would have been this your treasure is things new and old the old would have been the old covenant and the law the new would be the new covenant in grace and you disciples like nobody else on the face of the earth right now are able to take both of those things and bring them together and bring people the grace and redemption of God no longer under the law but let the law drive them to Christ put it all together Jesus is saying to them and to us I want the motive that I had to spread this kingdom word to be your motive too to spread it like a seed, to realize that you're doing it in the midst of tears, sin, pain, death, discouragement, disillusionment. Realize also that like a seed, that you're like a mustard seed and you're like leaven and no matter how discouraged you get, you need to know that you've had impact in ways you don't know. You need to know that you have found a treasure and you also need to know that it's a treasure that other people need to find because hell is real. Judgment is coming. The kingdom of God is like a dragnet. and to the unredeemed who may even be among us this morning this sermon is for you a warning and swimming away from the net that you felt brush up against your gill this morning will not change the inevitability of eternity and it will not change the inevitability of separation one day and it will not change the inevitability of judgment and today before you leave you can enter into by faith Ephesians 2.1 where Jesus said through Paul you were dead but now you're alive and to the redeemed I think I've already made it clear and again it is to the redeemed that this passage is directed the word is also a warning and it's a time to reassess your priorities, it's a time to rethink do I live with an awareness of the net do I live with an awareness that there's more to my life than this life under the water it's real easy to get totally caught up with the little perch in front of me and my little ways of living and there are things I have to do as a fish as a human being to eke out my existence do that but with a constant awareness that I've been made a new creature I am fit for heaven and there is an existence where I'm going to spend eternity and this thing in this little lake here is a very short time and I live sometimes like this time in the lake is all there is. A word from God to you this morning as far as letting this in for some of you as believers could totally change your life in terms of your priorities, how you spend the energy of your life, how you spend your money. What are you willing to die for? What are you willing to get tired for? You need to know the net is coming. And swimming away from its reality isn't going to change that one bit. Let's pray. Stand with me. We're going to sing in just a moment a prayer that would be a prayer of affirmation that we want his motive to be ours and his ministry to be ours and his perspective to be ours. It's, Lord, make me like you. You are a servant, make me one too. Give me your perspective. And I trust that as we sing it, it will be indeed your prayer. But also as we sing it, we need you to know that there is time today to minister. You may be unredeemed. And you have felt the net of eternity brush up against your guilt today. And maybe it makes you real mad and you've already swum away. You can't laugh. Fine. But maybe you've said, I need to deal with this. I need to deal with this ultimate question. And I need to receive Jesus as my Savior because He is my only hope. I can't get rid of the worms myself. I've tried. You need to know that you can come and if you come, people will come and minister to you. And also those who are among the redeemed, you might need to spend some time alone with the Lord just to assess what this says to you as a servant in the kingdom. And if you need to come, we'll minister to you as well. Let's pray. Father, we thank you, God, for times that you bring us a word that leaves us lighter than when we came. And we thank you for those times when you exalt yourself and through your word you encourage us. I thank you also for times when you confront us and make us aware of things that we don't want to look at. But the real truth is, the kingdom is like a dragnet and nothing is going to change that. And sometimes, God, we even worry about things that don't matter so much like I'm going to hurt somebody's feelings if I say anything and we need to get a picture of the dragnet. so that people we love can at least come under the hearing of the word of the kingdom. I pray in Jesus' name that you will release among these people a view of this net that will give us your motive and your perspective and your priority and your passion for doing the work of the kingdom. I pray in your name, amen. Amen.
