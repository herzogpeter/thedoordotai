Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Every week as we come to the time of the ministry of the Word, I'm looking for the right words. And they matter. The right words matter. But it also requires the right spirit. And so I pray for the right spirit. And it occurs to me that the right spirit would be your spirit. So fill me, fill us with your spirit. Fill these words with life that your spirit gives. And I pray that in your name. Amen. Amen. Well, as most of you know, if you've been with us the last couple of weeks, that born of our study in the book of Colossians, particularly in the second chapter where Paul declares Jesus to be, in Colossians 2 verse 3, the one in whom is hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to live it and about what the good life really is, we have been wondering together how that wisdom and knowledge can be applied to or found in the very practical and tangible arena of our finances, of our money. So for the last couple of weeks, we've been talking about money and about the somewhat surprising fact that Jesus, who according to Colossians 1 verse 3 is the one in whom has hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge about life, talked more about money than he did any other single thing. More than heaven or hell, more than love or forgiveness, anger, pride, lust, or salvation. He talked about drachmas and shekels and talents and gold, and it wasn't because he needed the money or because he was always trying to raise money, but because Jesus knew that very few things had more power on earth to capture the human heart, to deceive the human heart like money, which is where Paul's warning in the text we've been dealing with for the last couple of weeks comes into play where he says in Colossians 2, verse 8, see to it, you guys, that no one takes you captive to philosophy and the empty deception of the traditional thinking of men, I kind of paraphrase of that phrase, and the elementary principles of the world relative to, among other things, money, rather than according to Christ. I mean, seriously, he seems to be saying as we bounce up to verse 7, listen to me, he says, having been firmly rooted in Christ and built up in him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, see to it that you don't fall back into slavery, that you don't fall for this stuff, don't be deceived or taken captive. But the problem is this. As we've been acknowledging for the last couple of weeks, many of us, maybe all of us, to one degree or another, have already been deceived and taken captive in this arena of life relative to money, thus raising this question around which we've been kind of camping for the last couple of weeks. The question is this, how do we break free from the grip of this, from the deception of this? How do we walk out of what I've been describing for the last couple of weeks as this kind of Egypt where we've been living as slaves to, among other things, mammon or money? Well, first step I suggested last week was this, that we begin to break the silence. and tell ourselves the truth about how we've really been living, and how we've really been giving, and what we've really been wasting, and we have to be accountable, and tell someone else the truth as, well, and we need to stop and think. I mean, it's a big thing to just stop and think about the ways we've been deceived, because deception is deceiving, and you don't always know, so you need to stop and think about how we think, and get a grip on how we live, and wonder together. We talked about this last week. When is enough enough, and am I able to discern the difference between wants and needs, and to do that, we need to stop and think and maybe get some help, which is actually what the classes and the seminars that we are offering are really about. I don't do this very often in the middle of a sermon, and that is make an announcement, but in your bulletin, I think I told you about this last week, that we were going to offer some help, some real tangible things. I feel really good about this because it kind of gives legs to this thing. It's kind of a follow-through on the sermon, but actually there's three options. You'll see them in the bulletin. There's a shorter thing and a longer thing. One of the offerings we're gonna have is called Finances 101. I think it's up on the screen there. This is a three-week deal that you can get into. It's starting, I think, next week. There is no registration. All you gotta do is show up. We've got people in our church who are putting this thing together that we really trust and have a lot of confidence in. I just wanna thank Brad Friedlein, by the way, for putting this whole thing together. Another offering is this thing called Financial Peace University. A guy named Dave Ramsey that you've heard me quote over the last couple of weeks. We have a lot of confidence in his stuff. Now this university thing, that's the last thing. This is a 13-week course, which is a big commitment. This is a kind of change your life kind of thing. If you're interested, boy, that's a big thing. What I want you to dial into is the preview because next Sunday, Saturday, after every one of our services, Saturday night and both on Sunday, there's gonna be a preview of this so you can kind of dial into that and check that out to see if that's something that would help you. And I think actually it'll be enough to get you into it, and very, very helpful if you're enslaved to this. Even if you're not enslaved, you'd like to understand some more freedom in this arena. I really commend these things to you. But I ended the talk last week. If we really want to get free from mammon, my final thing was this. We need to learn to give, which, again, is the last thing I said last week, quoting Richard Swenson in his book entitled Margins, where he says, quite matter-of-factly, that there is one act par excellence that has the power to break the grip of mammon by going directly against the law of mammon or money, an act for which money is not made, that act is giving. Indeed, he says, when we give money away, we not only neutralize its power over us, but we also bring it under the domain of the kingdom of God. God is honored, and his right to rule in our life is reconfirmed. But the problem with that is this Most people don't give At least not very much Indeed the average American who actually does give According to the Barna Group Who is a research group and kind of collects data like this The average American who actually does give Gives about 2.5% of their income To what they might consider good causes Evangelical Christians according to this same survey Give a little more than that gave about 3.5%. Indeed, says Barna, that while American Christians live in the richest nation on earth, enjoying an average household income of around $42,000, it seems that the richer we've gotten, the less we've given. The fact is, he says, only 6% of evangelical Christians tithe. That may be a foreign word to some of you, but tithe is a biblical term that makes reference to giving a tenth of your income. Only 6% of evangelical Christians tithe. That's 94% who don't, all of which means a number of things, I suppose. Like maybe we have been deceived and taken captive by the tradition of men and the elementary principles of the world in this arena of our money, or maybe we're just disobedient, and maybe we just don't care, or maybe we're just all selfish and immature, and maybe we're just afraid, and, or maybe we just don't know what the Bible says, and so maybe I should tell you what the Bible says. I was thinking about this week, what should I I don't know. Maybe I should scold you and wag my finger at you. But I don't want to. And there are times, and if you've been around here long enough, I think you know that I wouldn't shirk away from something that needed to be confronted and said, and even if it was a discipline of some sort. But I don't want to in this one. Because what I'd rather do, and I mean this, there's a whole other way to look at this and enter into this that's desperately important, because what I want to do today is invite you to the party that I believe kingdom giving really, really is, because some of you, not all of you, but some of you are actually missing the party. In fact, it's a party that some of you don't even know is going on. There's a party going, and you don't even know. So while I could go, listen to me, I could go a number of different directions with this topic today. What I want to do today is invite you to a party. Again, that some of you are missing a party. The spirit of which, this is kind of weird, but the spirit of the party I'm trying to describe to you this morning is actually captured in a movie that all of us know about. And at Christmas time, we all get sick of it. Maybe not all, but me, I get really sick of it. It's called It's a Wonderful Life. You know that movie, okay? Over and over. It's on every channel for five months, anyway. And the scene that captures what I'm trying to describe here, again, I think is one that you're all familiar with. It's at the end of the story where all the townspeople come to George's house because George is in trouble. And they're going to bail him out. And as they all come piling in, you know the scene, they're all compiling in. Everybody's laughing and singing and they're coming into Mary and George's living room. What they do is open their hearts. Their hearts have already been opened. And then they open their hands and they release their grasp and they give. It was nothing short. if you can kind of replay it in your mind, I'm kind of banking on the fact that there's nobody on the planet who hasn't seen this thing. It's nothing short of a party, a grand celebration with laughing and singing and dancing for joy and as cheesy as that movie admittedly is. I can't think of a better way, a better picture to depict the party that I'm trying to invite you to today than that scene in that movie. But notice quickly this, that part of what makes the scene in that movie so poignant and useful as a tool for teaching here is that it stands in stark contrast. This picture, kind of close your eyes if you have. I can do it. I have a weird mind. I can play things in my mind like a movie while I'm talking to you. Several things going on at once. But the scene in that movie stands in stark contrast to the relationship we're much more familiar with relative to money, which is to grasp money, to guard it, to hold it, to be fearful of losing it, which means that going from fearfully clutching money to joyfully giving money speaks to nothing short of a transformation. From grasping to releasing, from closed off to open up, to hiding, from hiding to revealing, from fearfully holding to joyfully celebrating. One of my favorite examples of this in Scripture, this transformation taking place, involves an individual. his name is Zacchaeus you may know the story Zacchaeus was a wee little man a wee little man was he anyway um the only people laughing are those who went to Sunday school what are you why are they laughing at that it's a stupid song about Zacchaeus he was a tax collector and in Jesus day to be a tax collector meant you were a crook and you were cheating people but you got rich off your cheating people you kind of basically robbed them but when he got apprehended by amazing grace The first thing that happened to him was he gave. He gave. This hoarding, clutching spirit was transformed into a giving spirit, and he said to Jesus, I will give four times what I have defrauded, and he gave, and he gave with joy. Indeed, Jesus commenting on Zacchaeus' newfound generosity said, look at today's salvation. This guy has been saved from his greed and his fear and his clutching. But my favorite example, actually, of what I'm trying to describe involves not a person but a people. And I really like this picture even better because I want this to be a community event of people who in the book of Exodus enter into one of the most exciting, joy-filled experiences in their whole life with God, actually, on their journey of faith. And it happened when the Lord spoke to Moses in Exodus 25. And this is what he said to Moses. Moses, I want you to tell the people that we're going to raise a contribution to build the tabernacle. But Moses, there's one caveat on this offering. It's got to be a party, said the Lord. Indeed, that's the only way I want to build this tabernacle. Because if you build it any other way. In other words, if you build a tabernacle by pressuring people, by threatening them, by manipulating them. You might get the tabernacle, but you'll ruin the party. And it matters a lot how this tabernacle is built. Now, when I thought about this this week, it was weird because I immediately thought of what a radical thing that is. I mean, you may get the tabernacle if you kind of threaten people, but you'll ruin the party. And what I thought of was how in Egypt, when Pharaoh wanted to build the pyramids, they built the pyramids. So they got, as it were, their tabernacle. But they built it on the backs of slaves. Jewish slaves. The same kind of people who God is talking to in Exodus. I want you to build a tabernacle. And I want it to glorify God. But it's got to be a party. It's got to come from a place of freedom. You can get the tabernacle. You can build a pyramid, sure. But I don't want any slavery in this. Everything we do is going to be done a different way. So here's what God said. Exodus 25, verse 2. Only from those whose hearts move them shall you raise the contribution. Only from those who bless this, only from those who know and believe that this is from God and this is for God shall you raise the contribution. Any other motive is unacceptable. So if you don't know and believe that this is from and for God, if your heart isn't in this, Just keep your money. I don't want your money, which is not generally something you hear from, you know, like a fundraising person. But there's something really big at stake here. There's something really big at stake here. See, this is not just about building a tabernacle. Now, it is about building a tabernacle. I mean, that is, you know, and if people don't give, the tabernacle will not be built. And it's not just about supporting a ministry, Though it is about supporting a ministry, and if people don't give, the ministry will go away. It's about that, but it's about something else. It's about going to a party, and I don't want any party poopers at this party, says the Lord. Which he didn't actually say. He never did say poopers. He would never say that. I really mean it when I say this, and I don't know if this sounds like a radical thing. Why are you crazy? I've never heard anything like this. I mean this all the way down to the ground. if you don't believe that this is for and from God keep your money I don't want anybody saying as it relates to how we do what we do around here keep it we don't need your ten bucks because you might have a tabernacle if people go okay I'll go whatever we might get a tabernacle that way and the ministry might be funded that way but we will miss the party and you've missed the point if you miss the party. By the way, do you know this about God? That he is really into celebrations. This matters to him. Things that make the heart glad that he's really into parties and he throws a few himself. This is important. You need to know this about God. John Taylor, the bishop of Winchester, England makes this clear in his book entitled Enough, Enough, when he points out that once a year at Passover, all Jewish families would bring a tithe, again, one-tenth of all that they had to Jerusalem to be offered up to God. But this offering, this particular tithe, there were several tithes actually in Israel, but this particular offering wasn't used to fund the outreach ministry or to sustain the ongoing ministry of the temple because this time the offering was used for a party, a gigantic blowout party at which one-tenth of all the assets of the nation's population would be spent on a banquet of celebration. There was singing and dancing, and everyone was invited, the rich, the poor, the village idiot, the tax collector, the people of questionable reputation. All of them came, and all of them gave, and all of them celebrated the life and the love of God that they enjoyed as a community of faith. The music would play into the night as the party went on for days with the finest of wines and the best of meats. Deuteronomy 14, 26. Speaking of this particular celebration, says this, you shall spend your money. This is like a command from God. You shall spend your money on whatever your heart desires for this particular celebration, for oxen, for sheep, for wine, for strong drink, which just, the Baptists go, on tilt, on that one. For whatever your heart desires, and there, let's get the rest of this. I love the rest of this. And there you shall eat in the presence of the Lord, your God, and rejoice. Because God's coming to this party. And he's throwing the party. No wonder, says Taylor, the children of Israel said, I was glad when they said unto me, let us go to the house of the Lord. And if you want to read more about that, you can go look it up in Deuteronomy 14. But before you do that, come back with me to the book of Exodus, where Moses is collecting the offering to build the tabernacle because the most amazing thing is happening. Beginning in Exodus 35, it says this, that the hearts of the people were stirred and their spirits were moved and all of those whose hearts were moved, both men and women, it says in Exodus 35, 22, began to come and give brooches and earrings and signet rings and bracelets and all articles of gold so much so that in exodus 36 verse 5 i love this the report came back to moses the people are bringing much more than enough so moses issued a command and a proclamation a command and a proclamation which which circulated throughout the camp saying essentially this stop thus the people were restrained from giving see that in the texts they were restrained from giving anymore and so So then the people rejoiced. And it wasn't just because they gave. They rejoiced because they had given so willingly. It wasn't just that the tabernacle got built. It was how it got built. It was so joyful. They gave willingly, for they made their offering with a whole heart. And Moses rejoiced greatly as well. Sounds like a party to me, like the closing scene of It's a Wonderful Life. So let me ask you a question. Have you ever tasted that? Have you ever seen or experienced that? Have you ever been to a party like that? Well, as I asked that question to myself this week, I thought, yeah, I have. And we have, actually. I mean, we had a party like that right here. You know what I'm talking about, don't you? I think you do. Right here, and it started here, and then after it started here, It spilled out into the gathering place because it's all anybody could talk about. Then it spilled out into the parking lot and then it spilled out into some of your homes. And what I'm talking about is a few months ago when Steve Hansen came back from Haiti. Our group of people with Steve was in Haiti when that earthquake happened. And then they came back and Steve and I sat on this stage on two stools and Steve kind of told the story and the need and was reminded, we were reminded of this long-term relationship we've had with some specific people in Haiti. and we just opened it up and said, what can we do? What can we do? How can we be part of helping meet that need? And in just a couple of days, $200,000, $200,000 were raised for that. And a lot of you dug down deep and a lot of you gave what you couldn't afford to give, but it felt like what? Joy. And some of you, you wouldn't have used this kind of language at all, but I remember feeling this with Bonnie. We talked about this and it wasn't this thing, but you knew there was a party going on. I want to be part of it. I don't want to miss the party. So I'm going to give. And it came at a bad time for a lot of us and you did it anyway. And it felt like joy. But now add to that. See, I really do get that and I've tasted that and so have you. But now add to that the voice of the Apostle Paul who in 2 Corinthians 9-7, among other places, in 2 Corinthians 9-7 indicates that this kind of atmosphere and attitude in giving is not to be a blip on the screen. It's not to be reserved for special occasions only, though it would obviously apply to special occasions. It's not to be reserved for special occasions only, like a building program for the tabernacle or the temple or an earthquake in Haiti. Rather, think bigger than that and bring this way of living and giving into whatever you give. whatever you give to whatever you give, give this way, says Paul in 2 Corinthians 9, 7, as you purpose in your heart. You can see up on the screen there. Each one must do just as he has purposed. Give is the do there. Give just as he has purposed in his heart, which speaks to something very important. Because what it means is this, that our giving needs to be intentional. There's intentionality. It involves preparation. It involves thinking and wondering and praying. Let me kind of say it this way. This party I'm trying to describe is not a party you just stumble into. Though sometimes, you know, you do go to parties that way. You didn't know a party was going on. You go, whoa, this is fun. Maybe that's kind of how a Haiti thing happens. But there's dimensions of this party that I'm inviting you into as the people of God that is not a party you just stumble into. No, this is a party you decide to go to. You purpose in your heart to be part of this. And in the purposing in your heart, in the intentionality around it, what you'd begin to do is wonder with God, and maybe with some people in your family, I don't know how you would do it, what should we bring to the party? How can we best enter in to the joy of this? What would it look like to have our finances rightly ordered under the rule and reign of God and to bring that to this party? You know, there's a joke all the time about how long I've been here, 30 years. Jen actually said, I said she'd be in a nursery. She said she wasn't born when I got here 30 years ago. Wow. Anyway, it just makes me feel so young. I'm peppy but I have I'm in my 30th year actually and there's a long time and I've just I mean my whole life I've been in church it's just kind of in me and I know the good stuff and they delight me and I know the stupid stuff and whatever but I know how some people give I know how it works and for a lot of people it's kind of this thing you don't really it's not that you're bad or evil or even stingy you just don't know much about the party actually and so you kind of the offering plate comes by and you throw in it I remember somebody, a dollar bill would be in and I'd go, wow, whoa, big spender here. And then, and, and, and, you know, it's like wagging your finger. Now I'm, you're yelling at now, you know what? Just kind of, that's impulsive. People kind of reach in and, well, I have five, I'll throw in five, well, I have 20. And then you start praying, I hope I don't have 100, that'd be bad. Give that. But that kind of giving, it's, it's impulsive. It's not intentional. You didn't purpose to give. You didn't think. You didn't pray. And it's the amount there, oh, it's only a buck. That's not the issue. The issue is you're missing a party. So here's what I suggest. To enter into the party, each person, as he purposes in his heart, if you really want to enter into this, you've got to think about this. It needs to be intentional. You need to give on purpose. Indeed, back to 2 Corinthians 9, 7, let each one of you give just as you have purposed in your heart. Then it goes on, not grudgingly, nor of necessity, not because Pastor Dave wagged his finger at you. Don't give because of that. God loves a cheerful giver. Why is, in fact, that's again, growing up in church, God loves a cheerful giver. And people would take that literally and go, God doesn't love me if I don't give, and I need to be cheerful too. So they'd pretend they were cheerful. I hate giving. Hi. Hi. He knows what that means. God loves a cheerful giving. You know what that means? It means when he sees us giving freely, it means you've come to the party and it means you get it and it makes him happy. He loves that because you're enjoying this. You've entered into this in a way that means you're gonna be able to really enjoy the party that kingdom giving really is. But all of that raises a question. And it's a kind of a sticky question, but I'm gonna raise it anyway. the question is this. How can I be a cheerful giver? How can I be a happy, joyful giver, particularly when it comes to giving to the church, maybe even this church, if I don't like the church? That creates a problem, doesn't it? Hard to be happy giving. I hate this church, you know? How do you give like joyfully if you don't support the church, if you don't like the direction, if you don't trust the leadership? Here's an answer. This is brilliant. You're going to think, this guy is so smart. You can't. It's really hard to do that. If you hate what's going on, if you don't like to, if you don't trust the leadership, give happily, you can't do it. You can't do it. But here's another word. This going to the party thing is really so important. Here's what you need to do if you hate the church. I hope you don't hate this one, but if you, you desperately need to go and find a church where you do trust the leadership and believe that what's going on there is for and from God. Because going to this party matters, and if you hate it here or anywhere, it's going to spoil the party for you and for everybody else. You know, here, this is weird. I mean, I really mean this. I honestly don't want people giving grudgingly, nor of necessity, because you're missing the party. And in fact, if you're giving like that, okay, I'll give. If you're giving like that, honestly, this is so weird, but your money feels dirty to me. You don't have the spirit of what God is trying to do around your money. See, I'm inviting you to a party, says the Lord, and it really matters. It really matters that you get this, because, but if you're going to come to this party and enter into it, there's some spiritual things that are going to, everything is so connected, because you're going to have to open up your heart, and you're going to have to soften your heart. And you're going to have to loosen your grip on your stuff. And if you're like most people, the first thing you feel at the prospect of doing that, of opening your grip, loosening your grip, the first thing most people feel is fear. Especially if you've never done it before. Especially if you've never been to a party like this before, which is precisely why I believe God in Malachi 3 extends the invitation to this party this way. Malachi 3, verse 10, starting here in the middle of the verse, actually. God says, try me now in this. You put me to the test. God hardly ever, in fact, Jesus said, don't put God to the test. When God says, I'm breaking a rule right here. You try me in this. You test me in this, and see if when you soften your heart and loosen your grip, bouncing back up to the beginning of the verse, see if when you bring to the storehouse the whole tithe, I don't open for you the wonders, the windows of heaven, and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows. And the blessing is financial sometimes, but sometimes the blessing is spiritual. And sometimes the sense of blessing you get in the kingdom of God is, you ever just have this sense when you just did the right thing? You know what, it felt good. It cost us something, but we did the right thing. And there's this blessing that comes. In other words, Malachi 3, verse 10, I'm inviting you to a party. By the way here It wasn't until just a couple years ago actually I saw Malachi 3 this way That I was really able to understand Malachi 3 And embrace it the way I do now And I actually, I got this picture in my head Some years ago about this I wouldn't call it a vision necessarily But it is a picture I have And here's how I see it The storehouse that the prophet is speaking of in Malachi I see, this is goofy, but I see it in my mind as a barn. And maybe you can see this with me. As I look at this barn, I'm out in this field, and all the lights in the barn are on. So it's dark, it's dusk, it may be night, but the lights in the barn are on, so I kind of know something's going on in that barn. I'm not sure what, but I'm not there. I'm not in the barn. And then in this picture I have, the Lord of the barn, that would be God, Jesus, he kind of comes out, and he looks at me, and he says this. hey Dave, want to come to the party? Come on. There's something going on in here. And here's the deal. You're never going to enjoy the party from out there. But here's the other deal, Dave. When you come to this party, bring a whole tithe. Bring, bring, bring. You got to bring something to this party to enjoy the party. In other words, Dave, here's how I heard it. Dave, soften your heart and loosen your grip and give and see if I don't bless you beyond anything you give. In fact, it's the most fun you're ever gonna have. It's the most joy you will ever feel. Now, here's the deal. People who believe that and have entered into that are joyful givers. And by the way, you gotta expand. This principle is so ingrained in the kingdom of God. It's one of the reasons I feel so strong about preaching this forcefully because there's a lot of things you give. Your time, you give your attention. I'm giving a word today that's coming from my soul, and I'm giving it away. You give things for free. When people are done doing really hard things, they feel spent. That's an economic word. You give things away. And in the giving, there comes a kind of joy. And it isn't always, it's not always that kind of joy. It's this sense you gave something away, and you don't even know what the product is going to be, but there will come something from it. See, this whole perspective on giving is I'm going to a party, and while I may not know how God is going to use what I've given, whether it be money or something else, I may not know how God's going to bless it or multiply it or spread it. Here's what I know. It's that he will bless it and spread it and use it. So I'm going to a party, and I'm going to give away what God's given me to give. And this spirit affects our money. Money is one of the most tangible things. That's why it's so important that we do it. But this thing needs to bleed. It creates a whole way of living and being and interacting in the kingdom of God. I love that text, Luke 6, 38, I think it is. Press down, given it shall be given to you. Press down, shaking together, running over. And all the prosperity theologians say, That's a promise that if you give, God will give you more, money. And sometimes it does work that way. But if you read the text, it's all about giving generally, not just money. If you read, go up two verses. God says, I want you to be forgiving. And I want you to be graceful. And I want you to be full of love. And I want you to be forgiving and pardoned and graceful. And if you give those things, God will give back to you. Give and it will be given. Give grace, give forgiveness, give mercy, and it will be given to you, pressed down, shaken together, running over. This stuff releases kingdom of God realities. One more thing. Just to kind of really quick pull this together, that might help explain why going through this party is so much fun and is so rewarding and is so important. Because going through this party has the power, like few other things, to break the grip of mammon, to help us as a community walk out of this Egypt where we have lived as slaves. And this kind of point Paul makes full circle for us. For the last couple of weeks, I think you know, we've been talking about mammon. Mammon that, in my view, is not just money, but it's a spiritual force behind money whose job it is to seduce us into believing that money is not just a resource, but it's a source of life and joy and peace and security. And if we believe that, I've been saying. We will pursue money as if it has the power to give us life. We will grasp it, hoard it, might even steal it, eventually becoming a slave to it. I love the picture that Milton provides in his classic work called Paradise Lost, where he depicts Mammon as an angel before the fall, saying this, that even then, before the fall, Mammon existed as a spiritual being, much like an angel. But even before the fall, he was thought to be the least upright of all the spirits. for even when mammon was in the presence of God, get this picture, before the demonic hordes followed Satan into his rebellion against God, even then the angel Mammonos studied the gold of the streets more than the glory of God. And the posture of that is very significant. He studied the gold of the streets. The glory of God was here. He wasn't looking at that. He was looking at the gold of the streets. So the picture I have in my mind is of mammon as a spirit, thanks to Milton in this thing here, is that he's bent over. and he's looking down at the earth and basically he's saying it's here. I know it's here. And people who are affected by mammon, under the grip of mammon, you're living the same way. It's here. You're bent over. It's here. And sometimes this it's here thing is manifested in greed, but sometimes it's manifested in fear. It's here. I know it's here. I can't find it, but it's here. And this is where you think it is. Contrast that posture, intentional this posture is, with a different posture which speaks to a different kind of life, a different kind of living, and the posture, rather than bent over like this, is simply just watch me standing straight up, but not just standing straight up, but standing straight up into God. Like Abraham, who in Genesis 14, 22, Genesis, first book of the Bible, Genesis 14, 22 is the first example in Scripture of any kind of offering to God. And Abraham was coming from a battle, and they won the battle, and he had with him the spoils of war. He meets the priest of Salem, which eventually became Jerusalem, Melchizedek, and he offers to Melchizedek an offering out of this bounty that Abraham believes God has supplied, and what Abraham says in Genesis 14, verse 20 through 22 is this, I have lifted my hands up. Notice the posture change. Mammon's here, Abraham is here. I lifted my hands up to the Lord. God most high, possessor of heaven and earth. Everything I have belongs to you. And from that perspective on life, Abraham gave a tenth of all he had. A tenth being a symbol of the whole. Everything belongs to you. I'm giving a tenth to kind of remind myself that this all belongs to you. It was the first offering in scripture. First time a tithe was ever mentioned. And here's the deal. Very few things have more power on earth to break the grip of mammon. Not just giving, but here's what has the power to break the grip of mammon, the spirit of Abraham. That spirit that says, Lord God, most high, possessor of heaven and earth, everything I have belongs to you, and out of that I give. And a tenth would be a symbol of the whole to acknowledge it all belongs to you. And this spirit of Abraham is what we've come to call around here at Open Door, the spirit of the tithe. the spirit of the tithe you know if you're an open door person you've heard me teach on this before and if you're new to open door you really need to get this I really want you to know you know I have people come in where's your stand what's your stand on this and this okay here's our stand on this the spirit of the tithe and it matters that you get this because it matters not just what you give but how you give the spirit of the tithe is not a law that says you have to give a tenth it's a spirit and I wonder if it's as strong a spirit as the spirit of mammon. If you get the spirit of the tithe, you get something that counteracts the spirit of mammon. It's a spirit that on a consistent basis says this, I will lift up my hands and open them wide to the Lord God most high, acknowledging him as the possessor of heaven and earth, that everything I have belongs to him and to remind myself of that fact, I will give a tenth of all I have and I will do it every week and every month and every year, and I will do it on purpose. I will purpose in my heart, not grudgingly, nor of necessity. I want to join this party. You know, some years ago, if you would have asked me, well, Pastor Dave, do you teach a tithe here as the basic standard of giving? Some years ago, I would have said, no, I don't. For a variety of reasons, I considered all biblical. I had done a bunch of study on the tithe in the Old Testament and stuff like that, and I'd come to the conclusion that the tithe is not the standard, but today, to that question, for different reasons, I now say yes, absolutely yes. Primarily because I know of nothing better or more biblical than the spirit of the tithe. This is not a law, it's a spirit. The spirit of the tithe to consistently keep me and us aligned to the values of the kingdom and to consistently keep me free from the enslaving grip of mammon. So you try me now in this, says the Lord. if when you bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows, come join the party. Enter into the freedom and joy that God initiated, spirit-directed, heartfelt giving really, really is. And see to it that no one takes you captive. And no one is allowed to deceive you through the empty deception of the traditional thinking of men related to money or the elementary principles of the world rather than these kinds of things. That Christ, in whom, has hidden all the treasure of wisdom and knowledge about life and how to live it, possesses. I want to speak of benediction over you. As I close, it's right out of 2 Corinthians, the text I gave, 2 Corinthians 9, verse 7. There's some words around that I want to speak over. Yeah, I just want you to stand as we close. Now this I say, he who sows sparingly will reap sparingly. And it's talking about money here, but it's talking about other things. In biblical times, they would be giving grain or they would be giving time. Just this whole spirit of giving. And here's the deal, this I say, he who sows sparingly, I don't know if I will reap sparingly, but he who opens up their heart and opens up their hands and sows bountifully, we tend to reap the same way, bountifully, let each one of you do as he has purpose in his heart, not grudgingly nor under compulsion because God just loves it when you give it for free. When you've entered the party, now, let me help you with this too. Verse 10, he who supplies seed to the sower. In other words, he who gives you something to give in the first place and bread for food. Let me just tell you, he will supply and multiply your seed for sowing. He will give you more to give and increase the harvest of your righteousness and you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving to God. for this ministry of giving, this service that you're doing is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God. In other words, the fact that you are so free in your giving is causing people who are the recipients of your free giving to go, thank you, God. So worship is erupting because of your faithfulness, because of the proof given by this ministry. They glorify God for your obedience to the confession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all, while they also, by prayer on your behalf, yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you. Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift, because all of our giving starts there with his indescribable gift to us, which stirs in us this desire to give. And all God's people said, amen. Amen.
