For once we were not a people, but now we are a people. What does it mean to be a people? With that in mind, let's go to prayer as we prepare ourselves for the table. Father, we pray that your Spirit would be among us in such a way that we would be able to hear and to see the things you would like us to hear and to see, to enter into the reality and the fullness of who we are as your people, the church. And I do pray that these words that affirm our identity together as a community would prepare us as a community to come this morning to your table and to your cross for all that we need. and I pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, as most of you know, if you've been with us the last several weeks, we've been taking a break for our study in the book of the Acts to extend to you what we're calling an invitation to join us as a church on a mission, a mission that we have identified as involving, among other things, this, a willingness to enter into what we think is the struggle of becoming fully alive in God. And to identify it as a struggle and to identify it that way right up front, we think is significant because we really do think that becoming fully alive in God is in fact a process. It is in fact a journey that sometimes involves a struggle because sometimes, not always, but sometimes I don't want to obey. I don't want to humble myself under the mighty hand of God. It preaches well, and it's the right thing to say, but what that feels like to come under the mighty hand of God, I don't always like to do that, to submit myself not just to God, but to you. The apostle Paul talks about that very thing in Ephesians 5 when by the filling of the spirit, a community of faith begins to submit to one another in the fear of Christ to submit not only to God, but to you. Are you kidding? Preaches well, but how do you do that? What would that actually look like to come under other people that maybe I don't trust or even like? To have this attitude in you, in us, which was also in Christ, and the attitude that was in Christ was this, that although he existed in the form of God, he regarded equality with God a thing not to be grasped, but he emptied himself. Stop right there. He emptied himself. And then at the beginning of that section in Philippians chapter 2, it says, have this attitude in you. No, no. Because to authentically empty yourself of anything, you know it's true, requires letting go of something. And we think that letting go of anything sometimes can be a struggle. To let go of your need to control. Again, you can talk about that. No, the need to do it. Have all sorts of Bible verses around your life. But everyone knows you as the most controlling person they've ever met. To let go of that is, for some people, I don't know, a struggle. Let go of the need to be right to get your way, to look good and to win, to admit that you're wrong. I'm, that's not that easy. To admit that it's me and not you, it was me. Sometimes it's easy. Sometimes letting go of that stuff is easy, flows easy. You see the benefit of it and the release that comes with it. but sometimes letting go of things like that, which means an emptying of yourself, feels like you're going to die. But what we've learned about life in the kingdom of God is that when you do empty yourself of things like that, you let go of things like that, you don't die. In fact, certain parts of your life begin to blossom. You begin to come to life. Indeed, the more you enter into that kind of emptying of yourself, The more you come to life, more and more and more life. Colossians 3 verse 1 says it this way. In fact, Colossians 3 is kind of the biblical place that I think the language for this was born here at Open Door. It says this, that since then you have indeed been raised with Christ. In other words, you have spiritually come alive. You were dead in your transgressions and in your sin, but since you have now been raised with Christ, you're alive with Christ. keep seeking those things that give life. Indeed, keep seeking those things that give more and more life so you can become fully alive, and the things that give life are those things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, but that's not a magic wand. We've made that clear over and over again that makes all those things happen. It's not a magic wand that produces more and more and more life in us, Because as it turns out, becoming fully alive in God involves taking off some things. It involves putting on some things. It involves even, according to Colossians 3 later on in the text, putting to death certain things. Lay aside, therefore. It says in verse 8 of Colossians 3, all your anger. Ready? Go. That's why we think it's a process. It's a journey, and sometimes it involves a struggle. Lay aside, therefore, all your anger, wrath, and malice. Put on, therefore, verse 12, a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, and love. Put to death, therefore, because as it turns out, for certain things in your life to come to life, some things need to die. Put to death, therefore, verse 5, immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, And greed, ready go, all of that is why we believe this thing is a process. It's a journey. Sometimes it's a hard one involving a struggle to lay aside and to put on ends, to put to death. And here we are inviting you into a struggle, which is kind of crazy, I think, because I don't know, I invite people to parties, generally not to struggles. And when I do invite people to struggles, nobody comes. They don't show up. I don't know what that's about. I kind of do, actually, know what that's about. But there it is. I mean, it's right there in our mission statement. And if you've been here at Open Door for any length of time, you know that's our mission statement. We put it right up front. And it really is an invitation that we hope you'll respond to because we want all of you to join us on what we think is a journey. that we think sometimes is a struggle, but we also believe that it's worth it. We believe that it's doable. Indeed, we believe it's desirable. But if in real life, we're ever going to actually see it that way, as doable, desirable, if we're ever going to actually feel that way about this journey that we're telling you right up front is sometimes a struggle, We're going to have to discover some things, which is precisely why for the last several weeks we've been talking about what we need to discover. Discover, connect, and serve. We talk about that a lot around here. We're kind of honing in on this first thing, the things we need to discover as a church. The first thing was this, some things we need to discover about God because all of it begins there. So who is God was the first question we began to deal with some weeks ago. What kind of God is God? Because the answer to that question has a lot to do with how this faith in God and life with God is going to play out. So is he angry or is he not? Is he knowable or is he not? Is he distant or is he near? Is he vengeful or is he kind? Is he lion or is he lamb? Is he both? Who is God? was the first question that we dealt with, followed by who are you or who am I? Individually, as a person, who are you? Who am I? Turns out, and Vicki Degner brought the word kind of flowing right out of her story in a beautiful way, turns out we're the beloved. The beloved of God, that is our name. That's who we are. That's who you are. I am the beloved, which brought us then last week to this third question that we're dealing with again today. Who are we? Not individually this time as the beloved, but corporately, who are we as a people? Who are we as a group? Who are we as a church? Who are we? Which again, we think is a very important thing to understand and to discover because if there's a we involved in this journey that we've already told you is a struggle, but if there's a we involved in this journey, it changes the journey because now I don't have to take it alone. Even if it is a struggle, I can take it with you and you can take it with me. There's a we, so who are we? it's not a question we talk about every week i don't know if i've ever even kind of honed in on this particular question this particular way ever to even consider such a thing it is the question of the day it might end up being the question of the month because there's a bigger issue involved than just who are we like open door who are we bigger than that is what is the church not just ours, but the church. Why are we here? What is it that we're going to when we're going to church? Do you go to church? What kind of church? Pretty common question. You've maybe asked it yourself. Had someone ask it of you. What kind of church is it that you go to? Is it a Baptist church or a Catholic church? The answer to that question tells me some things. Is it a spirit-filled church or not that kind of church. I've had people call me and ask me about our church. Is it a spiritual church? And sometimes I don't know how to answer that question. Is it a big church or a little church? A secret-driven church or a missional church? A liberal or conservative church? Is it a mega church or a small group church? Is it a friendly church or a really cool and hip church? Is it a Bible-believing church? Or do you read from another book altogether? Does your church have a choir? How about a band? Do they sing rock and roll? Are you a worshiping church? How about a contemporary church? Because I'm looking for a church, just the right kind of church. So what kind are you? Who are you? Who are we? Is the question of the day. What is the church? Why are we here? Which is, in fact, a question that Al Shuck began to answer last week by going to the book of Titus, where the Apostle Paul, in chapter 2, verse 14, refers to the church as being, among other things, this phrase again, this word again, a people is what he calls them, calls us. You can see it on the screen. a people for God's own possession, eager, some translations say zealous, to do what is good. We are a people. But I don't think of myself as a people. I think of myself as a person. Paul says, okay, you're an idiot. That's how he talks to me. Okay, you're a person. But we, we are a people. I want you to get your head around that a little bit. You are a person. I get it. We are a people, a people or a community, according to Paul and Titus, belong to God. We're called his possession. A people for God's own possession, eager to do what is good, which is why last week Al talked about the church being like those people on the Atlantic coast. Remember that? In Massachusetts somewhere where ships were sinking and people just began to come around and they developed this thing that Al told us were called huts of refuge, where these people would go out and save people who were dying because their ship had sunk, run into the rocks that were close to the shore. Because what he was trying to do, that is Al, he was trying to describe to us a people, but a certain kind of people who were eager to do what is good. They were eager to do all that they could to seek and to save drowning people in that case, to find lost people, a kind of people who would do everything they can to help desperate people, to mend broken people, to feed hungry people. So who are we? Is the question. Well, that's who we are. What I just said is who we are. We are a people, a people for God's own possession, eager to do things like that, to find and to help and to mend and to feed. But sometimes we forget who we are. You know it's true, which is why sometimes huts of refuge, again, what Al talked about last week, become not much more than a yacht club that used to find lost people and help desperate people, that used to heal and used to mend. Peter, the apostle Peter, said all of this this way. In fact, he's saying all of this, kind of the same way as Paul did when in 1 Peter 2.19, it's the text that Christine read just a moment ago. Peter refers to the church as being, among other things, this, a chosen race. We are. Who are we? We are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation. We are a people. So there it is again. We're a people for God's own possession, whose primary purpose, whose mission as a people, end of verse 9, is to proclaim the excellencies of him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. For once we were not a people, but now we are a people. The people of God, but what does that mean? Preaches. Well, what does it mean to be a people, a chosen people, no less. In fact, as you think about that, I actually, it's okay to think about that, but I want you to try to find your feeler in this. What does that feel like to you when I declare over you that we are a people? Do you feel anything at all? Does it feel real to you when I tell you we are a people? Does it resonate at all with you when we gather in this room real time, like even right now, or do it week after week, do you ever have a sense when you're here with us as a people that that is what we are, in fact, a people that we're in this thing together, striving together, says the Apostle Paul to the church in Philippi, striving together for the faith of the gospel, or is all of that kind of a foreign concept to you? I mean, you understand in your head, and you're sure maybe someone else maybe feels that kind of belonging, but maybe not you, maybe not ever, because church, for many of us, is, and this isn't an evil thing, by the way, it's just kind of the way it is. It's a place that you go to. It's an organization that you belong to, providing. I love this. Dallas Willard talks about the church as, particularly in America, the church being an organization that provides religious goods and services. And if they're the religious goods and services that suit your particular taste or my particular taste, then I might go to that church. If they really provide the kinds of things that I really, really want, I might even support that particular church. So what kind of church are you? what kind of church are we? Are we a seeker church or a missional church? I need to know before I decide to go to that church. Are we a seeker church or a missional church? A spirit-filled church or not that kind of church? Are we a liberal or conservative church? Because I'm looking for a church, just the right kind of church. So who are we? so I was thinking about all this stuff I had a memory of years ago we were back in the Robbinsdale building and and we were going through a study in the book of the exodus it was a fascinating time I don't remember how long it took but we began at the beginning of the exodus when they were exiting from Egypt it was a symbol of their redemption the people of God were moving and we kind of went with the people of God for several months going through the book of the exodus through the Red Sea, 40 years of wandering, but whatever else they were, it just kept coming up over and over again. It was very clear they were a people, referred to over and over again as just that, the people of God. They were a people for God's own possession. In fact, most of the places where you hear a reference, in fact, in 1 Peter 2, what I just read when he calls us a chosen race, a royal priest, and a holy nation, a people, all of that is a quote from the Old Testament. a people for God's own possession. But because they were a people, that designation did not make them somehow perfect, far from perfect, if you know the story at all of the people of God, who were a people for God's own possession. They grumbled and complained pretty much all the time, Pretty much from day one, they forgot over and over again who they were as a people. They forgot over and over again who God was. In fact, part of the story, if you were just to tell it quickly, it would be that they were a people and then they would forget. And then they would remember. And then they would return. And then God would forgive. And then they would rejoice. And then they would forget. And then they would remember. And then they would repent. And then God would forgive. round and round and round they go. They fought amongst themselves. And as we were going through the book of Exodus, what became clearer and clearer was those people were just like you, us. They were just like us. They were like a church. And the lessons that we pulled from Those people in Exodus were the same as lessons that we as a people in our day and age, we call ourselves a church, the same lessons that we needed to learn. I remember the roundabout ways of God. It was one of my favorites in that whole series of things we talked about in Exodus. This came in Exodus 13, and the lesson was this, that God cares more about. Think about a people who are journeying somewhere, and where they want to get to is the promised land, whatever that is, the promised land kind of being symbolic of all my dreams fulfilled, the promised land. That's what God promised us. But Exodus 13, the principle was this. God cares more about who it is we are becoming than where it is we're going, because the land, the promised land, was right there. As we join the people, this is back in the Robbinsdale days, almost 18 years ago, I think, just coming right out of Egypt. They hadn't come to the Red Sea yet, and there was something they knew. They knew about the promised land. God had named even where it was, and what they knew was this, two weeks journey. If we go straight. Once you left Egypt, all you had to do was cross the Sinai Peninsula, and you were there. So as they're coming out of the slavery of Egypt, the promised land was, they could smell it. But God, Exodus 13 verse 17, did not lead them by the way of the land, the promised land, but he led them around by the way of the wilderness. And we called it the roundabout way, which is a very irritating thing about God. Particularly if you're, I don't know, a normal human being, but particularly if you're an impatient, make-it-happen kind of human being. And it's not just the time it takes to take the roundabout way. It's that God's agenda, and here's the rub. It's not just the time it takes. It's that God's agenda is part of what we learned in these wilderness wanderings. His agenda is almost always different than mine, than ours. And he is just not in a hurry like I am and we are because my agenda, real clear, I'll make it clear, it's to get there to the promised land. God, you promised it. And again, the promised land is symbolically the fulfillment of what you want, your hopes and dreams. And there they are, my agenda to get there. I want to arrive there. I want to drink the milk and taste the honey and do it yesterday. Please, thank you, Jesus. So let's go this way and fast. My idea. It's a good idea. It's what leaders do. God sends them that way and slow. Because God's agenda for his people is not just to deposit them in the proverbial promised land, all their dreams fulfilled. His agenda is to develop them, his people, called by his name, his own possession. His agenda is to develop them into a kind of people so that maybe when they get to the land, whatever that is, they might have something to give the land of benefit, of life, of substance and depth. So like it or not, here's the deal. God cares more about who it is we are becoming. It's true now too. than where it is we're going, than what it is we think we're accomplishing or are supposed to accomplish. So who are we becoming? And all of that really is part of what it means to be a people. All of that really is part of what it means to be a church. Let's experience that kind of journey with a people. you'd have to stick around long enough to go through some things like that in order to become the kind of people who might be able to step into a different kind of land a different kind of place which brings me or reminded me this week as I was thinking about that this week it reminded me of another poignant part in our study in the book of Exodus years ago because while there were many parallels, over and over we saw them. It was a very exciting study because they're all paralleled to church. Many parallels between their story and ours, their journey and ours. There was one part of their story and journey that we couldn't replicate. And I'm not sure I even mentioned it then, but I do think we talked about it as elders, and it was one of those conversational things that was just kind of interesting. And the thing we couldn't replicate was this. In the book of Exodus, when the people of God didn't get their way, and they didn't get their way, just like you and I don't get our way all the time, most of the time. When the water was bitter, and the manna was boring, and the leaders were stupid, and the people were prickly, in the Exodus, these people who were a people had nowhere else to go. It's fascinating to think about that. There was no other group to join because if they could have, they would have. There was no other church to find because if they could have, they would have. There was no other mate to marry because if they could have, they would have. So they had to stay. And it was part of the story I couldn't relate to because none of us have to stay anywhere. which became this fascinating thing for me to just think about because we don't have to stay and I'm not even saying we should stay. There are times when it's entirely appropriate even the best thing to go for a lot of reasons not even to escape something bad but to do something else. I'm not saying we should always stay but here's what I want you to think about and I think about this kind of stuff a lot. What if we did have to stay in church, in marriage? Well, I'm going to be miserable for the rest of my life. That's the answer to that question. Or what if in the staying, this is where God kicks in, and this is where the whole thing about God cares more about who you are becoming than where it is you're going? What if in the staying you actually learned how to do what you didn't think you knew how to do and didn't think you'd ever be able to do? What if you learned how to love a flawed human being, a prickly person? What if you learned how to do that? Now you are becoming. And by the way, everybody on the journey with Moses didn't do that. They did not become because a lot of them just stayed the way they were. I I can't get anywhere. And they just grumbled even more. But what if in the staying, there became a kind of person emerging who was learning how to forgive? Because you could hold it if you wanted. But we've got to stay. I've got to let this go. What if in the staying, you learned how to serve? What if in the staying, you learned how to submit and how to follow and even how to lead and do all that even when the water is bitter, do all that and even when the manna is boring and the leaders are stupid and the people are prickly. So who are we anyway? It's the question of the day. Might be the question of the month. It turns out we're a people. And sometimes we're a bitter, boring, stupid, prickly people. Once we're not a people, 1 Peter 2.10. But now we are a people. The people of God. A people for God's own possession, eager to do what is good, to build huts of refuge, to proclaim the excellencies of him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. And here we all are in this room right now to gather people. I'm glad it's communion this week. As I'm talking about this very thing, kind of opening this up and unpacking it more as weeks go on, I'm glad it's communion though today because in the moving of people, if you've been at Open Door before with communion, you know that we're going to begin to move in just a few moments to the stations where the elements, the bread and the wine are, and some will move to the cross and kneel and pray. And the moving of the people to the table, to the cross, to the prayer team people who will be up front, we're going to get to see something that we don't always get to see. It's always here, but we don't always see it because at this table and at this cross, as people move back and forth, what we're going to be able to see is who we are. And I want you to pay attention to who we are because we're all here. In fact, I want you to look around as people move. My wife and I very often in a nine o'clock service serve back in that corner and people come. And I don't always think of this as we begin, but by the time we're halfway through it, I'm just struck with the fact that not everybody's here, but old people and young people and babies and parents, they're all here. They're tall and they're short and they're fat and they're skinny. They're rich and poor, black and white and pick a color. There's saints and sinners here and they're coming. They're bitter and boring and stupid and prickly all here. So as it turns out, we're a people after all. Who once were not a people. But now we are the people of God. All standing in need of this grace. All standing in need of this bread and this cup and this cross. All invited on this journey that we think is a struggle. Having said yes to this mission, eager to do what is good together. And all of that journey, struggle, eagerness to do what is good begins right here at this table and right here at this cross. So come, people, and eat and drink and kneel and pray and join us on this mission as we learn how to be a people. Once we were not a people, but now we are a people. God's own possession. Let's go to the table. Stewards, would you take your place? I want you to stand with me as we enter into this, and I'd like to pray as we approach the table. Father, I thank you for this reminder of who we are, and I am mindful that we don't always talk like this. We're aware of who we are as individuals, but who we are as a people, your own possession, help us as we come to the table, not only to receive from you, but to see, to see maybe with fresh eyes who we are, a people who once were not a people, but now we are people for God's own possession. And we thank you and praise you for that. And all God's people said, amen. you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
