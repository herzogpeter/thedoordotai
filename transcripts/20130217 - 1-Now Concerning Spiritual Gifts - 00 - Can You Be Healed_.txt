Now, Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour, which is the hour of prayer. And a man who had been lame from his mother's womb was being carried along, whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, in order to beg alms of those who were entering the temple. When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he began asking to receive alms. But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, Look at us. And he began to give them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have, I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, walk. And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened. With a leap, he stood upright and began to walk. And he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. And also 1 Corinthians 12.1. Now, concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Let's pray. Let's go to the word. That utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, that I might make known with boldness the mystery of this good news. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Several years ago, the national press picked up a story that I saw in both the Star Tribune and Christianity Today. It showed up later there about a man named David Gilmore, along with his wife, Patty. decided not to take Dustin, their 15-month-old son, to a doctor when he became ill. Began with flu-like symptoms, and when they persisted, they brought him to church to be prayed for by their pastor and elders. Members of this church believed that faith alone can cure any disease, and that to look elsewhere for help like to a doctor would be a lack of faith. For several weeks they prayed earnestly, repeatedly confessing sin, real and imagined, including any wavering faith that God was in fact healing their sin, for that would be sin as well, to have wavering faith in their minds was sin. His temperature continued to climb when he no longer responded to sound. They prayed. They prayed harder when he went blind. Friends and family became concerned and assured Gilmore that to bring his son to a doctor was not inconsistent with faith, but he would not be dissuaded, not even when Dustin's neck swelled and his jaw muscles locked. May 14th, they went to church, as was their custom, and the pastor preached a particularly rousing sermon that day about faith. And they were encouraged. That night, their spirits soared when Dustin finally opened his mouth and took some food. The next morning, May 15th, Patty walked into the bedroom and found Dustin dead. But they weren't finished. They continued to pray, for they believed that the same faith that heals the sick raises the dead. David kept it up for about five minutes. Patty didn't last that long. Both were plummeted into a hopeless pit of despair. Dustin stayed dead. And then it only became worse when an autopsy revealed that Dustin died of a form of meningitis that if treated was easily cured. So, how do you react to that? Disgust? How could you do that? Pity? Anger? Confusion? But actually, how do you react to that story in light of the story that we're dealing with right now in Acts chapter 3? Have been for a couple of weeks where Peter and John tell a lame man to walk in Jesus' name. And he does. Because that kind of miracle is kind of the kind of thing that creates these Gilmore people thinking, and gee, that'll happen every time. How do you react to all of that? While some, hearing a story like the Acts 3 story, not the Gilmore story, look at stories like this in the Bible as more proof that the Bible is a storybook full of fables, not to be believed in a literal sense, maybe in metaphor or in symbol, but not real. As a teacher, a preacher guy, I feel a chill to tell you when I hear the Gilmore kinds of stories that people would take biblical stories as a reason to kind of act the way that Gilmore does. I feel a chill as a teacher. Be careful what you teach, what you encourage people to believe. When stories like this Gilmore story hit the national press, I got to admit to a tinge of embarrassment, actually, followed by a deep desire to distance myself from that kind of stuff and from those kind of people. And though they're Christians, these Gilmore types are Christians, So they're part of the family. I just want to run. And while I'm running, I want to shout as loud as I can to the entire world, we're not all like that. Every family has some crazy uncles, and that's ours. But that's when it gets weird for me, you guys, because in my running away from that which is disordered, I often run too far. It works like this. in my rush to get away from and disassociate myself from this idea that God always heals if we have enough faith, which I've seen create all sorts of damage in people, I sometimes, in trying to kind of get away from that, I sometimes find myself running into and unwittingly embracing the idea that God doesn't heal at all. So don't even ask. So while on one hand we have a problem with the Gilmores who never go to doctors, On the other hand, we have a problem with some Christians. Sometimes it's me who never go to God. And all of that is at least part of why last week, in our dealing with the story in Acts chapter 3, where Peter and John heal this lame beggar, I said that this week. We would talk a little bit more about what the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 refers to as the gifts of the Spirit, particularly these supernatural gifts like healing and faith, words of knowledge and prophecy, the effecting of miracles, too, which are precisely the kind of gifts and manifestations of the Spirit, if you will, that Peter and John are moving in and experiencing in Acts chapter 3, when they fix their gaze on this lame beggar, and in Jesus' name tell him to walk, And he does indeed with a leap, it says in verse 8. He stood up and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. He entered the temple. He entered the temple. You need to notice that. This part of the story where he enters the temple is very significant. It's entirely intentional. This is not incidental. It would be easy to miss that up until now in the story, this lame beggar was where? He was at the gate of the temple. Being at the gate of the temple is very symbolic because whatever else it means, it means that he is literally and figuratively outside. the temple. He is cut off from this kind of life. He is excluded from the temple, and again, this kind of life. Indeed, in Jesus' day, people who were lame, who were lepers, were not only considered physically unclean, they were spiritually unclean, and that makes you an outsider, excluded, cut off. But now, in this story, he's been brought near. By virtue of this healing, he is included. He is inside the temple. Again, just reading the story, easy to miss. Can't miss this piece. No longer cut off. He's been brought near. He is included, which sounds actually, wow, this is big. A lot like Ephesians 2, verse 12. The apostle Paul says this, that at one time, Ephesians 2, verse 12, At one time we were all there at the proverbial gates Separate from Christ Excluded and strangers from the covenant of promise Having no hope Just like the guy at the gate And without God in the world But now in Christ You who were formerly far off You were like everybody else at the gates have been brought near by the blood of Christ. You have been healed. Which speaks to a different kind of healing, doesn't it? And it's, in fact, a kind of healing that I think we need to keep in our mind as we talk about healing and supernatural manifestations of the Spirit, about the gifts of the Spirit, to produce and attend these kinds of healing. because this healing in Acts chapter 3, this manifestation of the Spirit that produced this healing is functioning, need to know this, like all healings do, is functioning at more than one level for more than one purpose because there's more than one way to be sick and need healing. You can be physically sick. You can be physically lame. The guy in Acts 3 was physically sick and you can also be sin, sick spiritually, sick heart, sick. The guy in Acts 3 was spiritually sick heart, sick. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come into all of that need with the supernatural manifestations of your spirit, with the gifts of your spirit, Gifts of your spirit that include healing, but there's more than one kind of healing and faith and words of knowledge, prophecy, affecting of miracles too. Because anything short of those kinds of manifestations of your spirit won't be much help for the kinds of sicknesses that we have. And all of that is at least part of why. Paul says what he says in 1 Corinthians 12, verse 1, it's the verse that Christian read at the end of the reading this morning when Paul says, And now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware. Here's why they're just too important, too central to the mission, too helpful to the cause, too easily misused by the Gilmores of the world. You cannot afford to not know, To be unaware of these things, the word unaware is agnosis. In the Greek, we get the word agnostic, kind of a familiar word. You know what that means. An atheist, to kind of give some contrast here, we know is someone who doesn't believe. And agnostic, interesting, as it relates to this story and how Paul is using it, is someone who doesn't know. Which is actually kind of safe. Don't you think, I don't know, we'll just kind of watch that and look at it from some distance. But I'm telling you, says Paul, in 1 Corinthians 12, verse 1, that given our mission to help lame people walk, and there's more than one way to be lame and need healing, need strength so you can walk. Because our mission, in light of the mission, it's to help blind people see. There's more than one way to be blind and deaf people hear and dead people rise. We can't afford to not know about these things. So, let's start our knowing this morning with some basics, some really simple things like the word gift, as in spiritual gifts. The Greek word for gift is charis. We get the word charisma. Charisma. And people who freely move into gifts are called charis. medics, which also can be translated really weird, people. What's fascinating to me about this word, and actually it kind of reduces it down, but in the reducing it down, it actually expands it for me. All that word really means, what it literally means is grace. Because all of the gifts that God ever gives, supernatural or not, Every way God has ever ministered to you, ministered through you in supernatural ways or not, every way that ever happens, those things are born of grace. Amazing grace. God gave you a gift. It wasn't because you were smart. It wasn't because you deserved it. God gave you a gift. When some ministry of God's Spirit came to you, it flowed through you. We sing the song Amazing Grace. I love that song. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved. A wretch like you, me, that saved. That's what amazing grace does. It saves us. I grew up hearing that wonderful story about the gospel, that amazing grace saved us so we go to heaven when we die. The amazing grace of God does more than save. It does that. It does more than forgive. It does that. The amazing grace of God, the charis of God, also enables and empowers us by means of these gifts of God's grace. These gifts of God's spirit enables us and empowers us to do what he's called us to do and to be who he's called us to be in the world. Which means, among other things, this. if these graces are real, that we have reason to believe that God could actually use people like us at a time like this, in a world like ours, under circumstances like these that most of the time scare us a lot and kind of want to make us pull everything in and just protect ourselves from the big bad wolf out there. But if these graces from God are real, we have reason to believe that God could maybe use ordinarily people like us to do the things that he did. And to say the things that he said. To literally be the body of Christ. To be his body in the world. But all of that, if it happens at all, is grace. It's a gift. Indeed, any way that God ever uses you or me, fulfills His purposes through you or me, is grace. It's a gift, which is yet another reason that we can't afford to be agnostic, that we can't afford to be unknowing, not knowing about these gifts of God's grace that come from the Spirit. They're called spiritual gifts. Ephesians 4, verse 7 says it this way. that to each one of us, Ephesians 4 verse 7, that to each one of us grace was given. Not just grace to save you, but to empower you. To each one of you, grace has been given. And the grace that God has given you, the gift that God has given you is according to the measure of Christ's gift. So if Christ's gift is a little tiny little thing, whatever you get from that gift, it will be a little tiny thing. It gets a little bigger when you realize what Christ's gift is. So what is Christ's gift? Sounds kind of weird. Well, as it turns out, it's pretty significant because Christ's gift is inclusive of everything. Christ's gift is inclusive of everything that he accomplished. In his incarnation, everything that he accomplished. In his crucifixion, in his resurrection, it includes everything that he accomplished. In the impartation also, in the impartation of his Holy Spirit to his people, the Holy Spirit, who, according to Paul in 1 Corinthians 12, 11, is working all of these things. Read it on the screen, verse 11. 1 Corinthians 12, verse 11. But one and the same Spirit works all of these things. And all of these things, because he's talking about the gifts of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 12, are the gifts of God's grace. these gifts of the Spirit. So the Spirit works all these things, distributing all these things to each one of us individually, just as He wants to, desires to, decides. So when He does that, He does that for this purpose. Ephesians 4 verse 12, for the equipping of the saints, for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ, to building up of the body of Christ. So these graces that come from the Spirit, that are enablements to do what God's called us to do and become who God's called us to become are given to us so the body can be built up for the building up of the body of Christ. Forget the religious language just for a second. Just picture in your mind a body, a physical body. Picture a physical body. anemic, weak. Can you see it there? Unable to stand right now, kind of skinny and scrawny, but now watch it in your mind's eye, this little skinny, scrawny body gaining strength. Where's it coming from? It's growing in stature. It's standing up straight. It's putting on, wow, it's putting on muscle. It's beginning to feel out. It's becoming skillful now. The process I just mentioned happens over time when you watch your kids grow up and they're skinny and scrawny and falling, all of a sudden your son turns into a man or your daughter turns into a woe. They're beginning to function. Their body is starting to work the way a body is supposed to work. And they begin to do the things they were designed to do. So think about it like this. 2,000 years ago, the manifestation of God in the world was Christ, Jesus Christ, the Nazarene. Remember him, an individual in a physical body. John 1.14 says this, And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, glories of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. We beheld his glory. We could see it with our eyes. But today, the manifestation of God in the world is this thing we call the church, his body. But by church, I think you know, that I'm not necessarily talking about the organized church, though I hope and I trust, indeed, I believe, that in the context of the organized church, you will actually find somewhere, I hope I'm not sounding too cynical here, you will find in there somewhere the authentic body of Christ, and I'm certainly not talking about a building that we might call church. I'm going to church as if that's in a building or it is a building because I'm talking about, I think you know this, Ordinary men and women, just like you and just like me, in whom the life of God by means of the Holy Spirit came in Acts chapter 2, this baptism in whom this Spirit really does reside, whoever that is, and wherever that is, that is the church, that is the body of Christ. And as that body made up of ordinary people, sometimes anemic and weak, skinny and scrawny, not functioning. The full measure of the stature of Christ begins to reverence, receive, and put into play all of the gifts of God's grace that are part of the measure of Christ's gift to the church. That body, skinny and scrawny as it might be right now, will begin to be built up, and by that building up, we'll be made strong enough to do what it's designed by God to do and to become what it's designed by God to become. And all of that is why, again, we can't afford to be agnostic, to be not knowing, to be unaware about these gifts of God's grace that empower us to do and to be. And it's why in the time I have left this morning, I want to give you two things. Two more things, actually, each of which are at the foundations of what we believe here at Open Door about the gifts of the Spirit. So in a way, it's a little unusual, I think, this morning. I don't talk this directly to kind of us as a church. It's all I do. This word, what I'm going to give you right now, is specific to us. Indeed, I consider what I'm about to share with you to be part of the spiritual DNA here at Open Door relative to this issue of the gifts of the Spirit, the gifts of God's grace. So if you're visiting with us this morning or you're new, good day, I think, for you to be here. Because you can listen to this and kind of decide, I want to get out of here really quick. That'd be good or not. And if you're not new and you've been on this journey with us for a while, good day to be here. Because I want to remind you of two things. And the two things are these, that we believe. that the gifts of God's grace, that these gifts of the Spirit are first of all rooted. They are first of all rooted in a promise, and second, they are purchased by the blood. They are rooted in a promise. They've been purchased by the blood because someone, you guys, kind of get into the metaphor of this gift thing. Someone had to pay for this gift, these gifts. Someone had to purchase these gifts so we could have them, open them, and learn how to use them, let's look first at this promise. And the promise is this. This is not new teaching here at Open Door, but I'm hoping in some ways we'll hear this with very fresh ears. The promise is this, found in Matthew 16, verse 18. Jesus is speaking to Peter. Peter is nervous about what's going to happen, and Jesus gives Peter this promise. Peter, know this. However scary it gets for you, I promise you I will build my church. And the gates of hell will not prevail against it, which is not normally a text that people associate with the gifts of the Spirit. But I think this text is central to an understanding of the gifts of the Spirit, at least it's central to our understanding of the gifts of the Spirit. To unpack all of that, the first thing I'd want you to note about this passage and the picture it paints is this, that the church in this picture, created by this promise in Matthew 16, is not passive or defensive. In other words, the picture is not of a church being built up into an impenetrable fortress where we huddle and hide behind these walls we've built safe. Are we from the big bad wolf out there? The big bad wolf out there is the world and the devil. Oh my. And church is this wonderful place we come and are protected by these walls that we have created, this fort we have built. And the promise for us, we think, is that this big bad wolf, the gates of hell, if you will, that are moving toward us all the time and trying to destroy us, the promise we think is that those gates coming at us will not prevail. Because we have such a strong fort. That's not the picture. It's not the promise. Indeed, the picture is this, of the church made up of ordinary men and women just like you and just like me, not only indwelt by the Spirit, but filled with the Spirit, Ephesians 5, under the influence of the Spirit, baptized, immersed into the Spirit, Acts 3, clothed with power from the Spirit, Acts 3, moving in and putting into play the gifts of the Spirit, saying among other things this, the way ordinary people might say it, and not full of necessarily bravado, but this church, baptized with the Spirit, full of the Spirit, says, maybe with quivering lip, we will go, we will go to the dark places, to the desperate places, we will go to the least and the lost places, we will go to the dead places, we will go to the demonically controlled places, And we will go to those places, first of all, right here, to those dark places and dead places in me. We will go to those dead and dark places in my marriage before I do the world. Remember last week the word from Jesus, don't go by way of the Gentiles. Don't go to the world yet. You bring this reality in life and this awakening back to the lost sheep in the house of Israel. So we will go to the dark places, dead, desperate places in our own marriage, family, church. But then we will also go out. We will go to the gates of the temple, the gate of the temple. Now being this metaphor, this picture of where blind beggars live, outside, excluded. We will go where lame beggars live. We will go where the least and the lost live. we will go where desperate people live. In other words, this is a church saying, we will move toward those gates of hell. So the picture is not the gates of hell coming against us. The picture is of a church moving toward those gates and the promise of Matthew 16, 18 is this, the gates of hell will not prevail against that kind of church. Indeed, my paraphrase of Matthew 16, 18, that connects Matthew 16 and 18 to the spiritual gifts is this, that I will build my church. What I mean by that is this, that I will get to my people what they need when they need it in order to storm the gates of hell. And what you need when you do that, when you actually do begin to move toward the dark places, desperate and dead places, what you need when you do that is, you know, I don't know, more than a good joke or some helpful insight. If you're really going to go to the dark places, when you do that, you're going to need some supernatural manifestations of the Spirit. You're going to need some gifts of wisdom and discernment, words of knowledge, gifts of healing and faith, prophecy and deliverance, effecting of miracles, dunamis, the operation of power, which, if I'm right, Provides a very important clue as to how you might begin to experience these gifts. Here's how. Attempt something that would require them. Begin to move toward the dark, desperate, and dead places in your own soul, in your own marriage, in your own family, and dare to pray. Holy Spirit, come because I've got nothing here. And when you go to those dark places, let me tell you what's going to happen. First thing, all hell will break loose. I'm not kidding. And you'll go, why did I do this? Why didn't I just leave that alone? I promise you, you go toward the dark places, first thing that will happen is all hell will break loose. But heaven too. Because I will build my church, and I will get to my people what they need, when they need it, and you don't need it until you start doing what Jesus did. Going to the dark places, the desperate places, the people by the gates, the dark places in your own soul. I've got a nephew who was drawn by his heart to commit himself to a very dark place. He lives there. He's ministering to a group of people who are among the least in the lost in the world. And in that place, there is some spiritual power that he didn't know about, didn't see. And so he actually began to see things and hear things and experience things, he came back and talked to his parents and talked to me and said, to me, Dave, here's this dream I got. I said, and what is all this? I said, Cornell, Cornell, you have gone to the dark places and there is spiritual power there, but you are experiencing things you have no name for. You are getting gifts of faith and gifts of power and gifts of insight. What cracks me up is you start going to the gifts. All these people, do you believe in the gifts? All you got to do is go to the dark places and the gifts will come because I will build my church. I will get to my people what they need when they need it in order to storm the gates of hell and what they need are gifts of God's grace. You don't deserve it. You're not that smart. Gifts of His Spirit, which include gifts of faith and knowledge, healing, and deliverance, power. So that's the first thing, that the gifts of the Spirit are rooted in a promise. Second thing is they were purchased by the blood. I just love how that sounds. Ephesians 4, verse 7 says this, but to each one of us, here's that verse again, grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift. Therefore, it says that when he ascended on high, what he did when he ascended on high was to lead captive a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men. Now, this expression, he ascended, what does it mean? Except that he also had descended into the lower parts of the earth. He went, that is Jesus, to hell. And in hell tasted death for every man, but he who descended is himself also the one who ascended. And when he did ascend, rise from the dead, according to Ephesians 4 verse 8 here, he did two things. He led captive, host of captives, which is weird, and he gave gifts to men. What's he talking about? Actually, is a fascinating picture that Paul is very intentionally painting, drawn from Psalm 68, which Paul is quoting here. In fact, when you looked at the verses on the screen, these verses were in bold letters. Remember that? Well, that always means it's quoting something from the Old Testament. What Paul is quoting there when he talks about this leading captive, a host of captives, giving gifts to men, he's quoting Psalm 68. And Psalm 68 is depicting an ancient king who's returning from battle victorious. And in his return, he is bringing two things, kind of in this victory parade. You can picture the king coming into the city, and the two things the king is bringing with him are number one soldiers of the defeated army, now in chains, which means that's a picture of his leading captive, a host of captives, their enemy soldiers who've been brought with him, and he's bringing gifts that the king would then share with his people. It's kind of part of the celebration. Hey, we won! Here's some stuff! It's part of this victory celebration, and the gifts that he's giving to the people as part of this celebration were called the spoils of war, that the good king won, if you will, paid for, if you will, in the context of this battle. Now, this Psalm 68 has some historical rules, because historically, all of what Psalm 68 describes there was actually known in the day as the captain's train. The captain's train. It wasn't the name of it. It was actually a victory parade because what ancient kings would actually do when they would come back victorious from battle would be, first of all, to literally parade the captives through the streets, in chains, stripped of their armor, stripped of their weapons, the purpose being this. One being, It was part of that. But the other part was this. It was a very important message the king wanted to communicate to the people. You need to know the battle's over. You need to know the victory is won. You need to know we have nothing to fear. I mean, look at them. Stripped of their armor, stripped of their weapons. It's kind of, it makes you wonder why we were ever scared of them in the first place. And then the king would give these gifts. Come on, you guys. And the gifts were the spoils of war. But the spoils of war were not always treasure, like property and provisions, like silver and gold and deeds. And this is where it gets interesting to me. But the gifts, the spoils of war that this king would give to the people were actually the weapons, very often, that the enemy soldiers had been stripped of. So we take the weapons away from these guys, and now they're not scary anymore, but the king picks up these weapons, and they're the spoils of war, so he gives them to the people, creating an incredible picture of a king who's inviting his people to not just have a party if the gifts were provisioned in silver and gold. Have a party. I'm sure they had a party, but this picture of taking the weapons that were stripped from the enemy, giving them to the people, paints a picture of a king who's inviting his people to make their mission, or his mission, their mission. I'm inviting you into this mission because this battle, we are not done with this. And here's some weapons to do this. Here's some tools so you can enter this. Oh, which creates, for me and us, fascinating picture, I think, of Jesus. Through his victory on the cross, Paul says, in Colossians 2.15, look at this on the screen, Through his victory on the cross, he has disarmed. He has stripped of their weapons, rulers, and authorities. Look at it on the screen. Because when he did that, when he disarmed the rulers and authorities, he made public display of them. Where is Paul getting this? This is all the captain's train imagery. He made public display of them, having triumph over them. Paul is using this captain's train imagery on purpose. It's very intentional because then, like the ancient king, Paul says in Ephesians 4, verse 8, he not only led captive a host of captives, but like that ancient king, he gave gifts to men. And the gifts are the spoils of war that he won at the cross that he paid for with his blood. But the spoils, these gifts, are not just treasure like property and possession, silver and gold. Oh my, oh my, this picture tells me, it tells us, they have something to do with these weapons that the enemy, these principalities and powers that are so scary to us have been stripped of, thus creating the picture of a king, King Jesus, who is wanting to enlist his people, the church, into his mission. But to do what I do, you're going to need some tools. You're going to need some weapons. Because these weapons, stick with this picture of the enemy being stripped of them. These weapons, inthe hands of the enemy, have real power. And they still do. These weapons, inthe hands of the enemy, have real power to steal and kill and destroy. These weapons, inthe hands of the enemy, have real power to deceive the minds and the hearts of men and women in every age. These weapons in the hands of the enemy have power to blind, oppress, and slave. But now these weapons are being turned. They're being transformed by God through Christ at the cross into weapons that will actually do the opposite thing. For in the hands of my people, my church, these same weapons that destroy will heal, will rebuild, restore, resurrect, give sight, set free. They will redeem. These are the gifts of the Spirit. They're the spoils of war. They were won with the cross, paid for by the blood, so maybe it's time to claim the spoils, to pick up the weapons, to receive the gift, to open it up and learn how to use it. Here's why. It's important. Ephesians 6, verse 12. Because we wrestle not against flesh and blood. If that was the level of the battle, the mission we've been called to, you can handle that. But that's not what I'm calling you into, says the king. We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Which makes me want to ask this question. What's your plan, church? Seriously. And in my mind, I would invite you to go beyond our church. I mean, this would be for our church, but way beyond our church, the church. Like in America, in the world. What's your plan to fight this kind of enemy? To bring people, even institutions, out of that kind of darkness? What's the plan? Last week I touched on this. Be nice. Well, be nice. Be trendy and hip. Be trendy and hip. I don't care. Be progressive and creative. Be progressive and creative. Serious. But here's God's idea. To all of that, please know how limited all of that is, because here's God's idea. that His people, that His church, wherever it is, in every generation would teach the next generation how to pick up these weapons, these enablements, these gifts of God's grace, these gifts of the Spirit, that they would, in a sense, from one generation to another generation, claim the spoils of war, spoils that were won at the cross, paid for by the blood. And in doing that, to reject the lies of the deceiver, who says, among other things, this, these gifts aren't for you. They're not for today. Who do you think you are, an apostle? Apostle? So don't pick them up. You go there, you're going to become like these Gilmore people. No, you won't. I'll slap you. Anyway, sorry, sorry. Just leave them on the ground agnostic. I don't know. Many of us have left them on the ground. And we need to repent. To change our mind. And to at least become a little more curious. And that would even be a very good start for some of us. Because you start smelling something, and I just know, in my whole life, yours too, you follow that, you'll find something here. Just become a little more curious. A little more aware. Because given the mission to which we have been called, we can't afford to be agnostic. We can't afford to be not knowing. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come with all of your gifts and all of your grace, so that maybe, just maybe, we can do what you've called us to do and become who you've called us to become. For Christ's sake, we say yes. For the church's sake, we say yes. For the sake of the world, sitting at the gate, we say yes. Holy Spirit, come. I'm going to close by speaking a prayer over you. Would you stand with me? The prayer team, obviously, that day like this is going to be here for you. Last night the ministry was strong. We're going to dismiss right away, but you come for prayer if you need it. But I just want to speak this over you because the real energy of this is for people to come this way, but it is for an empowered church to be going that way. Pray with me. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit, we plant our feet into the soil of the living God. Turn our ear toward the voice of the calling Christ. We lean our life into the wind of holy change. Be fierce. Be gentle. Toss us. Turn us. Shape us. Dishevel us. Holy Spirit, in gratitude we pray, come. with all your gifts, with all your grace, so we can do what you've called us to do in our families, in our marriages, in our own souls, and at the gate, at the gate, where the lame beggars live. We pray all this in Jesus' name. And all God's people said, amen. you
