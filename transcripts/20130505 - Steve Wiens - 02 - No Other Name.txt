Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers and elders of the people, if we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, then know this. You and all the people of Israel, it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. Jesus is the stone you builders rejected, which has now become the cornerstone. Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name given under heaven by which we must be saved. And when they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled and ordinary men, they were astonished. And they took note that these men had been with Jesus. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Well, hey everyone. How are you? My name is Steve. Welcome to Open Door. And I invite you to pray with me as we dive into this part of the service, the talk. God, may this be the moment that we wake up in a new way to who you are and what you do in the world. God may this be the moment That we wake up In a brand new way To who you are And what you do in the world Amen Alright well that text that Vicki just read Is a beautiful and full text And I have like 22 minutes left To really explain the beauty and majesty of that text So I want to dive right in But in case you're just joining us, what we've been doing for the last several months is we've been looking at this community of people in the book of the Acts. This community of Jesus followers that are trying to order their imperfect and actual lives around this person called Jesus who lived and died and rose again. And what they've been seeing over the course of these last four chapters is nothing short of astonishing. This little community of people that started with about 100 people has swelled to 3,000 or 4,000, maybe 5,000 people who are sharing their possessions, who are seeing people that were formerly lame be healed. I mean, crazy things are happening. And in this particular text, when Peter and John say to the court, hey, elders and rulers of Israel, if we're being called to account today because this one man was healed, remember the context. They were walking up to the temple through the gate that is called Beautiful. This one day, and they came across a guy who had been sitting there his whole life, probably, begging for money. And this particular day, and remember, Peter and John are probably 20, 21, 22 years old. And so when they're walking up to the gate that was called Beautiful, they're probably arguing about who led a better Bible study that day. You know, was it Peter or was it John? They're wiping a little hummus from their beard. They're making jokes, and they're getting ready to go into the temple. They're normal people, actual people who actually lived in the actual universe in the first century. But on this day, when they passed by this guy that they'd passed by hundreds of times, on this day, it was different. And when he asked them for some money, Peter said, I don't have any money. And he really didn't, because there's no way in the world they would let Peter hold the money. I don't have any money, but remember what he said? What I do have, I'll freely give to you. And Peter really did have it to give. And so he said, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, why don't you get up and walk? Can you imagine what happened in the heart and soul and mind and body of this guy that hadn't walked for his whole life when he got up? And we read in the scriptures that he not only got up and walked, he leapt and danced. And he went in to the place that he'd never been in before, the temple courts. Because that's what happens when the wind of God's spirit blows. It takes us into places we've never been before. It creates wholeness in us. And opens our eyes. It awakens us to something we'd never known and never seen before. Can you imagine being Peter and John? I mean, this is like a daily occurrence for these guys to see this level of healing happen in people's hearts. And on this day where they find themselves is not around a table sharing stories. They find themselves in a court of law before the religious leaders who are none too happy that this is happening because these religious leaders are being paid by Rome to keep the status quo. And what Peter and John are doing is certainly anything other than keeping the status quo quo. So we read then, Peter filled with the Holy Spirit, he said to them, rulers and elders of the people, Vicki read it to you a couple minutes ago, if we're being called to account, which means being sort of on trial, if we're on trial today for an act of kindness shown to a man who is lame and if we're now being asked how he was healed. And I can just imagine what's going through Peter's mind. He's been faithful to following what Jesus is calling him to do in the world. The wind of God's spirit is blowing. And as Dave said two weeks ago, what happens very often when you follow the wind of God's spirit and begin to do the things that God is calling you to do in the world, what happens is waves of resistance come. Have you ever been there? Where maybe you did the right thing and it was really hard to do at work. Where you didn't do the thing that was being asked of you. Or you did do the thing that was being asked of you. You had that conversation. You made that deal or didn't make that deal. And maybe you lost your job. Or maybe your child who's 21 years old and you had to have a real straight conversation with her about the way in which she was living was not good and you did it in love and you did it in mercy and grace and now she hasn't talked to you in four months. It might be a really, really small way that you've tried to follow the wind of God that's blowing around you and what you've experienced is waves of resistance. And that's not everyone in here, but I know it's some of you. And when the waves get real high, the threat is that the boat will go down. And so the question that comes, it's an honest question, is this. Is anybody about to capsize because the waves of resistance are so heavy right now? When that's true in my life, and believe me, it is true very often, I realize that this is what I need to admit. When I start believing that I'm responsible for creating the wind and or calming the waves, I know I'm going down. I mean, as a pastor especially, like, Steve, it's up to you to make sure the wind of God is blowing, so you better preach really, really good sermons. And when you get together with that couple whose marriage is breaking up, you better have really, really wise advice. Or when you get together with that person who just got their fourth DUI, it's like, man, you better have the words to say. You better pray the prayers that will change their life. When I start believing that the wind of God's blowing is up to me, I'm going down. But also when I start believing that when the waves of resistance are coming and people are starting to get freaked out, that it's up to me to make sure the waves calm down, like in your family, if it's up to you to make sure the waves get real, real calm, and you kind of internally know that you have no idea how that's going to happen, if that's up to you, let me just tell you, you're going to go down. So what do you need to know in that moment? I think you need to know what these 20 and 21-year-old guys knew, Peter and John. Because what they said to these elders and rulers of Israel is, they said, we all want you to know that this guy was made well by the power of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. And you crucified him, but God raised him from the dead. And this man was crippled, but he's now well and he's able to stand here. Not because we have some crazy gifts or because we're really good at praying for people or giving sermons. It's because of the power of Jesus. So I need to remember these things in my actual life. I'm not responsible for creating the wind of God to blow in me or people around me. And I'm not responsible for calming the waves even when I desperately want them calm. And some of you are, I mean, that's like our life. It's like, yes, the waves. I mean, I'm about to capsize and I'm spending lots and lots of energy trying to calm them down. When really I think what is needed and what you're responsible for is simply this. to stay in the boat and raise the sail. So question, what do you need right now? I mean, really, what do you need to stay in the boat? And don't get uber, uber spiritual right now. Some of you really need just more sleep. Some of you need to have a conversation with someone that you just know, you just have to have it. Some of you need to make that decision that you know you've been needing to make and you've just been avoiding it. And in all of that, you need to cry out to God for help. Because when I feel like I'm trying to raise the sail, I'm trying to stay in the boat, what I know that I just, I need God to know how it really is in my real life. And I need to be able to have a place with God where I can pour it out in ways that are really, really honest. So if you are struggling with waves of resistance, my encouragement to you is to cry out to God as honestly and simply as you know. Anne Lamott, one of my favorite authors, says the three great prayers and the only prayers you need to know are help, thanks, and wow. If we would learn those three prayers and just prayed those three simple one-word prayers, the formation in our lives would be amazing. But this leads to the next verse as we just kind of plow our way through as quickly as we can through these amazing verses. This is another thing that Peter and John and their 20 to 21-year-old selves knew. They said this right out in front of everyone. Salvation is found in no one else. For there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. And so the question is, what does that mean? You know, really? To be saved. It's a very evangelical word, isn't it? Remember in this church I was working at years ago, right before I came up to speak, this woman came up to me. She was a little older than I was, and she sort of put her hand on my shoulder and in a very menacing way asked, when were you saved? I was like, oh, you know, I want to be saved right now, you know. So like, saved from what? What does that mean? And so I was reading some commentaries this week, and according to this very passage in Acts 4, this is what I read. The primary meaning of salvation is detachment from the world of unbelieving and disobedient and attachment to the true people of God in the last days, the ecclesia, the community which is constituted on the one hand by loyalty to Jesus and on the other hand by his gift of the Spirit, which makes possible a new life conformed to and the new loyalty in other ways too. And that was one sentence. It's like, wow, I mean, isn't that deep? Now, I don't disagree with one word of that, but how does that help an actual person who's drowning? There's no other name. I wonder if you ask this person that had been just recently healed, this lame guy that now is walking and leaping and dancing and praising God, I wonder if you asked him, Hey, just for you, what does it mean that you are saved by Jesus? I wonder what he would say. And I just don't think that there would be that many large words in his description. Have you ever heard a sermon from a person and the sweats start to pour out and it's like the pulpit is being pounded. It's like, there is no other name than Jesus. You know, it's like, wow. I don't know why, but I'm kind of scared right now a little bit. And I know that should sound like good news, but it doesn't sound like good news. You know? And have you ever felt like some people are trying to say, It's like the name of Jesus is kind of like a password to get into the secret club. It doesn't really matter what you believe as long as you say the password right. No kidding, this last week, my boys, my three boys, were getting some plans together to give presents to their grandmothers for Mother's Day because Mother's Day is coming up, gang. Guys, just telling you, next week. And so they were talking all about their grandmas, which is great, but Mary was sitting right there, you know, and so I said, now guys, who else do we celebrate on Mother's Day? Mary's sitting right there. Isaac, my almost six-year-old, he waits for a minute and he goes, Jesus? I'm like, no! You celebrate your mom on Mother's Day. Oh, you know, it starts really early, right? So, like, is the name of Jesus a password? You know, you just, it has to, you got it, that's all you need. Or if you were talking to this guy that was healed, I wonder if he would say something really different than that. Here's what I think. When we read that there's no other name, it's not about getting the password right it's about being absorbed into the essence of the person of Jesus who actually lived and who lives still and you may not even know it at that time but what I'm here to tell you today is maybe that feeling that you felt of freedom and you didn't know how to describe it. That's the essence of Jesus. And I wonder if you talk to this guy who was healed and you say, man, you gotta know, I've met a lot of people in my life on that gate, beautiful gate heading toward the temple and there's no one else in the world that could heal me. No one else in the world. Let's look at the words of Jesus real quick. In John 6, 35, Jesus said this, and I just love the simplicity of this. Jesus said, I am the bread that gives life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. And you know what I like about the simplicity of that because I know what it's like to be hungry, and not just physically hungry. I know what it's like to go to things to fill me up, to satisfy me, to nourish me in the ways that I need to be nourished. My soul needs to be nourished, and I know what it means to gorge myself on things like approval and other things like that. And I know what it means for that to feel so empty like you've just eaten a big meal of fast food that fills you up but empties you out at the same time. And I know what it's like to come to God, maybe filled with bad choices and all my sin, and go, oh God, would you, one more time, would you forgive me? And I know what it's like to know God's forgiveness and grace and nourishment. I remember my sister Lisa. She's so wise. She's a little bit older than me. And she said, Steve, it was a couple years ago. She said, I began to be much more compassionate for people when I understood that every single human being on planet Earth is just starving. So what is the nourishment? and maybe that time that you felt nourished for the first time in your life, and you didn't know how to attribute it, I'm here to tell you that if you were really nourished, there's no other name that can nourish you other than Jesus Christ of Nazareth. That's who it was, even if you didn't know it. And in John 8, 12, when Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, if you didn't understand that bread of life thing, and some of you didn't, maybe you can understand this. I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. So maybe I didn't know all those big theological words in that quote that I gave you a few minutes ago, but I do know what it's like to be lost and to be fumbling around and to feel like there's no way out. If someone doesn't shine the light on me, I will have no way of doing it. And I also know what it's like to have the light finally shining on the lostness of my life. And I gotta tell you that when the light shines like that, it's not a self-improvement plan that can do that for you. It's the gracious, loving gift of God through Jesus that shines the light and says, come home. So if you didn't know it, that was Jesus. there's no other one that can do that and then in john 10 11 i love this one i am the good shepherd jesus says so if you didn't understand the bread of life if you didn't understand the light and the darkness you know then you're really on the remedial path here but i want to give you one more there's even others uh kidding you know but that's why he says it in so many different metaphors right because he wants you to know i'm like the good shepherd i am the good shepherd he says the good shepherd lays down his life for sheep. And we don't really, you know, shepherds, we don't really get that. I don't know a lot of shepherds. You know, I've met a lot of people who've given me their business card and underneath John Smith, shepherd. That's not really my personal experience. But the people in the first century would have really understood this. And what shepherds do is they lead their flocks of sheep to places of nourishment. And especially when, remember in Psalm 23, when we read that we are led to quiet waters. Well, when sheep go to drink at quiet waters, it's a beautiful picture of them getting what they need. But in the actual world, in the actual, that actually exists, where sheep go and drink by quiet waters, there's also animals that are predators that learn that sheep, this is where sheep go, and this is where sheep feel most at calm and at peace. And so when sheep go to drink at quiet waters, that's when I'm gonna get them. That's what predators do. So this picture is of a God who says, when you're at your most vulnerable moment and the predators are swarming all around you, you need to know that I will not only move to save you, I will lay down my own life for you. And there is no better picture of God than Jesus on the cross because it's the picture of ultimate love. In our rebellion, God said, I'm going to keep coming around until all the sheep are found. I'm just going to keep coming around. I'm going to keep coming and keep coming and keep coming and keep coming and keep coming. And that's the essence of Jesus. What it means to be saved is when you understand that you are lost and now you're found, that you are blind and now you see that you are starving and now you're filled. and maybe you didn't even know how you got there, but now I'm here to tell you that if you got there in a real way and understood, I really couldn't do this on my own, I needed a Savior, then you met Jesus, even if you didn't know it. In Acts 4.13, the last portion of our text this morning, we read a kind of amazing thing. The leaders saw that Peter and John were not afraid to speak, And they were saying really bold things. Like when they said there's no other name under which humankind might be saved other than Jesus, they were co-opting a Roman phrase. In Rome, the phrase was, there's no other name other than Caesar by which humankind may be saved. So Peter and John, I mean, in a very rebellious, seditious way, said we're changing the rules. And that's why they noticed that they weren't afraid to say crazy things like that. And they understood that these men had no special training. They didn't go to seminary. They didn't go to rabbinical school. And they were amazed. And then they realized that Peter and John, and I love this phrase, had been with Jesus. They didn't have all their doctrine tied up in a bow and, you know, they didn't have degrees. They had been with the character and the person and the essence of Jesus. And that made all the difference in the world. Because what they regularly saw from Jesus and with Jesus in their own life and in the life of Jesus was this, that anywhere Jesus went, death came to life, broken was made whole, hungry people were satisfied, and there's no other person in the world that can do that. There's no other name. So when we say there's no other name by which you might be saved, please don't hear the pounding of the pulpit. Please hear the essence of Jesus is death to life and broken made whole and hungry satisfied and there's just no one else that can do that. So as we come to the table, the communion table, Where the communion table is placed in our service is a very deep theological statement. It's on the floor, accessible. You know, some churches, the communion table is way back there. And then the person that is in my place is in between you and the table. And I just need to say, I don't ever want to be become. I don't ever want to be in between you and what you need. And so many religious leaders, I think, get their meaning and worth from being in between. You need to know that the Savior of the universe is on the ground available. So one of the things I think is core to the DNA of this church is this little statement right up here. we're not the bread, we just serve the bread. Amen? We're not the bread. In fact, we're imperfect. I mean, if you've been around here for any length of time, you know that that's true. We're imperfect. But the bread that we serve, man, it's really good bread. It's the bread of life. And so if you're hungry for Jesus, we invite you to come and eat to your fill of the bread of life because there's no other name that gives you that kind of life. Amen. Amen.
