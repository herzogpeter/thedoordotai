Okay, well this morning we're going to talk about the struggle that I see people enter into to try to erase their shame by doing right behaviors. And I think that that is the incorrect struggle and I don't think it works. It does result in a lot of right behaviors for some people, but I don't think it's possible to erase shame on the inside by doing right stuff on the outside. Last night when I spoke, I talked about the soil of shame and how some people out of that shame grow some plants that are pretty ugly. And a couple of plants that I talked about was addiction and codependency. And I gave a little bit of an illustration about how even acting violent toward one another can come out of a person's shame. And those would be ugly plants. This morning's talk is more about the pretty plants that people grow out of their shame. The way that out of our sense of defectiveness or our sense of not being okay, in order to fix that, we just grow pretty stuff on the outside and how that doesn't work. And once again, you can't fix the soil by fixing the plants. You fix the plants by fixing the soil. So I'm going to start with a needy person here. And this person is an empty circle. And when I say empty, I don't mean that to be an indictment. I mean my definition of an empty person is a person who is in a state of unmet needs. So we could call this person empty or we could call them needy, but everybody's needy. So I don't want to talk about this person in terms of needy because it kind of is a moot point. Everyone's needy. So when I say empty, it's a person who is in a state of unmet needs, or it could be a person whose needs are met, but they're not aware of how well their needs are met or that their needs are met. It's all right there for them, but they somehow can't let it in. Now remember that the three basic needs that we have as human beings is the need to know that we're loved and accepted unconditionally, without strings that we're approved of. The second need is that we need to know that we're worthwhile and valuable and capable, that we have worth. So it's loved and accepted without strings that we have worth. And the third need is to know we're not alone. This would be a person who doesn't know that they're loved and accepted without strings. Or who even maybe knows that they're loved and accepted, but it's based on a lot of performance, in which case they don't know it anyway. See, because earned love doesn't work. It doesn't get in. This is a person who lacks a sense of worth. You know, they don't know that they're valuable. They don't believe that they're capable and worthwhile, and that they feel pretty alone. Like, either they're not well-supported, they don't have people in their lives that they can turn to and lean on, or they feel like they're the only one that struggles with a particular struggle that they have. They're the only one that feels this way. And a lot of times with shame-based issues, you see issues that kind of arise out of shame, people tend to feel really isolated. Like, because shame is a sense of being seen in a diminished way, if this is an issue that I have in my life, it would be more like this behind my back because this is an issue that I have in my life and if I put this out here for you to see you're going to see me in a lesser way in a diminished way as a result of me having this issue then I'm going to hide this issue from you and end up feeling isolated and not connected with people in my life who maybe would be there to help me and that's really one of the beautiful things I think about support groups and recovery-oriented groups is that they let people know that they're not alone. There's a very powerful message sent and received in an interaction where someone sits and tells you what they're really going through, and you don't fall off the chair, you know, or you nod your head like this. I mean, without even saying anything, just to be able to talk about what is really beating in your heart or is really tearing your heart apart and have the other person nod their head like they know what you're talking about. There's a very significant message sent by that. And so small groups, I think, are very powerful in telling people that they're not alone, even if nobody says, well, you're not alone, I understand, you see. The fact that it's a safe enough place to talk about what you're going through and have people understand. This is a person who doesn't know that they're loved and accepted, that doesn't have a sense of worth and feels pretty alone. This would be a newborn baby, okay? newborn babies. I was just over at the other building, and they're having this car wash today, which is really a bad day to have a car wash, but they're having it. And this is a commercial for the car wash. They're trying to raise money to go to do a ministry trip, and it's a free car wash because they've already gotten pledges from people for how many cars that they wash. So go get your car washed at the crystal building. Anyway, there was a newborn baby there, and this mom was carrying around her newborn baby, and, you know, however messy newborn babies are, and however hard they are, and how much work they are, they're not as much work as adolescents. I mean, you You know, I had, my daughters wanted to play basketball the other night, and I had two cars sitting in the way of the basketball thing, so they pushed the one car back, you know, and then they pushed the other car back and bent the door on a tolle backwards, you know. And I was so angry and so, I couldn't even believe they did this. But then I started thinking about it, and, you know, if this had been 10 years ago, It had been a lamp. Somebody would have knocked a lamp over. And it would have been an accident. And this was an accident too. It's just that the accidents cost so much when they're... You know, man alive. But anyway, here's this newborn baby over there. And this mom is walking around. And this baby is a totally needy person. Do you understand? It's like they are capable of nothing. What they do is they scream and wave their arms and people give them stuff. And that's their job. And it's okay. Nobody shames them for doing that. There are some people, I think, who are worried about spoiling their child because if they cry and then you go toward that and try to help that, you're going to spoil them. But really, I don't believe that you can spoil a newborn baby. Plus, I really don't think that it's appropriate to talk about human beings in terms of being spoiled. I mean, in our culture, what do we do with things that are spoiled? We toss them. So it's not okay to talk about people that way. But the thing about this is that little babies cry, and then what they're doing is they're coding their needs to us, C-O-D-I-N-G. They're coding it. And then our job as caregivers is to decode what they're saying and then go toward that need. So sometimes they're hungry, and sometimes they're wet, and sometimes they're uncomfortable, and sometimes they're too hot. I remember one time, one of our daughters, I don't remember which one it was, but she cried and cried and cried and cried and cried, we tried everything to decode what she was trying to tell us. We fed her and we changed her and we gave her a nook and we rocked her and held her and all this kind of stuff. And after quite a long period of time, we found out that there was a hair wrapped around her little toe. And her toe was blue. And she was just crying and screaming and trying to tell us, you know, my toe hurts, but she's just a newborn baby, you know, so she can't do that, and our job is to decode that. And when you decode that, when a little baby who's hungry cries and you go feed them, or when they're wet and you go change them, what you're teaching them is that they can trust that when they ask for help, they're going to get it. In a pre-verbal kind of way, you're training them that it's okay to ask for help, and you can believe that help will come if you ask. And that is very, by the way, a very good precursor to a spiritual relationship with the Lord, you understand? So it's not selfish for little babies to be needy. It's not a problem. This is a little person who doesn't know they're loved and accepted, who doesn't know that they have worth. They're not capable. Our job is to help them become capable, and they feel pretty alone. And if you put them down in the room and leave them, they feel alone. And that's okay. You could put them in a nursery with 10 other babies and 20 workers, or 20 babies and 10 workers or whatever, but they still cry because they feel alone, because you're not there. And little babies, if you move out of their, if they're young enough, if you move physically out of their field of vision, you don't exist. You've left the planet. And in order for them to know that you are there, you have to be right where they can see you because that's where they're at in their developmental stages. So they scream and holler. People give them stuff. Now, if this is an 18-year-old person and they're still screaming and hollering and waving their arms and people are giving them stuff, then something didn't happen in that person's life. Do you understand this? If they're an adult parent and they're sitting in the chair screaming and waving their arms and everybody in the family is supposed to tiptoe around them just right so that they feel like an okay parent or so their needs are met, you see, then something hasn't happened in the life of this person from zero parenthood. And if they're a pastor or a church leader and they're standing up in the pulpit screaming and waving their arms and you're supposed to jump through a bunch of spiritual hoops so they can feel like an okay preacher, then something hasn't happened in the life of that person too. And so they're still needy, they're still empty, and then they still have to try to find ways to meet those needs. You understand this? But, so that's what I mean when I say empty, in a state of unmet needs, or a sense of unmet needs that the person has about themselves. Now, when I was growing up, I grew up in a church that was very much about putting external pressure on people to get them to do holiness. So holiness was a thing that was legislated. Right behavior, health was something that was legislated from the outside in. There's a verse in Romans 12, 2, it says don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by renewing of the mind. And the tension in that verse is between the words conformed and transformed. The word conformed there means squeezed. To be conformed to something means pressed into a mold. Conformed from the outside in. don't be squeezed or conformed but be transformed by renewing of the mind transformation is what happens when tadpoles turn into frogs or caterpillars turn into butterflies it's metamorphosis, it's even the word that's used in the Greek metamorphosis is something that's built into caterpillars in other words, if you have a caterpillar and it's living in the conditions that are conducive to transformation You don't have to tell it to transform. You understand? You can stand there and holler at it and preach at it and tell it to transform, but it's going to transform anyway, even if you didn't do that, because it's built in. It's part of its nature. It's part of who it is. Now, in Minnesota, here we have June bugs. June bugs, they are what transforms from grub worms, and grub worms are those white worms that kill your lawn. Grub worms transform into June bugs. Caterpillars transform into butterflies. It's just going to happen because of the identity of a caterpillar. It's going to happen. But it's an inside-out kind of process. It's not an outside-in process. Now, you can tell a grub worm that it's supposed to change into a butterfly as well, and it can't do that. There's no possible way for a grub worm to turn into a butterfly. No way. All grub worms can turn into are June bugs. Now, a grub worm, though, could turn into a butterfly if it was born again as a caterpillar. If in some way it became a new creation, which was called a caterpillar, then it could transform into a butterfly. But otherwise, it can't happen. So hollering at these things to change from the inside out doesn't work. And plus, it's not necessary. What the verse says is don't be conformed from the outside in, but be transformed. Where I grew up, though, because there was so much emphasis put on external pressure and trying to legislate holiness and good behavior, what we were taught, this would be our little group over here, the independent, fundamental, Bible-believing, sin-hating, whatever we were. And then over here were the Lutherans and Catholics, basically. And what that verse said was, don't be conformed to the world, but be transformed. The way we were taught that was, don't be squeezed by these guys, be squeezed by these guys. Don't let this group tell you what to do, let us tell you what to do. Paul isn't saying, don't be conformed by the bad guys, be conformed by the good guys. Paul is saying, don't be conformed. Don't be squeezed, period, from the outside in, but be transformed from the inside out. A person who is in a state, all of that to say, a person who is in a state of unmet needs can be conformed. In other words, this is not a full, strong, on the inside person. This is a vulnerable person. This is a person who can be pressed into a mold because they don't have the strength on the inside to resist that. And so let's put this person in the world, whoever that is. Don't be conformed to the world, but be transformed by renewing of the mind. And so the world, whoever they are, once again, when I grew up, it was really clear who the world was. It was everybody who wasn't sitting in the church building with us on Sunday morning was the world. Everybody who didn't go to our Bible camp, everybody who didn't go to the college that we sent our high school graduates to, that was the world, which was a very big group of people. And the kingdom of God was this very, very small group of people. And thank God we weren't like them and that we were in church on Sunday morning instead of watching cartoons or professional wrestling. And so, but the world now, you see, world messages are a little bit more obscure, to me anyway, than they were before because the world is sneakier than that. It's not just like you put a label on the group of people and that's the world and then everybody who isn't there isn't the world. If I said to you how much money you make or how much money you have is what makes you a valuable, acceptable person, would that be a world message or a kingdom message? That'd be a world message. If I said how much money you give is what makes you a valuable, acceptable person, is that a world message or a kingdom message? That's a world message, too. Because that's about squeezing you from the outside in. The elementary principles of man that it talks about in Scripture, that's what it is. It's a squeezed from the outside in kind of message. Colossians 2 talks about it a lot. And let me show you what's going on in Colossians 2 just to illustrate what the world message looks like. And what happened in Colossians is the same thing that happened in Galatians except for one thing. In Galatians, Paul preached the good news and that God's acceptance was available as a gift because of grace based on faith. And so it was just a free thing, and you just received it by believing, you see. And then he left, and then people followed behind him and said, yeah, this grace stuff is great, and faith is great, and you've got to have it, but it's not enough. You're going to have to get circumcised, too. So God's acceptance of you is based on what God did plus on what you do. And so you have to add something of your own performance to God's performance in order to really be validated by God. And the Galatians went, oh, okay, and so they started doing all this external stuff, and then Paul writes the letter to the Galatians and hollers at them and says all kinds of mean stuff and is all angry with them. Well, the Colossians, the exact same thing happened, except that the Colossians didn't buy it. So they received the good news by faith, and then this message came that said, yeah, but you've got to do something in addition to what God did to get him to really like you, and then he went, no way. and they just hung on to faith for dear life. And so Paul affirms them in Colossians 2. That's why he says in verse 5, even though I'm absent in body, nevertheless I'm with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline and stability of your faith in Jesus Christ. In other words, you hang on to Christ really well here. They didn't hang on to Christ that well in Galatia, but you, Colossians, do. As you therefore received Christ Jesus, so walk. So walk and walk and walk. Walk the same way you came in the first place. Well, how did you come in the first place? With a list of behaviors that you could check off so God would like you? No. You came in the first place by receiving a gift that was available because of what Christ did. Well, walk the same way. Live and live and live and live based on that. Just as you came in the first place based on that. See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world. What are the elementary principles of the world? We know all this secular humanistic stuff and New Age stuff, those certainly are the elementary principles of the world. But those aren't exactly, I don't think, what are the elementary principles of the world here. The elementary principles of the world here, garbed in religious stuff, was you need to do something on your part to add to what God did for God to really like you and accept you fully. Later on it says, Let no one act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to festival or new moon or Sabbath day, things which are a shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Jesus. So, let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and worship of angels, taking a stand on visions he has seen inflated without cause by his fleshly mind. You see, these people were just hanging on to Christ, and then these other people were saying, yeah, but you might be okay because of Jesus, but I'm okay because of Jesus, plus I don't drink anymore. Or because I don't go to movies, or because I go to movies, or because I speak in tongues, or because I have visions. That's what really makes me okay. Well, have visions, but point at Jesus. Don't be pointing at the fact that you have visions or that you have gifts. Have gifts, but point at Jesus. And when someone comes to you and says, yeah, but if you did this, then God would really approve of you, Paul calls that defrauding you of your prize, cheating you of the prize that you have. Don't listen to him. So the world, you see, is sneakier than that. And if Satan can't get you with world stuff, he'll get you with religious stuff, which is still world stuff, but you'll think you're being spiritual. So the world comes to this needy person and starts putting pressure on them with messages that say, smoke cigarettes and drink and use drugs and vandalize and sleep around. Grow a mustache. That was really a bad thing to do where I grew up. And square dance in gym class. That was a biggie. And so, you know, we didn't square dance in gym class. We took our stand, boy. Oh. We went to gym class and everybody else was square dancing. And frankly, okay. I think square dancing is stupid anyway so I was glad for the excuse but we took our stand and didn't square dance and then the confusing thing was that all these non-Christians didn't run up to us as fast as they could and find out what gave us the strength to take such a stand for the Lord nobody cared but the reason is because none of the non-believers gave a rip whether we danced in square danced in Fayette or not. The only people I cared were the Christians and they wouldn't have known anyway because they weren't there. But, see, do these behaviors or don't do these behaviors and if you do them on the outside, so let's call them negative behaviors for the sake of this, if you sleep around and use drugs and grow your hair long or I don't know, you know, if you do that negative stuff, then we'll love you, we will love you and we'll accept you and we'll approve of you remember what the needs are, we'll meet your needs you'll be an important person, you'll be a valuable, acceptable person and you won't have to be alone because we'll let you in our little club and so if the person believes that those needs will be met if they do this behavior, they do the behavior and now they're in the club but there's some problems here and one of the problems is that you can't do enough negative stuff on the outside to fill yourself up on the inside. It can't be done. Some things that I want to tell you about this person is that this person is easy to spot. In other words, you know who they are. They are empty on the inside but empty on the outside as well. And people who are empty on the outside are easy to spot. If I'm walking down the street in Minneapolis and I see someone who's laying in the gutter drunk, I don't say to myself, I wonder if this is negative. It's negative. It's not that hard to figure out. So people who live this way, you can tell who they are. They look negative. Another thing about this person is that not only are they easy to spot, but they are bad PR. bad public relations. If you have a person like this in your family and you care and you're not sure exactly what you're dealing with and you have a sense that their behavior has the power to say something about you as a parent or a family member, see this is bad PR you either have to fix them or hide them, you know, and that would be enabling understand, codependency, because you think that the fact that this person is living this way is an indictment on you as a parent or a son or daughter or a sibling or a fellow Christian or a roommate or whatever. And the other thing about this person is that they're tired. And the reason they're tired, once again, is because you can't do enough negative things on the outside to fill yourself up on the inside. But as long as you think you can, you keep expending all this energy trying to earn that stuff on the inside and it doesn't work. But you do a lot of negative behavior. Now, let's say one day this person figures it out, and they say, I'm tired, you know, this isn't working. I have been the best negative person there is to be, and I'm not any better than I was before. Plus, I'm more tired. Actually, I'm worse off than I was before. So let's say they figure this out. Or let's say that we come to them, and we start to put pressure on them to knock this off. So society would come to this person and say, you know what, if you do one more of these behaviors, behaviors we're going to throw you in jail. You're going to get pain for acting this way. The principal comes and says one more of these and you're expelled. The employer says one more of these and you're fired. Parents say one more of these and we're going to send you to the Christian school. It's not okay for you to keep acting this way. I mean you think there are people in the Christian schools because of this? Sure there are. There's no comfort in that for me. Do you understand? There's nothing, that's not, that's, that's just a person who's been squeezed. So let's say that this person figures out that they're not willing to live this way anymore. Okay, so here they are over here. Still empty. Remember, emptiness is a state of unmet needs. Same person, they've stripped away, they've given up all their bad stuff, okay? Still don't know that they're loved and accepted. Still don't know that they're worthwhile and valuable. Still feel really alone. You know, this is a person who doesn't have inside strength. Unmet, needy person is a vulnerable person. You can squeeze this person. So we'll put them in the positive peer group, maybe a religious group. You know, religion is just a more spiritual version of the world, that's all. Religion and spirituality are not the same thing. Religion is, you know, Christianity is the only system in the whole world that bases identity and value and acceptance on someone else's performance besides your own. That's what pure Christianity is about. That's what sets it apart from every other system in the world. That's what's foolish. Paul calls it foolish. Where else would you find that kind of system? God's the only one, Paul says in Romans 11, that could have thought that up. Every other system is based on performance. Every other religious system is based on performance. If I was going to think of a system to validate people, I would say bald guys get to heaven easier than people with hair. I would think of a system that I could do. I wouldn't think of a system that I couldn't do. And so every system of the world, or every religious system, is based on some performance on our part. And so in every system then, certain groups of people have the edge. But in God's system, no one has the edge because God has created a system by which no one can get to him based on their performance, but everybody can get to him based on his mercy and grace. And that's just like foolishness. It's like it blows us away. Whoever heard of that, see. So this religious system, all this system does is put pressure on this person from the outside as well and says, well, don't go where they go, go where we go, and don't dress how they dress, dress how we dress, and don't read their books, read ours, and don't listen to their music, listen to ours, and don't talk like they talk, talk like we talk. And if you do, we'll love you and accept you, and you'll be an important, valuable person, and you can join our club, and you don't have to be alone. And if that person believes that doing that stuff can fill them up and meet their needs, and we'll get them accepted, and we'll make them important, and we'll get them part of the crowd, see, they do the stuff. and now they're empty on the inside and full on the outside. But because I'm not capable of knowing people's hearts, no one is except God, we look at this person and we say, well, praise the Lord. I mean, the Holy Spirit is really doing something in this person's life. Well, this has nothing to do with the Holy Spirit. This is just a person who's decided to please a different group of people. This is just a person who's been squeezed from the outside in. They've been conformed by a prettier-looking group. That's all. so this is a scary thing because now instead of being easy to spot we have a person who's hard to spot and the reason they're hard to spot is because I don't know hearts, I'm not capable of knowing hearts I can draw some conclusions about someone's heart based on what's going on on the outside but that doesn't mean it's really there or that I'm capable of actually knowing what's there Man looks on the outward appearance. God looks on the heart. The other thing about this person, though, is that they're not bad PR. They're good PR. This is the person who is the trophy. This is the person that we drag out in front of people and hold up and say, look at them, because if we have a sense that someone else's behavior has the power to say something about us, you see, this is somebody who says some good stuff about us. And so we stand up in front of people and point at them and applaud for them. And, you know, I'm not even saying we shouldn't applaud for people's good stuff. I'm not saying that. No, this is the kid that we bring out in front of our parents and try to get them to sing this little cute song that they sing or do a little poem or say all the little verses they've memorized because maybe if they tap dance good enough, our parents will validate us based on our kids' behavior because they never validated us based on ours. and so we're still needy in that area and now we have another shot at it. People who get good at this get to be elders in churches. I mean, for Pete's sakes, this looks good. But they're still tired, you see, because you can't do enough positive stuff on the outside to fill yourself up on the inside. It can't be done. If it was possible to do enough positive stuff on the outside to fill yourself up on the inside, Jesus wouldn't have had to come. we wouldn't need a savior we could just save ourselves and so here's this person who's doing all this kind of behavior trying to fix themselves and meet their needs by doing good stuff and they end up just as tired as the person who is doing the bad stuff as a matter of fact they might end up more tired what do you think which person do you think is more tired person A or person B who thinks person A is more tired how about person B Yeah, see, person B actually would be more tired because person A is, person B is living in an inconsistent way, in an incongruent way, and to continue to do stuff on the outside that's against what's really going on on the inside is a very tiring way to live. Even though this person's negative, if they feel like ripping you off, they just rip you off. I mean, this person B, if they want to rip you off, they just smile and say, so good to see you. They always give you the right answer, even if it's not the true answer, and that's a very tiring way to live. Which person do you think is more healthy? Who thinks person A is more healthy? Who thinks person B is more healthy? Well, that's a trick question because they're the same person. It's just the same person. Neither one is more healthy than the other if our definition of health is about inside strength. Understand this? Now, in secular psychology, the way the thinking goes is that the reason why people become mentally ill is because they live incongruent with themselves. In other words, they live on the outside in a way that's inconsistent with what's going on on the inside, and if you do that long enough, you get sick. So then the goal of psychology, of therapy, would be to help people be congruent. And there's two ways to do that. One is to help people change their behaviors on the outside to match their inside, but in society, you see, You wouldn't ever want to do that. If you had someone who was a criminal who was not robbing banks, that would be someone who was incongruent, right? So you wouldn't want to help them start robbing banks so that they could be congruent. So then the other goal would be to change their value system. So there's two ways to fix this person. One is to help them learn to live consistently on the outside with what's going on on the inside, or else to help them change their value system on the inside to match what they're doing on the outside, and that'll alleviate the tension between their outside and their inside. A lot of Christians, a lot of churches, church people, have a behavioral definition of health. And what that is is that if a person lives right on the outside, they're healthy, period. That's all there is to it. So in that case, person B would be more healthy in that definition. In a psychological definition of health, this is the person A is more healthy. But in a behavioral definition of health, person B is more healthy, and then our goal would just be to help people start doing the right stuff on the outside. It doesn't matter if it matches their inside. If they look good, they're okay. But if your definition of health is about inside strength and fullness and maturity and responsibility and faith and those kinds of things, then it's just the same person. And neither one is more healthy than the other. I don't believe that our goal, as parents, let's say, or as preachers or teachers or Christian friends or whatever, I don't believe our goal is simply to help person A quit acting that way and start acting this other way. But for a lot of people, that is the goal. It doesn't matter where it comes from. Just live that way on the outside. I'm not, by the way, saying that how you live on the outside doesn't matter. It matters a lot. But I'm saying, really, that it matters so much that it needs to come from a real place. and because I can't see hearts you see I would be in trouble trying to help this person I might not give this person the help that they need let me show you some verses that talk about the danger of this and the first verse is 1 Samuel 16 7 actually verse 6 and 7 then it came about when they entered that he looked at Eliab, Samuel looked at Eliab and thought Surely the Lord's anointed is before him, but the Lord said to Samuel, Don't look at his appearance or the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. God sees not as man sees. Man looks at the outward appearance. God looks at the heart. So what happened, what that means is that God just kind of looks past all this stuff in both cases and sees what's on the inside, and what's on the inside he didn't like in this case. You know, what's interesting, once again, where I came from, remember, where all the pressure was on the outside to get people to act a certain way? What I saw in that fellowship of people were the saddest, most miserable Christians that you ever wanted to see. But there was a lot of good external behavior. People gave a lot of money, and they visited people at the nursing home on Sunday, and they went to Singspiration, and they did all this external stuff. No smoking, no drinking, no chewing, no going to movies, no doing all the external stuff. But also, no love, no joy, no peace, no patience, no goodness, no kindness, no long-suffering, you know, none of that. None of the fruit of the Spirit, because it wasn't the Spirit that was producing these things in these people's lives. It was them producing these things. You know, these were the best-looking, miserable people, you know, best Christians without a smile that you ever saw in your life. And so hearts matter, I think, and God cares about hearts. Isaiah 29, 13. Then the Lord said, Because his people draw near with their words and honor me with their lip service, but they remove their hearts far from me, and their reverence for me consists of traditions learned by rote. So in other words, they say the right stuff, and they've got a lot of verses memorized maybe, and they know the whole deal by heart. I don't have their hearts, and that's the issue here in Isaiah 29. In Jeremiah 9, verse 23, Thus says the Lord, Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not the rich man boast of his riches, external stuff, you see, but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord who exercises loving kindness, justice, and righteousness on the earth. I delight in these things, declares the Lord. Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, that I'll punish all who are circumcised yet uncircumcised. Now you see, circumcision was an external symbol of what had happened in Abraham's heart when he believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness. God said, do an external symbol that signifies the real thing that happened inside of your heart. So it was almost like Abraham's heart was circumcised. He was cut away. And so to signify that that had happened, go do this on the outside. But what happened was that after that point, people kind of forgot about the inside stuff and just did the external thing and thought that that's what it was all about. You know, baptism, getting baptized, getting baptized is just an external symbol of what has really happened in a person's life. That's all. You know, it's a play. It's an outward manifestation of something that has happened. It's a picture of what has happened inside of a person. You know, when you're baptized and you're lowered into the water, if I hold you under the water long enough, what happens to you? You die, okay? And so what baptism is a picture of is that in Christ, we've been baptized into his death, and we've been raised up anew into newness of life. But that doesn't make it happen. Do you understand? It just shows that it already did happen. And to show people out here what happened in here, we get baptized, that's all. But somewhere along the line, you know, sometimes we forget about the inside thing. It doesn't even matter if the inside thing really happens. Just do the outside thing and everything will be great. Same thing with communion. Communion is just an external symbol or picture of the death and life, or what Christ's death and life gives us, you know. But sometimes communion becomes the thing then, and we forget about the real thing and just do the external thing. Well, see, here we have people who are circumcised yet uncircumcised. Egypt, Judah, Edom, and sons of Ammon and Moab, and all those inhabiting the desert who clip the hair on their temples, for all the nations are uncircumcised. Israel is uncircumcised of the heart. And so, you know, they did the right external thing, but their hearts, I don't have their hearts. And that's an issue. Matthew, in the book of Matthew, chapter 23, when Jesus is kind of hollering at the Pharisees here, and warning people against them. He says, Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. You clean the outside of the cup, but inside they're full of robbery and self-indulgence. And so here's a cup right here that looks good. If you turn this cup on its side, on its edge, on its side, and you look at it, it's clean on the outside, but inside it's empty. There's nothing in there. And God doesn't like that. I mean, that doesn't mean anything. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. you like whitewashed tombs on the outside. A whitewashed tomb means that on the outside you're white, but inside it's full of dead men's bones. And this is not simply saying that you look different on the outside than what's going on the inside, although it is saying that. Jesus, that's hypocrisy. Hypocrite, you know, was an actor. This is acting. But in addition to this, And what happened here is that there's a million visitors coming into Jerusalem for the Passover. And in those days, when someone died, they didn't bury them in a cemetery. Like I got a cemetery out by my house that says St. Patrick's Cemetery, and all the dead people are in there. So if you don't want to be hanging around dead people, just don't go in there, because that's where they all are. But here, they just buried people where they could find a place to bury them. So they bury them under rocks. They bury them next to the road. They bury them in a cave. They bury them under a tree, you know, things like that. And then if you are coming for the Passover, the belief system was that if you touched one of these graves, you became ceremonially unclean. And in order to be able to do the Passover, you have to go through a bunch of ritual washings and rigmarole to get fit now to go do the Passover. So don't go near these graves because they defile you. and so as a present, as a service to all these visitors that are coming for the Passover, they'd go through the countryside and whitewash all the places where the people were buried so it's not just like a tomb, like a building, like a square building like on the Dracula movie, it's not like that it's like wherever there was a dead person, they would just whitewash it and then when you came into town, you could avoid those places so not only is Jesus saying that this kind of living is hypocritical but what he's also saying is that don't hang around these people because they're going to rub off on you. It's going to mess you up to hang around this. Watch out for this. It's a warning. And the last passage before I close is from Hebrews 4, verse 9. There remains, therefore, a Sabbath rest for the people of God. A Sabbath rest. Now this is referring to when God created the world in seven days. So he worked for six days and rested on the seventh. Why did God rest on the seventh? Because he was tired? No, because he was finished. Everything that needed to be completed was completed, and so God rested. And there remains, therefore, a Sabbath rest for the people of God. For the one who enters his rest has himself also rested from his works, just as God did from his. So what the saying is, in Christ, you can rest from your striving to try to fill yourself up and complete yourself and make yourself okay, because he has done everything there is to do. It's complete, and we can rest in that. We can rest in the is-finished rest. Then it says, let us therefore be diligent. Now, that's the motto of a lot of Christians, try hard. Let us be diligent. But then it says to enter that rest. So if you want to try hard, this verse says try hard to rest. lest anyone fall through following the same example of disobedience. So in this passage, once again, disobedience is not resting in what God has done. I'm not saying that resting means not doing anything. I'm not suggesting that I'm so okay because of Jesus that I just sit around not doing anything because I don't have to do anything. I'm talking about why we're doing what we're doing. Are we doing what we're doing because we're resting in what God did, or are we doing what we're doing because we don't think he did enough and it's our job to make it better by what we do. Then it says, The word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And there is no creature hidden from his sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do. So this is the verse that we were taught, you know, why we should read our Bible. You know, the Word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. The Bible is our sword. And so what we need to do is we need to read the Word of God because it's a sword so that we can go out and slice up non-Christians with it. That's what I was taught. Well, this verse isn't about slicing up non-believers, you see. This verse is talking about us and that we need to apply this to us. And the sword there is a machaira. And the machaira is a sharp, dagger-like, scalpel-sharp sword. And it's not like King Arthur's sword, which is this big, heavy sword, but it's a scalpel-sharp, little bitty sword. And so with King Arthur's sword, if you could get it swinging around hard enough, you could just cut everybody in half, you know, one big thing. Like that. Well, see, the thing is that when King Arthur would be picking up his sword, you could take this mackayra and flick out his Adam's apple like that because it was so sharp and so light. You could throw a piece of silk in the air, and when it came down, the weight of the silk would cut the silk in half because this was so sharp. And what they used to do with this sword is they used to use it in the law court, and what they did was if I was the defendant, and Jeff over here was the prosecuting attorney, he'd come get in my face and he'd say, you did it, you did it, you did it, you did it. Why'd you do it? You did it. And of course, he's in my face, and I don't want to look at him. So I'm trying to avoid his gaze. I'm trying to avoid the charges. So what they did with this machiro was they would strap it to the guy's chest and put it on his Adam's apple right here like this. And then the prosecuting attorney would come and say, you did it, and they couldn't look away. They had to face the charge. And what this says is this. There's no creature hidden from his sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do. And so what this verse is really about is that someday we're going to have an eye-to-eye encounter with the Lord and we're not going to be able to look away and everything is going to be laid open and bare to the eyes of whom we have to do. In other words, he's going to take a machira and just kind of open us up and judge what? The thoughts and intentions of the heart. Meaning that God knows why we do what we do. He knows why we do what we do. And that's the issue in this verse. That's what's being judged here. And the context of the verse of this passage is rest in what God did, resting. And so he's going to open up this person and he's going to say, oh, you know all this good stuff that you did? None of that was about resting. See, can you see how this person is not resting? This is a tired person who's striving like crazy to do enough good stuff on the outside to try to fill themselves up on the inside. So none of this is about rest. It's all about striving and trying harder to do it and finish what God did and all that kind of stuff. And God's going to use his makairah to look at that. And so what I'm suggesting is that we just do that ahead of time. In other words, that's why we read the Bible, is to use it to look inside of ourselves so we don't have to have this. I don't want to set people up for this kind of experience by putting so much pressure on them on the outside that it doesn't matter why they do what they do, just do the right stuff. In 1 Corinthians 3, it says that even though these people are saved, see, so this person could be a saved person even, all the stuff they did is going to get burned up because it was building garbage on the good foundation of Jesus. And it doesn't last. It's not going to last. So they'll last, you'll last, but this stuff won't last. And I don't want my kids to be this person who has to have that kind of encounter with the Lord or fellow Christians. This is not the same as a healthy, full person. Now, I'm going to talk about that a lot the rest of the day because I think it is possible to have fullness on the outside that comes from fullness on the inside. And I also think it's possible for believers who are full to not know how full they are or to act like they're empty, still trying to fill themselves up. I think it's possible. And so we're going to talk through all that during the rest of the day. Any questions? hearts matter fake it till you feel it that doesn't work if fake it till you feel it was the way to do it the Pharisees would have been okay because they did the right stuff Hebrews 4, 9-12 was the scripture reference on the last passage you know one more thing you know that passage that says God looks on the a man looks on the outward appearance but God looks on the heart the purpose of that passage is to talk about that external stuff is deceiving and that God doesn't fall for it he looks past it looks at hearts where I grew up the way that that passage was applied was to somehow get us to do external stuff. I'm not exactly sure how that happened. It was kind of like, well, man looks on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart. But man does look on the outward appearance, so don't grow a mustache or something like that. I'm not exactly sure how that got twisted, but even that verse got twisted to put pressure on us to do stuff from the outside in instead of from the inside out. Yes? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Because that's what I grew up with. Yeah. The story is, is Martin Luther in touch with such stuff? Or I mean, could you identify, seriously, could you identify people between the time of Paul and Jeff Van Tonderen that are in touch with him? You know, I'd like to mention Paul's name in the same sentence. Well, see, I think that Martin Luther, for instance, would leave the Lutheran Church, probably, because the kind of stuff that he railed against in the Catholic Church when he left it was this adding something to faith, that something had been added to faith, and it was faith alone. And he was so sold on that idea that he thought the book of James shouldn't have been in the Bible, for instance, because that talks about faith without works. And I was even talking too much about works than he wanted to talk about. So I think that there are lots of people, you know, in between Paul and Jeff Van Vonderen. And probably, you know, one of the reasons why this lands on you and you even embrace it or nod your head is because for a lot of people here, I'm probably not saying a new thing. I'm probably saying some words that put a language on what you have felt and experienced but didn't know exactly what to call at different times, you know. And so I'm just saying it out loud, and I think that through history there are lots of people who say this kind of stuff. But the reason it's hard, the reason why when you leave here it gets twisted is because as soon as you leave here, or as soon as you leave any other place where you hear that it's about grace and faith, period, as soon as you leave that, you walk out into the outside and you get bombarded with messages that say, It really is about how you look or what car you drive or whether you give 10%. And then the struggle is to believe this in an environment that says it's not true. Here, it's not so much of a struggle because this is what's coming like crazy. So everybody can go, yeah, I remember that, I remember that, because if you don't, I'll confront you about it. But out there, the message is different. Plus, it lands in the soil that we have where that was the only message we got, perhaps. I would say that maybe two years ago, prior to two years ago, I felt really angry about the place I grew up. It was so abusive, and it was. It was very legalistic and authoritative. About two years ago, something happened. and I don't even know, can't explain it. I think it's just God did something. But two years ago was the first time that I actually had a sense of feeling grateful, grateful for being in such a bad place, okay? Because God's grace is really sweet, and there just was none of it there, okay? And I think I have a sense of how neat God's grace is because of how lacking it was and how bad it was there. So for the first time in my whole process, I kind of feel like maybe in a big picture kind of way, I was set up to, I don't want to say God beat me up legalistically, but I do want to say that God could redeem that, and I have a sense of that being redeemed now. So I have a little bit of gratitude now, even though it was a terrible place, and even though I'm still angry about it. I still think it's wrong, and I don't think that you should abuse people so that later on they can find out how great it is to not be abused. That's kind of like why a gorilla beats on his chest, because it feels so good when he stops. But I think there are a lot of people who get this. I think there are authors out there today, there are books out there that say the same thing. I have sensed recently almost a revival happening across the country with different writers and people who are saying this kind of stuff. I think that A.W. Tozier said this. I think that there's a lot of people that said this. And I think everybody has a struggle to remember it. Even Paul and even me. Yeah. Yeah. I know you've been told or anything, but how long has it been? It seems like you've been a man who's not a man who's not a man. Well, the question is, how long did it take for this to be real in my life? And I can name an event that happened that switched my thinking around, but it didn't make it not be a struggle from that point on. It just redefined the struggle. See, I drew this picture kind of like you start here, and you burn out doing this, and then you come over here, and then this doesn't work, and then you figure it out. In my life, I did this first. This was where I started, and I did this for 18 years. And then I got some power in my life called a driver's license and a high school diploma, and I said, I'm out of here, and I'm not doing this anymore. It's a very tiring way to live. And so then for three and a half years, I did this. And my goal was, I was even conscious about it. I'm going to be the best bad guy you could be. And so I set out to, somewhere in all of this, you know, I couldn't have described it the way I just described it today, but I was aware of the fact that this didn't work. And I was ticked off because I had invested so much, and so I'm out of here. And I went and did this. And I think that the fact that it took me three and a half years to figure out this negative side and 18 years to figure this out is significant. Because when you're doing this negative stuff, you know, the cops are after you and people are chasing you and beating you up. And so you figure it out sooner. Over here, you're getting strokes over here. You know, people are patting you on the back and, you know, you're getting all kinds of trophies and things like that. But the event was that one day I kind of bottomed out doing this, you know. And then repentance for me, which is a big word for us, repentance for me, which over here on this side would have been a behavioral issue. Repentance would have been, okay, so I'm doing all this good stuff, and then when I do a negative thing, I feel terrible, then I've got to repent, which would have meant change it back into a positive thing. So repentance for me was a behavioral issue. But, see, I think that when I repented over here, it was no longer a behavioral issue. What occurred to me was that it's not possible for me to get okay from doing good stuff or bad stuff. So it was a significant kind of intervention in my thinking, you know, one night after a big party and a big fight and all this kind of stuff, that I've been doing this now for quite a while, and I'm still not okay. I don't feel any more full, any more rested, any more sense of well-being now after doing this than I did over here. And because, though, I had all this theology and all this teaching about God and stuff over here, I all of a sudden remembered some stuff that I had been taught, but it landed different. It was almost like, it was as simple as this. If I'm going to be okay, it's going to have to be because of something besides me. Okay. Say it again. Yeah. Yeah. But it was more like, yeah, that was coming to the end of myself. But it was like, I need a gift. And that was very significant for me then. It wasn't new vocabulary, but it meant something different than it used to mean. It's like, God's going to have to do something for me because I tried and it didn't work and I'm more tired than when I started and blah, blah, blah. And all that kind of crystallized in one evening. But since that time, then the fight has been different. And before, the fight would have been to just be Mr. Nice again, you know, and try to do it right. Now the fight is to remember who I am and what God has done and how settled it is. And frankly, folks, that's as good as it gets. As good as it gets is fighting the right fight. That's as good as it gets. And I was not taught to fight the right fight. I was taught to fight the wrong fight. And now we're talking about a different kind of fight here. and it's not a behavioral fight. And I'm not saying that behaviors don't matter. I'm not saying that. I'm saying that they matter so much that they need to flow out of a real place because otherwise they don't count and you get really tired. So I struggle with this, but I think that what's changed for me is that I struggle with the right issue now instead of the struggle I used to have. Repentance for me is not a behavioral issue, it's a source issue. So if I repent, it's not from just doing a bad thing, but it would be from doing the bad thing as if the bad thing is what could fill me up and remembering who it is that does say I'm okay. And so it's a source issue versus just a behavioral issue. Non-Christians can do the Ten Commandments and their life will improve, but it doesn't make them full. It makes them less of a menace to society. okay last question then we'll take a break yeah well the question is where the Romans one person fits in, and this is the person that is on the negative course, and God gives them over to that. I think that that is in line with some of what I said last night, which is I think that the reason God gives them over isn't so that they're given over, but so that they can experience the fullness of how empty emptiness is, and even that's an act of grace, do you understand, so that they can understand that there is salvation, or there is a gift, or there is a way to be full. But, you know, as someone who is looking at this, if this was a relative, for instance, that would be a very scary thing. You know, to be given over by God would be a very scary thing, I think. But I think even that's an act of grace. Paul talks about even the law is grace. Even the law is grace because what the law does, the law was God's way to drive you to a gift, not to drive you to holiness. The law wasn't given to make us holy. the law was given to show us that we can't be holy by being lawful so we'll go get a gift.
