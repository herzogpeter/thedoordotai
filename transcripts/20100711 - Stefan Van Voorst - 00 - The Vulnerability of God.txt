Well, Steve Weins and Dave Johnson, who are usually here, had an opportunity this week to spend time with their families and be together, and so they called me up from the minor leagues. We're going JB today, all right? It's, it's, no, it's great to be here, actually. It's, it's really cool. Are we having a good summer? Going okay? Yeah, we, we've had a great one. Getting a lot of time with my kids and my wife, which has been super, super fun, because it's just, yeah, it's exciting. We're at a fun age. One of the things I've been looking forward to the most, though, this summer is going to happen a week from now. A week from today, I'll be in Detroit, Michigan, and I'm going to spend the entire week in the studio recording vocals for my next record, which is, yeah, super fun. Justin Charvenau has been in this neck deep with me, as well as Grady Kennevin and Ian Allison. So now I have to show up and sing. So we'll see how that goes. But one of the things I'm looking forward to the most about this and why it makes it even better is on Saturday night, a week from tonight, or Sunday night, a week from tonight, I get to be fifth row at a concert of one of my favorite bands. I'm fired up. The band is called Switchfoot. And some of you know Switchfoot. they've been around a long time I'm a bit of a jerk in that if something's like cool I'm immediately skeptical like if everybody's like you gotta hear this band so what happens is a band exists for 10 years and I never listen to them and so about a year ago I started listening to them and I fell in love with them and I'm like oh my lands and it's not because I just like the style but they have something to say and I really love artists who have something to say and so I'm gonna get to hear them and I have a bit of a stalker issue right now, I'm afraid. I can't wait, you know, and I paid the money to be fifth row and, oh gosh, stupid. But the other thing about when I get into something, I'm a little bit obsessive about it and so I listen to it all the time and so what that means is my kids hear it all the time. And so now my kid's favorite band is Switchfoot, which I'm actually really excited about because it could be Lady Gaga or something like that. And it's Switchfoot. And they have these songs memorized now. And because I get obsessive, I bought a DVD of a live performance, a live concert. And they have this one song that's my kid's favorite song. And I don't even know why it's their favorite, but it is. And it's one of my favorites as well. It's called The Shadow Proves the Sunshine. And the song goes like this. Sunshine, won't you be my mother? Sunshine, come and help me see. My heart is darker than these oceans. My heart is frozen underneath. We are crooked souls trying to stay up straight. Dry eyes in the pouring rain where the shadow proves the sunshine. The shadow proves the sunshine. So my daughter, she watches this video, and she copies John Foreman, the lead singer. And she grabs her little toy mic and, sunshine, won't you be my mother? Right? And my son, he catches little words here and there, but he just starts yelling, sunshine mama, sunshine mama. He'll be two next month, and so that's the best he can do. And he jumps around while my daughter just sits there like this, right? A couple weeks ago, I came home, and I walked in the door, and I knew it had been a bad day. Meredith was frustrated. It was obvious. And she says, well, it's been a rough afternoon. I says, well, why has it been a rough afternoon? And she starts out by saying, your daughter, which is a bad sign. She says, your daughter told me this afternoon that she wanted the sunshine to be her mother and she wanted me to live in the attic. Now, I wanted to do that response, laugh. But this was not a laughing matter. It clearly had crushed my wife. This three-year-old girl has a ton of power. And one little statement like that, even though she's three, and anybody looking from the outside would say, well, she's three. She doesn't know what she's saying. When you're my wife and when you're her mother, when she had come from you, when every day, all day, your life is about her, it crushes you. So I thought, well, we can fix this. So I went into the den, and we did our hugs and kisses and all that kind of stuff. And I said to Mimi, I said, Mimi, I'm going to go get something to drink in the kitchen. Do you want to come with me a minute? I'd love to talk with you about something. And so she follows me in the kitchen, and she sits down at the kitchen table. And I said, did you tell Mom that you wanted her to live in the attic today? She smiles. She says, yes. And I said, well, do you really want her to live in the attic? and she says I don't know I said well I think it might hurt mom's feelings and then she got real quiet I said but I know we can fix this I know we can fix this and I said here's how we can fix it if we go back into the den if you go up to mom and you say mom I'm sorry for saying what I said I really love you and then you give her a hug and a kiss. I said, I bet it'll fix it. So we head back into the den, and I'm not going to lead this thing, right? I want her to see if she'll do this, so I'm hands off. I sit down on the couch, and all four of us are in there, and a couple minutes passes, and she's not doing what we had talked about. It's crazy. You should be able to reason with a three-year-old, but... So she's rolling around on the floor, and finally I said, Mimi, do you have something you need to tell mom? And she looks at me, and she knows what I'm talking about, and she just says, I can't. And I said, okay, I think you probably need to. I can't. And from her expression, she was saying, I'm sorry. but I kind of wanted to hear the words right well it didn't happen so I'm like whatever a little while later we're sitting in the kitchen getting ready to eat and I'm like this is still bugging me I said okay Mimi you sit here mom you sit here and I'm sitting in the middle I said Mimi did you say that you wanted mom to live in the attic today she says yes I said mom how did that make you feel? And Meredith said, it hurt my feelings. I said, Mimi, do you have anything to say about that? And she says something like, poopy butt. My intentions were so good, but it just didn't work. And Meredith ended up just feeling worse, you know, because given the opportunity to change it, she still didn't. Well, if you ever had an encounter like that with a child, one of the thoughts that might run through your head is, man, we did not sign up for this. And part of the fear, I think, in Meredith is not just that it happened then and it's a three-year-old and everybody says, oh, it's a three-year-old. But I think there's this fear in the back of our head that says, okay, what happens when she's 13? If this is what three-year-old is like, what is it going to be like in 10 years or 20 years? It's the part of parenting that's absolutely horrifying. To realize you love this person so much, but they don't need to return it. it's totally up to them and now this other person has so much power one little sentence can crush you this is the danger of love that as we love we open ourselves up to all sorts of stuff that could come a few years ago a friend of mine went through a divorce and I was talking to her after a court case they had and I was just talking about the experience and things like that and she said this thing to me that really stuck with me she said, Stephan, she said I never imagined how painful it would be to sit in a room with the one person on earth who knows you more than anyone else and to hear them say, I don't want to be with you. That hurts. And when we sign up for marriage, we don't sign up for that. The problem is, is when we sign up for marriage and we say, I want to give myself to you, we become vulnerable to the possibility that that kind of pain could happen. This is the danger of love. It's dangerous. Because we could get hurt. A couple years ago, Steve Weins and I were in France with a man by the name of Jean Vanier. And he's one of the holy men in the world today. He is incredible. And 40, 50 years ago, he started living in community with folks with disabilities. And it's a healing community. It's a community where people can come and be someone. And all these communities over the last several years have popped up all over the world now. People who have committed their lives and go live there for the rest of their life to live in community with folks with disabilities. And when we were there, John said something that like, it kind of shook me a little bit because I had never really thought about it. And one of the things he said about people with disabilities or people who are poor, he said, we see Christ in the vulnerability of the poor because Christ was vulnerable. And I thought, I don't know if I've ever thought about that. The vulnerability of Jesus. But now as a parent, I get it. Because I think Jesus was driven by love. And when you love, you become vulnerable. It started right at the beginning. A little baby. And from the very beginning, this baby needed to eat. Seems simple, we take it for granted. But when you're looking at the baby as the creator of the universe, that's kind of crazy. And the one who was going to keep him alive was a young teenage girl. That's vulnerable. That God would trust a teenage girl with the Savior of the world. Vulnerable. It didn't get a whole lot better. Once news of his birth got out, immediately his life was in jeopardy. It already upset the political environment and there was a threat on his life. and so these two young parents Mary and Joseph have to flee to save their baby boy to take off to another land without these two young parents Jesus dies vulnerable his entire ministry was a ministry of vulnerability I think we have a picture of Jesus or at least I've had a picture of Jesus for so much of my life where he wasn't affected by stuff. Because he always had the big picture. He always knew something else other people didn't know. But that's not how relationships work. Relationships live in the moment, in the present, face to face. And so one day Jesus gets news of a friend of his named John. who had been killed. And I would think, well, Jesus has the big picture, right? So he would hear of John's death and he would say, I know, folks, it's hard. Don't worry, it's gonna be okay. This isn't the end of the story. There's more coming. Everything's gonna be fine. But Jesus doesn't do that. Jesus lost his friend. a friend who he loved and so he wept he experienced sorrow he was vulnerable to pain and losing a friend was painful most of his ministry he had to live outside of cities in the hills and in the mountains and in the wilderness because his life was threatened. The scriptures would talk about people running them out of town, wanting to stone them. Jesus' entire ministry was a ministry of vulnerability. But at the end of his life, that's where it really gets crazy. He had spent three years with a little group of friends and he had given himself to this little group of friends. They knew him better than anybody else on the planet. they had been in the inner circle and so when he said things that people didn't understand this little group of friends got to hear what he meant what a gift he walked with them daily ate with them laughed with them cried with them probably experienced fear with them walking through with them how to deal with what was happening around them and teaching them the way of the kingdom. Close group of friends. So on the last night, before he's arrested, he goes out to this garden and he had just shared a meal with this group of friends. And a few things happened in that meal that were significant. One was Jesus let them into a little bit of what was going to be happening. And one of the friends named Peter says, no, it's not. That's not going to happen. And Jesus says, Peter, not only is that going to all happen, in the midst of all that, you're going to deny you ever knew me. Jesus was vulnerable to being rejected by a friend. But Jesus doesn't drop the friend there. Jesus is always and always always giving second chances so he takes the friends out to this garden and most of his disciples he said wait here and he takes three with him Peter, James and John it's like the core of the core and he says something to them that I think is interesting he says I'm overwhelmed with sorrow we need to pray and I need you to pray to be with me in this sorrow I need you think about that I need you to pray so he leaves the three and he goes off by himself and he prays comes back a little bit later and these three friends that he needed to pray to be with him in his sorrow are sleeping and he wakes him up He says, you guys, do you have any idea what's happening? I need you right now. I need you to be present. I need you to pray. And he leaves again, and he prays, and he comes back, and they're sleeping again. Jesus was vulnerable to being let down by friends. soon after that they hear people coming with swords and clubs religious leaders and they come and leading the group is a man named Judas who was part of this inner core of 12 who had been with Jesus for three years who knew Jesus better than almost anyone else other than the 12 that were with him. And Judas has his own agenda. And here's the thing that always baffles me about Judas. What I want to know is, when did Jesus know? When he first asked Judas to follow him, did he know what was going to happen? Or did he not know until way? How did it work? He entrusted Judas with the money. Jesus gave Judas chances and for however long he knew can you imagine the grace Jesus had knowing what Judas would do can you imagine the patience can you imagine how Jesus would have had to what would have had to have been inside him to always be given Judas a chance I mean how would you not how would that not affect your relationship if you know this guy is going to betray me and it is going to set off a cycle of events that is going to be horrifying how would you not treat him different well vulnerability there's an interesting thing in the scriptures when Judas comes and he says the cue for everybody is he's going to kiss Jesus on the cheek so he walks up to Jesus and he says hello Rabbi and he kisses on the cheek and Jesus says this friend do what you came for friend I think a lot of us have been betrayed by a friend I can't I don't have a box for that and Jesus still calls him friend well Peter's still fired up this is not going to happen so Peter grabs his sword He's not going down without a fight. Boom! One big swing. It cuts off a man's ear. It's time to fight. We will defend Jesus. Protect Jesus. And Jesus looks at his friend Peter and he says, Peter, put that thing down. If you live by it, you're going to die by it. Don't you think I could call 12 legions of angels from heaven to help me right now? Put the sword down, Peter. This isn't my way. My way is love, and therefore, I'm vulnerable. I'm vulnerable. Jesus gets arrested, and he goes through this whole thing alone. the disciples flee for fear of their life. Ends up on a cross. His mom, a couple other women, and his friend John sitting there. And he dies by himself. While he's on the cross, people are mocking him, making fun of him, saying, you did all this for everybody else, why don't you save yourself? And because we know the story, we look at that mockery and we think, man, that's mean, you know. Of course he's not going to do that. But I tell you what, if you're at the scene and you're a disciple, that's your question. When I put myself into the shoes of the disciples, I'm going, okay, we saw a little girl get up from the dead. We saw Lazarus walk out of a cave after being dead. We saw lepers healed. We saw lame people walk. We saw blind people see. What's happening? How did we get here? get off of that cross but the way of love doesn't because love leads to vulnerability and so you can end up on a cross fortunately the story doesn't end three days later the world is shocked because Jesus has risen from the dead and this is the part we celebrate you know this part where it's like he conquered death and the images I have of Jesus in this is like the king who's conquered it all nothing can beat him nothing can take him down and that is all true but there's still something about Jesus and how he chooses to relate to his disciples that fascinates me and the one story specifically starts out the disciples are fishing in the morning and they're out in the boat and jesus is on the shore and the disciples are struggling and so jesus throws out some advice and after a little bit the disciples realize that's the lord that's jesus and my favorite part of the story is john's like trying to get everything in back into the boat and to get into the shore. Peter is not waiting. Peter takes off his coat, dives into the water, and swims to shore. Love that. That's how I want to chase Jesus. I don't have time to wait for you, John. He gets to shore, and Jesus says, let's have some breakfast. I had fish. Never had fish for breakfast. It's weird. But if Jesus cooked it, it was probably pretty good. but Jesus and Peter have some work to do because even though Peter was all fired up to see him these are two friends that had a falling out because one friend who needed the other friend so much at one of the worst times of his life was failed. And so we see this little interaction of Jesus and Peter that I think is incredibly profound. Jesus gets alone with Peter and he says to Peter, Peter, do you love me? All my life I've known this story. And all my life what I've been told was Jesus was testing him, right? Because Peter was going to be doing some things after this that are pretty significant in terms of the history of the church. And so Jesus needed to know. So he's testing Peter. Well, I don't necessarily read where you get that from in the scriptures. My question is, what if he actually wanted to know? What if Jesus is looking at a friend and they had experienced so much together? They had been through everything, including death. But when he needed his friend most, his friend bailed. His friend didn't hang in there with him. What if it hurt? And what if Jesus is looking at his friend saying, I gotta know, do you love me? I think that's incredibly significant when you think about the heart of God. Because I think it's a question God has for us. And the amazing thing is we could say no. Peter could say no. that is vulnerable have you ever had to sit across from a friend and look him in the eyes and say I have to know do you love me? have you ever had to sit across from your spouse and look him in the eye because you genuinely didn't know and you needed to do you love me? Have you ever had to look into the eye of a parent and say, do you love me? Or maybe a child. I gotta know, do you love me? Are you with me? Love calls us into vulnerability. It is dangerous. and the thing that I am absolutely amazed about God is that he is not there because he wants to just do stuff for us instead he comes to the table of relationship with vulnerability seen in the person of Jesus he's willing to take the risk of being rejected he's willing to experience the pain of it that's unbelievable the creator of the universe the one in whom all things were created standing there with his friend saying, do you love me? Because more than anything, what I want is relationship. Unbelievable. Scary. Scary. Now, if you've ever really loved somebody, this is nothing profound for you. Because you're going, oh yeah. But it is a question for us, would we be willing to come to the table of relationships with our vulnerability? To come as we are. Because the truth of the matter is, I think all of us have that question that we're all asking in some way. Do you love me? And I think the fear of the answer causes us to do all sorts of things. Some of us isolate. I couldn't handle the idea of rejection. The problem is the question doesn't go away. So we can isolate, but the question remains, do you love me? some of us we've been loved based on what we do we live in a culture of competition weakness does not work in our culture I don't know if you noticed that but the question do you love me is a place of weakness in a culture of competition it goes totally against the grain. In a culture of competition, love just doesn't work. Richard Rohr has this great thought, and he says, anytime there's competition, love can't exist because love doesn't play by those rules. Competition is always seeking to dominate, to conquer. But love won't. Love doesn't play by those rules, and therefore, A lot of times it looks like you lose. And none of us like losing. But I happen to think that Christians historically have always been at their best when they're losing. And I think it started with the cross. You talk about looking like losing. I look at the church sometimes and I think, why are we still trying to win? Because in all our effort to win, we've lost our ability to love. Because in love, we give ourselves and people are free to do whatever they want, to reject us, to hurt us. Jean Vanier talks about being free of the fear of our fears. What would that look like? To be able to come to the table of relationships and say, I don't have to conquer you. I don't have to impress you. I don't have to try to make you see why I'm better than you. I can let it all down. One of the experiences, if you've ever spent time with the poor, you know this. The poor have nothing to impress you with. They can't dominate you. They can't win. They don't have the mechanisms to do that. We lead with our jobs, with the kind of families we have, the house, the cars. The poor don't have any of that. All they've ever known is vulnerability, and so that's what they come with. This is who I am. My life is a disaster. And here's what's amazing about the poor. People who leave the world of competition to go spend time with the poor, it's not strange for them to give up their entire life and spend the rest of their life there. And the reason is this. The poor give you the freedom to let go of it all as well. They're not looking for somebody to impress them. They're not looking for your generosity. They're not looking for any of that. What they're looking for is somebody who would be in relationship with them and sit in the question, do you love me? This is me. I haven't showered in two weeks. I'm totally schizophrenic. I'm addicted to alcohol and drugs. It's me. Do you love me? and I experienced some incredible things where I realized oh my goodness if they could be that vulnerable maybe I could maybe I could be honest about the things that are the darkest in me and that is the place of freedom when we begin to look at our darkness and Richard Rohr has this thought that if we are temples, then even the darkness is sacred. So befriend it. Don't be afraid of it. And we move into love because we're not scared of being vulnerable. Now the cost is high because I think love and vulnerability are connected. The more you love, the more vulnerable you become. And I think it'd be easy to say, not worth it, when you see people who have been hurt over and over and over again, I totally get it. It's like, nope, I'm not going back there. The problem is to not love is death. The scriptures are clear. We were created in and through Jesus. What that means is the fabric of our being is love. Our DNA is love. And when we do anything that tries to operate against that, we die. And if you've seen anybody who's worked so hard to isolate and protect so they can't be hurt again, look at their life and see if they're happy. When we refuse to love, we've got two problems. We're going against our being, and two, our question of do you love me still doesn't get answered. But it's risky. it could bring pain we could be rejected we could end up on a cross we'd have to lay down our swords we'd have to give friends second chances all the time to be hurt again and again that's the heart of God that's the heart of God that's unbelievable we can't do any of that without the heart of God we can't do any of that without that heart becoming part of us in some way and man, I would love to be able to say, poof, there it goes, but it doesn't work that way. I think it's in the practice, and it's the continuation of moving towards Jesus, and when we get beat down to get back up, I said, Lord, I don't know what else to believe in. I choose to believe in love. this morning we were sitting side by side it's my picture of the church not just open door the church in general our rooms are set up side by side and the focus is on one person and that one person is going to help give answers direction direction but the church of the future is not going to work that way. The church of the future needs to move from side to side to face to face because one person can't do it. Everybody's doing it. Everybody has to do it. The answers are in all of us. So part of the question for us is how do we become a church that can go face-to-face? To choose love and to know, oh man, it is going to be vulnerable. But that's where we need to move. I don't totally know what that looks like, to be honest. A few weeks ago I talked about the mentoring program. I think some of that we get to see there. But that's not for everybody. How do we move face-to-face? To look each other in the eyes and to be honest with our question, do you love me? To let down all the things that protect us, the things that give us status, the things that help us win. And to be willing to say, the goal here is to not win. The goal is to love. Let's pray. Lord more than anything I'm just humbled grateful of your faithfulness and honestly I feel so unworthy the fact that you'd continue to come and give of yourself over and over and over again. And that your mercy for us is new today and it will be new again tomorrow. Lord, I pray that we wouldn't look at you as the one who just does stuff for us. But the one who deeply desires relationship and that you're willing to come and be vulnerable. Help us as we move to the table together to look at each other. Give us the courage to lay down the things that protect us. Give us eyes to see each other and more than anything to see you. You are good. And we are grateful. We pray this in your name. Amen. Thank you.
