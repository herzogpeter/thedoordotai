Open your Bibles with me to the book of 1 Corinthians, chapter 14, verse 1. A couple of weeks ago, when we were in the middle of our study on the gifts of the Spirit in chapter 12, really it was a few months ago, I came to one of the gifts that was the gift of tongues, and to others has been of various kinds of tongues given. And some of you thought I was dodging a bullet, I'm sure, as we kind of skipped over that and made a promise to you that we would eventually get to that, hoping all the time that the rapture would come first. But it didn't, so here we are. Chapter 14, verse 1. Let's look at it. Pursue love. Now, just a reminder here, I don't want to do a lot of background, but we're coming off of chapter 13 that Paul used to try to bring for the Corinthians into perspective all of the gifts of the Spirit. You remember that they had become absorbed in them. Nothing at all wrong with the gifts of the Spirit or even experiencing the fullness of them. To say nothing's wrong with them is silly to say. They are one of the keys that unleashes the power of God in the church. But the problem with the Corinthians was that began to be the place that they got their sense of value. And it was the focus and it exalted them and it became a very selfish thing. And so he says pursue love because that's the thing that is eternal. He's bringing it back into perspective. Yet, don't ignore the gifts. One of the things you need to be mindful of is whenever you're dealing with immature people, they are constantly given to extremes either it's the gifts and nothing else it's just gifts gifts gifts and then i get corrected it's not the gifts it's love now it's just going to be love love love and we're just going to let the gift slide right out the window constantly needing to bring these people back into a position of mature balance pursue love that is the priority but don't let your pursuit of love get you to ignore the functioning of the gifts of the spirit among you And then he begins to get to what he really wants to talk about, but especially pursue prophecy. And now he's really talking about what he wants to in verse 2. For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. For no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries. But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation, which is better than tongues. That's his inference. Verse 4. But one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, and that's fine. But one who prophesies edifies more than himself. He edifies the whole church, and that's better. Now, I wish that you all spoke in tongues. There are some people who wish like crazy that wasn't in the Bible. But even more, I wish that you would prophesy. Stop right there. Let's pray. Father, as we come to this particular topic, we are aware of the fact that this is something over which believers in your Son, and people in whom your spirit dwells have found reason to divide. And I think that grieves your heart. And especially as we are mindful as a congregation that we have been affected these last weeks by the teaching of 1 Corinthians 13 and what it really means to love, we come to this Father with hearts that are tempered by love, knowing that whatever it is that we think we know, we only know in part. And so that keeps us in a position of humility. Whatever it is that we think is fine to think. But Father, give us room to give room to other people. And to indeed focus on love as we deal with this issue. Do your work among us of teaching and exhortation, edification and building here among us in Jesus name. Amen. As we get into this thing, we need to establish some things. One of the things I want to do this morning is get you to enter into the struggle I had this last week as I just began to get to the text. Something is going to happen this week, this Sunday morning, that has happened before. And if you're with us often, you're kind of used to this. If you're a visitor, you're going to feel a little bit awkward about this, but we're probably not going to get to the text at all. This is one of those teachings that to me is so important. It's very much like when we came to the gifts of the Spirit in chapter 12. One of the sermons we had was kind of a background or an introduction into the whole issue so that we would have some foundational information with which to deal with the issue with a sense of stability. There are some things we need to know about this particular thing. First of all, let's recognize together that the issue of tongues is a timely issue. I don't think you can be maneuvering or functioning in Christian circles for very long before the whole issue of the charismatic movement comes up. Either you're involved in it, or you have a friend who's involved in it, or you think we should be involved in it, or we're too involved in it, or something like that. It's just there. And right at the very focus of the whole charismatic thing, and all of the functioning of the gifts of the Spirit, that we have talked about together at length and have seen begin to function among us, is this one central thing, tongues. It just is right at the very core of it. Not only is it timely, however, it is controversial. I don't think I need to do a big proofing on that to convince you that it's a controversial issue. With all the discussion that we do have, invariably it seems that we take sides in one form or another, on one side or another, in our congregation. I dare say that among us there is a tremendous divergence of opinion on where the gift of tongues fit, if it is appropriate at all in any context. In our congregation, I would hazard a guess that we have people among us who think that the gift of tongues on one hand is just a bunch of hooey. That's W-H-O-O-E-Y. Hooey. From the Greek word hooyeo, which means... It's a bunch of baloney. It doesn't have any place in the church. I just don't understand it, and I don't want to talk about it, so let's just close the door. We have people like that here, I'm sure. But we also have people here among us who, on the other hand, say, hey, the gift of tongues is the greatest thing since the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. It's the only thing that matters. Obviously, I'm dealing there with extremes. And I would like to think that there's some place where we can put our feet down and say, There is something that I know for sure true about tongues so that we can deal again with a foundation with some stability. I think we can do that, by the way. And I don't have any idea or any, I'm not so naive as to believe that we're all going to walk out of this door reconciling all of it. Everything you want to know about tongues, but we're afraid to ask right here. You'll never have a question again. Yes, you will. One of the problems that I discovered, quite honestly, and I'm going to be as honest with you as I can through these weeks as we deal with this. There are problems in this text. There are things that do not come as clear as I like them to. I think that one of the things that God has called me to in the style of my ministry is one of teaching. And somebody who's in a position of teaching wants to be clear. You'll want to be able to say, this is it. There will be times when I'm going to have to say, there are differences of opinion here, here's mine. But there are some things we can know. And I think it's important that we establish that. From there, we've got a foundation from which we can build and then fight like crazy. No, we won't. Some work, establishing some things. Point number one, in establishing our foundation, the first thing I want to do this morning, and I would encourage you to take notes, because our textual study over the next few weeks is going to be vital, but I think most of it is going to flow from this, so I encourage you to do that. The first thing I want to do is establish and understand the problem itself. Establish and understand the problem itself. The problem is twofold as I see it. First of all, we have, when it comes to the gift of tongues, a theological problem. The theological problem was one I've already referred to. On one hand, we have people who have a theology that teaches them the gift of tongues no longer exists in any form at all. Now, when you have that particular perspective on tongues, that it is no longer existing today, and by the way, they very often point to verse 8 of chapter 13, saying tongues will cease. We've already dealt with that, and I'll kind of dispel that a little bit in a minute. But what you do is you raise a question, and it's one that every one of us face. If you are to accept that theology, carte blanche, that it no longer exists, I've got to reconcile that theology with a lot of people I know who have come to me and claim that they have the gift of tongues. Now, it's real comfortable as well. If everybody I know who claims they have the gift of tongues is a little bit wacko, you know? I know they're given to emotion. They're very, very shallow people. They're insecure. They need a buzz. So they go to that church or they go to that group, and they get ecstatic, and I understand. I love them in the Lord, but they're idiots. Okay. It's nice if you can do that. But you, I dare say, have people that you can't put into that little box. They are mature in their faith. They are deep in their understanding of the word of God. And they come to you not waving flags generally if they're mature. If they're waving flags, it's an indication that they're not. But they have what they call a gift of tongues. And so it's hard to reconcile people I know like that and with a theology like that. But if you do have that theology, one of the things you're going to have to do to explain that whole charismatic thing is say something like this. It isn't charismatic renewal that we're seeing. It's Corinthian carnality. Okay? Because basically chapter 14 is Paul dealing with the whole abuse of the issue of tongues. And so this whole thing that we see, this movement, is just a real expression of Corinthians revisited. Possibility. Better consider it. I don't buy it, but it's one to consider. On the other end of the theological spectrum, you have people who say that the gift of tongues are indeed legitimate. And they are indeed for today. Now, in that particular theological camp, you have a whole gamut of opinions, ranging from extreme to moderate. Let's start at the moderate. A moderate position here would say this. The gift of tongues is given to the church by the Spirit of God for the edification of the church, for the edification of the individual. And it is a sign of the filling of the Spirit. It is not the only sign of the filling of the Spirit. But sometimes when people are filled with the Spirit, one of the results of that is that they speak in tongues. And very often that position, I would call it a moderate one, would say there are many people who are indeed empowered with the Spirit of God to serve him in demonstrable ways who don't speak in tongues. We allow for that. But then it gets a little bit more radical in terms of, or extreme in terms of its interpretation. and it says things like this. It is the sign of the filling of the Spirit. And if you don't speak in tongues, then you're obviously not filled with the Spirit. And then there's even one more extreme than that, and it says this. It is the sign that you are indeed saved. And if you don't speak in tongues, then you obviously don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ. And by the way, my opinion is that from that kind of mentality emerges a new kind of legalism. What do I mean by that? See, we always connect legalism with you. Don't go to movies and you don't play cards. Legalism is fundamentally anything I do, and by doing it, I feel better about myself. And I don't care what it is that you're doing. If you're looking to a behavior, and that behavior is what tells you you're okay, that's legalism. That is the law performing. And a mentality that says, if you do this thing, then you're okay, is a legalistic thing, and it will put incredible pressure on people to perform. I think it's clear why I sit on those extreme perceptions. But again, all sorts of variations on both sides, moderate to extreme. But, having given you the theological perspective on tongues and the divergence, the other thing I need to introduce right now as we established the problem is that the gift of tongues and tongues in general is far more than a theological problem. It is very much a personal problem. Let me explain what I mean. I can argue theology and disagree with you and you disagree with me and we walk away friends and everything is great. But something somehow happens with this particular issue. If I speak in tongues and you don't, there is somehow often, not always, because this is handled very often with maturity and integrity and a sense of the Spirit's love, but sometimes, because I speak in tongues, I feel superior to you. And I've obviously got the feeling, and you maybe do, or I'm obviously saved and on and on and on. There's a sense of superiority. But now on the other hand, there are people who are made to feel inferior if they're in certain groups because they don't speak in tongues. But in another group, you've got people who are made to feel silly because they do it. So I feel superior not because I do, but I feel superior because I don't. Did you follow that? I didn't. What did I just say? You see, and our theology, by the way, determines all that. I've got a theology that says the gifts aren't for today. And obviously, if you come to me, well intended, I really have a lot of confidence in you, and you're really a neat person, but you come to me and tell me that you speak in tongues, my theology says that's not for today. What I know for sure about you is that at best, you're really uninformed. That's condescending right now. I mean, you just really don't know what you need to know. At worst, at best you're uninformed, at worst you're really under the control of Satan and he's the one who's motivating all the gibberish that's coming, flowing out of your mouth. And I think that says it pretty well how this becomes right now a personal issue. And people are polarized on this issue right now. There are others who maybe wouldn't find yourself in one camp or the other. And again, as I said, what I've been presenting is pretty extreme. Some of you, honestly, would just come to this issue and say, you know, Dave, I just don't know. I'm confused. Some of you might have even had in your past an experience with the Lord where you began to speak in tongues. And now you're kind of wondering about all that and you're kind of pushing it aside. And you don't know if it's valid and you've seen some things that don't feel good to you and you're pushing it aside. Some of you have been in situations where it didn't feel like a real work of the Spirit. but you were indeed manipulated and you felt pushed and coerced and used and now you're kind of disillusioned about the whole issue not only of tongues but of gifts not only of gifts but of spirituality in general in a relationship to Christ because it just felt so yucky to you and you're backing off the whole thing we got a problem we got a problem when it comes to this issue like we've established that it is theological it is also personal second thing I want to do as we first of all just acknowledge we've got a big ugly thing sitting here. Is there anything we know for sure? Point number two, let's identify what we know. Now, I need to kind of back off that statement and say it this way. I cannot come here and presume that when I say let's identify what we know, that what I say we know is what we think we know. I mean, some of you might disagree with me when I come to you with things that I say we know. You might say, you know that, I don't know that, I don't buy what you just said. So I'm going to say it this way. This is what I believe. I'm just going to kind of go on record concerning some things that I believe about tongues. And you need to know that this is the foundation from which I'm going to be operating as we go into chapter 14. Some things that I believe about tongues. Number one, I believe first of all that the gift of tongues is a legitimate gift of the Spirit given to the church for its edification. The reason I believe that, please write this down if you're taking notes. I want you to know why I believe this. The reason I believe that it's a legitimate gift is back in chapter 12. Verse 8, as he's talking about all the gifts of the Spirit that are given to the church for its building, in the list, right along with everything else, is this one, various kinds of tongues. And also in verse 28 of chapter 12, 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 28, he talks about several things that have been appointed in the church. The word is simply set in the church for its edification. Among them are apostles, second prophets, third teachers, miracles, Then gifts of healing have been said in the church, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues. I don't have any reason to treat that any differently than any of the other gifts that we've dealt with. I believe it's a legitimate gift. I also believe that the word of God indicates to us that this is a gift that will cease. We know that. A gift will cease. It says that right out of the text. Again, chapter 13, verse 8. It says, if there are tongues, they will cease. We know that for sure. I also believe that we know when they will cease. Why do we know that? The text tells us when they will cease. Verse 10, it says this, When the perfect comes, the partial will cease. The partial will be done away. So, when will tongues cease? Tongues will cease when the perfect comes. Are you with me here? Good. Okay, one person is. The perfect, I believe also that we know when the perfect will come. I believe the perfect is not the fulfilling of Scripture, the bringing together of the canon, which is something we mentioned a few weeks ago. I don't want to get lost in that because that's a whole other thing. And if you were here with us these last weeks, you kind of are in tune with that. But the perfect, I believe, is one of two things. Either when I die, and the Bible says, when I am absent from the body, I am present with the Lord, and I will see face to face. And when I see face to face, as is mentioned in verse 12, I will know what I don't know now, and I will see what I don't see now, on and on and on. Or it is when Jesus returns and brings his church to himself eternally in heaven. The point is this. I don't think that text leads us to believe that tongues has ceased. It leads us to believe that tongues will cease. It is a ceasing kind of gift. There's something else I believe, and I want you to write this down. I believe, one, that tongues is a legitimate gift. Two, there is more than one form of this gift. Now, I've dealt with this issue with you before, but I'm going to go a little deeper this time. The reason I believe that there is more than one form, follow this. Several reasons. One, in chapter 12, verse 12 and 28, passages I just read you, it says right in the text, there are various kinds of tongues. Various kinds of tongues means, literally in the Greek, various kinds of tongues. Okay. It's not as hard as we think. Also, I think, now I'm being a little bit more tentative on this, because I don't want to build a whole theology about what I'm going to give you, but it's another thing I want to just throw in here. I believe that chapter 13, verse 1, is Paul giving to us two examples of the variety. Okay? Chapter 13, verse 1. If I speak with the tongues of men and if I speak with the tongues of angels, I think those are very possibly two different varieties of tongues that are given to the body of Christ for its edification. Tongues of men is one of them. I believe that that is referred to in Acts chapter 2, and it happened at Pentecost. It is a discernible language. In Acts chapter 2, verse 8, the word there is that they were amazed because they heard these things in their own language, and it was coming from people who did not know the language. Key here, get this, the word for language there is dialecto. Dialecto, if you want to phonetically write it, just dialecto, okay? And we get our word dialect from it. That particular form of a tongue was a dialect. It was a language. It was assigned to unbelievers to get their attention so that they would listen to the sermon that Peter was about to preach. And it did just that. But then it says a tongue of angels. And as I referred to this when we were in chapter 13, verse 1, I said that it's very possible that this is referring to what some people call a prayer language. A prayer language. Now, Ralph Martin, he's the author who did so many things on the kingdom of the cults and things like that, said this, that this is a phrase, it's a Jewish expression, if you will, that is a type of prayer speech suited to praise and worship. And it was kind of just a colloquialism that Jews would have understood. Just kind of suited to praise and worship. Now, again, I don't want to build a whole theology around that and say there's obviously two, because it says right there. I don't know there are other ways to go with that. But let me add some other things to it. In chapter 14, verse 14, it says this, For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. Whatever this praying in a tongue is, it is different than dialecto. Okay? Acts chapter 2, they were amazed because there were languages, and that was speaking in tongues. And now he is here referring to praying in a tongue, and this praying in a tongue is very, very different from dialecto. It is praying in a tongue. I want you to notice something about this praying. There are some things we know. Verse 16, it says, Otherwise, if you bless in the Spirit only, whatever this prayer language is, it is one that blesses. In verse 17, For you are giving thanks well enough. Whatever this prayer language is, it is two, one, two things. It is one, a blessing, and it is two, giving thanks. Now, lots of teaching here. Hang on. Being fair with the text. He's rebuking them there for something. He's not patting them on the back because they're praying in a tongue. He's kind of correcting them. He's saying, if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful and that's not a good thing. Okay? What is the outcome then? I shall pray with my spirit. That's a good thing. But don't just throw your brains out the window and disconnect your thinking. Pray with the mind also. I shall pray with the spirit, or sing with the spirit, but I'll sing with the mind also. Otherwise, if you bless in the spirit only, nothing wrong with blessing in the spirit, nothing wrong with the prayer tongue. But if you just do that only and your mind isn't connected, how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted, who doesn't understand what you're saying, how can he say amen? How can he say you right on? I agree with that. I think he doesn't understand what you're saying. Just give this a synopsis here. Paul is not blowing them up for having a prayer tongue. He's blowing them up for using their prayer language in the context of the congregation because nobody can understand it and that edifies nobody. Don't bring it here. Verse 17, you're giving thanks well enough. I'm not questioning your motives. But the other man is not edified. Leave it alone. Okay. My point is I'm trying to give you a basis for why I believe there's more than one tongue. Speaking in Acts chapter 2, dialectal language. Chapter 14, 14. We're talking about a prayer language. 14 verse 2. For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Again, when you speak in a tongue to men, that's Acts chapter 2. Remember that? For unbelievers so that they would hear and respond. But here is speaking of another tongue that is not to men, but it is to God. Established. In my mind, there's more than one form of this tongue. Now let's move on to the other thing that I believe. I believe not only is tongues legitimate, and not only are there different varieties of these tongues, and I would probably, just because I don't have any information or anything else, limit it to a prayer language and dialectal. The other thing we need to know, and this is where I really want to grab you, is that while those things are legitimate, there are those things that counterfeit the authentic. There are those things that counterfeit the authentic. And I do not believe that we can afford to be naive about these at all. If we are, it is extremely dangerous. Let me just dive into this by saying this. There are some of us, because of our lack of knowledge, and we just haven't been exposed. It doesn't mean that anyone is stupid. We just have never been taught very often. We have a very small perspective. Some of us have been saved, moved into a place where this is really the priority speaking in tongues. And we get the impression that the whole issue of tongues as a phenomena was introduced into the human experience in Acts chapter 2. It was never seen before. It's not true. Years before Christianity came. Years before the Spirit fell on anybody, filled anybody. people were experiencing what we would call ecstatic kinds of languages. Plato, in his writings, called the Dialogue. Plato, by the way, lived from 429 to 347 before Christ. And in his writings, page after page is committed to his describing ecstasies of speech that were connected to pagan worship. There is a term that Paul uses in the Greek. It's lalenglose, lalenglose, speaking in tongues. we need to know that that little phrase was not invented by Paul to describe what was happening in Acts chapter 2 that was a phrase pulled right out of the culture they saw people speaking in tongues in their pagan temple all the time now it's happening by the influence of the spirit and it's a good thing but not everything you see like that is you better know it the problem with Corinthians was that they had such a premium on ecstasy ecstasy is all that matters that anybody who was ecstatic got a pat on the back. It must be of God. The result in their congregation that some people were standing up cursing God in a tongue and nobody would confront it. Why? Well, it must be of God. If he's ecstatic, if he's going like that, it must be good. No, it's not. Not necessarily. We need a lesson in history. I'm going to give it to you very quickly. The fact is this. As I said before the Holy Spirit indwelt anybody, The Corinthian culture knew about an ecstatic tongue kind of experience. The Greco-Roman world had a multitude of gods and goddesses. And their form of worship involved trying to get in touch with these multiplicity of gods and goddesses. Now, it was common for a devotee in the context of worship to move into what we would call an ecstatic experience. There was a purpose for the ecstasy. And it went basically like this. Their belief was that it was possible, in fact, the aim of their worship was to somehow move themselves into a trance-like state, kind of short-circuit the brain a little bit, and remove themselves from their bodies. You know, just kind of forget about all of this, move myself out of this. And the ultimate was somehow, as I move out of my body, to connect with a deity. One of these gods or goddesses that's floating around in the air. Guess what? Guess what? The sign that you had connected with the deity was? Can you guess? Ecstatic language. See? And in the Greco-Roman world, they called that the language of the gods. Now, let's back off that and just think about it. Do you think that any of these Greco-Roman people who didn't know God and didn't know Christ and were worshiping pagan deities and statues and men made of stone in their attempt to reach a god or a goddess did. Do you think any of them did attempt, did reach a god and connect with a god? No, I don't think so. My theology tells me no. Now, I'm predisposed to believe the only god is God. The only way to reach him is through Christ, so I don't believe that any of those people did actually connect with God or a god. Do you believe, however, that they did speak ecstatic talk. You bet they did. Why? Because the virtue, the goal, and the proof that I have arrived is that I do. Guess what? You're going to find a way to do it. Sound familiar? There is that which is authentic. There is much that is not. The Greeks had a word for this experience of ecstasy. The Greek word for this experience is one that will surprise you. It is eros. now we've heard teaching on that Greek word eros connected with love and eros is a form of love that is basically erotic remember it is sexual the word itself however has a much broader meaning and it isn't just limited to sexual experience as being sensual it has to do with sensual or the senses more broadly it is based in the senses so I would say it this way when I speak of sensual worship I am not talking about worship that results in some sort of orgy. Though, in the Corinthian church that happened, and though in their pagan culture that happened, when I talk about sensual worship in the broad sense, it doesn't necessarily involve sex, but it does involve the senses. Sensual worship is based in the senses. It is focused on what I feel. That is the priority. It is what I experience. It's what I get lost in. You see, sensual worship, you sense it. It's like coming together and going, Oh, wow. Did you feel it? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was great. Feel what? Well, I don't know. You're just supposed to sense it. See, that's sensual worship. And the priority is feeling something. Now, every time I do this, you've got to drive it back to balance. Because as soon as I say that, I could just kind of go on and follow that thought through and just kind of close the door on any expression of worship and praise among us. Lifting of the hands, singing to God, losing yourself a little bit. I believe that worship for the Christian can be ecstatic. It is never devoid of the intellect, though. I will pray with the Spirit, but I will not pray devoid of my mind. So we need balance. Constantly need balance. Many of us have come out of religious experiences where the worship or the experience with God that people had was cold and calculated and correct. And there is something in the spirit of the human being that loves God, that wants more than calculated, correct yuck. We yearn for that. But in our yearning for the experience, we don't short-circuit the brain. Corinthians were doing that. Got into all sorts of trouble. And the authentic gift was being perverted. Incredible confusion. They had dragged every element of their old life into the new. And when it came to tongues, the Corinthians bought the whole bag. Their formula, ecstasy, equals spirituality. Therefore, ecstasy began to be the premium, and everybody was. But not everybody was spiritual, and not everybody was being induced by God, and it was a mess. I want to share some things with you that I dug up this last week that helped me a lot. It's from Stephen Olfert, who brings, from his perspective, three kinds of tongues. And I want to share them with you, and I'm going to add a fourth of my own. three kinds of tongues that help us sort it out there is that experience which is first of all psychic he says, okay, psychic, a psychic experience of tongues the way it works according to Stephen Olfer is this you put people under pressure first of all, you put them in a context where a lot of people are doing something and the way you put them under pressure is that you make them feel inferior now by the way, I think this is especially easy if you get a big group of people who are kind of really moving in one way you're going to start feeling uneasy, okay Make them feel inferior. It's also very easy to do this with people who really are new in their faith. They desire to please God. They love the Lord Jesus with all their hearts. But they really don't know the truth of the word of God. Nobody's come to them preaching who they are in Jesus out of the book of Ephesians. Nobody's come to them and delineated the power of God that is available to them. Like in Colossians, saying to them, Listen, folks, in Jesus is the fullness of the deity in a bodily form. And you know what's the good news? The good news is this. in Jesus you have been made complete. There are no spiritual salamanders where you get your legs later. You got it all. The fullness of the Spirit is in you. Now what we need to do is begin to let that Spirit flow and we need to begin to plug into and surrender to the filling of the Spirit but you have everything you're going to get. And don't go looking around for other things. But if you don't know that you're going to be a sucker for all that kind of stuff. Offer them something that will make them complete. Let that thing that makes them complete be tongues. Bring them into a situation where you put hands on them and they really want it and nothing happens, so you coach it and you start to say this word, bah, bah, bah, say it faster, bah, bah, great, wonderful. And then the spirit falls. I don't believe it. You need to hear something. I don't believe that just because I find it offensive. Listen to the words of Jesus in Matthew 6, verse 7. Jesus is warning his followers, I don't want you to pray the way the Gentiles pray. Gentiles are pagans. That's the reference. He's not talking about people who are trying to sound spiritual. He's talking about pagans, Gentiles. The way Gentiles pray is with meaningless repetition. Now all my life, I've never really dug into that passage, so I kind of just thought that's a real confrontation on people who come into a pulpit and read flowery prayers, and they memorize their prayers, and Jesus is saying, I don't want you to pray like that. I want you to come and have a conversation with me. It's a lot deeper than that. And it is directly confronting the issue we're talking about. The word meaningless there, meaningless repetition, is a Greek word called bata lageo. Bata lageo. Lageo, meaning to speak. Bata is the word that's in front of that, and it is not a word. It means nothing. It is what we call in our vernacular, our English syntax, an onomatopoeia. You know what an onomatopoeia is? Anomatopoeia is like this. A bee goes buzz. And a zipper goes zip. And a plane goes whoosh. And what Jesus is saying here is this. The Gentiles, when they come together, they have these meaningless words that they use and they repeat them over and over to get some sort of neat experience. And they go buzz, buzz, buzz, zip, zip, zip. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. And I don't want you to do that. Bata, bata, bata. And you can, by meaningless repetition, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, move into some trance and then say, wow, God really came to me. Don't be so sure. The transcendental meditation people have what's called a mantra. And what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to kind of hang on to some little phrase that you just pick whatever you want. And with the whole key to getting this Krishna consciousness is saying this word. How? Over and over and over. how many of you have been in a situation when it came to this particular issue where they did indeed do this? Some of you are here, I've talked to some of you, who were indeed turned off to the whole thing because you did get coached. They came and they said, well, you didn't come, so start saying it, say this word over and over and over again. I don't want to offend anybody, I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, but I don't buy that. Though I will give this, I do believe that even in that context that I don't think is good, God could still do what he wants to do and dispense gifts. Some of what we see is psychic. Don't buy it. Some of what we see is satanic. Olford's second point, satanic. This doesn't even take long to develop. Spiritualistic seances, satanic worship, all of it has tongues involved in it. You may not have known that. Common. Shintu priests speak in tongues. Mormons speak in tongues. Animus tribes in the middle of Africa who've never read a Bible, don't know anything about Pentecost, speak in tongues. It's part of their ability to connect with the gods. And very possibly, I think I already mentioned this to you in chapter 12, verse 3, when he says, nobody stands up in the congregation and says Jesus is accursed except by Satan. I believe that very possibly that was somebody speaking in tongues and in tongues, under the influence of Satan, saying Jesus is accursed and not getting confronted in the congregation because tongues was just great. No discernment whatsoever was going on. The third kind he gives is that which is authentic. There is psychic, there is satanic, and there is authentic. And I've already established the fact that I believe that there is more than one kind. I think there is the electo, the language. I also think there is that prayer language. The fourth I'm going to add is this. There is the authentic gift that can be used in an inappropriate way. And when the appropriate or the authentic gift is used in an inappropriate way to exalt myself, I believe that appropriate gift becomes just as illegitimate as if it were psychic or satanic. That is a heavy thing to say. I think that is exactly what the Corinthians were doing. They had been gifted by God. They were twisting it, self-exaltation, look at me, look at me, and it was rendered just as impotent as if Satan had been the one who orchestrated the whole thing. I wish that you would go home and be quiet, Paul says. With that in mind, that that's the issue, that would be a good place for us to dive into the text. But there's a couple more things I want you to know that I believe in establishing our foundation. One other thing. I think that we can know together, according to chapter 12, verse 11, that gifts in general and tongues in particular are, write this down, this is important. It may seem like a little thing, but it's important. They are dispensed by the Spirit, these gifts are, and they are determined by His will. Read it. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, tongues included, and He distributes to each one individually just as He wills. What that means, and the reason I'm making such a big deal out of that is this. That verse helps me spot counterfeits. How is that? Because one of the things I need to constantly know is the one who dispenses these gifts is not a high-powered evangelist. And it's not my will that determines whether I get it or not. It is the Spirit of God who dispenses, and it is God's will that gives it. One other thing I want you to know, everybody doesn't have the gift. And again, right out of Scripture. This is not just... This is right out of our study over the last several months. Verse 29, or verse 30. All do not have the gifts of healing, do they? And the inference here is no. He's trying to make a point that not all people do have these gifts. So quit thinking you're special because you are being used certain ways and not other ways. Because not all have the gift of healings. And not all speak in tongues, do they? The answer, what? No. And not all spirit-filled people speak in tongues. Again, I make a big deal out of that because it helps me spot a false teaching. It helps me spot a phony presentation. That is not true that everybody who's filled with the Spirit speaks in tongues. That's not true. According to me. So, before we even get to the text, one of the things I hope is dawning on you is this. Because of the study we've done the last few months, all I've done is bring all that together, by the way. Because of the study we've done over the last few months, we know a lot more about tongues than we thought we did. There is a foundation from which we're going to dive into our study. We know that the gift of tongues is a legitimate gift. We know that there very possibly is more than one form, at least dialectal and a prayer language. Glossa is the word for that. We also know that there are counterfeits and we can't afford to be naive. And maybe more than we'd like to admit, what we have seen is indeed counterfeit. We also know that God is the source of a legitimate gift, not a high-powered evangelist. It is His will that determines it. It is His Spirit that dispenses it. And it is his body that has benefited from it. Now, let me ask you a question. With all that, what are you left with? Are you left with any kind of feelings about tongues? Maybe you're here and you're going, Boy, Dave, you know, God gave me that prayer language and I've really enjoyed it and it's been a real special thing to me. But now, you know, you talk about all these counterfeits and it kind of makes me want to back off and go, Whoa, I mean, I wonder if what I have is real. I wonder if I counterfeited or if I stirred it up. Man, oh man, I'm not as excited about this gift as I was when I came in. You're kind of taking the wind out of my sails on this thing. Maybe you're on another thing where maybe indeed you did have an experience like this and you were manipulated. You just felt this pressure on you to perform this thing and you did it. And you just don't have any sense at all that it's real. And now today you're real thankful because you've identified for sure that you can let that whole thing go because it was just a crock. It didn't mean anything. maybe if nothing else you're just feeling a little more suspect about the whole issue and maybe I shouldn't make it so important as I have if you're coming away with a little bit of tension about where it fits and what it belongs and where it belongs in your life and whether it really should have a position of prominence that is exactly I believe the point of chapter 14 if that is happening to you then we have brought to your spirit exactly what I think Paul was trying to bring to the spirit of the Corinthians. What had happened to them was that tongues, a gift from God, legitimate, wonderful, had become such a priority for them that they began to see it as the only thing that mattered. And if anything is going to come out of this passage, this text, it's that if tongues is anything, it is at best secondary in its importance. And I want to tell you, even that statement helps me see some things about false teaching in this area and fuzzy thinking. Because there are those who would move on me that that's as if, we act as if it's the only thing that matters. And you can't possibly read this without coming away with a feeling that it is at best secondary. Prophesy. What does that mean? Next week. We'll get into that. Sorry about that. We're going to get into the text next week. Something I want to do this morning, though. I'll just share with you a little bit about what I've gone through, and I just want to introduce to you again. When we were going through the issue of gifts and the working of the Spirit, there was a real exciting thing happening among us, and every time it seemed like we gave an invitation of any kind, people came. And in the last several weeks, we haven't done that. You've probably noticed. One reason was because I didn't always feel like that's what the Spirit wanted us to do. Another reason was a need to maybe back off of that. But I want you to know, and I think it's important that we affirm together, the Spirit of God gives gifts to His church. And He does heal His people. And there is the ministry of the body to the body. And it's a powerful thing. And I would just like to take a moment right now to spend just a moment in prayer to ask the Spirit of God to speak to us about needs that might even be here among us. And I'll just open this altar up for people who need to be ministered to to come. Jeff said something in his testimony that I found interesting and I think applies here. When he heard that evangelist speak hellfire and brimstone, he heard a different message. Remember that? He heard the love of God. We talked here about tongues and it's required some thinking on your part, but I believe that the Spirit of God is able to do ministry that has nothing to do with that message. And it might be moving in you, and I want to just afford us to that. Would you stand with me, and let's pray. Lord Jesus, I ask you right now to make us aware of your presence here. If we aren't already, God, impress on every one of us the fact that your power is here to heal, to heal emotions, to forgive sin, to move people from a relationship with you that is distant and detached to one that is real again. And God, there may be many among us who are very delighted to hear this teaching and excited about it because they learned some new things. But God, there's something deep that needs to happen in people's hearts here this morning that has nothing to do with that. I pray that you would impress those who are lost, that this morning they could know you. Those who are dried up and just need encouragement, that they could come this morning and receive gifts from you of encouragement and faith and building up. And even those, God, who are sick physically could come and be prayed for and receive a touch from your spirit. God, I pray that even now as I pray, you would move among your people. Give them courage and liberty to come if they need to. Just with your eyes closed and your head bowed, I just want to extend that. if the Spirit of God is ministering to you right now, and there's need, and you need to be ministered to, we want to make that available to you. Anyone at all, you come. I'll pray and we'll be dismissed. Okay, Lord, we thank you for your word. We thank you for the balance that it gives to us, that we can come to an issue like this and find some stability. I pray that you would continue, even as we go through this, to bind us together in love. But I pray, too, that when we're even talking about an issue like this that feels real cerebral, that your spirit has moved in people's hearts about heart issues and things where the hard ground needs to be plowed up. I pray that you would indeed dispense your gifts, minister to your body this morning in Jesus' name. Amen..
