Good morning, everybody. My name is Ben Maddox, and this is my lovely wife, Katie Maddox. And this week, we'll be doing the Advent reading. today's reading is from Luke chapter 3 verses 2 through 6 during the high priesthood of Anas and Kephias the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness he went into all the country around the Jordan preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet A voice of one calling in the wilderness, prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight the paths for him. Every valley shall be filled, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked road shall become straight, the rough ways smooth, and all people will see God's salvation. This is the word of the Lord. Well, thank you, Ben and Katie. Let's give them a hand. They've been coming to Open Door for just a couple years. We've become friends. They are beautiful people. Amazing, beautiful, real, raw, real, real, actual people. And I love them. Welcome to Open Door, everyone. You made it. This is the Achiever congregation right here. The 9 o'clock service. That's right. I'm not going to let a little snow get in the way of me going to church, looking down at all the 11 o'clock people or those people that, you know, stay home today because there's snow. So wherever you're at, we're glad you're here. It's good to be together. It's good to worship together. It's good to be reminded together that there is a God. No matter what your week looked like, no matter what your morning looked like, no matter what your life looks like, that there is a God who is with us. I mean, it's just amazing. So as Ben and Katie lit the second candle of Advent, we're moving into the second week. and last week I shared with you two prayers that I hoped would be helpful reminders as we move through Advent and the first prayer was thank you when you get a taste and it's just a taste as Dave taught us several weeks ago it's just a taste but thank you, these moments when God shows up and you didn't expect it and something beautiful happens for which you're really, really grateful could be a tiny thing. You get the phone call that says it's good news. One of your kids returns home after a long time away and you're just filled with thankfulness. Thank you, thank you. But then there's another moment where the second prayer comes in and many, many times I've spoken to many, many people this season where this is the reality they're living in and the prayer is not thank you, it's come Lord Jesus, right? When life is not as it should be, life is not what you hoped it would be, and all you can think to pray is, come, Lord Jesus, please come. You gotta come. My friend Dan Bennett, after hearing the talk this last week, created this, I thought, very cool deal, and so I put it on my lock screen of my iPhone, so every time I turn it on, that's what I see, and it's gonna be there all Advent. It's on our Facebook page, The Door, Facebook page. If you just looked that up, Church of the Open Door, and then like us. And well, you don't even have to like us to get the picture. You can just get the picture. You can like us just because that's cool. Half of you are going like, what does that mean to like someone on Facebook? Anyway, okay. Week two of Advent. I'm going to repeat one of the verses that Ben and Katie just read. Luke chapter three, verse three. You can look it up in your Bibles or your smartphones or whatever you have. But here it is. He that is John the Baptist went into all the country around the Jordan. And did you ever notice this one before? He didn't just baptize people. He what? He preached a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. John the Baptist, I don't know what kind of picture you have of him, but here's my picture that I have of John the Baptist. This is what I think he was most likely like. He lived in the wilderness, and I don't think he just lived in the wilderness. He was the wilderness. He was raw. I promise you he was smelly. If you got within 10 feet of him, you were like, whoa. He said it like it was. He said it straight. He probably had limited social skills. He had a super weird diet of locusts and honey. Probably was very healthy. He didn't care. What he was all about was preparing the way for Jesus to come. And the way he was going to do that was to say to the children of Israel and anyone else who would listen, that there are some things in your life which are not good, and you need to turn from them, and you need to prepare the way for Jesus to come. He described Jesus, John the Baptist did, as someone that he'd never met before, but someone for whom I'm not even worthy to tie his sandals. You guys think I'm a big deal? I'm nothing. The one who's coming after me is the big deal. And so John the Baptist preached a baptism of repentance. And as we move into week two of Advent, the work that we're going to do is preparing a way for Jesus to come. And the way that Jesus comes is through our hearts. And so the preparation that we have to do is in our hearts. So let's check out the next verse that Ben and Katie read, Luke 3, verse 4. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, which were written about a thousand years before the events of John the Baptist. And we quote from Isaiah, a voice of one calling in the wilderness. This is what John the Baptist was doing. Prepare the way for the Lord. And then this phrase, make straight paths for him. It's really interesting that in the time that Isaiah wrote it, about a thousand years before John the Baptist lived, the children of Israel were in exile. The Babylonians were leading over them. And what the Babylonians would do every year, this is really interesting, is they would prepare a road. And once that road was prepared, it was kind of like a parade march. They would carry their gods. And they would just march down that road that they had prepared, carrying their gods for the children of Israel to see as a reminder year after year after year to the children of Israel that your God, what's he doing for you? Our gods are the one to be worshiped. And so this word that Isaiah brings is a prophetic word of dire straits and dire circumstances of what God wants to do, but also the work that you need to do. Isaiah is saying, here's the work that we're gonna do. We're gonna prepare a road, a different kind of a road, a different kind of a path, and God is gonna carry us out on it. Does that make sense? the road that we're going to prepare. And it's our work to do to prepare the road. We're not going to carry. We can't. I mean, how ridiculous is it to think that we can carry our gods? No, our God carries us out of exile. That's what our God has always done. That's what our God will do in the future. Amen? And so John the Baptist is preaching that baptism. What you need to do if you want to be carried out of your own wilderness is you got to prepare a way. And that is your work to do, which John the Baptist is saying, and you need to do it. What's also interesting is the word for paths in the Greek, as it's written in Luke, it was Hebrew in Isaiah, but in Luke is tribos. It means well-worn ruts. Well-worn ruts is the word for paths. So you get a picture of, now, have you ever been in a situation where it's kind of slippery, kind of slidey, but the ruts are in the right direction that you want to go? So you just find your way into those ruts, and then it's almost like you're back at Disneyland, and you're on those rides that doesn't matter what the two-year-old steers. Eventually, it's going to get to the place where it needs to go. Some ruts are really good. Some ruts are even sacred, and that's the kind of rut that we need to create if we want to walk and prepare a way for God to come in our hearts. But the ruts that we create in the wilderness are not like that. They're the ruts that take us in the wrong direction. ruts that are very difficult for us to get out of. And that's the work that we're called to do, that John the Baptist is calling us to do and that I'm calling us to do here in week two of Advent. Because when you're in the wilderness and you're on your ruts of behavior that you've always done, there's no way in the world that those ruts are going to take you where you need to go. And right now, you know that's true. you know that's true so repentance John came preaching a baptism of repentance repentance the word is metanoia it literally means to turn around confession is saying I did something wrong I sinned repentance is saying and I'm turning from that and going a different direction and that's what John came preaching yes first of all you need to name it confess it I'm sinning. It's not right. It's not good. But now I'm going to turn. A few weeks ago, I was sitting with a small group of people and one of my really close friends, dear friends, came in with courage, said, I have something to say to you. And she said this, and I'm sharing this with her permission. She looked at us and with tears in her eyes, she said, I feel like you've turned against me and I feel like you've believed the worst about me. And when she said those words, just a little group of us, it pierced me because I knew she was right. Now, you know, in those kind of moments, you're tempted to sort of say, oh, what do you mean? Oh, no, I'm sorry you felt that way because I never, oh, my goodness, no, I didn't do, no, I wouldn't have, no. But this moment was calling for honesty. It was a really courageous question, really, that required an honest response. And so I had to say, you know what? You are right. And I am so sorry. That was confession. Then later on, it was like in a moment where I was a little more open maybe to God's voice in my life than I normally am. It was as if God whispered, hey, when else do you do that? Believe the worst about someone. And then it was like a movie started playing in my mind about my life. Oh my gosh, I always do that. it just it takes a small thing someone is thoughtless in their words to me or hurts my feelings or does something that treats me as if i'm not the center of the universe which i'm not p.s that was the joke there nine o'clock people if you're going to show up at nine o'clock at least you know engage um No, I get it. You guys are so convicted about your own sin and your own way that you're doing that that you're just so involved. No, the truth is I really was. And it pierced me and made me go, I don't want to be that kind of person that assumes the worst about someone. And I need to turn from that. So there was some confession to people, confession to God, and that's the kind of repentance that is called for if we want to be a people in whom, you know, in our hearts that Jesus really comes and reigns and lives and breathes. We need to prepare. That's our work as we head into Advent. So to help us do that work, we find, I just find this so almost poetic and helpful in Luke chapter 3, verse 5, where we get four pictures, four pictures that are going to help us do some examination of our hearts. and the four pictures is there's a picture of a valley that's filled in. There's a picture of a mountain that's made low. There's a picture of a crooked road that's made straight and a picture of something that's rough made smooth. This is going to help us prepare our hearts and we're all in the same boat everybody. I am, you are, so let's go there together preparing our hearts for the way for the Lord to come. First picture, the picture of a valley being filled in. And when I think about a valley, especially in the time that this was written, valleys for anyone that was mobile, that lived a kind of a life that you had to pick up and go. If you were in a valley, you were vulnerable and exposed to any enemy that would look down on you and say, oh, there they are. We're going to come raid them. We're going to take what they have. So you probably wouldn't want to sit in a valley for that long. But the question for us as we prepare our hearts is this. When you're sitting in a vulnerable and exposed place and you feel empty, where do you go to get filled? Where do you go, another way of saying that would be to get shelter or safety. Where do you go when you feel empty? And do you know what I mean, that empty feeling? It's actually a very good Advent feeling. When you feel that ache of emptiness, where something is not as it should be, where you're upset, you're feeling anxiety maybe, you're feeling like you just got rejected, you're feeling like something that you wanted to have happen didn't happen, and you're sitting in that place of emptiness, that's the place of Advent. That's the season of Advent. That's what Advent is all about. That's like, bing, bing, bing, a big light is flashing on the dashboard saying, you need God right now. But where we go is not God. and we all do it you just pick your poison some of us when we feel the moment just a little bit of anxiety it's to the kitchen anyone ever do that it's like all i want is chocolate and i want a lot of chocolate right now or now maybe some of you aren't chocolate and we're like no i'm more give me give me something salty crunchy like seven bags of chips would be great right now i'm there for some of you it's a different kind of chemical maybe it's a drink or two or more for some of us maybe it's making another list and crossing it off in order to feel control about what's happening to you and what's not happening to you for some of us we just get real angry and big around people where do you go when you feel empty and one way to prepare your heart this Advent season is just to take a little time around that question. Where do you go when you feel empty? And this is where God can be very helpful because it's not like, well, where you should go is you just open your Bible and just start reading and then the emptiness will go away. Has anyone ever tried that? Now, you may get the peace that passes understanding in the middle of your anxiety that comes from God. it's like wow this is so great but the point is not to all of a sudden not feel empty when you feel empty the point is to go to God and be with God and let God say to you I actually am enough and you might need to sit in that emptiness for longer than you want so welcome to Church of the Open Door everyone okay Anyway, the second picture that I think is just so helpful. Mountains made low. The word for made low literally means to be humbled, and so that gives us a picture of what we're going to need to examine. Woo! The elevator's going down into an even deeper level. Are you aware of who you pass by and your way to getting what you want? Are you aware? Are you even aware of who you carelessly or thoughtlessly step over on your way up the mountain to getting what you want. Many of you know I'm a marathon runner, and when I started running marathons, there was really no, you know, like, cool websites to tell you how you did, like, in your age group or in your gender group. It was just like, you finished, you get a shirt, you get a medal, and woo, that's great. But now, because of these little chips that you can wear and they chart your progress all along the course, at the end, when you get back home and you're sitting in a tub of ice, you can open up your laptop, and you can look and see how many people you passed during the race. And they'll tell you. Like for me, it was thousands of people. No, I'm kidding. No, but they'll tell you, here's how many people you passed. Here's how many people passed you. So you definitely want to have, you know, you want to have Pat, right, Chad? You want to have passed more people. Chad's a marathon runner as well. And you don't. Now, what if there was a website at the end of the day that you could go to and it would show you faces of the people that you thoughtlessly and carelessly passed by on your way to getting what you want? I would visit that website, right? No. But what if we could? Would you have the courage to visit? Folks, if you're white, and especially male, and like you have a job, you are among the 2% most privileged people on this planet, and you're used to getting what you want. Black Friday, you know, we recoil in horror when we hear stories of the crazy events that happen on Black Friday, like in Walmart, mace being sprayed and all that stuff. That's just a picture, maybe on steroids, a little bit of the kind of problem that we have because we just think that we can get what we want whenever we want it. And we read these words from Isaiah the prophet through John the Baptist, and we realize if we want to prepare the way for Jesus to come in our hearts, we're going to have to start paying attention to the people that we thoughtlessly and carelessly pass by. You ever sat with someone who, and I'm really, you ever sat with someone who sits in more of a minority group, of a minority group in our culture, and then just ask them, hey, how do you experience people in the majority and in people that have privilege? If you have the courage to have that conversation, what you're going to hear, if they're honest to you, is going to make you feel like, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't want to be like that. I don't want to be the kind of person who has to get what he wants and who just thoughtlessly and carelessly steps over people to get it. If we're going to prepare our hearts for the coming of Jesus, the whisper of Jesus to us is this, every single person on my planet I'm crazy about. Including you. but I don't want you to pass by one of them thoughtlessly or carelessly on your way to the top. So would you put your antenna up and notice people? Psalm 138.6, very encouraging verse. Not. Though the Lord is great, he cares for the humble but he keeps his distance from the proud. Lord, prepare the way for the Lord to come in your heart by just admitting, Lord, there are times when my pride and my privilege gets in the way. So please, God, help me to be a person that notices. Amen? Can we be a community of people, Church of the Open Door, that notices, especially those who are left out? Can we be? I mean, this takes tremendous courage and discipline, especially from the ones of us who have privilege and power. Third picture. Crooked roads becoming straight. I love this picture. The thing about crooked roads is that you can't see what's coming. And they're filled with shadow. And so the picture is poignant for me. Are you the kind of person that with your language, no one can see what's really real and no one can see what's really coming? Where do you shade or hide the truth to make yourself look better? We all do. This is so embarrassing, isn't it? It's just so embarrassing. This last week, I was going upstairs to get something, and Isaac, my oldest son, asked me to get Lionel, his little security object, because Lionel was upstairs. And so I said, sure, and I went upstairs. And this is what happens with me. I just forget, you know? So my mind's just on to something else. So I grab a bunch of other stuff. I come downstairs, and Isaac goes, Dad, where's Lionel? And my response was to get kind of indignant. Well, Isaac, you see that my hands are really full, you know? And the truth was, I just forgot. I just forgot. Now, thankfully, I was in this text this week, so it's just banging around on my mind like a ping pong ball. Bong, bong, bong, bong. And I realize I'm lying to my five-year-old right now to make myself look better. I'm actually doing it right here and right now. Ding, ding, ding, ding. You know, so then I said, oh, Isaac, I'm sorry. I really just forgot, you know. He's like, that's all right, just go get him. You know, like, all right. I've thoughtless. Don't thoughtlessly or carelessly pass me by, Isaac, on the way to get what you want. Kidding. We all do this. Where do you do this? Where you just manipulate the truth a little bit. Most of us aren't huge, huge, grandiose liars. But most of us shade the truth. Most of us manipulate the facts a little bit just to make it seem like, you know, maybe we're a little late to something. And it really was because we left late. You know, it's like when there's snow on the ground, right, everyone knows people are going to be driving slower. Everyone knows it's going to take longer. But when you leave at the, oh, man, traffic is awful. Right. And, like, you left late too, right? Well, yeah, but, I mean, seriously, I mean, it was my wife's fault. I mean, she, you know, she's never on time. I mean, I say, you know, we have to leave at 9. That means we're leaving at 9. That means we're in the car at 9. That means we're rolling out of the driveway at 9. And anyway, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So where do you hide or shade the truth to make yourself look better? This verse in 1 John is also incredibly encouraging. Here's the message we've heard from him, God, and announced to you, God is light. There's no darkness in him at all. There's no shifting shadows. There's no crooked roads. It's all straight roads when it comes to God. 1 John 5, verse 6, suppose we say, and I love suppose, Suppose we say, we all do this, that we share life with God, but we still walk in darkness. Then we're lying. We're not living by the truth. Can we just do a mass confession? Can we just all feel just like we're on the same? Raise your hand if you do this. You're liars. I'm saying you're telling the truth right now, but we're all liars. We're all liars. And we are. We just are. It's time to just admit it and say, please, God, come into my heart and help me say it straight. Help me be a person that doesn't shade the truth because it ends up hurting people. Help me just say no to the crooked paths. Fourth picture, fourth metaphor. The rough ways are made smooth. And the word for rough here is like jagged rocks. the question is, when are you dangerous to be around? I heard audible. When are you dangerous to be around? Like, what are the environments where you're just not a safe or fun person to be around? If you don't know, you can ask the person that you came here with and they can tell you. When are you dangerous? Seriously. When are you so empty or so frustrated or filled with such anxiety or trying to control things so much that you really are hurtful to be around? You know, when you're feeling vulnerable and you go to someone to talk about it, What you're looking for is a soft place to land, aren't you? You know, and think about a person in your life that in those moments where you need to talk, you need a soft place to land. Can you think of someone who's like that? If that person is consistently like that, I guarantee you, he or she has gone through a process where their rough edges have become smooth. Where God has taken them through some humbling circumstances. where they haven't gotten what they wanted, where life hasn't gone the way they wanted it to go, where they've been called out on ways in which they shade the truth. And so the result is a person that just has very little to prove, and they can actually be there for someone. No one's perfect. No one's a saint. but don't you want to be a person like that for the people in your life? I mean, I do. My wife is empty, and I happen to be empty too. You know, because you always like kind of, well, you ever heard someone say this? Well, it's great in our relationship because when she's low, I'm usually not low. I don't know. I don't know any of those real people. When I'm low, she's low. When she's low, I'm low. When we're low, we're low. You know, so then it's like this. Well, who's going to be lower? so that, you know, they'll get, it's like, no matter where you're at, what does it look like to be a person that's a soft place to land, a smooth place to come and be close to? And this doesn't mean you lose strength, doesn't mean you don't say it, doesn't mean you're not telling the truth, it just means you're a safe person to be around, a safe place to be around. So where are you most dangerous? What would it look like for you to open up your heart to God and say, God, smooth those places out in me. Please, Lord, smooth those places out. That's going to be a humbling process, I need to tell you. There's no magic wands in this. God's going to say, all right, well, we're going to, you know, I'm just going to start by you not getting what you want all the time. You okay with that? No. All right. Let me know when you are. Okay, Lord, I'm ready. I'm ready. And here's the good news found in Proverbs 28, 13. Well, it's a challenge, but also some great news. The challenge comes first. People who conceal their sins, they're just not going to make it. They're not going to make it. They're not going to prosper. But if and when they confess, and then metanoia, turn from those sins, here's what's great. They will receive mercy. The greatest news about God is this. We can be so honest about the darkest of our sins as long as we're naming them as sin and saying, Lord, I need forgiveness. It is my fault. It is me who did this. It is my sin and I need forgiveness. And then you get bucket loads of grace and mercy. That's our God. But if you try to hide and conceal and walk away from your sin, there's just no grace for you because you haven't confessed anything. Can we be the kind of people who with a kind of absurd courage come to God with our sin as real and ugly as it is, right there, and say, God, if you don't clean us up, it's going to be dirty my whole life. So quickly, let's remember these four pictures and you can do a little work on your own. Are you a kind of person who, in your emptiness, you go to get filled somewhere? Where is that? Maybe that's something you need to work on this week. Just bring to God. And this isn't morbid introspection. Oh, God, show me, show me. No, it's just, okay, God, if there's something there, I want to know. So would you show me? If not, we can move on. So maybe this is something you need to look at this week. When you're empty, where do you go to get filled? And is there a way in which you need to turn from that? Number two, mountains made low. Are you aware of who you might be passing by in your way to getting what you want? Here's a little clue. It starts with the people you live with. That's going to be the first people you need to look at. Then it rings out to the people that you are around most of the time. Then it rings out to people that are people groups that maybe you do this to, the way in which you think about certain people groups, and then you end up treating them that way. So maybe God needs to do a little work on you with that. Let me jot that down. Again, no morbid introspection, just, Lord, do I have anything there? If not, we can move on. Third picture, where you hide or shade the truth to make yourself look better. And this might require some help. You might need to ask someone that you live with or are around, because, you know, we're, well, I never do this. Well, then you know you do this. You know you do it if you say you never do it. But you might need some help. Hey, where do I do this? Where have you seen me kind of, you know, but then if you just have your antenna up for this, like I have been doing lately, you'll notice yourself doing it just all the time. It's embarrassing. But then you laugh at yourself because you're like, oh my gosh, I could, I do it. I'm doing it again. So Lord, help me. Fourth picture, where are you dangerous to be around? Where are you really not a soft place to land for the people that are in your life? Where do you need to be made smooth? And so that's just something also to bring to God. Okay, God, what rough edge is in me do you need to do some smoothing? And that's gonna be humbling work. It's gonna be a little painful, but I wanna prepare a way for the Lord to come in my heart so the Lord can come in this world, right? We are the people of God called to be and call out the presence of God in our world. And it starts with us. It starts with us. It starts with our hearts. Are we willing to be the kind of people who say, I just am going to stop going to things to fill me up that can't fill me. I'm just going to start to be aware of people. I'm on my way to getting what I want. I'm going to start really asking God to straighten out the crooked paths in my life where I shade the truth and I'm dishonest. I'm going to ask God to smooth out the rough edges in my life so I can be a soft place to land. This is the picture of Jesus in our world, and we are the picture of Jesus in our world. The church of Jesus Christ is the picture of Jesus in our world, and it starts with us in the non-sexy place of our own heart. So, Lord, we confess our sin, and we say to you, Lord, we want to turn. so maybe if there's one thought in your mind right now just one of these areas that you highlighted god highlighted in your heart god highlighted in your mind we're going to take a moment to pray and confess and turn this is just you and god right now stuff there might be work you need to do with other people later on as a result of it but right now it's just you and god because here's the deal in luke chapter 3 verse 6 the verse that wraps it all up here we got a straight road leading out of your wilderness, and the straight road that God is going to walk on after we prepare it is going to result in all people seeing God's rescue, God's salvation. I mean, wouldn't that be an amazing thought that some of the work you do right here in the next couple of moments is going to result in a straight path being laid out for people that you don't even know in Maple Grove, in your workplace, in our city, in our world to see God's salvation. Isn't that an incredible thought? The work that you're going to do in your heart right now is going to help prepare the way for God's salvation to come to all people. Amen? I mean incredible. So let's bow our heads and bow our hearts. So God, we invite you to come. Holy Spirit, come. We're not living in shame right now, God, we're just living in honest confession. There are ways in which we have really, really fallen short in our hearts and in our actions, in our thoughts and our words and our actions. We've done it. It's been us. It's our deal, our sin. And right now, you can just think of that thing that God brought up to you in your mind. And with just the beautiful light of God shining on it, you can look at it and say, yep, that was my sin. Yep, there it is. I did it. Yep, I did it. And the light of God shining on that sin, all of a sudden, it starts disintegrating. And it becomes vapor. And the person of Jesus Christ is standing beside you saying, you are forgiven. You are made new. you're made whole it's done it's finished you're my son you're my daughter there's nothing between us now I'm moving toward you I love you I'll never leave you I'm with you and I'm gonna help you turn from this thing and it's going to be work. There's no magic wands about this. Turning from it is going to be work and you're going to need help. And there the Lord is saying, I will help you. I will put people in your life, if you're willing to be honest with them, that they will help you as well. and to that work of redemption our only response is thank you Lord amen thank you Lord amen Thank you.
