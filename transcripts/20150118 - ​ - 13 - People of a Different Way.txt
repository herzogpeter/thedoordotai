Our scripture reading today is from 1 Peter 2, 9-10, and Ephesians 4, 14-15. But we are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that we may declare the praises of him who called us out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once we were not a people, but now we are the people of God. Once we had not received mercy, but now we have received mercy. Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head. That is Christ. This is the word of the Lord. Thank you, Robin. Let's pray as we begin. For ears to hear what you're saying to the church, for eyes to see where all of it is calling us for courage to respond and anointing by your spirit to follow, I pray. Amen. So we're a people for God's own possession who have the capacity evidently and are expected evidently to grow. No longer infants, no longer children tossed here and there by waves. waves, waves which I take to mean life, that batters us and buffets us and comes at us in waves, waves that sometimes seem bigger than our boat, but we're no longer tossed here and there like children by those things or carried about, second part of that verse says, by every wind of doctrine, not blown around by the wind of what's in the air today by the trickery of people and the craftiness and deceitful scheming, which reminds me, this craftiness, this trickery, what's blowing in the wind, reminds me of what we talked about last week. Living as we do in this world and in this culture that's shifting and changing at a very rapid pace such that the face of things is changing almost too quickly for us to keep up. It's dizzying when you think about it. We don't often think about it because we don't have time to think about it, but things are shifting and changing very rapidly in the culture and in the church, sometimes in ways that, again, stagger us, but it's changed the face of things in the culture and in the church. Fear has changed the face of things in the world we live in. For us, 9-11 changed the face of things. of bombings in Boston did the same. ISIL is a little acronym we didn't even hear about a year ago. It's changing the face of things. Terror is changing the face of things, and we see it every day. We're kind of there all the time. It feels like it's coming at us through all of the technology that allows us to be in places that, wow, we're seeing it happen almost as it is. So technology has changed the face of things, which again is something we talked about last week. And I love the fact that Brian's going to do a class for parents dealing with parents who feel like they lost their kids to their smartphone, that kind of thing. Technology is really good. And it's changed things in some really good ways and bad ways, but also some weird ways. Like the family I told you about last week, whose Christmas letter to us included all the kinds of things that Christmas letters include about kids and additions to the family and career changes and all of that, but one of the things in this letter was that they happily revealed that they had finally found a church they liked in Atlanta, and it confused us, that is, Bonnie and I, because we didn't know they moved. Turns out, as I said last week, they didn't move. They go to church. They live in Minneapolis, but they go to church in Atlanta by doing it online through a computer, and whatever else that means, it means the face of things has changed. and it's all happening very quickly and we don't have time to think so we hear these scary things and we hear these strange things and we shake our heads maybe we laugh and we just move on but it makes you wonder sometimes are we in ways we don't even know are we being carried away by the wind entertainment is change the face of things again we talked about this last week it's part of the wind And it's carrying us away at times in ways we don't even know. I love that quote I gave to you last week by Neil Postman in the book he wrote entitled Amusing Ourselves to Death. Here's what he said, that while everything in our history has prepared us to know and be prepared and to resist a prison when the doors begin to close, who has prepared us to take up arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain about that? and when do we do it, and in what tone of voice do we do it when serious discourse has been reduced to giggles, when a population becomes perpetually distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainment, when serious conversation becomes a form of baby talk. Think Kardashians. There you go. Boom. You don't need to go any further. When it's short, people become an audience, and they're a public business, a vaudeville act, then those people are at risk, and culture death is near, and if he's right about that, then it raises this question. It's a question we've been asking for several weeks, actually, about who we are as a church, and why we're here, what is the church, because the question is this, relative to that, do we have an answer to any of that? Do we have any kind of response? And I don't mean a speech. We're for it. We're against it. I don't mean that. Does the church, by being who they are, offer any hope? Do we provide an alternative to the fear, to the trivia, or have we been carried away by the wind ourselves in ways we don't even know? Back to Ephesians 4, verse 15. But speaking the truth in love, we grow up. into him who is the head, even Christ. He is the head, but if he is the head, who are we? I'm serious. This is not a quiz, but who are we as a church? What is the church? Why are we here? Again, it's the question we've been asking and we've been answering yet. 1 Peter 2.9 answers the question because we're a people. You've been hearing that over and over again. A people for God's own possession who have been called out of darkness in his marvelous light in order that we might be a people who are proclaiming the excellencies of him in a variety of ways. So we have an identity as a people, but we have a mission as well to become the light we've been brought into, having been brought out of the dark, and our mission is to just let this life of God in us shine. So we're a people, Ephesians 2 says, we're a temple. And we spent some time with this as well. A holy temple, to be specific, Ephesians 2 verse 21, made up of living stones. Remember this? We really unpacked this for a while, several months ago. Living stones that are being fitted together by the Spirit of God. And as these living stones are being fitted together, they're actually growing into, we are becoming this holy temple, this holy temple, which is the dwelling place of God, and that is who we are, and that is why we're here, because we are living stones. And because we're living stones, we have the capacity, because we're living, to grow. We have the capacity to grow, thus increasing our capacity as a people, as each individual stone grows in the grace and the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have the capacity together, then, to grow as a temple, thus providing more room. for the presence of God and the working of God because we are the dwelling place of God, which is at least part of why we talk about a radical commitment to spiritual transformation around here because it matters that living stones actually grow. It matters a lot. And I think it matters more the more you get in touch with the way things are shifting and changing and the more you get in touch with the way the winds are maybe blowing us away. Ephesians 5 says it a different way. We're not just a people. We're not just a temple. Apparently, we're also a body. Ephesians 5, you know this concept well, I assume. But we're not just a body. We're the body of Christ, which elicits certain things and certain people were the body of Christ. We're the body. And some people get, isn't that beautiful? But I say, when I hear that, I get intimidated. I'm going, oh my God. We are it. We are the physical manifestation of Christ in the world. The only body he has in the world for people to see who he is, is us. So if people want to know who Christ is, or if they want to know what he's like, they can look at us. Just look at the church. There he is. okay it just makes me cringe a little bit but but kind of hear the cringe this way it's kind of like a family uh and we're comfortable with each other you know it's my family we're comfortable with each other i think of thanksgiving when everybody's there even weird uncle bob you know he's there too and we're all okay with our weird uncle but i wouldn't want company tonight i wouldn't want anybody else to see how weird this is. True story, early days, open door. We had what was called an evening service. We had a morning service, an evening service, and Wednesday night prayer meeting, then a Saturday morning discipleship. And I had to have a different talk for everything. And I really didn't know why we were doing evening service anymore. Some of you come from that tradition. And what's the reason we're doing that? Because it was exhausting. Me, I had to come up with a whole different talk. And the answer I got was, well, we think visitors come then and they might stay if they come okay. And so they would pray for visitors. What they didn't know was that their pastor, me, was sitting on the platform waiting to preach, praying that no visitors would come. God, don't let them come today. I was what in those days you called overexposed and underprepared and sounded stupid most of the time. Not a lot has changed. So anyway, and all that stirs again this question, who are we as a church? what is the church, why are we here? well I just told you, we're a people, we're a temple we're a body, okay, okay, okay but I mean, really who are we? because while we are all that and we are all that, we are a people whether we know it or not, we are the people of God. And we are a temple of the dwelling place of God, and we are the body of Christ, but it's weird. I don't have time to unpack this, but we're more than that. But I don't have time to unpack this either. We're less than that as well. So who are we? Because a church isn't just a church. Remember I said that last week, that a church is a church. How different can they be? Turns out they can be pretty different from each other, even though they're all a church and they all kind of have some of the same similarities. Let me explain that with a metaphor. Because if the game we were playing was baseball, well, lots of people play it. Just like there's lots of churches all over the place, and it's all pretty much the same game. Talking baseball. From Little League to the Big Leagues, from Target Field to Wrigley Field, it's all pretty much the same game. Because we all play this game with the same things. Even in Sandlot Baseball, you got a baseball. It's not baseball unless you have one of those. You got a bat. You have maybe baseball gloves. You have a base, even if it's somebody's shirt, which is what we used to do. That's first base, your shirt. My pants are on second. There we go. Whatever. it's all pretty much there's certain things that are similarity churches have bibles and they have buildings and even if it's a house church that's their building they have budget and baptisms because the church is a church is a church pretty much all the same but if you get a little closer you might find out that from team to team from church to church wow it's almost a different game still have bats and bases and baseballs but there's a real different thing in this team or on that team emphasizing very different things creating very different culture requiring sometimes very different skills some teams are built on speed I remember when the White Sox kind of coined this phrase years ago they played small ball it was all about speed You just dunk and dink and get on base. We'll get you in a second. We'll get you in some way. It was all about speed. We are all about speed. That's the name of the game. Others would build their team around power, striking out a lot, but every once in a while, just when you're ready to go to sleep, pow, out of the park, we win the game. That's how we play it here. For others, the name of the game is defense or pitching. For others, the name of the game is evangelism. that's how we play it here, or discipleship, or worship, or the gifts of the Spirit, or even for some, it's just getting more people in the room, so they all play it a different way. It's all the same kind of game, if you will. It all looks kind of the same, but they all play it different. If you played for the Cubs, let's go back a few years, because this year they're going to be good. Trust me on that. If you played for the Cubs and you got traded to the Yankees, one of the first things you might hear from some of the guys who'd been around a while would be something like this. As they saw you play a little bit and carry yourself in the locker room, you might hear something like this, Dude, that's not how we play it here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the same game, but that's not how we play it here. You're a Yankee. So how do we play it here? It's a question I want to get to this morning, and it's an important question, I think, and it will set us up well for what we want to talk about next week when we talk to you about our vision and where we think it is God's calling us to go and things he's calling us to do and become. But if you wanted to answer that question yourself, without hearing anything from me today about how we play it here, you could actually do it. You could get online, get on our website, because it's all right there in our values statement, which make it pretty clear that we're, first of all, a people who root ourselves in the story of God, which means we are a people of the book, and to use this phrase, it's kind of how we play it here. But there's a lot of churches that would say the very same thing, we're all about the Bible, we're all about, I know, I know, but it really is true, it's how we play it here, we're rooted in this story, which is something that I hope you know without getting on our website, without hearing anything from me, because as you come week after week, you have a sense of things. You can see there's a very high value here in the text, in the scriptures. We hear from God that way when we come together. I love the word rooted. We are rooted in the story of God. It's how the value is stated in our value statement. Like a tap root that from a tree or a plant grows vertically down, picture it in your mind, really deep, from which that tap root branches off horizontally, so you've got it going down deep and then horizontally out, making that plant or that tree really hard to uproot. A dandelion is a word, but you can pull it up by the roots. When the root has gone deep and spread wide, it's really hard to do it. It's actually, hopefully hard. If you're rooted in something, it's hard to blow you over by every wind of doctrine that's blowing in the wind. The image I get of being rooted and then really deep, it allows you as a people, I see a tree in my mind, but it allows you as a people to extend yourself really high. the deeper you are the higher you can go and it speaks to breath as well you can kind of be out there and think some yeah expansive kinds of thinking but if you're not rooted and you're really expansive and you're thinking bye that wind just took you right away I picture something in my mind that is so rooted it's able to go no no no being rooted like that takes time we've been anchoring ourselves as a church as a people into the story into the text for a very long time and it's part of our story it's not just part of our theology it really is part of our story and it's how we play it here like a taproot if you will we have burrowed down and if you've been here with us on the journey for years the longer you've been the more you know We've burrowed down into books like Ephesians. When I first came here, I don't know. What are we talking about? Let's do the book of Ephesians. We did the book of Ephesians in 1 Corinthians, Galatians, Matthew, Hebrews, 1 John, Philippians. I could go on. I think I will. Anyway. Then we learned about the way of the rabbi, this rabbi named Jesus. And we learned about the law that he loved and the sermons that he preached inside of a mountain to a small group of young kids. 16, 17-year-old kids named Peter and John through whom the world would be changed. And he didn't talk about theology, and he didn't talk about church, he didn't talk about religion, he talked about life. You've heard it said, don't commit adultery. Let's talk about your lust. And 17-year-old boys never think about that stuff. That's what they talked about on the site. You see, you've heard it said, don't commit murder. None of you have. Let's talk about your anger. And I didn't expect that from a rabbi. And he got down deep with those guys, and it started to change those guys. But it makes you wonder when I think about that kind of burrowing down into the scriptures, into the story in which we're rooted, how do we keep that going? How do we pass that on? I don't know. So come next week, we'll figure it out by then. You were supposed to laugh at that point. That's right, my notes actually. So we're people of the book. That's who we are. That's how we play it here. We're also a people, second value of the kingdom, and a people of the spirit. We talked about the kingdom of God a couple of weeks ago, the gospel of the kingdom, and try over and over to make that as clear as we know how to be and kind of explain what that word might get kicked around, what we mean by what we say when we talk about the gospel, for instance. Went into that quite deeply a few weeks ago, and we're a people of the spirit. and it's not just part of our theology, though it is. This thing about the Spirit in the kingdom, it's part of our story. It's part of our journey, my background. As many of you know, maybe you don't, it doesn't matter if you do or you don't, but it was all about the gifts of the Spirit were not for today, which built in me a kind of, not only a reservation around the gifts of the Spirit, anything supernatural or woo-woo-y at all, made me really nervous and scared, actually, of those things. but it's, the short story is this, in the early days it began to dawn on us and on me that God had called us to something other than or bigger than just being a big church or building a slick organization. Those little things are fine. When you really dial into what God's called his people to do, which is to help deaf people hear and blind people see and dead people rise from the dead, which is evangelism, you start realizing that I can't help deaf people here by being funny or smart. We're going to need some do not miss power. We're going to need some supernatural manifestations of God's spirit to do what we cannot do on our own. And it built in us a hunger. We followed that thing. And God brought us into relationship with people who opened doors of understanding and experience around the power of God's spirit among his people. and paradigms were changed, and hearts were opened, and our journey continued, and it began to be part of how we play it here, because we're a people of the book, and we're a people of the kingdom, and we're a people of the spirit, and we're a people of grace, which if you know anything at all about Open Door, particularly in the early days, it's kind of what we were and maybe are, I don't know, what's out there. We were kind of known for that's the grace place, which is something I feel really good about. I remember in the early days, there were so many broken people responding to this message of how much God loved them that we got this little moniker, some of you know it, that we were called, it was in the paper actually, a headline, Church of the Open Soar. And some were using that in a disparaging way about us, and I always thought that was a compliment because there was grace here for people who wanted to get honest about their stuff and God could heal it, but it's not just a theology for us. There is a theology behind this, and I could tell it to you, but it's part of our story. It's part of my story. And every time I think of where the grace thing came from, I think of, sorry, I think of my dad. And that story I've told you before where late in my high school years, I was a very angry guy and could not wait to get out of my house and out of the church that I hated because it was all about how things look and nobody could ever talk about what things really were going on in them, including me, which meant a lot of anger in me when one day my dad sat me down, wanted to know how I was doing. Long story about how I trusted him this time when I hadn't before, but this time I did. And so instead of the right answer, which is, I'm just trusting the Lord, Dad, which is great if that's what you're doing, I told him the real thing. and some anger came out and then some more and I vomited on him. The stuff that I had never been able to say to anybody and he didn't correct me and he didn't stop me. He wept. And I was sure Martians had invaded his body who took my dad. But that saved me. I was saved that day. And then I reduced it down to this. This was the end result of that. What dawned on me was this. If my dad can handle the real me, not just the polished, happy me, if my dad can handle the real me, maybe God can too. That saved me. Because I started coming to God the way I actually was. And when I did, I found there was grace for that and healing for that and transformation in that. And we brought all that here so that now, I mean, we don't always believe it, but the truth is you don't have to pretend and you don't have to hide. You don't have to act like you're better than you are, no more than you do. You come as you are, and that doesn't mean we're not glorifying sin. It's just okay. It's not okay. There's a consequence for whatever the sin might be, but there is grace for it and healing for it. There is. So quit pretending and quit hiding and come out into the life and out into the light and come alive, and that's why we're a people of grace. but I need to add this it's grace and truth that we value here grace and truth I've said this a lot because grace without truth grace oh I love you without truth you're an idiot grace without truth is a sloppy kiss from your grandma I honestly I have this picture in my mind I'm 10 years older than my grandma I'm just sitting there going, this is great. She loves me. What I need is a hug, like from my dad, who's also able to say, Dave, I love you, man. But you're an idiot. Anyway. And see, when you have somebody who loves you, but they're also able to speak some truth into you, to call you out, that's how people grow. You need more than a hug. So grace without truth is a sloppy kiss from your grandma. A truth without grace is a body blow with a baseball bat. That's the truth. And I hit you with the truth. Don't give a rip about you at all. Your soul, your heart, just tell you. Fillet you and it's happened to you. It's what the church sadly is often known for. It's grace and truth. Ephesians 4, what we just read. Speaking the truth in love is how we grow up. the truth in love is grace and truth together every time I go to a meeting where it's going to be hard you have the same kind of meetings there's some sort of conflict and I'm with somebody I love I care about the mantra I just go God grace and truth God give me grace and truth and I even judge meetings how they went not by what the outcome was whether I got what I wanted or did I say what I needed to say and did I do it with love did I hang on to love Because a lot of times what gives me the courage, you're the same way from time to time. A lot of times what gives me the courage to finally tell the truth is I'm just so ticked. I'm so tired of this. Pow. And I blow. Ooh. Somebody up. I gave him the truth. But I couldn't hang on to love that time and mess things up. Or I was just so, I just want to give you a hug that I never told him the truth and nobody grew. we need a sword let me tell you what I mean by that Hebrews 4 verse 12 says this the word of God is living and active and when you hear the word of God and I don't mean just a random Bible verse when somebody is bringing to you a word from God the way you know it's a word from God is that it is alive and it is active it goes places in your life and in your spirit, and it's sharper, verse goes on, than any two-edged sword. There's the sword metaphor, piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, able to discern, that is to see, thoughts and intents of the heart, a person with a sharp sword, a people who have a sharp sword corporately, are able to see things relative to how they're really panning out, what's really going on in the realm of the spirit, what's really going on in the realm of the flesh or the physical, and to see what's really going on and be able to divide between that's fluff and that's real and that's substance and that's not, you need a sword. You need a discerning capacity. But if that's all you have is a sword, You don't have enough. If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels but don't have love, I'm just a noisy gong, just a sword that just maybe cuts people to pieces because they're always so right. It's truth and grace. You need both. This came up in our visioning process. some months ago, as a significant thing that we needed to bring and make part of our stated values when we were trying to tell people who we are. That's why I'm talking about it actually today. Because we're living in a day, and you know this is true, that's becoming more and more polarized. In the church, it's becoming more and more polarized. You've got the religious right, you've got the religious left, conservative, liberal, you know the labels that just fly all around. It's happening politically, racially, economically, sexually. And in all of these places, we tend to move to these polar positions. And in those polar positions, we feel safe because we're right about the truth and we're right about love. But there isn't both. On the right, there's a sword. You have truth. That's a sin. Good for you. You spotted it. On the left, there's a hug. It's just okay. It's not okay. we think you need both we call it the third way terms used in a lot of different ways but just know how we use it we're talking about a third way being not just truth and not just love it's both truth and love held together it's how we play it here or want to but the third way is a difficult way it's a difficult place to be because the people here won't like you it doesn't take much to think about and the people here won't like you because you're not loving enough or you're not truthful enough because we're going to be here holding on to that and holding on to that how do you do that? I have a friend and this illustrates the tension of this I have a friend who was invited recently to his niece's wedding which is a delightful thing but his niece was going to marry a woman so it was that same sex gay marriage thing right in his face right in his family what do I do? do I even go to the wedding? there was a time in his life he would have not gone to the wedding how does he make it a statement? he thought it through he thought it through I have some pretty strong feelings about what this is and what this means and what's but I love my niece so he went to the wedding and with all his questions and concerns and I don't know where it was, if it was at the reception or some other place, but some place in between, you know, the ceremony and other things, he found himself alone with his niece and there ended up being a picture of it because as he's alone with his niece, he saw her and there's this, because he loves his niece, he showed up with that. I love you, I just love you. And it was that kind of look in his eyes to her eyes, the two of them alone. And again, someone got a picture and it went where pictures go. Facebook, poof, there it is. Everybody sees the picture. Fine, big deal. Well, it was kind of weird. There was some tension around this whole thing. As my friend kind of was unpacking this whole experience that he'd had, because he went to the wedding, and at the wedding, he just couldn't love his niece more, but he had some questions and concerns about what was happening, because he had some feelings about what is ordered and what is God's design and da-da-da-da-da, and all that kind of stuff. This misses the mark, but lots of things miss the mark in me, He said, I'm here, I'm here. He loved his niece. But the tension was, there was some people at the wedding who were delighted with this wedding and were kind of angry at him because he wasn't happy enough about it. So he was in trouble with them. And then his picture went up on Facebook. And there were some people over here who, why were you at the wedding at all? You should have been picketing. They didn't like him either, and there you are. There it is. so how do you hang on to truth at least what you think is truth and love at the same time well you're going to have to be willing to be in an awkward place so I'm going to love you and maybe we can talk and maybe we can't I'm not going to try to change you but I'm loving you and I'm not moving in terms of what I think is rightly ordered or disordered in my life or yours you know what this preaches I think but we need to have discussions about this we'll talk a little bit more about that next week how we might be able to learn how to talk about things we often don't know how to talk about John 8 is one of my favorite stories relative to this dynamic when a woman is taken in adultery she's caught in adultery know the story and some sword swinging Pharisees who were all about the truth knew that that was wrong. So they picked up stones to do what you do when someone has done what you're not supposed to do, particularly in the sexual arena. We just get really big about that. They picked up stones to stone her and Jesus got between them. I mean, you just see it. You can. You can see her getting ready to die and there's this group of very self-righteous people ready to kill her. And Jesus gets between them and says, in effect, don't you dare hurt her. And by the way, he didn't turn to her and say, oh, by the way, adultery, no big deal. He didn't say that. It's a deal. It's a big deal. But don't you hurt her. I will protect her from you. And then he said the most amazing thing, because he's very smart. Jesus is brilliant. And what he said, don't hurt her. Do your own sin first. That ought to keep you busy. In fact, remember he said, anyone who hasn't sinned, let them cast the first stone. And actually the oldest of the scribes or Pharisees dropped the stone, because the oldest was the one who knew. The young ones, yeah, me, I'm, shut up. and they all left because if you deal with your own sin it ought to keep you busy you actually won't have a whole lot of time to fix theirs and maybe if you do your own sin you know what it might do it might remind you that you need grace that you desperately need grace too just like him and just like her and just like me. And that's how we play it here. And we think you need to know that. Next week, some more on this to unpack what we think this means for where we're going as a church. I'd like you to stand with me as we close. we will have people up here to receive anyone who needs prayer for anything at all but Father we thank you again for calling us to be your people because wow you didn't call us because we were all bright and shiny, here we are and we want to become who you've called us to be. And we want to do what you're calling us to do in this particular time and age and culture where the wind is blowing kind of wildly. We believe in you and we pray you would give to us what we need by your Spirit. to walk in the ways you would call us to walk. We pray all these things in Jesus' name and all God's people said, amen. God bless you as you leave. You're dismissed. Thank you.
