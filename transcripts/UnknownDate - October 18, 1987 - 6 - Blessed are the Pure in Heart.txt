Turn to me with the book to the book of Matthew chapter 5. Matthew chapter 5. Today we're going to be dealing with verse 8. This has been a blessed time these weeks as we have gone through what we have come to know as the Beatitudes, the Sermon on the Mount. We have been in the book of Matthew for some months now and we are just in the flow of our study dealing with these teachings. and I think it's important as we do this weekly to continue to set the stage for what's going on here it's very important to me that you can join with me in seeing yourself literally sitting at the feet of Jesus as he is delineating to the disciples the kind of people to whom the kingdom of God really comes and not only the kind of people to whom the kingdom comes but the kind of people through whom the power of the kingdom flows. We are aware of the fact from our study that all of this kingdom talk began in chapter 4 when Jesus began the ministry that he was sent to earth to do. And that ministry began with these words in verse 7, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The rule of God has come. And the kingdom that he brought was a kingdom of authority. It was a kingdom of power and deliverance and healing. And that authority and power and deliverance and healing was not just something that Jesus talked about. It was a power and authority and deliverance and healing that was demonstrated. And we saw it demonstrated. It became visible to the world in verse 23 of chapter 4. And Jesus was going about in Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom or the good news that the reign of God had come. And he healed every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. And that's the kingdom of God visible. The power of God made manifest. But there was a result of that demonstration of power. The result was this, that the word spread. Something's up and I really like it. The word spread through all of Syria and they brought to him all who were ill and taken with various diseases and pains. Demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics. And he healed them. And after the news spread, great multitudes followed him from Galilee and Decapolis. and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan. And then the result of that was Jesus said, hold on just a minute, because there's something I'm aware of from this multitude and worried about. And that is this, that after people you see, see a demonstration of power and something that's real zippy, I'm afraid that maybe they're coming for the wrong reasons. And so it was in chapter 5, verse 1, when he saw the multitudes and he saw the bandwagon effect. He went up on the mountain and after he sat down with his disciples and they came to him. And remember, disciples is not just the twelve. Maphetes is followers. All the people who were interested in what he was saying, they came to him. And he opened his mouth and began to say to them, in effect, this. I've got some good news for you, multitude, and I've got some bad news. The good news is this, that the kingdom that I bring is a kingdom of authority, and it is a kingdom of power, and it is a kingdom of healing and deliverance, and it is a kingdom that is going to bring people out of darkness into light, and out of death into life. It is going to bring the rule of God to the earth. So everything you suspected is true, but the bad news is this. It is not going to come the way you think. It's not going to be coming to you by grabbing it for yourself. And just because you see the power doesn't mean it's going to be yours. And it's also not going to come to the kind of people that you think. You see, from the beginning we've been hearing this. It is not going to come to the righteous, especially those who think they're righteous. It is not going to come to the religious and the pious, to the performer, or those who have it all put together, who don't think they need a healer. It is going to come instead to the broken, who have come to the end of their striving, who have come to a place where they realize that their only hope is me. It is going to come to, and the power of it is going to flow through the mourning, who, because they have been broken, have come to a place where they've quit pretending about everything being great and slapping on happy faces. And they're beginning to get out here, what's in here. It's going to come to them. And the power is going to flow through broken, mourning people. It's going to come to meek people who, because they're broken, have somehow now become teachable like they never were before and a gentle breeze and a soothing medicine. And it's going to come to and flow through the hungry, who, because they are broken, are now realizing that their own righteousness is pathetically inadequate. and they're now seeking and hungry for a righteousness that is not theirs. Those are the people to whom my kingdom is going to come and through whom my power is going to flow. It is going to come to the merciful who have received mercy because when they were broken, you know what they got? The kingdom. And when they were mourning, you know what they got? Comfort. And when they were meek, you know what they got? All of the earth. And when they were hungry, you know what they got? Satisfied. And you know what that means? They were full. And full people can give mercy. Knowing they're forgiven, they forgive. Knowing they've got grace, they grace. And today we hear these words, Blessed are the pure in heart. For they, and this by the way is in the emphatic in the Greek, they alone shall see God. Let's pray as we begin. Father God, I pray your anointing on this time. I believe that the words I have today are important. But God, the power of your Spirit is what's needed to communicate deep to our hearts what is true. And God, I know in the flesh there is impotence to change a life with words. But God, you, by your Spirit, can take words and drive the words that are true deep into our hearts and break up stony ground. And I pray for this work to be done among us. In Jesus' name, amen. pure in heart one of the things we've been doing these weeks is we've been dealing with these concepts each one of them is i've asked you right off the bat to kind of throw it around in your mind a little bit what is the impression how does it hit you when i say pure in heart what is your first response i don't know about you but my first response to that was it felt a little bit intimidating pure in heart who would have the gall to claim that for themselves yeah that's me that pure in heart guy Dave you know a lot of these other aspects we've dealt with like hunger and meekness and stuff and brokenness we've had a struggle with them and as we've kind of gone together with understanding what they mean the struggle hasn't been whether they're a virtue or not we've all understood that they were virtues but they didn't seem real desirable meekness right off the bed is not the thing that I look at and go that's what I want to be when I grow up is meek you know I mean kind of felt weak. And as we dealt with the concept, though, we began to understand the glory of it and the wonder of it and the power of it. And by the end of understanding it, I think most of us were saying, that is what I want in me. I want to see that in me. It wasn't undesirable for those other things. It wasn't unattainable. It was undesirable. This one, when I look at this, I see it as something that is desirable for me. I want to be pure in heart. But the struggle I have as I approach it is it feels unattainable. who could say that of themselves and if you feel like that right off the bat you need to know you don't have to feel like the lone ranger in proverbs 20 verse 9 the same sentiment is echoed when it says who can say to themselves i have cleansed my heart and i have washed myself from sin the implied answer to that question is nobody can say that i'm going to add something to that as we struggle with this concept. Not only does it feel a little bit unattainable, but you need to also understand, and this just makes it feel heavier, the necessity of purity of heart is undeniable. First of all, I ever read it. It already said in the Greek, they alone shall see God. In order to see God, I've got to have a pure heart. In Proverbs 24, verse 3 and 4, the same thing is said. Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord? Who is going to stand in the holy place? Who is going to come into the presence of God. Another way is, who's going to get into the kingdom? Who is going to see God face to face? What's the answer? You know that passage of scripture well enough probably to know the answer. He who has what? Clean hands and a what? Pure heart. Question, is God asking us to do something we can't do? Is God asking us to do something that is unattainable? And maybe the cry in your heart is what mine was at the beginning. God, is there any way that I can really know a pure heart? That I can really stand before people and say, I know that I've got a pure heart. And not just pretend when I'm saying it, but know it and feel it. And deep within me to feel like even before the Lord, I can stand before the Lord clean and stand there without being embarrassed in front of God and say, I'm here, God. And the reason I'm here is because I know I've got a pure heart. Can we in any circumstance see ourselves saying that? or seeing that be true of us? The answer I have for you today is yes. And there's three things I want to do this morning to deal with this issue that will illustrate to you and unlock the treasure of what this means so that you can say and understand what it means to have a pure heart. I want to deal with three aspects. First of all, the essence of a pure heart, what it means. Second of all, the nature of a pure heart. And third of all, the source of a pure heart. Where does a pure heart come from? What is a pure heart really? Let's start with the first thing, the essence of a pure heart. The essence of a pure heart, first of all, is this. It is internal. If you're taking notes, just write that down. It'll come clear as I go through this. The essence of a pure heart is, first of all, that this is an internal issue. Where do you get that, Dave? I get it from the word heart. The word heart is the word cardia in the Greek. We get the word cardiac. It means heart. And in Scripture, one of the things we need to understand is that that word heart, cardia, is always used to refer to internal realities. As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. Many men look at the outward appearance, but God looks at the what? The heart. It's an internal reality. Purity of heart is calling for an internal purity before we talk about anything else. Proverbs also says this, keep your heart right. Guard your heart. Keep watch on your heart. Be careful about what your heart is going through. The reason is this, for out of the heart flows the issues of life. What is going on on the inside eventually is going to come to the outside. And what I care about the most is what's going on on the inside. It is interesting to me and exciting to me to realize that among the very first words Jesus said when he was describing the kingdom of God and the kind of people who are in the kingdom was that he said this right off the bat. The relationship with God, I want to make very clear, is an issue of the heart. The realities of kingdom life come down to an issue of the heart. The reason I find that exciting, by the way, is this. As I consider whether or not I've got a pure heart, one of the first things I am aware of is that I've got feet of clay, and I think of all the inconsistencies in my life. But you know, one thing I know about me, and maybe you can say this about you too, But one thing I know about me, with all the inconsistencies, I know one thing about me. In my heart, I love Jesus with all my heart. Already, knowing that this pure in heart thing that feels so intimidating is an internal issue, makes me feel like I can warm up to this a little bit. What's going on on the inside? I am interested in the outside, God would say, and behave your matters. But the bottom line for everything is what is going on on the inside? What is pumping through your veins, people? Something else you want to note here as we just understand that purity of heart is initially an internal issue. We need to understand this. Hear this. It has always been that way. A relationship with God from the beginning of time has always been based on an internal heart condition. The reason I want to make a big point of that is this. I think we get an impression from time to time that things changed when grace came. Well, things obviously did change when grace came, but what I'm driving at is this, that we have this idea that in the Old Testament, what really mattered was the external law and performance, performance, performance. And what matters now under grace is the internal stuff. What you need to hear is that from the beginning of time, the internal stuff is what mattered. Every verse I read you, from the heart flow the issues of life. Man looks on the outward appearance, God looks on the heart. All of those are Old Testament verses. Even the Mosaic law that God gave started with love the Lord your God. Love your neighbor as yourself. Internal qualities. A relationship with God from the beginning was an issue of the heart. Not an issue of performance. But you know what? One of the problems for people then and people now is that the only thing that God really cared about was very often the one thing that people couldn't do and didn't do and didn't really want to do and that was to really come to a place where in their hearts, in their spirits, they loved God with all their hearts. And not being able to keep that law that was the only one that really mattered, you know what they began to do? They began to create for themselves laws that they could keep. Like what? Well, like washing hands. See, I don't need to have a good heart to wash my hands right and look very spiritual when I do it, ceremoniously. Now, that's not a thing for us, but that was a thing then. Going to the temple many, many times. Now, I don't have to have a good heart to do that. And so I make up all these little rules and observing the Sabbath and making sure it's holy. And that's a good thing. But now the thing I do is I can go to the temple and I don't have to have a good heart. I just go to the temple five times a day, ten times a week. How many times? Who knows? Praying loud and long in front of people. And I can wear nice robes with real fancy things that make me look very, very pious and very, very spiritual. And the glory of all of that is nothing has to happen to my heart as long as I look on the outside good. And I can tithe, and I can tithe dill and mint and cumin, and that's what the Pharisees did. Their tithing and their sense of spirituality was so drawn from all the things they did. that it got down to that. Dill and mint and giv were seeds. If I get ten seeds, I'm giving one to God. And that's something I can do. I don't have to have a right heart to do that. All I've got to do is find all these rules. And so people in whom the heart was not warm toward God created for themselves a plethora of rules and codes that they could do. But you know what the irony was? They couldn't even keep those. They couldn't even keep those. And so even the Pharisees, by the time Jesus came, were saying things like this. You know, even our codes we can't keep. So you're doing good if you just find one little law and keep that one. You find one little rule and you keep that one and God will be okay with you. And they started feeling real self-righteous because they did tie dill and mint and cumin. And they did wash their hands just right. And the result of all of that external stuff from the beginning, beloved, was comments like this by God to people who pretended to be His people. Isaiah 29, verse 13, hear these words. God is speaking here to the people of Israel who would be the church of the Old Testament. He says this, these people honor me with their lips, but I've got a problem. You see this? I like being honored with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. To paraphrase that, we've got Dr. Taylor here today. He'll appreciate this. I think paraphrasing that, he's saying this. I wish like crazy they would just shut up and give me their hearts back. I really don't think Dr. Taylor would say it that way. I don't even know if God would say it that way. It goes on in that passage. He says this, In vain do they worship me, and I am tired of their many words. I want to tell you something. God is saying here, I hear their words, and they honor me with their lips, and they're doing good things because they come and they worship me. There's a problem, though. It's in vain that they worship me. Isaiah, again, this is Old Testament now. The problem isn't that they're not doing religious things. The problem is they're doing religious things, but I don't have their hearts, and I know it, and that's the only thing I care about. because when I got their hearts, out of the heart flow the issues of life. If they love me, I'm not worried about obedience. Obedience is going to come. But I am not impressed with external compliance at all. And you know what? That didn't change. When Jesus came, he began to confront the religious system that looks much like the one we see today. And he said this to those who are part of the religious system who looked very good, keeping all these external laws. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees. I'm in Matthew 23, verse 23. You tithe mint and dill and cumin, but you've neglected the weight of your provisions of the law like justice, mercy, faithfulness. These are the things you should have done without neglecting the others. You're blind guides. You strain at gnats and you swallow camels. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees. You're hypocrites. You clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of robbery and self-indulgence. Listen to this. You blind Pharisee, first what you need to do is clean the inside of the cup and the inside of the dish so that the outside of it may be clean also. That, by the way, that verse right there is a synopsis of the whole message of grace that is pounding forth from this pulpit. Week after week after week. External compliance is not impressive. We want the heart, and from the heart the outside becomes clean. It's always been an issue of the heart. From the beginning. You need to hear something and know this, that the Israel that Jesus came to was characterized by oppression in more ways than one. There was what I would call in the land of Israel that Jesus came to as Messiah, a political oppression. That political oppression was characterized by Rome, who had them under their thumb. There was also a financial oppression going on in the land at that time. That financial oppression was illustrated in abject poverty. There was also, however, in this land something that we can, I believe, identify with, and that is this, spiritual oppression. That spiritual oppression came from legalistic Pharisaism. And in that same chapter, by the way, Matthew 23, verse 4, Jesus is speaking of the Pharisees to other people, and he's saying this of them. The problem with them is this. They tie up heavy loads and lay them on men's shoulders. What are the heavy loads? all the external things you've got to do, and all the ways you need to make sure you're washing your hands just right. They put these weights on their shoulders. But the problem with the Pharisees, he says in that verse, is this. They don't even lift a finger to help them remove that load. And one of the things, by the way, that is veiled in that particular verse is this. The Pharisees put the big weight on people, and it results in shame, and they don't do a thing to remove the weight. You should be doing that. You should be doing that. Heavier, heavier, heavier. The veiled thing there is this. Jesus, I, the Messiah, have come to do something about that weight, and that is to remove the weight. Forgive their sin, give them a new heart from which real holiness will flow, not measured by how you wash your hands. By the way, an oppressive legalistic system like that produces three kinds of people, real quickly. First of all, it produces arrogant people who wash their hands just right, who go to the temple all the time, who memorize the verses all the time. Nothing wrong with memorizing verses. But that's where they get their self-esteem, you see. You ever been around people like that? They are intimidating. And they are oppressive. When you're around people like that, there's something in mind. And I can tell. It's like a radar I've got up. As soon as I'm around someone like that, I'm very careful of what I say and how I say it and how I talk and dot my eyes and all that because I know that they're going to judge me if I say it wrong. It creates arrogant people who, because of their little laws, they feel like they're keeping them well. It also creates angry people. Angry people who never feel like they do fit in, who are constantly feeling oppressed and judged by these arrogant people. And basically what they're saying to all the God things in their lives are this. Get away from me. I don't want any God talking this house. You've met people like that too. There's another kind of person that this system produces. It's tired people. Who are like this. Who've got the weight on their shoulders. And all that performance stuff. Weighing them down. And you know what? Way down deep in their heart. There is a heart for God. And there is a desire to obey. But the whole thing has been given an external focus rather than an internal one. And the external focus is just wearing them out. That is the society that Jesus came to. Guess which group of the three had ears to hear the message of the kingdom of God? The tired people. Remember Nicodemus? John chapter 3 verse 1. Nicodemus in that verse, chapter 3 verse 1, is described as a Pharisee. More than that, he was a teacher. more than that he was a ruler and in the Greek what is indicated by ruler is he was the ruler so he was top dog somewhere Nicodemus was I would compare him to an elder in a church but you know what else is true about Nicodemus? Nicodemus was one tired guy who had a heart for God but was weighed down by all this external stuff and he came to Jesus and you know what? he saw something in Jesus that he did not see in himself what was that? power authority and Nicodemus even though he hadn't verbalized it yet, had come to a place where he saw that even though I'm keeping all these little codes and I'm washing my hands just right, it doesn't bring peace to me. It doesn't bring power to me. I don't see God, but when I see this guy over here, I see God. I see power and authority. And so he came to Jesus and he asked this question, what do I need to do to be part of the kingdom? What's the one thing I need to do? Again, that's kind of the voice of a person who has got all these laws and all you need is one thing. What's the one thing? And Jesus began to speak to him in weird kind of language. Nick, it goes like this. You need to be born again. You need to start over. Language like that confused him. It would have confused you and I. Jesus went on and said, you need to be made new by the Spirit. Okay, that's really nice. Thank you very much. Verse 5 and 6 of John 3 says this, Nicodemus, unless you are born of water and unless you are born of spirit, you will not enter the kingdom of God. And Nicodemus, that which is born of flesh is flesh. You know what that's an allusion to? All his flesh he's trying to be spiritual. Nicodemus, what's born of flesh in your effort is just going to result in flesh. That's all it is. But what is born of the spirit is spirit. and don't marvel Nicodemus when I say to you you must be born again the wind blows where it wills and now he's off into another place you know I don't know what this weird talk is it is kind of weird talk and I've even read that before and go I'm sure that's really nice what does that mean essentially he's saying this Nicodemus kingdom life is not a matter of flesh effort and external conformity it is an internal transformation by the spirit of God indwelling you and maybe one day you'll understand it. We don't know if Nicodemus did or not. The point of what I'm trying to say is this. Kingdom people are not a bunch of people who've learned and conformed to external codes. They have been transformed internally by the Spirit of God. I say all of that to simply say this. The essence of a pure heart is this. It's internal. It's internal. Point number two. The nature of a pure heart. The nature of a pure heart, write this down if you're taking notes, is unmixed. It is unmixed. Where do you get that, Dave? from the word pure. The word pure in the Greek is the word katharizo, and it means literally unmixed, undivided, unadulterated, sifted, genuine, real. It has no added mixture, no foreign element. It is pure. So, a pure heart is a heart that is unmixed. It is undivided. A pure heart is an unadulterated heart. It is a genuine heart. It is a real heart. It is a heart that says, God, I belong to you. It is a heart that says, God, you are my source and I have no other source. There is no mixture of looking to you but looking to this too. I have an unmixed heart that says, God, my only hope is you. Ironic, isn't it, that broken people talk like that? Because they've come to an end of themselves and they've given up on trying to get life from anything else and they say, God, my only hope is you. Unmixed, pure. You are my God. You are my king. I have no other gods before you. I am not going to look to my kids anymore. I am not going to look to my house, my ministry, my wife, my husband, anything. You are it. Unmixed. Pure. And you know what I know about unmixed, undivided hearts? From those hearts flows the reality of pure living, holy living. And it isn't about this. It flows from a pure heart. that's unmixed toward God. Number three, the source. And this is really the meat of this here. See, what I want to know after I've seen the essence of it as being internal and the nature of it as being unmixed, where does a pure heart come from? How is it established in me? You want to know something? That was the question of Nicodemus. How can I have a pure heart? That was the question of the rich young ruler who came and said, essentially, how can I have a pure heart? How can I come before God? That was the question of the prostitute at the well who basically needed to know this. How can I have a pure heart? First thing I want you to know is this. You can't crank it out yourself. Again, I refer to what I said at the very beginning, Proverbs 20. Who can say to themselves, I have purified my heart? Nobody. You can't do it yourself. But there's three things about this that are thrilling. First of all, a pure heart is received by faith. Write that down. A pure heart is received by faith. What does that mean? It means this, in Acts chapter 15, verse 9, a debate was raging in the new church that had been established. And the debate was this, as to whether Gentiles who had not been circumcised could really be saved. You see, they didn't have this external thing yet. They didn't wear the robe right. They didn't understand how to wash their hands, and they weren't circumcised. And we're not sure, you see, because they don't have that little external sign, whether they can really be seen as being in the kingdom. And Peter said these words in verse 9, I don't care about the external mark. What I know is this, that God who knows the heart has given to those Gentiles the Spirit of God. And what I know is this, God makes no distinction between them and us who've got all these externals because God judges the heart. And the reason I know that they have a pure heart is that by faith they have been cleansed in their hearts. God gave them the Holy Spirit. And when he gave them the Holy Spirit, he cleansed their hearts. How? By faith. Faith in what? 1 John 1.7 says faith in what? 1 John 1.7 says faith in this, that the blood of his Son cleanses our hearts from all sin. You know, this is just a basic little lesson in how do people get saved? How do they get redeemed? Step number one. in receiving a new heart, in knowing the reality of a new heart, is by faith receiving the washing, receiving the cleansing, receiving the forgiveness, receiving the grace, letting it in, accepting the gift, and letting the water of that forgiveness wash over you. Zechariah 13.1 says these words, In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of Israel, and that fountain that's going to be opened will wash away every sin and create a clean heart. Ephesians 1, 7 says this, In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins. That, by the way, is just where it starts, though. I got good news coming right behind that. That's where it starts. It is received by faith. But you know what? You're not left on your own after that. It's received by faith. I don't know about you, but that kind of receiving it by faith stuff feels kind of bleee stuff. The second thing that happens in establishing a pure heart, it is not only received by faith, it is implanted by the Spirit. It is implanted by the Spirit. Write that down. When by faith in Jesus Christ I receive the gift of Christ, I literally have implanted into my life by the Spirit a brand new heart. There are no words that I can use to express the power of that and how real it is. Literally, I get a new heart. Not by trying hard to get a new heart. When I receive the gift of forgiveness and grace, God gives me the heart. I want you to turn with me to Ezekiel 36. I want you to see these words with your mind. Ezekiel 36. It's where your pages are the whitest. Verse 25 of Ezekiel 36. And God is speaking to the prophet Ezekiel who is looking for a redeemer. And he's telling him what the redeemer is going to do when he comes. This is what I'm going to do. I will sprinkle clean water on you. and you will be clean and I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. Moreover, better than that, I am going to give you a new heart and I am going to put a new spirit within you. You're not going to be able to do that. I'm going to do that. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and I will cause you to walk in my statutes. Did you hear that? I will cause you to walk in my statutes. and you will be by my spirit in you causing you to walk in my spirit in my statutes you will be careful to observe my commandments why? because there's an external law out here? no because there's a brand new heart in here that is redemption that is transformation Hebrews 10.16 says essentially the same thing this is the covenant I will make with them after those days says the Lord I will put my laws on their hearts and on their minds I will write them. You need to get that. The reality of what God does is literally plants a new heart and that is why kingdom people are not just a bunch of people who have learned the rules and follow a code and know doctrine and do the right behavior. They've got a new heart. They've got a new heart planted by the spirit. You need to hear something. I believe that the curse of the church and I believe with all my heart that the reason for much of its mediocrity and much of its impotence and much of its stumbling is that many of us, even in the evangelical circles, have taken the grace of God, which is an internal issue, God giving a new heart, received by faith, and giving it an external focus. And the result of that for many people has been that we have got churches and schools and youth groups and sometimes even pulpits filled with people who have externally conformed to the gospel but have never been internally transformed by it people who have been transformed by the spirit of god because by faith they have received the gift receive a new heart and that new heart results in something you know what it is a new desire and it isn't something you work up it's something that is the result of the spirit implanting a new heart and removing the heart of stone And that leads me to my third thing. How do you get a pure heart? One, it's received by faith. Two, it's implanted by the Spirit. Three, it's affirmed by your own will. What do you mean by that? What I mean by that is this. The question might be asked, having received by faith salvation, and many of you are in that category, you know you've done that. If that happened indeed to you, you have been given a new heart. That's just a fact. That's just a fact. But you might ask yourself the question, Dave, how do I know I've got a new heart? How do I know I've got a pure heart? You know how you know? Because your own will will affirm the fact that you do. You know why? Because when that spirit comes, he's going to change your desires. Again, it's not this. In fact, if it's this, I'm not sure you've got a new heart. That new heart that is implanted by the spirit creates and brings with it a new desire. Psalm 37.4 says this. You delight yourself in the Lord. And you know what he's going to do? he is going to give you the desires of your heart you like some of that it's your life verse you know what you think it means if I delight myself in the Lord and I'm really really good he'll give me that bet that I really really want ah so much deeper than that the glory of that verse is this you delight yourself in the Lord and you receive the gift from him you know what he's going to do for you he's going to plant in you a new heart and you know what that new heart is going to do it's going to have new desires he is literally going to give you the desires you're going to see about yourself that you used to desire that and now you're going to desire this and by the way it doesn't mean you won't ever stumble again please know that there will be times when that old lifestyle pulls at you but you know what the new heart has as its desire and main desire to please God and love him and serve him and that wasn't there before Psalm 27 8 I like this this is David speaking and he says this and this is an expression of I think a pure heart he said this when thou didst say to me seek my face my heart said I will seek your face why would he seek his face because there's a rule that says you got to seek his face no he said this my heart said when you said seek my face my heart said I want to do that I want to do that you know why because he had a heart after God that's why the mark of the redeemed the mark of kingdom people is that they have received by faith pure hearts. It has been implanted by the Spirit and it is affirmed by their own will and new desire. Titus 2, 11 to 13 comes into our lives and says this. The grace of God has appeared to all men and the grace of God that appeared to you when it came to you, it began to teach you things. What did it teach you? That denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live how? Soberly, righteously, godly in this present world looking for the glorious hope, Glorious appearing of a great God and our Savior, Jesus Christ. And you know what? That verse falls on the ears of people who haven't received a new heart, and maybe they respond this way. I really should live godly. I really should try. And it falls on the heart of people who have been given a new heart, and they hear this. When thou saidst to me, denying ungodliness, worldly lusts, live soberly, righteously, godly in this present world, my heart said, I want to do that. I want to do that. That's what I want. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speech be put away from you. And people with a new heart say this. When thou saidst to me, let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor, my heart said, I want to let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor. Why? Because I got a new heart, a new desire. Sometimes you fail. But the desire is there. Be kind, tenderhearted. When thou saidst to me, be kind, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, my heart said, I want to be kind, I want to be tenderhearted. By the power of the Spirit in me, I want to be kind. Why? Because you've got a new heart. All the imperatives of Scripture to the believer are a matter of getting what's on the inside to the outside. And I need you to say this too, I've already said it, but you don't always do it right. And sometimes you fail. In fact, you need to understand that that is not even sometimes the issue. In Romans 7, we hear Paul say this, In my heart, I joyfully concur with the law of God. You know what? That is the mark of the redeemed. In my heart, I joyfully concur with the law of God. But sometimes I do the very thing I hate. Redeemed people, people with a pure heart, don't always do it right. But the desire of their heart is to do what God wants them to do. The mark of the redeemed is not that they always do it right. There is a process of sanctification. But I will say this, and hear this. If obedience to God goes against your heart, if it goes against your heart, you need to consider the possibility that you are not a kingdom person at all. Why? Because kingdom people, having received by faith the gift, have had a heart planted in them by the Spirit, and that new heart is affirmed by a will and a desire to do the will of God. They don't always do it, but they want it more than anything in the world. David is a classic example of that. Called a man after God's own heart. Seeking after God's heart. And yet if anybody failed, it was him, and you all know that. But you know what David did when he failed? He said things like this. When I kept my sin quiet and hidden from you, my bones waxed old within me, I dried up, I died. Why? Because no matter where David went, and no matter what he did, you know what he couldn't get away from? His heart. His heart that really did belong to God, bottom line. You know what's interesting? I want you to get a picture here. A contrast between people like Paul who said, In my heart I joyfully concur, but sometimes I do the very thing I hate. And then with David over here who said, My heart is fixed on thee, O God, but at the same time fell into sin that was terrible. Would you consider the possibility that the contrast between those kind of people and Pharisees is really interesting? Because it's very possible that Pharisees, who were so reined in and tight about all their behaviors, never did do the things that Paul did and maybe the things that David did. But you know the problem? They never did have a heart for God either. And those who looked so good and spiritual were on their way straight to hell. God is saying this, I'd rather have a prostitute whose heart is mine than a stumbler whose heart belongs to me than someone who looks so good but whose heart has grown cold. A pure, unmixed, undivided, genuine, holy heart. Beloved, it's received by faith. Have you done that? Some of you have. Some of you haven't. If you have, you need to know something about yourself. You've got a new heart. When you received the gift, you got planted in you a new heart. And it's been affirmed by your own will. It doesn't mean you haven't stumbled. But you know what? there are some here who are indeed believers to whom the reality of a pure heart still feels distant. It isn't real. And the reason is is because just plain sin has crept in. You have a bondage on your life. There is a bondage of the evil one who has bringing enticements into your life and drawn you away. And even though way down deep inside there is a commitment to God, there are all these other things that pull to you. And there needs to be a cleansing. And I would add to all these other things I gave you, received by faith, implanted by the Spirit, affirmed by the will, but I think over and over as believers we need to come to God and say words like this. God, I want to ask you to do something in me. I know that I'm redeemed, and I know that I'm a Christian, but I want you to cleanse me again. I want you to, for real, not for salvation, but I want you to make me pure on the outside as well. And I want you to search what's going on in my life so that you can reveal even to me those things that are hindering the authority in my life and hindering the power of the kingdom flowing through my life. And see, I think part of having a pure heart is a choice that I make that gives the Holy Spirit access to my heart. And beloved, I know what that feels like. I know what it feels like to sit down there or stand up here and know that I am putting a wall up to the Spirit and say this, you can't touch that. I'm not letting you into there. but then I hear the heart of David who said this God I want to give you access to my heart and what I want you to do is put the spotlight of your spirit on me I want you to put the spotlight of your spirit on me search me know my heart I open my heart to you see if there be because I can't always see see if there be any wicked hurtful way in me Psalm 51 he said this create in me a clean heart renew in me a steadfast spirit restore to me the joy of my salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit sustain me with an I will when I hear I will spirit why? because thou dost desire truth in the innermost being blessed are the pure in heart search me oh God and know my heart blessed are the pure in heart for they alone shall what? see God when? in eternity? you bet now? you bet now now how many of you upon being broken and upon having the spirit come and speak to you and reveal to you that you need a cleansing have in your worship literally seen God. Not a picture, but you sense the presence and the power of God. Blessed are the pure in heart who open their heart and give continual access to the Spirit to purify. We're going to have a time of worship right now. And the worship team is going to come. And we are going to sing together a prayer. And it was the one I just read. Search me, O God, and know my heart. See if there be... Would you... See, these words are the things of which revival are made, beloved. when God's people open their hearts and say and mean it God I give you access to me turn the spotlight on me God begins to move and you want to know something? He's going to do it. He's going to do it. When Satan harasses you by the way you need to know this and he's bringing all sorts of things the conviction you feel is a shaming guilty thing and you can never put your finger on what's wrong. You need to identify when you can't figure out what it is that you feel lousy about most of the time that's Satan accusing you with lies. When the Spirit of God comes and you open your heart, he will not be vague. He will put his finger right on the issue and you will know. And beloved, as we sing, I want you to stand in just a minute, not yet, but as we sing, this altar is open. And as the Spirit of God moves among us, I believe that some of you are here and you are experiencing these words and hearing these words for the first time. And you need to receive a new heart. and let the Spirit of God give you a brand new heart and that is for salvation. We want you to come. There are others among us who are believers who need to be cleansed. And as the Spirit puts his finger on it, we want you to come. And as you come, we'll find people to minister to you. Some of you will need to be alone. But this altar is open. Thank you.
