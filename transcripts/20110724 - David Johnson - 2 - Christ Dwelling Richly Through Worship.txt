Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Colossians 3.16, which as many of you know is the text that we began to deal with last week. We are again dealing with it this week in the broader context. We're studying the book of Colossians. It says this, to the Colossians who, as you know, were living in the context of a culture because they were living under the shadow of Rome that was both religiously and secularly very confusing and sometimes even scary. Because of that, he says to them, among other things, this, let the word of Christ or the words of Christ revealed to you in the word of God richly dwell within you. To dwell, the Greek word there is oikos. It means house. To richly dwell means to let these words of Christ settle down and be at home in you. Here's how with teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And so open door. I said last week, if you are here again, you might remember at the end of the service, I said this, because we live in a similar culture to Colossae that is confusing and sometimes even frightening. We need to be doing everything we can as a church to create an environment where the words of Christ that are revealed to us in the Word of God are central to our life as a community so that they can, in fact, richly dwell in us, find their home in us, and be at home in us with all wisdom. And because one of the primary ways that the words of Jesus actually begin to dwell richly in a community, because one of the ways that happens is through teaching. We talked last week a little bit about teaching and Paul's admonishment to Timothy in that regard to be absorbed with these things. The words of Jesus and the word of God be preoccupied with this, take pains with these things because the words of Christ as revealed to us in the word of God are among the most effective tools we have in helping people, whether it's 2,000 years ago in Colossae or in our day living in Maple Grove, the words of Christ dwelling richly among people is one of the most effective tools we have in helping people navigate their lives, the context of a culture that's confusing and sometimes even scary. But it's not just the words of Christ. I said last week, the need to richly dwell, it's Christ himself. who needs to richly dwell among us, who needs to feel at home among us, which raises this question that we began to deal with last week. How do we, as a community, how do we as a church, create an environment where beyond the words of Christ, richly dwelling, Christ himself might richly dwell. That Christ himself might settle down and be at home, which might sound like an odd thing to say. I mean, would Christ feel like, among certain people, a little nervous? Settle down, Jesus. Are there places where he is really welcome and other places, not so much? God is everywhere. We know that theology of that. He is omnipotent. He's present, whether we feel it or not. Are there places, are there environments where he richly dwells? Where dwell? Oikos, house. To richly dwell, to settle home, to settle down and really be at home. And while the answer to that question about creating an environment where he might richly dwell could send us in a number of different directions, and even there would probably need to be some warnings about how you think you can manipulate all that, the direction that the text sends us relative to that question is this, it's when we worship. With psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, it says in verse 16, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And because I noticed that last week, immediately following the service, the 11 o'clock service, I walked up to Joel, and I don't get these ideas like this all the time. Kind of in the last service, I get an idea for the next week. But right after church, I walked up to him and said, Joel, today we talked about the centrality of the Word and what we need to do as a church, what we need to know and believe about the Word, particularly the words of Christ, for those words to richly dwell in us. And I'm thinking this week that next week, which is now this week, following, I want to talk about the centrality of worship. Last week, the word. This week, worship. And what we need to know and believe about worship so that not only the words of Christ might richly dwell among us, but Christ might richly dwell, might settle down and be at home among us. But I don't want to just talk about it. I told him I want to do it. Are you with me? He said, yeah. Then he said, how? I said, I don't know. Let's meet on Tuesday. So we did. Actually, he did. Scott Madison and Steve Weems, Vicki Degner, Joel, and myself, and we began to wonder, just kind of talk, what might we need to know and maybe believe? What might we need to maybe remember about worship? And the role that it plays in creating an environment where not just the words of Christ, but Christ himself might settle down and be at home, might feel at home among us, might richly dwell among us. And among the first things that rose to the surface relative to that was this text that we often make reference to. Joel kind of makes reference to this quite often, actually, in the context of worship. It's kind of as a reminder, Psalm 22, verse 3, which says this, that the Lord is enthroned in the praises of his people. Enthrown means he inhabits the praises of his people. That word inhabit is interesting, especially as it relates to Colossians 3, 16, where it's talking about dwelling richly. Inhabit means to house, to dwell, which means, among other things, this, that praise is where God lives, in a sense. He is everywhere, but there is a way in which he moves toward praise. Praise is his address. He inhabits it, so wherever he finds praise that is coming authentically from the hearts of men and women, he makes that place of praise, not a building, But this place where praise is happening, he makes that place his home. He settles down and is at home in that kind of environment, which means, among other things, this, that worship and praise from the hearts of God's people is not a tangential thing. It really is a critical component, a central piece in our trying to create an environment as a community where not only are the words of Christ, because we've given it space, richly dwelling among people. But Christ might richly dwell himself, because worship and praise is God's dwelling place. He inhabits it. It's where he lives, it's his address, and wherever he finds it, he makes it his home. He settles down and is at home. He richly dwells among us. So come, says the psalmist in Psalm 100, verse 2, come into his presence with singing and into his courts with praise. Singing, says Paul in Colossians 3.16, with thankfulness in your hearts to God, with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. But when we do all that, because we do all that, we need to be aware. And this is the intentionality, because sometimes we can kind of blindly go through these things. When we do all that, we need to be aware that we're not just singing songs, though we are singing songs. What we're doing is the work. And I want you to dial into this, because there really is a kind of work involved in this. Indeed, the word liturgy, it's not a word we use a lot around here, but liturgy literally means the work of the people. So there is a kind of work involved in invoking the name of God. You need to be intentional. You need to kind of dial into what we're doing here. We're not just kind of doing a perfunctory prayer or saying a song, hope you like it. There's something that, but there's something more involved. There is a work involved, an intentionality in inviting the presence and dialing into the reality of the presence. We are intentionally trying to create an environment where God, it might sound odd, where God literally might feel at home among us. Where he might richly dwell because while we're the congregation, we're not the audience. And sometimes I kind of look at you and there's the audience. And now this is kind of splitting hairs and you're being kind of picky here. But you're not the audience. You're a congregation, and as a congregation, sometimes you need to remember God's the audience. There's an audience of one, and the work we have to do is to adore and to remember, to reflect, and to help. God help us see and help us hear. So when we're putting together a worship set, for instance, we'll talk about this very often, like how we do that, and when we're at our best in doing it, we're not trying to figure out what's your favorite song. Instead, we're wondering, and we don't always get it right, but we're wondering. Here's the thought process. What could we do? What might we need to say? What might we need to remember and declare on a given Sunday about God so that God among us might be at home, might richly dwell among us? And when he's richly dwelling, his presence becomes known, becomes manifested presence. And on those times when your human spirit gets kind of an interaction with the Holy Spirit in the context of a community like this, some interesting things happen. Sometimes it's why you weep. And you can't make that happen. And sometimes you get disappointed if it doesn't, like, we didn't sing the right song. And if we do, you know. Sometimes when the manifested presence comes, you do weep. I was talking to somebody last week who after the service, when we did the word, and then there was a worship time afterwards last week, there was such a sense of presence that they laid on the floor, which is weird. They couldn't, they just, they had to do that. The presence was thick, they knelt down. Sometimes people get healed in the context of worship because God has settled down and is at home, and when he's here, he begins to do what he does because he is who he is. And yes, you can experience God's presence alone. In fact, we talk a lot about how we need to realize that. To be a people of the presence doesn't just happen in this room because Christ is in you and you are the temple. It isn't a temple made with hands like this building that we're in. This isn't that kind of thing. You are the temple and Christ is in you and Christ in you individually is the hope of glory, but we also need to remember, we kind of have this pendulum swing back and forth where we kind of go into extremes that something significant, something different, something unique, something very important happens that we're not always conscious of when the whole body gathers because it's not just Christ in you, it's Christ in us. There are ways that God moves among his people when they are gathered that he doesn't do the same way when we're alone and I know what you're thinking um I really do because because I know I know that you're thinking what on earth does any of this have to do with complex adaptive systems and emergent property theory um right that's what you're thinking right so I kind of knew that actually that that is a question that I actually heard Greg Boyd ask. Of course it was Greg Boyd asking a question like that. And it was in the context of a sermon he was doing on worship. And I found it fascinating because complex adaptive systems and emergent property theory says this. Interesting as it relates to worship. That throughout all of creation we find this pattern. And the pattern is this. That in certain situations when groups come together. Whether we're talking about molecules or insects or animals or people. That that group of molecules, for instance, can take in a property that none of the individuals in that group possess or can pull off alone. In fact, as said Greg, this thing is kind of hardwired into a variety of aspects or manifestations in all of creation. That certain things are possible in coming together in unity that don't happen the same way in isolation. He uses ants then as an example. Yeah, I said ants. A-N-T-S. saying ants are not smart, which I didn't think was very nice to say. Ants are stupid, he said. Six behaviors is all they have, but together, and now you know what happens with ants. They create this very complex system of life, an entire civilization, and it's remarkably efficient, and it's not like there's this one ant that's a super genius organizing the whole group, saying, you go here, and you go there, and you do this, and you do that. No. But in coming together, they do this thing that just couldn't happen alone. And Dina, an ant farm, he said, is like an individual mind. Think of it like that. Like a life with a life of its own. It's almost like a body of its own. Like the body of Christ isn't you. It's us. And we take on a whole different dynamic when we're together. neurons in your brain when they all come together. An entirely different property emerges. A different kind of intelligence emerges, and it's true of humans too. Indeed, it's hardwired into all of creation at certain levels in a variety of ways, which is why actually going to Target Field to watch the twins play is a different experience, and it's an entirely different experience than watching it on TV. And it's why going to the U2 concert last night was an entirely different experience for some of you who probably will be in the 11 o'clock service than it was for me reading about in the paper in the paper it's where I read about the YouTube concert I went whoa wow cool it was different being there so when you see we come together not just as individuals but as a body and not just to sing songs, but to, and here's the deal, it isn't just to sing songs, but to, and this is what doesn't always happen, but to with a common heart and a common faith and a common desire to praise, to do that kind of work, thereby creating this environment where God might feel at home, where Christ might richly dwell, a different property emerges that is really quite important and cannot be forgotten or ignored, though sometimes it is forgotten and ignored. And when it is, it then becomes the work of the people to remember what has been forgotten to repair, what has been broken to restore, what has been marginalized or dismantled, which is precisely what Nehemiah was doing, and it's precisely why Nehemiah, having rebuilt the wall in Jerusalem, the wall in Jerusalem being a physical thing, but it was also symbolic of kind of a protection for the people. The wall had been rebuilt. He had given his life to rebuild this thing, and with the people now poised and ready to reenter the city, the holy city of Jerusalem, Nehemiah kind of paused before they all came back and said basically this, that the primary reason that this wall, that there was a breach in the wall, that the wall actually was destroyed in the first place is because we as God's people have forgotten and ignored two things. The first thing is this. We have forgotten, number one, the word of God. It ceased to richly dwell among us. And second of all, we forgot about the worship of God. So before the people come back to the city of Jerusalem, Nehemiah says, bring them back. Bring both the word and worship back and make them central, Nehemiah 13.1 says this. So on that day, they read aloud the book of Moses and the hearing of the people because we're a people of the book. First of all, it all starts there, said Nehemiah. And then they brought back the singers. It says in verse 27 of Nehemiah 12, and then the leaders of the singers that we might celebrate with gladness, it says, with hymns of thanksgiving and songs of praise like it used to be in the days of David and Asaph. In the days of David and Asaph, those days were remembered by the people of God. Those are the days when the word of God and the worship of God was central to the people of God. And as Nehemiah is bringing these things back and giving them a place of honor, of centrality, it was like a revival was breaking out that began with a desire. The revival of these things, of remembering, began with a desire and then a decision to number one, bring back the book so that the words of God might richly dwell among us. And number two, bring back the singers because it all begins with the word and with the worship, the word of God and the worship of God. And while that isn't all we do, there's lots of other things as a body, as a community of faith that we do are involved in particularly in a context, in a culture that's confusing and scary. the word and the worship is where it begins and things spin off of that things of life where his words are richly dwelling and he is richly dwelling and those decisions by nehemiah to bring them back were driven by a belief that wherever we create an environment where these things can richly dwell, so does God. Richly dwell. The psalmist said it this way, oh magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. You can do it individually, and it's important to learn how. Together we magnify. Together we exalt. To magnify, just kind of let you in on this, because it kind of helps you do the work of this. To magnify is not like a microscope that tries to take something that is really, really small. That's what microscopes do, these things you can't see with the naked eye, and makes them bigger. To magnify is not like a microscope. It's like a telescope that is looking into the heavens and trying to bring something that is infinitely large close so we can wrap our head around it and at least get a little glimpse of it. But to do that, to bring this infinitely large thing close, this thing that is invisible to the naked eye, it needs to be discerned even by the spirit, this unseen real. Sometimes you need some time to focus. Just like a telescope, you go, a little more, a little more. Okay, there it is, I can see it now. I can see it takes a little time. Sometimes it takes a little quiet. Sometimes it takes intent. Always it takes intent. I know that God can kind of knock us off a horse and just kind of surprise us with presence, but this work of the people is intentional. I just want to get quiet and dial in, begin to focus. So let's, right now, intentionally, quietly maybe, reverentially, take some time to focus so we can magnify, bring what's hard to see close. And as we do, in this quiet place, at least to begin with, know this, the God inhabits the praises of his people. It's where he lives. That in our worship and praise, he makes his home, he richly dwells, and so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. can't make anything happen but we can be present to your presence and this is our request be at home here pray with me would you spirit of prayer God be at home among us and not because you like the songs we're about to sing God doesn't show up when we sing his favorite songs he lands on your heart you guys a heart of praise he lands on your spirit he comes and dwells and we say come and our desire is that you feel at home among us Thank you.
