Let's pray as we go to the Word. for the kind of Hosanna that from our lips would truly give you praise, we pray. And we pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. We call it Holy Week. Beginning today with what we refer to as Palm Sunday, thus the palms all over the floor, Came in last night and said, I think I can even figure this out. This must be Palm Sunday, marking the last week of Christ's earthly life as he sets his face like flint toward the cross, toward his suffering and pain. But it began, this holy week thing, with what looked like a party in Matthew 21, which will actually be our primary text for the weekend as we focus our attention this morning on this event we call Palm Sunday. Indeed, it looked not just like a party, any old party, it looked like a coronation where they would make him king. That is, Jesus, as he rode into the city that day to the adoring crowd and the palm branches waving what looked like worship to him, Hosanna to the Son of David, they sang in Matthew 21, verse 9. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest. It was all so clear. They were all so sure that they were right about who they thought he was and what they thought he'd do. And what they thought he'd do, obviously, was what they wanted him to do. And what they wanted him to do was to make everything right. Kind of generally do that. Make everything right. and there were a lot of ideas in Jesus' day about what needed to be made right politically, economically, socially even religiously and as that crowd was cheering him Hosanna-ing him they were sure that that's who he was that that's what he'd do and so they sang because of that Hosanna Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord Blessed is he who will make all things right But underneath the surface of this wild celebration, behind this veil of praise, something was stirring. Something was brewing. Something was wrong, off. Not quite what it appeared to be, a dissonant chord. a dissonant chord that in the middle of the cheering crowd would actually be hard to hear and hard to see. So let's look closer. Because on the surface, everything looked great. It really did, as most of the multitude in Matthew 21, verse 8, it says, spread their garments on the road in front of Jesus. You can picture the scene in others were cutting down branches from trees and spreading them in the road, thus the branches. And those are gestures that mean nothing to us, except as it relates to our kind of understanding or picturing in our minds of what that Palm Sunday must have looked like. But in Jesus' day, these gestures were full of meaning and very intentional, particularly as it related to Israel's history of kingmaking. Because these symbols were evocative. These movements and the dropping of the clothes and the laying of the palm branches were evocative of what you do when people are saying, you are the man. When Jehu, for example, the son of Jehoshaphat, was coronated king, the people in 2 Kings 9.13 acknowledged their acceptance of him as king by taking off their outer garments and throwing them in the road as he came by. And what that was was an out loud kind of public declaration. We are submitting to you. We recognize you to be the king and are giving you now the right to rule. And so in like manner. That means what they're doing here is not just some weird thing. This is very intentional. In chapter 21 of Matthew, verse 9, the whole multitude was going before him, and those who followed were crying out, saying with a loud voice again, Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest. It was all so clear. They were all so sure. It all looked so good. Indeed, I mean, just picture being in the crowd and what it had to feel like. Because like a lot of crowds, the bigger the crowd got and the louder they sang, the clearer it seemed to be to anyone who was in the crowd that we were right about who we thought he was and what we thought he'd do. Hosanna. But underneath the surface of this wild celebration, behind this veil of praise, something is stirring something is brewing something is off a dissonant chord not quite what it appears to be but it's hard to hear what this dissonant chord is through the noise of this celebrating crowd and it's hard to see what isn't quite right with this picture so let's look closer and when we do actually look a little closer we soon discover that some of the clues as to what might be stirring what might be brewing what might be off are revealed to us by jesus himself was entering the city that day on this his coronation day what the scriptures refer to as his as his triumphal entry okay but he's doing that on the colt of a donkey dial into that not just a donkey, which would look inglorious enough all by itself on the colt of a donkey. I grew up in church hearing this story, and so the idea of Jesus riding in on the colt of the donkey didn't seem odd to me until I actually thought about, what, this is a grown man. I'm not a donkey, but a colt of a donkey. Peter would be upset with this thing. This is animal abuse. What is it? He It looks weird doing this. And he did it on purpose. Matthew 21, verse 2. Sending two of his disciples with these instructions. You guys, go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. So they did. But he rode the colt, which just looks odd. I can get caught up in all the screaming and yelling, and this is all so wonderful, but if you kind of pay attention, there's something weird here, not very presidential, the scene here. In fact, we don't know a lot about coronation ceremonies. It's not part of our culture. I think the closest thing we could kind of dial into mentally or visually would be a presidential inauguration, and maybe that's kind of close to the kind of pageantry, but history tells us that these coronations of a king, and even in Jesus, they were glorious events, filled with rich people, rich food, rich banquets, and feasts, and jewels, and clothing, and everything about it was designed to point to the glory of the event and the elevation of the person. If it was a king or a queen, sometimes those kings or queens would be raised up on a great shield, and the symbolism there, they would be raised up on a shield. The shield would be something of protection, but also it had military connotations, but he would be raised up above the people, and being above the people is significant. There's a message there for the people riding, sometimes not a shield thing, but sometimes they would often ride in on a powerful war horse, and you can picture just this massive animal being ridden by a king or a queen even in some situations. It was not just meant to intimidate, though it could be quite intimidated. It was also meant to impress, but not just to impress. It was actually designed to, among other things, instill confidence. And again, it kind of would. I like to know I'm being protected by that guy who's riding that horse. Then they would be presented often with a spear and a sword and a scepter, all of which were obvious symbols of power. But above all was this crown thing. In 1846, in 1838 rather, at the coronation of Queen Victoria, for example, she was given a crown with rubies and sapphires all around and a 300-carat diamond in the middle of the crown and a scepter with a 516-carat diamond on the top. All very incredible, wonderful, magnificent, which means that this triumphal entry of Jesus and what's supposed to be his coronation just looked like a coronation, but it looked a little odd, A little off. A dissonant chord in here somewhere. Because while there really are a lot of the entrapments of a coronation, there are the elements that you would expect in an adoring crowd. A big parade. Symbols of this coronation. There's also this cult. What's up with the cult? And then at the end of the parade, it was just the strangest thing, you guys. Because it says in Luke 19, 41, which is the parallel passage to Matthew 21, that after he had taken all of this in, the hosannas had been sung, the palm branches had been laid, the clothing had been laid out in front of him. He was looking over the city and over this crowd, and it says at the end of this thing that he wept in Luke 19, which, again, if you're kind of taking in the whole scene, maybe stepping back a bit and watching this thing, which looks so clear to us what it means, the fact that he's weeping looks a little odd, a little off. While everyone else is singing and dancing and laughing for joy, he's weeping. All of which raises this question, this kind of wondering. What does he see that we don't see? We're all singing. You're weeping. What does he know that we don't know? Because it all looks so good. It all seems so clear. We were all so sure that we were right about who we thought he was and what we thought he'd do. And what we thought he'd do was to make everything right. The way we wanted him, to make everything right, because that's who he is, and that's what he'll do, and that's why we sing Hosanna. But underneath the surface, behind the veil of praise, something is stirring, something is brewing, something is off. A dissonant chord. Again, that in the din of the cheering crowd is hard to hear. So what do you do with that? With the dissonance, with the dis-ease, with this sense that something's not quite right here. I don't know. I don't know if you've been in situations like that where you're wanting to get caught up in something. Everybody's agreeing and something's not going to. one way to handle the dissonance that something might not be quite right that maybe we don't quite get it is to ignore it that handles the dissonance that works for me just ignore the dissonance the sense that maybe something's not quite right that maybe we don't get it and just listen to the crowd that will solve the dissonance because they sound so sure it's also clear how could that many be wrong. Indeed, indeed, that's actually what I love about the crowd. It's what I love about being in a crowd, because in the crowd, try to put yourself there, I'm sure. When I'm in the crowd, I know what to think and how to feel and what to say, and on this occasion, what we're saying is, Hosanna! That's the right thing to say. That's the right thing to think and the right thing to feel. Ever been in a crowd? Of course you have. You're in one now. Ever been in a cheering crowd? Maybe a Palm Sunday crowd? Forget it. They don't make it religious. A football crowd. One of the things about it, I mean, it feels like unity. We're all together. And we all agree. We know for sure. or even a booing crowd. You ever been in a boo? Hostile crowd. Because either way, whether you're in a cheering crowd or a hostile crowd, the thing about the crowd that feels good is you know for sure who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. Who's the best? Cheering crowd. Who's a bum? Hostile crowd. It's all so clear. We're all so sure. And that feels great. Again, it's what I love about the crowd. But it's also what I don't trust about the crowd. And I suspect, again, when we're in it, we feel good about it, either a hostile crowd or a cheering crowd. When we're in, it kind of feels good. But I suspect that you are somewhat suspect of that as well. For some of the same reasons that we love the crowd, because the crowd cheers and then it boos, but then it turns on a dime. These crowd experiences move. They shift from cheering to booing and then back again to cheering. Case in point, and this is fascinating to me, Palm Sunday. It's weird. When I began to get this take on Palm Sunday many years ago, It kind of ruined Palm Sunday for me as being this wonderful celebration because I just began to see Palm Sunday as always this false kind of praise. It ruined Palm Sunday for me. We quit doing it here for several years. That's a joke, sorry. I mean, I mean, think about it. There they were in Matthew 21 shouting, the whole crowd, everybody, Hosanna, Hosanna, he's the best, on Sunday. Five days later, same crowd, same city, shouting, shouting, crucify him, crucify him, he's a bum. On Friday, it was all so clear. We were all so sure. Both times, clear. Both times, sure. But both times, that crowd was wrong. Both times, that crowd cheering and booing didn't get it. They didn't get him. Even when they were cheering for him, they didn't know who he was. They didn't know what he was doing. They didn't understand the kind of kingdom he was bringing. It's why I don't trust the crowd, even when I'm in it. And even when I'm part of it and being kind of swept along with it, there's this kind of inside of me. I think you've felt this from time to time. I don't know about this. Oh, might as well go. Even then, there's this hesitation. I remember years ago, I can't remember when this was, but you know, I'm from Chicago, and I have this Chicago Cubs disease I can't get rid of, and going to Wrigley Field as a kid. Several years ago, I was there with my brother, and I think our kids were there as well, and we always go early when we go to Wrigley, and sit out in the bleachers, and there's a big deal about, you know, the players being real accessible, and they throw balls up to the kids. And, in fact, one of my memories is we did this every year, and when Christopher was 16 years old, we went to Wrigley Field with a bunch of his friends, and he came up and said, they don't throw me balls anymore. And I go, you're not cute anymore. Anyway, that's a little off thing there. But I remember there were these little rituals out in the outfield, even before the game starts, where the crowd will pick a player and go, yeah, and they'll just heap all sorts of praise on him. It was wonderful. Yeah, yeah, ooh, they always chant, and they'll also fixate on somebody they decide they don't like today. Boo, boo, boo, and all this invective is being kind of poured out on this guy. My brother and I are just kind of getting, yeah, blah, blah, and all of a sudden we stopped, and we went, this is weird. This guy that we're saying is a bum, and the worst player that ever lived, if we actually knew him, he would probably be the best athlete we'd ever met in our whole life, we should shut up. Okay, all of that in mind, come back with me to this scene unfolding in Matthew 21, okay? As Jesus is riding into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey, not the donkey, a colt of a donkey, to the shouts of, Hosanna, what a party, and now, if you can, forget about the crowd and let's dial in to him. if he had a laser focus kind of bring it close dial into him see the look on his face three things I'd want us to see about the look on his face I'd want us to know in fact for some of you I'd want to remind you as he's entering this city that might help redeem this scene in fact it is what helped redeem this scene for me and then what is and then in turn what is sometimes our own false praise much like the crowds into authentic Hosanna the first thing I want us to see is this that he knew number one he knew that the cross was looming and so that really does put a spin on it if we're gonna see the scene he's coming in everybody's going yeah yeah yeah man he knows that no matter how good a day this might be on the surface he knows the cross is looming it's why he's there having set his face like flint. Matthew 16, 21 says, I must go, he said to his disciples. I must go to Jerusalem, and I will there be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes and will then suffer many things and die. So he knew, as this party was going on, that the cross was looming. And he also knew that this crowd, so full of praise today, would turn. He knew. and that is at least part of why I think not the only reason but that is at least part of why I think in Luke 1941 it says he wept but not for himself poor me that wasn't it he wept for them and he wept for us because he knew of their blindness and ours because he knew of their deafness and ours. Because he knew of their lostness and ours, and he even knew of their fickleness and ours. When they thought they knew for sure, he's the best. They don't know. He's a bum. They don't know. So he knew. And he wept. But here's the kicker. For me, he went anyway. And when I put this story together that way, it kind of makes me want to sing. Hosanna. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Jesus loves me. This I know. A child's song. you know in my office I don't know if I would expect your office is like this over the years you just start collecting these artifacts these mementos of your life and icons of your life in my office it's full of pictures of my family, friends, memories of my dad, yesterday I looked up in my office and on the top shelf is my dad's bible kind of sitting on end that he preached out of and studied it once in a while I'll look that thing up and look at the notes that he took, almost every page is marked because he was in that thing all the time. There's a rock in my office that just has engraved on it, remember, and when I look at it, I remember what that rock was about in a season of life here at Open Door that was actually kind of hard, and I remember, and it was about remembering God's faithfulness. There's a staff, a staff, like made of wood from the Holy Land that's hanging on my wall that I look at every day, and sometimes like things in your office. You don't see them after a while, but it reminds me when I look at it, look at it, that whatever else I am, whether I like it or not, I'm a shepherd. This week as I was thinking about this talk, I was reminded of a little memento thing I have in my office that I've had since my first year I was here at Open Door. It's a pencil sketch of a picture, and I'll show it to you in a second, but it's a picture that was written by a guy named Tim who was at the very first service here at Open Door many years ago and Tim didn't take notes like some of us do writing all the things down. He would hear what I would say and he would draw a picture and I have several of those. I had several of those from him over the years and this particular picture was of the very first sermon I ever preached at Open Door and I don't remember what I said but this is what he heard. And when I see that picture, it kind of makes me want to sing Hosanna. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, because as he rode into Jerusalem that day on the colt of a donkey, surrounded by the adoring crowd, he knew what was coming, and he wept. But he went anyway, which makes me want to sing. the soldiers had fun that day that crucifixion day and it lasted all day from the horrific beating to the bullying game of blind man's bluff that's recorded in matthew 26 verse 67 where they blindfolded jesus and they started to spit in his face and then begin to punch him from different directions saying and this is my paraphrase of the verse you see on the screen tell us mr prophet man Which one of us hits you if you can see things? Which one of us spit on you? Can you tell? Do you know? Ask you a question. Have you ever been bothered or frustrated, maybe even angry, at the apparent restraint of God when evil seems to have its way? You pick up the paper in the morning, and day after day after day after day, it looks like it's winning. I mean how could we wonder a loving God a supposedly all-powerful God allow that thus calling into question both his love and his power I think those are pretty normal questions that rise up for us from time to time but can you imagine can you even get your mind around the restraint of God on this day when evil was having its way with every lash of the whip, every crunch of a fist against the face and the flesh of Jesus, he knew. And if we're to believe Jesus' words in Matthew 26, 53, he knew that 12 legions of angels awaited his command and that one word from him, just a gesture of his hand, a moving of his finger would grant permission to them to go. This ordeal would be over, and his rejecters would get what they deserved, but no word was uttered, no move was made. The lion was a lamb that day. So here's your Palm Sunday story. This is your Palm Sunday scene. As he entered Jerusalem that day, riding the colt of a donkey to the praise of an adoring crowd. We need to know he knew. And he wept. But he went anyway. And it kind of makes me want to sing. Hosanna. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. You knew how fickle they were. You knew how fickle I am. And he went anyway. Roman historian and philosopher Cicero wrote in his memoirs this that the very idea of a cross should never come near the bodies or minds of a Roman citizen it should never pass through the thoughts eyes or ears of them to Romans crucifixion as you know was the cruelest form of capital punishment but it was reserved only for people who deserved it never a Roman citizen only the lowest of the low scum of the earth murderers, thieves and sometimes people like Jesus who led what they were perceiving to be a slave revolt Romans if you were a Roman citizen you could be executed but you would be beheaded lucky you but never crucified Jews had the same aversion to this horrific thing preferring stoning which again isn't exactly humane but they wouldn't crucify It just didn't happen. Indeed, history records that it took many years, even for the church, to look upon a physical cross as a symbol of hope and healing of faith and love. Church founders forbade a cross's depiction in any kind of art. Though grateful for its theological implications, it was gruesome to see. C.S. Lewis actually points out that the crucifixion did not become common in Christian art until everyone who had actually seen one had passed off the scene. see there's three things about Jesus I want us to know as he rode into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey to the praise of this adoring though fickle crowd he knew and he wept and he went anyway which kind of makes me want to sing Hosanna blessed is he he spoke some things while dying there, things that on this Friday, Good Friday, coming up, we will kind of unpack and look at in detail. Snatches of conversations recorded by people who heard as he hung on the cross, Behold your son, he said at one point. Father, forgive them, he said at another. I thirst, he also said. Aaronic, isn't it? That this one who provided gallons of wine at a wedding feast and who spoke of living water that would quench the thirst of men and women forever and ever would die with a swollen tongue and a sour smell of vinegar wine in his beard. See, there's these three things I think we need to know if we hope to get the Palm Sunday story right. As he rode into Jerusalem that day in the cult of a donkey, surrounded by the adoring crowd. He knew, he wept, and he went anyway. Which makes me want to sing Hosanna. Blessed is he. It's a fascinating scene that unfolds just a few verses after this triumphal entry thing. We know of this story called the cleansing of the temple. we don't always connect it to being in this proximity to the triumphal entry, but just a couple of verses after the triumphal entry is over, Jesus enters the temple in chapter 21, verse 12, where he turns the tables over. Remember that? Of the money changers, thereby confronting this corrupt temple system that was exploiting people, particularly poor people, for the personal gain of a few very rich people, such that people who were coming to the temple in Jesus' day, who wanted to do what you generally do when you go to the temple or when you go to church. They were wanting to meet with God. They were coming to the temple to ask forgiveness, to find access to God, to make peace with God. The temple system had become so corrupt that as people were coming into it looking for God, the very system itself kept them from God. And Jesus, in turning over this system, is saying, in effect, enough of this. I'm here to tear this system down. For I have come to make access to God available for free to anyone who wants it. And when he was done, turn over the tables and scattering all the people and the doves are flying and the fur is flying and people are running. It says that in the middle of that chaos, so strange, Matthew 21 verse 14, that the blind and the lame began coming to him. I've always seen this picture as a weird thing. Again, you grow up in church, you see it and you go, okay, that's what they did, no big deal. And yet you think of blind and lame people. I mean, they hear a big noise and they're waiting to get hit. Something weird, however, about his violence that scattered the money changers but somehow communicated to the blind and lame, he's fighting for us. He's safe. So they came to him and he healed them and then the next thing, children. Very next verse, it says, and then the children who liked the blind and lame were kind of in the shadows all the time and in the way. But now, when Jesus turned over the tables, his violence didn't scare them either. They started running through the temple, crying out, Hosanna, Hosanna to the son of David. There's that Hosanna again. But the rulers of the temple, when they saw this, in Matthew 21, 15, became indignant. Look at it on the screen. When the chief priests and the scribes saw these wonderful things that he had done, and the children who were shouting out in the temple, Hosanna to the son of David, they became indignant. In confronting Jesus, they said to Jesus this, verse 16, do you hear what they're saying? Do you see what they're doing? Are you going to allow that is what's implied there, to which Jesus says, in effect, in verse 16 there, yes, I see it. He doesn't exactly say that, but the kind of implied thing here is, and yes, I hear it, and yes, I will allow it. And then in classic rabbinic style, Jesus answers their question with a question, have you never read? How about you? Verse 16. You know that place in Psalm 8, verse 2, and this is where he's quoting Psalm 8, verse 2, where the psalmist says, that out of the mouths of infants and nursing babes, God has prepared praise for himself. In other words, you guys, you may be indignant at this, but nothing can stop this. Because God is going to get the praise he's due. And if you don't give it, He's saying this to the chief priests and the scribes, the rulers of the temple, and if the crowd even doesn't get it, the children will. And if they don't get it, infants and nursing babes will get it. And if they don't get it, Luke 19, verse 41, which again is the parallel passage to this story, it says the rocks themselves will cry out. How does that work? Maybe in the middle of the night, when everybody's sleeping, the rock starts singing, and we never see it. Anyway. Poetic language, language of imagery, evocative language. I have a picture in my mind. I don't even know if it's true, but the picture is something like this. And in this room, there's an angelic host. And part of their job is to look for praise that's directed to God, and they bring it to God. Again, I don't know if that's true, but they come here, and we start singing our songs, and when they hear it coming from our hearts, they just bring it to God, and they translate it into something that sounds better than what comes out of my mouth. I'm so glad. Into praise. They translate it into praise. And I don't know, this is such a weird thing, but I think of rooms full of people singing songs, and sometimes I wonder if the angelic host could tell them they don't know what they're singing, they don't know what they're saying, this isn't coming from my heart, so I'm going to get out of this room and go where I can find it, and they go down to their nursery. Again, this is such a weird picture. I don't know if it's true, but they land. I kind of picture them landing on the innocence and purity of the little babies down in their nursery, and they take their gurgling and their cooing and their laughing and giggling, and they translate all that into praise to God. And if they don't get it there, they'll go to the rocks if they have to. All of which makes my heart say, and I think yours, something I've said many times before, Lord, when this picture comes to me, we say, may it never be, God, that you would have to leave this room, that you would have to leave this building and go to the rocks to get your praise because you can get it from us. Right here, right now, because today we see Jesus riding into Jerusalem that day on the colt of a donkey to the praise of an adoring crowd. But now we know he knew that the crowd was fickle and that the cross was looming and because he knew, he wept. But he went anyway. And it kind of makes me want to sing Hosanna. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Sing out this word. Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna See the long way to King Come to set His people free We cry Hosanna Come and tear the temple down Raise it up on only ground we cry Hosanna See the long-awaited King Come to set His people free we cry Hosanna We sing Hosanna We sing Hosanna guitar solo Thank you.
