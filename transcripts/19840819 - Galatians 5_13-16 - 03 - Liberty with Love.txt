Open your Bibles to the book of Galatians chapter 5. Galatians chapter 5. In our continuing study in the book of Galatians, it brings us to the 13th verse in this good book. Paul is going to balance some things off for us in our understanding, and I believe that these are going to be some very important things for us to learn. Chapter 5, verse 13. For you were called to freedom, brethren, Only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. But if you bite and devour one another, take care lest you be consumed by one another. Let's pray. Father, we come to this point in the week, every week, and I'm overwhelmed with the same kinds of feelings, and I feel silly acknowledging them because it's the same thing, a sense of inadequacy, and yet a sense of urgency and power at the same time. Your Word is so alive, and so real, and so needed for us to grasp and digest and chew. May it be that kind of experience. May it be more than listening and hearing, but may it be eating and devouring as we come again to your word. We ask for your spirits enlightening of our minds and of our hearts. In Jesus' name, amen. Ephesians 2, 8 and 9 says, For by grace you're saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it's a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 4, 4 through 6. Now to the one who works, his wage is not reckoned as a favor, but as what is due. But to him that worketh not, but believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Not your works, your faith. Romans 5, 1 and 2, Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand. We stand in grace by faith. And the Judaizers came along and said, Hey, that's real great. I like all the talk about grace. I like all the talk about faith. But the truth is this, that's just not enough. And Paul comes along to the Galatians and says, Oh, yes, it is. In fact, the message of grace and faith is grace and faith alone and nothing else. And if anyone comes along mixing law and works in with that as a way to be right with God, I want you to know this. Even though we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel that is contrary to that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so say I now again. If any man is preaching to you a gospel that is contrary to that which you receive, that is grace and faith alone, Let him be accursed. But these Galatians had already begun to stumble, and they were living the Christian life by the strength of external rules and rituals, and so it is that in chapter 3, verses 1 through 3, Paul says this, You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? You understood the gospel. This is the only thing I want to find out from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing with faith? Are you so foolish then? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by your own fleshly trying? Then in chapter 3, verse 7, Therefore be sure of this one thing, that it is those who are of faith who are the true sons of Abraham. Chapter 4, verse 9, But now that you have come to know God, let's start in verse 7. Chapter 4, verse 7, Therefore, you are no longer a slave, but you are a son. And if a son, then an heir. Verse 9. But now that you have come to know God, or rather be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things to which you desire to be enslaved all over again? You observe days and months and seasons and years. Legalism. I fear for you that perhaps I've labored over you in vain. And then chapter 5, verse 1. It was for freedom that Christ has set us free. Keep standing firm in your freedom. Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom. Liberty, liberty, liberty, liberty. Don't you love liberty? Don't you love freedom? You bet your life I do. I think it's great. The restrictions have been removed. The rituals have been replaced by reality. The rules have been abolished. And we are free to do whatever we want to do when we want to do it with whoever it is we want to do it with. It's great. I love this freedom. somebody just went over a line. Don't you feel a little nervous? What did he just say? I like the freedom stuff. I like this liberty stuff. We can just do our own thing because we're free in Christ. Do you ever find yourself, do you ever find yourself when we're right in the middle? We have been in this for months. Started in Hebrews when we started talking about liberty in Jesus. Do you ever find yourself just kind of going, kind of giving me some hand from the congregation going, don't go too far, Dave. Don't go too far, Dave. you're getting a little farther, this freedom is going to go a little bit overboard. Very often we find ourselves worrying about how people are going to react to certain kinds of messages because we play them out to their extreme. We kind of think, well, if we're talking freedom, that means you can do just whatever it is you want to do. And that scares me if that's the message we're hearing from the pulpit. And so people who are worried about people going a little bit too far kind of have the feeling, you know, you ever feel like this? Have you ever felt like, you know, I like this freedom stuff and I like this liberty, but let's say a little bit of law wouldn't hurt. Just to kind of keep our hands on things, a little bit of law wouldn't hurt. A little bit of rules in this thing wouldn't hurt to kind of keep control of everything. You know what we need to know? I just want to grab you here this morning because this is what Paul is doing here. We need to live in balance. We need to be a balanced people. Very often we react to things, not just to spiritual things, but to life in extreme ways. We respond to something, we hear something, and instead of listening to it and hearing it, we react and we kind of think we better live way over here in terms of the response to that thing over there. This is a terrible oversimplification, but I'm going to give it to you to kind of help you get a hold of what I'm talking about. I believe that when we come to this issue of freedom for the believer, that Christians kind of find themselves in three different camps. There is what I would call, first of all, the careful Christian. The careful Christian. I would be very careful not to call this person a legalist. Legalists are not going to heaven. We've had that. We've hashed that out. Ishmaels are bound for hell. They are people who are dependent totally on their self-effort. They don't know anything about faith. But there are Christians who are what we would call very, very careful. Some of you would think they were nervous. Okay? I would call them careful. Some of you would call them nervous. They're just real worried about everything just being right and how things look. And oh my goodness, and I don't know if it's going to be okay. And everything just gets real happened. And they're very, they love the Lord and they are saved by grace and they understand the doctrine. But in a pinch, they lean toward legalism. Okay? In a pinch, they lean toward legalism. Got to have a little bit of love. There's another kind of Christian, and this is the carefree Christian. You've got the careful, and you've got the carefree. And this is the person who really has accepted his liberty. He's accepted his liberty. He's serving the Lord Jesus, and it's obvious, and everybody sees it, but he's doing it out of freedom, not out of bondage. He's doing it out of joy, not out of a burden or a guilt of any kind. This person does not need rules. In fact, this person resents rules because he's doing everything he's doing because he loves Jesus with all his heart. And so you have the careful Christian. You have the carefree Christian. And you have somebody who really messes things up, and that's the careless Christian. The careless Christian. This is the guy who loves to come and hear Pastor Dave talk about freedom because then he's able to go, this is wonderful, the guy says I can do anything I want. It's freedom, freedom, freedom. And he uses his freedom as a basis for dropping out sometimes. He uses his freedom as an excuse to become lazy in terms of his service to the Lord and his giving in terms of serving areas. And he uses his freedom as license to do whatever he wants. And what happens is you begin to have a battle in the church. You begin to have all sorts of tensions between these three kinds of people. You have careful and careless people who are at odds all the time and the carefree people are kind of in the middle trying to explain everything all along the way. In fact, what happens is the careless people and the carefree people and the careful people are always pointing at each other saying, that's their problem and that's their problem and that's their problem. For instance, the careful person, just a little bit nervous, is always looking at the careless person who is really using his liberty as an occasion for the flesh. And he points to them and he says, see what happens when you talk about freedom. See what happens. In fact, what he does is he grabs the carefree guy and he says, I want you to know what happens when you talk about freedom. Look at that guy over there. He's being careless. And then the careless guy grabs that carefree guy and he goes, Well, I'll tell you what, look at that careful person. They're so nervous, they're so uptight, I can't believe they're so legalistic, it just drives me crazy. I wouldn't want to be like them in a million years. Could you follow that? That was like machine gun fire. And the carefree guy's kind of in the middle, trying to balance them, feeling a little bit of both what they're saying. I understand what this carefree person's saying, that we're free, but I don't think you're that free. I don't understand that. And then you come over and you hear the careful person and you kind of understand it. But something's missing. Somewhere we're missing balance. Christian liberty how free are we really? you know what I think that some of us from the day we started Galatians have been asking that question wondering when is pastor going to answer that question how free are we really? what is Christian liberty when we're talking about how I live my life and where do we find balance? a guy by the name of Hendrickson gave an illustration that I really like and I think it works here he likened Christian liberty to a very narrow bridge. You've got to picture this in your mind. And what it does, it spans over two streams. You've got this real little narrow bridge. It's not real easy to stay on. And underneath you have two streams. One stream is crystal clear. It's brilliant. It's sparkling. It's clean and it's cool. But you need to know something about this first stream. It is treacherous. It is deadly because it is rapids. And people get smashed on the rocks. There is another stream that's going underneath that bridge. It is polluted, it is stagnant, it is mucky, it smells bad, it doesn't even flow, it just oozes, okay? That first stream is legalism. That first stream is legalism. It comes on like real righteousness, it comes on like great piety. The problem is, believer, if you fall off the bridge of balanced Christian living and fall into that stream that looks real crisp and cool, you won't be able to stay afloat. Some of you have gone that way. some of you are fighting the rapids like crazy and everything you're doing is in the flesh and you're just trying as hard as you can to be a good Christian and all the waves are hitting you and you're just going nuts some of you have already been bashed on the rocks some of you are here because you've gotten smashed on the rocks and you got tired of it but that other stream is no better it's the opposite see it's the extreme the other stream that's mucky and dirty is that libertinism, that antinomianism that says there is no law. Do whatever you feel. We're free in Jesus. You can just kind of run amok. It's great. The problem is for many of us, I really believe this, that we are extreme in our responses. What happens is someone will fall into that legalistic extreme, live 10 years of their lives under a legalistic structure, say, forget it with this. I hate it. I will not live. You know what they do? Instead of getting up on the bridge where there is balanced Christian living, what do they do? Very often, jump right into the muck, don't they? They go right over into the antinomianism, into the libertinism, say, I'm going to live my life, my way, and do my own thing. You know people like that. I know people are the other way around. Some people have been exposed to a libertine kind of thing, do whatever you feel, maybe coming out of some sort of liberal theology, where everybody could do what was right in their own sight, And nothing mattered. And in a response to that, a reaction to that, it became real rigid and real unmoving. The problem is this. We need to catch this. Those two streams, neither one of those streams, either legalism nor antinomianism, lawlessness, spells Christian victory for a believer. They spell death and destruction. They spell frustration. They spell lack of joy. They will get people who fall into those rivers very often find themselves wondering if Christianity is real at all. To them it isn't. God has called us to balance, beloved. God has called us to balance. We are called to live on that bridge between those two streams. And I'm going to admit to you that it is not always easy to do that. I believe we need to be taught the Word of God in order to do it. I don't believe it comes naturally. I don't think it's just kind of a cloud hits you and you go, Oh, I think you need to be taught the Word of God. I think we need to understand the working of the Holy Spirit as well. Balance is understanding this. If you're taking notes, write it down. Balance in my Christian life is this. Understanding that freedom, one, is not license. But it is also understanding that holiness is not legalism. Freedom is not license. Holiness is not legalism. The problem is this, that whenever you address either problem, think about this. You've been in this congregation. When I've preached on both of those things. Freedom, I've had times when I've preached on holiness. Very often, whenever we hear something like that, we find ourselves reacting in the extreme. We talk about freedom, freedom, freedom. We leave thinking, boy, that sure sounds like libertinism to me. Or we talk about holiness, holiness, holiness, and we leave kind of thinking, boy, that sure sounds like a lot of duty. It sounds like a lot of law, a lot of legalism. We react into the extreme. I think it's important that we are clear. Paul thinks so too. That's right in the middle of this whole thing. He gives us four verses with which to deal. The Apostle Paul at this time is preaching about what? Grace and freedom. You are not under the law. You have been set free. What did people say when they hear this message of freedom? What do you think they said? Oh, Paul is an antinomian. He doesn't care about law. Do whatever you want. Fact is this. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing could be further from the truth. When Paul speaks freedom, Paul is not saying in any way that we set aside God's moral law. The ceremonial law is set aside. All of the little things I do to try to gain God's favor, we set aside. All the little religious rituals we perform for each other are set aside. They mean nothing. God's moral law is not set aside. In fact, it is exalted more than any it ever was before. You see, what Paul does with the moral law because of Christ is this. The moral law is not abolished. It just went inside. The moral law is not abolished. It just went inside. And when the law of God is written on my heart, John mentioned that this morning when he was praying and we were singing, when the law of God is written on my heart, I don't need rules to keep it. It's the throb of my heart. It's the desire of my heart by the Holy Spirit living within me. But the Apostle Paul, in an effort to be clear, to keep the balance, stops in verses 13 through 16 and says, You have been set free. But don't you dare, don't you dare let liberty turn into license. Because if it does, then you don't understand your liberty. Then you don't understand your liberty. Three things I want us to get. Three things I want us to catch. And I think this is going to be very, very helpful to many of us this morning. First of all, Paul clarifies the call. He clarifies the call. Point one, the clarification of the call. Verse 13, for you were called to freedom, brethren. You have been called to freedom. When I say what I'm about to say, don't you dare let what I'm about to say negate what I have said, and that is you are called to live in freedom, not under law, ever. But, but, only, do not turn, literally that means do not twist, do not pervert, do not pervert your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but rather, through love, serve one another. Through love, serve one another. Let me say it this way. You've been set free. But don't abuse it. Use it. Don't abuse your freedom. Use your freedom. For what? To serve? To give? Take your freedom, that freedom with which Christ has set you free, and throw yourself to the wind. Take that freedom with which Christ has set you free, and give yourself to any impulse you have. No. No. take that freedom take that precious gift that Jesus has given to you by the blood of his son that gift that says you can't earn it you don't have to earn it you don't have to perform you are loved you are forgiven take that precious gift of freedom you are accepted and use it to serve him and each other I think we need to understand some things about our liberty and what real liberty does in terms of our living I want you to turn to Exodus chapter 21 verses 1 through 6 because this text teaches us something about what liberty results in in the life of a believer. Exodus chapter 21 verses 1 through 6. Beloved, these are the ordinances which you are to set before them. If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years under the law. He has to. He doesn't have a choice. He is doing it because he's got the rules and there's no way to get out of it. But on the seventh year, he shall go out as a free man without payment. If he comes alone, he shall go out alone. If he is the husband of a wife, then his wife shall go out with him. If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master and he shall go out alone. But look at verse 5. But if the slave plainly says, Oh, I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out a free man. Then his master shall bring him to God. Then he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl. And he shall serve him forever. You get a picture of freedom there? You get a picture of freedom there. I get a picture of a lot of Christians there as well. I could write my testimony on that particular text. I grew up in a Christian home. I grew up in a spiritual home that honored God. And I went through the motions for a good chunk of my life. And I knew how to talk and I knew how to walk. And I served God. I didn't serve God. It was because I had to. That was what was expected. I was in that cultural framework where it would have been terribly uncomfortable for me to rebel. I didn't. But one day, I got my autonomy. It's called college, you know. and then I had a chance to go free, and I can do what I want, and I did for a while, but you know what? Somewhere along the line, I don't want to give you the whole thing, because this has happened to many of you as well. The Lord Jesus got a hold of me, and my whole relationship changed. It became one of love, and I came back to Him, and I said, I will serve you. You have set me free. I will serve you. I'm going to use my freedom to serve. That's what the slave said. I come back to you. You have set me free. I'm going to blow it to the wind. No, I'm going to use my freedom. my freedom to bring it right back to you here. Nail me. I'm yours. I want to tell you something. I am a free man. I am a free man. But I've taken that freedom and I've said to Jesus, I will gladly be your slave. I am under law. I'm under a law, you know, the law of Christ. The law of Christ is a law of love. We're going to get into that in a minute too. People who understand that kind of liberty, I don't know if I need to elaborate, I think that says it. People who understand that kind of liberty and have experienced it don't need rules. Why would they? The one who has come back and said, I am yours. Why do they need a rule to get them to behave? They've got the internal spirit of God transforming their lives. That's freedom. So first, Paul, what he does before he does anything is he clarifies the call. You are free, beloved. You are free. But use it. Don't abuse it. Use it to serve. Now, he gets real practical. It's as if he says this. Let's get specific. Here's what I mean. When I tell you to use your freedom, don't abuse it. When I tell you to use your freedom, here's what I mean. I'm going to give you some examples. And we'll call the second part. The first part is he clarifies the call. The second part is simply this. He applies the call. The clarification of the call, the application of the call is 13 through 15. The whole text. Don't use it as an opportunity for the flesh. Through love serve one another. The whole law is fulfilled in one word. Love. Don't bite and devour one another. Let's pick it apart one at a time. First of all, he gives us four things that freedom is not. Four? Is it four? Maybe it's three. We'll see. Things that freedom is not. The first thing he says is this. Freedom is not the freedom to indulge the flesh. Know that. Freedom is not the freedom to indulge the flesh. Only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh. That word opportunity is a very interesting word. I think it's worth noting. It's a word of form A. It is a military turn. And it means a base of operation. Literally spoken, it means this. Don't use your freedom as a base of operation for launching into sin. If you use your freedom as your base of operation for launching into sin, then I am going to tell you this. You do not understand your freedom. You probably haven't been set free, really. That is a misuse of freedom. That is a misunderstanding of Christian liberty. and it may in fact indicate that you really have not been set free by Christ. Scriptural proof. We always need that. Jude verse 4 verifies that if you use your freedom constantly as an excuse to do whatever you want, you may not really be free at all. Jude 4 says this. Certain persons have crept in unawares and you know what they've done? They've turned the grace of God into licentiousness. They've turned the grace of God into doing whatever you want. Do you see the two things that Paul was constantly fighting against? He was constantly fighting against people who were taking the grace of God and turning it into licentiousness. And he was constantly fighting against people who would take the grace of God and turn it into legalism. People live in the extreme. He's always calling them to what? Live on that bridge. Live in balance. Same thing in 2 Peter 2, 18 and 19. For speaking out arrogant words of vanity, They entice fleshly desires, promising them freedom. Ah, great. Promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption. 1 Peter says this, don't use your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness. Did you catch the balance? I think you do. I think you do. If you've been following along at all, chapter 5, verse 1, he says, you are free. Be free. Chapter 5, verse 13 says, you are free, but be his as well. Be his. And we don't want to fall into either stream. We don't want to fall into either stream. Preachers do this. I feel an impulse to do this. When I see people who are using their freedom for liberty, for libertinism, for licentiousness, I have an impulse, and so do you, to get in the pulpit and talk about law. You've got to lay down the law. React. Other times when I see people who look like they're acting legalistically and they aren't free in the spirit and it doesn't seem like, it just seems to close in on me, I begin to think I better talk about freedom and really get them going and do whatever you want. We react. We go to one extreme and then to the other. And it's so hard to find that balance. Freedom, first of all, is not freedom to indulge the flesh. Just know that. If you're in that, you don't understand freedom. Secondly, freedom is not freedom to injure others. It's very important. this is real close to home freedom is not freedom to injure others you don't use it as an opportunity to the for the flesh but through love serve one another but through love serve one another this beloved is dealing with a very specific issue he is dealing here with a very specific person he is giving this exhortation to that carefree Christian. He is giving this exhortation to this, to a Christian who understands his liberty. But you know what? Not all Christians have accepted their freedom. There are a lot of Christians who really struggle with liberated living, who really struggle with Holy Spirit-controlled living. They really yearn for external rules. They yearn for someone who will come and tell them what to do and what not to do. That is where they feel safe. That is where they feel secure. And very often, people who are not living under that kind of thing have the internal dwelling of the Spirit, really understand freedom, are under the transforming power of the Spirit, look at that person who needs all those externals and really chafes on Him and says, what a dodo bird. Man alive, why in the world are they like that? They're so uptight. They're so legalistic. It drives me crazy. I wonder if they're even a Christian. I've done that. This text has rebuked me in that. Don't you use your freedom. You who understand freedom. Don't you use your freedom to trample on other people's sensitivity. To those of you who really are free and understand that you're not walking libertine, you're not walking legalistic, you're right on the bridge. Then use your freedom to serve. That word serve is real interesting. You know, one of the complaints I hear is this. You know, if I've got a legalistic friend and they're a Christian, they're not an Ishmael. By the way, I need to make that distinction. Last week was one of the... That was a hard sermon to preach. Because we were really nailing the Ishmaels. And those who are naturally born sons of Abraham, they are characterized by legalism. They just are. They are. That's their characteristic. They don't have anything else. And we talked about getting rid of them, disciplining them out of the church. You better know. You better know that not everyone who has some problems with legalistic things, they are not all Ishmaels. Paul says that right here. One of the complaints I hear among people, however, who really do understand their freedom and that it's all internal and we don't need anything external, is that this, if I yield to those people who are uptight, then they've just got their thumb on me, you know? And it's like, I've just got this, I'm under their bondage and I'm just putting myself in bondage if I do that. I want you to know something about that word serve. Serve one another. It's the same word for bond slave. You know what a bond slave is? The same kind of guy who took his ear and put it on the post. It's one who says, I don't serve you because you got me under your thumb. I don't yield to you and defer to you and love you and I don't act gently toward you who are slow in accepting your freedom. I don't do that because I'm afraid of you or because I think somehow we just better be careful either. It's because I have chosen to place myself in a position of service. Because I'm that free. I'm that free that I can do that. I'll tell you, to do that takes a free person. Serve out of love. And you know what happens if we don't? If we've got people who understand their freedom and they start flaunting their freedom going, What's the matter with all you guys? You're not free. You know what happens? Fifteen. You begin to bite and devour one another. Take care lest you be consumed. And all of it would be in the name of freedom. that would just be the way Satan would do it he would take a good message and just pervert it Romans 14 gives us some insight on this and we need to go to a turn Romans 14 Romans chapter 14 starting verse 1 but now accept the one who is weak in the faith but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions this text says there are two kinds of Christians I talked about three that was my opinion Paul is better, let's go with him, okay? There's two kinds of Christians. There are weak Christians and there are strong Christians. What's a weak Christian? You know what a weak Christian is? A legalistic Christian. That's it. That's what a weak Christian is. A strong Christian is one who understands and lives in freedom. Now, very often the weaker Christian has trouble accepting his or her liberty. They just can't do it. What do you mean, you say? Let's just picture the church in Rome, this one where this book was written, and the church in Galatia. Lots of Jewish people, especially in this church in Rome, some of them got saved and it's great. The first thing that they were told was this. You are free. It's great. Go. You are no more bound to ceremony. You are no longer bound to diet habits. You are no longer bound to feast habits. You are no longer bound to church habits. You are free. You can change all of those things. You know what this guy does? He gags on this stuff. He just gags. I can't handle this. This is crazy. He is not about, even though he's a Christian, he is not about to ignore the Sabbath and ignore all its rules. He is not about to start carrying sticks on the Sabbath, even if he's free to do it. He is not about to start working on Saturday so that he can meet with the Christians on Sunday. He just won't do it. He has grown up that way. That's the way he has been. He, beloved, is a weak Christian. I want you to know that, too. The need for the externals to stay there so I feel secure is a weak thing. It is not an Ishmael thing. how does the person who understands freedom that none of those things matter deal with this one who is still struggling let's say you have them for dinner a big Jewish thing back then would have been eating pork is not a good thing to do and for some who are struggling with their freedom who don't understand their freedom would have real scruples about not eating pork and so this guy he'd be invited over for dinner from this liberated brother and there's on the table there's a big pork pork chops is great what a great thing the guy gags He goes, I can't handle this. This is crazy. You know what else that legalistic friend does? That struggling, weak Christian does? He points his finger at him and says, See, that's what freedom does. It becomes even more legalistic. It becomes even more firm. You need some rules. You need some guidelines. But the free guy goes, Yeah, I'm free. And he just starts waving pork chops under his nose all the time. I'll show you how free I am. I'm afraid I'm going to be free. I'll eat pork chops right in church. Paul says, listen, if you're really free, then you're the mature brother. If you're really free and you understand your freedom and you have really been able to shuck off all those silly, needless externals that give you security, you are the stronger brother. But don't you use that to abuse and hurt the one who's still struggling with it. What you want to do is minister to them. You don't want to leave them there either, though. I'm not talking about giving in and thinking it's okay because it's not okay. It's not okay to be wrapped up in those externals. What we want to do is help those people to grow in what? Grace growing. Grace. And slowly they can maybe strip some of those things away. Let's read on. Now accept the one who is weak in the faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions. Don't get down on him. Serve one another. One man has faith that he may eat all things. No problem. And he is free. But he who is weak eats only vegetables. I don't have time to go into the history of that. It sounds funny just saying it that way. Let not him who eats regard with contempt. the one who does not eat and let not him excuse me and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats for God has accepted him you better you better who are you to judge the servant of another to his own master he stands or falls and guess what stand he will for the Lord is able to make him to stand one man regards one day above another another regards every day alike let each man be fully convinced in his own mind before God, that whether he observes a day or not, is something that he has gone through in his own mind. For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies to himself. I want you to skip over. By the way, I think you know this, but you know, we're talking here about the proverbial gray area. You know, whenever we get into the gray area, even the gray area is gray. I mean, we don't even know exactly what the gray area is. We are not talking here about moral behavior. when believers have differences about lifestyle. We're not talking about laid out morality. We're not saying whether a guy robs or not is up to you, or steals, or has adultery with his neighbor's wife, or murders his friend. We're not talking about whether someone should pray or not. We're not talking about whether someone should walk closely with the Lord or not. Those things are clear. We're talking about gray areas. Should I go shopping on Sunday afternoon at Jacques Penay, you know? Some people have real problems with that. Sunday is a day that you don't do anything. You don't shop. You don't do anything. That's it. A gray area. Do I take the kids to see Star Trek? No, no. Star Wars. I wouldn't take them to see Star Trek. Anyway. Return of the Jedi. Whatever. Do I take them to that? Now I'll tell you. You know. The church is probably divided right down the middle as to whether that's appropriate for a Christian or not. Whether we go to movies, even if it's a good one, and we get all these things and all these disputes, do I do that or not? Even sometimes how we talk, little words we say, there are certain words that are for some people, you know, gee willkers, you know, somebody would be offended by that, I'm sure. Somebody else goes, man alive, what's the matter? And the guy who goes, man alive, what's the matter? Starts going, I'm going to say gee willkers, gee willkers, gee willkers, all over the place, because I'm free to do it. You're not as free as you think. you're not as free as you think if you've got to cram your liberty down somebody else's throat you're not free let's look at verse 14 this is good I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself nothing is unclean you are free you are free but to him who thinks anything is unclean to him it is unclean for if because of food your brother is hurt oh think about that think about some stupid little thing that you got to do for if because of food your brother is hurt you're no longer walking according to love you're under law you're under law but it's so much more powerful than any stupid little rule we put on the back of our church the law is love the law is love for if because of food your brother is hurt you're no longer walking according to love don't destroy with your food him for whom Christ died he's a weaker brother you gotta bring him along therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil you get that? do not let what is for you a good thing to be spoken of as evil for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking it doesn't matter, they don't matter but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit for he who in this way serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men so then let us pursue things which make for peace and the building up of one another. Don't tear down the work of God for the sake of something that doesn't matter. All things are clean. Yes, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense. It is good not to eat meat or not to drink wine or to do anything by which your brother stumbles. It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything by which your brother stumbles. Those days they had problems with eating meat and wine. Today, I don't know if there's anybody who has problems with somebody eating meat. We definitely have problems with people who drink wine. That thing goes on and on and on. I remember when I went to my former church, there was a constant barrage for me to get in the pulpit and talk about how people should never drink wine. Good Christians don't drink wine. And I kept preaching about internal stuff that, you know, there's a lot of good reasons why somebody shouldn't do that. But I began to wonder, why is it that I'm constantly getting this haranguing to not do this thing? It didn't seem balanced. It didn't seem appropriate. Until I found out that they had a guy in that church some years previous to me that came into this church and saw that they were real external. They had all sorts of rules. And he decided he was just going to take all those rules and get them out. And he decided that wine didn't matter and you could drink wine. But instead of just lovingly bringing these people along into freedom, he began to wave pork chops under their nose. And everybody went the other way, real strong. We need standards. We need rules. verse 21 verse 22 the faith which you have have as your own conviction before god i'm sorry verse 21 is the one i wanted again and i want to stop here for a second it is good not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything by which your brother stumbles that word stumble is extremely important i want you to understand this the word stumble there means to halt the progress. To halt the progress of a beloved brother. Sometimes the progress of a beloved brother that I would halt by some behavior that I would do would be a new believer. And the stumbling would be this. It would be a falling back to a former way of life. You got that? Let's say he came out of the drug culture. Let's say he came out of alcoholism or something like that. Let's say he came out of a life that was marked by a real... the word I'm looking for is dependence, dependence, like an alcoholic, on pornography or something like that. And all of a sudden he's with a new Christian, he's with another Christian and you're drinking or you're going to a certain kind of movie or something like that causes him to stumble back into a former way of life. It confuses him, it's not worth it. But there's another kind of person here that it can halt the progress of, not the new believer, but the weak brother. The weak brother is the one who is struggling with externals. He's just not able to let go of all of the little external things. And all these little things make a difference to him. You know how it causes him to stumble? It causes him when he sees your behavior that to him doesn't look appropriate and makes him a little nervous or her a little nervous. He sees your behavior and it causes them to stumble back further into legalism. See what happens when you talk about freedom? Look at that. And they get even tighter and say, we need the rules. It's not worth it. It's not worth it. I want to tell you something. Freedom is not freedom to indulge the flesh. Freedom is not freedom to injure my brother. I am not free to injure my brother. And I am not free to indulge the flesh. Third, I am not free to ignore the law. This is the last one. No, we're three, not four. Verse 14, back in Galatians. This is real quick. Verse 14. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, the statement, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. We've already gone over this, so I don't need to go over it very much. The law is love. I am under law. The law is love. I am not bound in concrete forms of religious systems, but I am bound. I am bound because I have chosen to be bound to the law of Christ, and the law of Christ is the law of love, and that's going to affect everything I do in relation to you and in relation to the Lord. Romans 13, 8 through 10 says this very same thing. It goes talking. I don't have time to go there now, but it gives a rendition of all the laws that we are to keep. Moral laws, love, joy, all these kinds of things. But then it says that the bottom line in the law, don't covet, don't rob, don't steal, don't commit adultery. And then it says the law is fulfilled in one word, love. You know why? Because if you love, you don't need laws. If I love you, I won't covet after what you have. If I really love you, I would never commit adultery with your wife. If I love you, I wouldn't take anything that is yours. Love is the law that I live under, and I don't need any other rules. if that's really an operation that's the only restraint I need my liberty if real if it is real if it is Holy Spirit induced will be fully expressed not in fleshly indulgence but in holy living not in injuring a weaker brother but in loving patience not in ignoring the law but in joyful obedience last question how does this operate? how does this expression how is this expression of love how is this expression of liberty that is under control, that is on the bridge, made possible. How do you get people to live on the bridge? We've had a clarification. We've had an application. Now an explanation. I say to you, verse 16, I say to you, here's how. I say to you, make some rules. Force conformity and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. No, it doesn't say that. But I say to you, walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. I'm not going to preach on that now because we don't have time. We're going to begin in that next time we meet and really expand what it means to walk in the Spirit. But I want to just close with this. The operation of Christian liberty is not automatic. The operation of Christian liberty is not automatic. I don't believe that unless we are getting good teaching, I don't believe that unless we are, with an act of our will, plugging into the resource that we have within us, that we can stay on the bridge. We're going to fall into one or the other. We are given to extremes. it's going to take some sort of discipline to stay on that bridge but it has got to be an internal thing it has got to be the work of the Holy Spirit in me it can't be anything external when I was saved I was redeemed out of the control of any religious system to get me to do anything into the control of a person God the Holy Spirit Paul said this Christ in you that's your only hope of living gloriously not rules by a church that's not any hope of living gloriously Christ in you that's my only hope no rules no strict church no harsh discipline how are you using your freedom? do you understand your freedom? do you understand the extent to which you've been set free? some of you need to be set free some of you are using your freedom in an abusive way maybe a lot of you need to come this morning and say Lord you set me free but I'm using my freedom to serve myself and I would come to you this morning and have you pierce my ear I would serve you out of love I would serve you out of freedom I would serve you out of joy you know what I want you to do? I want you to stand right now and some of you can just offer this up to the Lord again and reaffirm your freedom reaffirm why you give and why you serve some of you need to do it now, today this morning before you leave. I'm going to ask those of you who need to do that, to need to pray about this and really bring it to the Lord and say, I'm tired of living under legalism. I am tired of living libertine. I want to be on that bridge. Would you come and we'll pray. Bye.
