Last week, if you were with us, I'm sure you remember that in the context of our coming to know Jesus as our rabbi, because that's the series we're in right now, following the way of the rabbi. Also, last week, in the context of preparing ourselves for the communion table, at which we were, as a people, going to celebrate, I asked a question, and it kind of drove the entire service. The question was this, who is welcome at our rabbi's table? It's a pretty important question, and as we got into some history, it's always been an important question, even in the context of Jesus' life, because the fact is this, as it comes to table fellowship, very few things got Jesus, our rabbi, in more trouble, particularly with very religious people like the Essenes and the Pharisees, who we have come to know quite intimately in the last couple of weeks. Few things got Jesus in more trouble than who it was he invited to and welcomed at his table because he continually invited and included the wrong kind of people, like prostitutes and publicans, like the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame, as the parable in Luke chapter 14, which was the focus of our study last week, so vividly illustrated. And not only did he identify or have table fellowship with those kind of people, he didn't mind, apparently, being identified with That meant he surely was. He paid a price because people assumed that if he moved with people like that, he was himself a drunkard and a sinner himself. So we talked about last week who is welcome at his table and who isn't and why. And it was a particular joy for me last week to be among the servers, many of you who served communion last week, who were saying over and over again to anyone who came for the bread and for the wine these words, you are welcome at the rabbi's table. The rabbi welcomes you to his table. Because what you need in order to come to his table is, number one, you just need to be nuts about the rabbi. So if you're nuts about this rabbi and you're saying, I want to follow this rabbi, and you kind of have room in your heart for the people that the rabbi has invited, like the poor and the blind and the lame and crippled, then you're welcome to come to this table, then come. But all of that raised for me last week another question. Beyond the question, who's welcome at the rabbi's table? I was left last week with this question, who's welcome at mine? I mean, I was able to watch, because I saw it firsthand as you were affected by those words, coming to the table and being able to look in some of your eyes and saying, you're welcome to the rabbi's table. And some of you even verbally coming back at me and my wife, both of us, and saying, it's so good to be here. And seeing just what it did to your spirit, but then it makes me wonder, what if that same spirit was extended beyond here? And that's where this question came from. Who's welcome at my table? Who's welcome at our table, at your table? How big is my life, as it were? How broad? And does my table, The people and the people I include in it look at all like my rabbis. I mean, could I get in any trouble for who's at my table, for who I include? Well, that'd be an interesting way to kind of test whether your table looks anything like the rabbis to see if you could get in any trouble because of it. Well, that question bothered me. The rest of last Sunday and all of Monday, I thought about it. I called Keith and Terry and members of the message team. Whenever I get an idea like this, I kind of don't necessarily trust it at the beginning. I just smell something, and so I want feedback from other people. Do you think this question is worth pursuing? This process, is it worth pressing into for another week? And then in the process of thinking about that, I thought of a friend of mine who embodies this whole thing. Because beyond just asking the question, who's welcome at my table, this friend of mine has done some things that have expanded his table, that have enlarged his heart. And it's why early in the week I asked him if he could come this weekend. Because real transformation comes in the doing. Real transformation doesn't come, I mean, I love this series we're in right now, but real transformation doesn't come by understanding new things about the rabbi. It comes in following him. Transformation comes in doing things the rabbi would have you do. Stephan Van Voorst is a friend of mine. He's a friend of ours. He's led worship here several times. And if you were ever here when he was here, you remember him well because there was a big hole in the roof when he was done. That's a good thing. We've had him in the pulpit to speak. Indeed, he's one of the reasons that when I think of the next generation, I have great hope. Because Stephan is one of among many, among us, who are taking very seriously what it means to follow the way of the rabbi. And when I think of young men and women in our church who are the next generation, and I think of our church's commitment and passion to calling out the next generation, one of the things we need to dial into, if we are going to be a church that calls out the next generation, there's two things. One, we need to be willing, as the older generation, to wear the mantle of a father and a mother, of parent, and to create paths for others to walk on. But the other thing we need to do, and that is this, every once in a while, in fact, a lot, to stop and turn around and listen to them. Because there is much to learn from young men and women who are committing themselves in very serious ways, in doing ways to follow the way of the rabbi. Stephan, would you come? Welcome Stephan Van Vos. Well, hello. It's an honor to be here. I love this series that you're in because I love learning about Jesus and hearing stories about Jesus and just playing around with what does it mean to follow this Jesus, this rabbi. And I think the question that Dave posed is really an interesting question. It's a question that I swim around in a lot, thinking about how big is my table, and does it need to get bigger? A good friend of mine says this. He said, and I think about this a lot, he says, when you become a follower of Jesus, you lose your right to reject anyone. So that's kind of the water that I swim around in, just thinking, like, who am I rejecting? Who feels rejected by me? And what does it look like for me to expand my table so that they feel welcome, so that they feel like they can come and belong? And so today, I really just want to share some of my story with you. I don't have any real profound thoughts and deep theological knowledge, but I have a story that started with me just experimenting. It started because I was having a sort of faith crisis, some of what Dave was talking about. I grew up in the church and had believed, you know, in Jesus all my life. But a few years ago, I was wrestling with this question of, well, what does that really look like in my life? Like how does my life reflect being a follower of this rabbi? And I realized something that I don't know how to follow the rabbi if I don't know the rabbi. And so I thought, well, I better get to know the rabbi. So I dove into the Gospels. And I did some things that a lot of people were like, I don't know if this is a good thing, Stephan. But I just did it anyway. And what I did was I looked at some of Jesus' teachings. And, you know, some of the way I've been trained is you have to dig in and do all this study of the teachings and figure out what did he really mean. But I said, I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to go try the teaching. I'm not going to try to figure out what Jesus really meant. Instead, I'm just going to obey it. I'm just going to do it, see what happens, and maybe afterwards I'll have an idea of what he meant. So one of the first teachings that I turned to came from Luke 14. In Luke 14, Jesus is sitting with some Pharisees And they're sharing a meal together They're at the table with one another And Jesus is teaching these Pharisees And this is what happens Then Jesus said to his host When you give a luncheon or a dinner Do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives Or your rich neighbors If you do, they may invite you back And so you will be repaid But when you give a banquet Invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind And you will be blessed so I'm looking at these teachings thinking okay I'm just going to do this right who knows what will happen I'll just try it so I got my friends together and we lived in just outside the city limits of Detroit and in a little suburb called Royal Oak, Michigan and there's a fairly significant homeless community there so I got my friends together and I said hey let's throw a banquet for people who can't repay us so we planned this time on a Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock. We grabbed all these burgers and hot dogs and chips and all this stuff, and we went to this park right by downtown Royal Oak. And we went into the streets, and we said, hey, we're having a free meal, a picnic, a barbecue together. We want you to come and join us and eat. So if you're hungry, come and eat. And so 3 o'clock on Sunday rolls around, and we didn't know if it was going to be 5 or 500 people. We had no idea. So we had kind of guessed with the food, and we're sitting in the park, and all of a sudden people start rolling in, right? People that we had never seen, black, white, young, old. Some were walking, some were in wheelchairs. The most diverse group of people you've ever seen. And before you know it, we're sitting across the table from one another, sharing stories of our lives with one another, talking about fun things like movies and things I didn't think I'd talk about with homeless people. But I was surprised at what we talked about. Well, about an hour in, I looked at the food and I looked at the people and I thought, we have too much food. So we either need to give us some food or we need to find some more people. So I go to a friend named Dave who has taught me so much about what it means to follow the rabbi. He spent most of his life in prison, lives on the streets. And I said, Dave, we have more food. We need more people. He says, do you have a car? I said, yeah, I have a car. I had a little Ford Escort station wagon. And he said, well, let's go. And so Dave and I got in my car while everybody else was eating, and we took off, and Dave took me to the cracks and crevices of Royal Oak, Michigan. And guess what we found? We found people. and I remember just we're going down the street and Dave he's so fired up about this whole deal and he's yelling out the windows hey picnic in the park free food come and eat with us right this radical invitation and then we went to places like the bus stop and the alleyways and places where the poor were hanging out and Dave would say hey we're having a barbecue come and join us. And I remember one guy coming up and saying, well, do we have to pray? And Dave says, no, we don't have to pray. Just get in. So people start taking off. Some are on their bikes and they all head to the park. And my car fills up, a little Ford Escort station wagon, fills up with homeless people. And we drive back to the barbecue and we sit and we eat and we talk. And one of the things I found out is that homeless people don't have a real tight schedule. So we were there for a long time. And it was great. Some amazing things happened because of that day, because we invited the poor to the table. What happened is that I got invited to theirs. And that's where I learned about how radically diverse and big the rabbi's table is. That's where I started to learn it. I remember sitting with them one night outside of a Jimmy John's, and somebody had gotten some day-old bread. And we were all sitting on a street. They have benches on the curb, and it was on the main street of Royal Oak. And somebody had day-old Jimmy John's bread, and they took a piece, and there was probably 10, 15 of us, and I think I was probably the only one other than maybe my wife that was not homeless. And it was like 7 o'clock at night, and so they're passing the bread around, and a friend named Ricky is next to me, and he says, Hey, man, have some bread. And I'm thinking, one, I just ate, so I'm not really hungry. Two, I have a whole cabinet full of food at home. I don't need any bread. These people need bread way worse than I do. They need food. So I, very politely thinking this was the right thing to do, I said, no, thank you. I'm fine. And Ricky looks at me, he's like, dude, take some bread. I said, no, man, I'm good. And he looks at me again and he said, dude, take some bread. And I'm kind of slow, right? But I realized when he said that the last time, it wasn't about the bread. it was about something greater it was about belonging it was about being a part of them so I took the bread and I passed it to the next person it was fascinating to be seated at their table and hear some of their perspectives one of the things that had never come up was religion and I never brought it up but from time to time they would talk about interactions with Christians and because I had been invited to their table and they just saw me as Stephan and not Stephan the Christian or anything like that they would tell me about interactions with Christians and it was fascinating to hear how Christians gave and how they didn't give and one of the things that became apparent and I saw this played out several times is that there seemed to be conditions that Christians had for inviting the poor to their table. One of the conditions is, and you heard it reflected in the man who said, do we have to pray? One of the conditions is we need to pray first. And so I remember one day, it was actually Ricky again, he comes up, he says, hey man, we got some burgers today. Somebody gave us some free burgers. I said, really? I said, what'd you have to do? Because I kind of had figured out the pattern, right? He says, well, we had to pray first, but it was no big deal. We just quick prayed, and then we got to eat. Interesting, huh? I started to see conditions. It's very common. In many food shelters, you can come and eat, but sit through the worship service first. There's an invitation to the table, but there's some conditions first. and the poor locked onto it. They knew it. They knew the game and they played it. But for me, it gave me a deep sadness because I began to see a disconnect between how I saw the rabbi's invitation with how I saw the invitation of Christians. Some of the things that I learned, some of the questions that came out of that experience are what are my conditions? if I want to invite people to my table what are some of the things that people feel they have to do before they can come to be with me to be in relationship with me what are some of those conditions not that I might intentionally be doing but just unintentionally be totally unaware of what do my friends feel like is a condition to be in relationship with me what are the conditions to come to the table of Stefan another thing that I learned from them is this amazing ability to put the needs of the community and belonging before the personal needs. When they're passing around that bread, I thought, man, some of these people, this is the only bite of food they're eating all day. And yet it's more important for them, for the people in the circle to know they belong than to get their fill. And I started thinking about the rabbi's table and I thought, you know what? This is more than just eating and drinking. the rabbi's table is about belonging the poor taught me that I wonder what I would be missing if I hadn't been able to expand the table to involve people who were not like me I realized being with them that there was things about being Christ-like in the world that I just was missing I was blind to I wasn't aware and I needed to be around people who were different than me to understand one of the other things that I realized in being with them is that the truth is that the people around my table were my friends they were like me and so it was very comfortable my table was very comfortable and when I spent time with the poor I realized that not only was my table people like me but I needed to diversify and expand my table because there's things I needed to learn about Jesus. And if I didn't do that, I would miss some stuff. And so I really started thinking about this. Who's welcome? Who wants to come and feel like they belong? And who have I really invited? And the question that gets a little scary is how far do you take this, right? Like how open is the invitation and who do we really dare invite? And I, you know, we draw these lines all the time, right? Well, I'll go this far, but not that far. That's too far. We can't go there. But then the voice of my friend, when you follow Jesus, you lose your right to reject anyone. That voice scares me because it's like, oh boy, what does that mean about my table? How big is it? So I was looking through the gospels and I'm thinking about this idea that the people around my table were like me. And what does that cost? And Jesus says something interesting in Matthew 5, 46 and 47. He says this, if you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. This is an interesting thought by Jesus, because Jesus is kind of saying, listen, if you love the people who love you back, if you're sitting with friends and people like you, if you're doing this, this is how the world operates. He said that there's a greater love. What does it look like to move beyond that group of people? Could you move to the group of people who would not love you back? The context for that passage comes after maybe the most radical words in all of Scripture to me. And that is this. Jesus tells his followers, love your enemies. Now that is scary. Because to be honest, opening up my table to the poor was pretty easy compared to that. Opening up my table to the enemies, that's scary. that's scary I was talking with a friend of mine from the Middle East about this idea of what it means to sit down at a table with your enemies and he says to me, he says, Stephan in the Middle East that doesn't happen he said that you don't sit down at the table with an enemy and he says if you do, you don't leave his enemies you leave his friends he says, so if an enemy invites you to the table to their table what they're saying is I want to move towards you I want to move towards relationship and if the enemy accepts reconciliation will happen because in the Middle East there's such sacredness around sharing a meal with one another it's very very important and so when Jesus is giving these pictures of a banquet and sharing meals the way people are hearing that is probably pretty different than how we hear it If you think about that thought, like how they would hear it, then imagine what Psalm 23, this beautiful picture of the kingdom of God, sounds like to those ears. Verse 5, it says this, You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. Now, I don't know why I thought this. It's kind of weird. I guess I just didn't think about it too much. But the picture I always got is that this verse is me sitting at this table, feasting and all this food, and my enemies are around watching me eat. And it's kind of like, ha ha, look, I'm eating and you're not. God loves me and has blessed me, and you're getting what you deserve. But if you read that verse through the lens of what my friend was talking about, through the lens of how a Middle Eastern ear would hear that, Something amazing is happening. And what God has prepared is not just a table, but a setting for reconciliation to happen, where enemies become friends. The table is more than just about eating, although it is about eating. It's more than just belonging, although it is about belonging. I think the table is also about enemies becoming friends. And so the invitation to my table becomes very important if I truly want to be reconciled with my enemies. I think Jesus did this. If I was to think about who is the enemies of Jesus, the first thing I think about are religious leaders. Have you ever looked through the Gospels and see how many times Jesus is sharing a meal with leaders? It's amazing. I think he did it. Well, I kind of come to the question, well, who's my enemy? Right? If that's what the rabbi would do, if that's the direction that followers of the rabbi go, then who's my enemy? And I think if you were asking me today, like, Stephan, who are the people you hate? Who are the people you reject? I could probably think of a few. But to be honest, I'm a pretty laid-back guy. I don't know that I hate anyone. But there's another way to ask that question that I think is interesting. And that would be, Stephen, who sees you as an enemy? Not who do you feel maybe is an enemy, but who sees you as an enemy? And what does it look like for you to go and invite them to your table if they see you as an enemy? I think this is the beauty of the Good Samaritan this story where Jesus is talking with with folks and they're talking about eternal life and they talk about loving God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength and loving your neighbor as yourself and a man says well who's my neighbor? in other words where's the line? and then Jesus tells this story of a Jewish man who's going from Jerusalem to Jericho and on the way he gets robbed, beaten and left for dead and so he's laying on the side of the road and a Jewish priest comes by and he sees the Jewish man left for dead and he keeps on walking and then another man, a Levite comes by and he sees the man left for dead and he keeps walking as well but then a Samaritan comes by now if you know anything about Jews and Samaritans you know that these are enemies they are not people who get along they avoid each other at all costs who sees me as an enemy well here's where the Samaritan messes everything up the Samaritan doesn't act like an enemy the Samaritan moves toward the man who's hurt and he does something enemies don't do and he takes care of them and the universe is messed up right do you think the Jewish man could ever look at Samaritans the same again I don't think he could that Samaritan just messed everything up there's a whole other message in the idea that Jesus used the Samaritan as an example that's an amazing thought But the point that I want to bring out is this idea that who sees me as an enemy? And how do I begin to act the way enemies don't? How do I do things that enemies don't do? I'll tell you. Come to my table. I want to be with you. Enemies don't do that. Again, I learned this from the least likely of people. One of the many great surprises of my life. My wife and I, last spring, went to the Middle East. And we wanted to be immersed in Arab culture. Because we had a lot of questions. We wanted to understand Arabs. We wanted to understand Islam. We wanted to understand poverty and the issues going on in the Middle East. And so we went. And the response that we got from people was pretty interesting. Because most people who didn't know us, their reaction was like, Are you crazy? Are you crazy? They see you as the enemy. and you're going right into the lion's den. What are you thinking? And my wife was six months pregnant at the time and so we're going to doctor's appointments and doctors are just baffled. They weren't concerned about her health in terms of a pregnant woman traveling. It was more the idea that you're going to the Middle East. I mean, they hate us, right? Now, as much as I would like to say that I had thought through that and my thinking was right and not saying, I don't know if they hate us, but it's hard to escape the messages that were sent in our culture because the message that Americans are sent is the message that Arabs really hate us. They want to kill us. That's the message. And so for us moving in this, that message is still part of my DNA. These are still things I've heard, and when I was there, I found something completely different. I found people who didn't operate like enemies. We flew from Paris to Amman, Jordan, and on the way to Amman, we sat next to an Arab man who lived in Jordan, and we started talking with him. And as we're talking with him, he starts talking about his kids. And he starts talking about his wife. And he's sharing with us what he does for work, and that he travels, and he really misses his family when he's gone, and he couldn't wait to get home to see his family. And he was so excited for Meredith because, you know, he saw we were expecting a child, and he was so excited for us, and so he's telling us about his firstborn. And side note, if you ever want to be treated like a queen, go to the Middle East as a pregnant woman. It's incredible. It really is. So we're talking with him. Well, we land, and we're taxiing towards the gate, and he does something that just blew me away. He says, where does your friend live? Because I can take you to his house. Now, Amman's a few million people It's a huge city I'm like, what? You're going to take us He's like, yeah, do you know where they live? I'll take you there Well, our friends were actually meeting us So I said, oh man, that's so generous of you But our friends are here, they're at the airport And we'll be fine, you know Then he pulls out his cell phone He says, well, do you want to call them? Do you know their number? Just to tell them that you're safe so they know that you've made it. Enemies don't do that. And now my universe is messed up. It's messed up. I can't look at Arabs the same. We're traveling to the desert in southern Jordan. We had to stop and ask for directions. And a man comes out of his house, walks across his yard through a ditch, sticks his head in the car. And they're all speaking Arabic. And so I don't have a clue. I don't know anything in Arabic other than one word. And that's the word for peace. And so they have their head in the car. And my wife and I are in the back. And they're talking and talking and talking. And you can tell, like, our hosts are trying to get going. And the man won't let us go. And we finally take off down the road. And my wife says, what was he saying? And our host said, oh, he was begging us to come in for tea. That sounds normal, right? Enemies don't do that. Enemies don't invite you to their table. I learned it from Arabs I believe it's the heart of the rabbi there are people out in the world that see you, that see us as enemies and when we make the invitation to our table it messes up their universe they can't think the same about us they can't think the same about Christians and they can't think the same about the rabbi. It just doesn't work. Because the table is more than just eating. It's more than just belonging. It's a place where enemies become friends. I want the world to know that they can come to my table. I want all people to know that they're welcome at my table, that they belong with me, and that I want to be friends. I really want the world to know that if they can find followers of the rabbi, that they're welcome to their table, that they can belong there, and that the followers of the rabbi want to be friends. but even more than that I want people to know that they can come to the table of their creator that they can belong there and as they drink and as they eat they can become friends with their creator again that's the kingdom of God and that is good news thank you thank you Stephan, so how big is your table? We're going to sing a song. It's the song, the offertory, that I said made sense relative to the sermon. It's a song that Stephan wrote. It connects with this. But as we sing it, in fact, why don't you stand with me as we close. The ushers are going to hand out these little white cards here. I don't know. Maybe it's a little cheesy. I don't know. It says reserved on it. It's kind of what you put on a table when you've saved a place for somebody who you want at your table. We're going to give these away, and I want you to take them and wonder about someone who belongs at your table who isn't welcome now. Maybe a kind of person who the rabbi is saying, you need to make your table. If you're going to be a follower of me, your table's going to have to get a little bigger. And this is a way to look at it and think of it. Maybe stick it in your Bible. Let's pray as we go to this closing song. Father, thank you for this word. Thank you for Stephan and the things that he's doing that calls us to follow our rabbi that way, this way. Holy Spirit come. Amen. Make us instruments of peace where there's hatred let love rain make us instruments of peace dissonance bring harmony Oh Prince of Peace Your song we sing To be sons and daughters of the King Shalom Shalom Shalom Make us instruments Make us Instruments of peace bringing hope to hopeless things make us instruments of peace in darkness light for all the sea Prince of Peace This song we sing To be sons and daughters of King We sing these words of peace Salvation Oh Prince of Peace Oh Prince of Peace Just always sing To be sons and daughters of the king Lord, thanks for this day. Thank you for the way that you have modeled loving enemies, welcoming people as they are. I pray that we would follow in your way. Teach us more. in your name, amen. Have a great week.
