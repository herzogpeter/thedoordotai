The class you're in, if you're not aware, is dealing with despair. The purpose of the class is to, first of all, help people become better equipped in our church body to deal with people who are in significant kinds of pain. A lot of times we have no idea what to do, and because of that, we have a tendency to run away. And we don't want to do that, and we want to get deeply involved in people's lives, but because sometimes we think we have to say something or somehow fix it, we kind of run away. And so part of this, the agenda that we've got for teaching this, is to just help people who run into people who have pain. And you're gonna. You maybe have people right now. The other thing is that some of you may be in pain right now. Maybe we all are at some level. Some of you are in what we would call real deep despair, a loss of someone you love deeply, a loss of some real significant thing in your life, not even just a person, but Jeff talked last week, I thought importantly about dreams that are dead, directions you thought you were going to go and you can't, things like that that we're in grief about. Last week what Jeff dealt with was the cycle that we go through, and we're not always aware that we go through it, but the cycle we go through when we grieve. The first is denial. We can't hardly believe it. Anger, it's really not directed anywhere. It comes out in ways that doesn't make sense sometimes. Blaming, and also that's kind of blaming slash bargaining, if I only would have done this or if I only would have done that. And Jeff was just recounting how when his dad died, he got real mad at the doctors who couldn't do anything. And he got mad at his dad, and that was goofy. And it was just displaced stuff all over the place. And then depression, where there's kind of a shutdown. He called that stage, at least part of that stage, was kind of a gift because it's just kind of an overload and you shut down. And then acceptance. And the acceptance wasn't, if you recall, it wasn't feeling, coming to the place where you felt like it never happened. That was not acceptance. In fact, coming to the place where you feel like it never happened might be a form of denial. Acceptance was the ability to really receive and understand that it did happen, be as sad about it as you are, but not have it interfere with your life. And that's when you've gone through the cycle. The other thing you need to know, and I talked about this with Jeff later and some of you later, is that it's not always as one, two, three, wonderfully orchestrated as it sounds. Sometimes we get stuck. Sometimes you go through the whole thing at different levels, and you go through it for even some years and you'll be feeling things years down the road that you don't know what that's about. And it's just kind of the cycle of grieving. What we're going to do today is move into the book of Job. And Job is for us going to be an illustration of grief. It's going to give us an opportunity to do what C.S. Lewis did in his book called The Grief Observed, Observe a Grief. Job is a person who is in tremendous despair. He's lost a lot. We're going to read about that in a minute. But the thing that's significant to me about Job and the pain he's in is that he's a mess when he gets in it. There's some very confusing things that happen. There's some very confusing things that he says. He says some things that don't sound very godly in the middle of his mess, some things that are very scary and shaky. The fact is this, that in the process that Job goes through, he doesn't always look real good. And that's part of what we need to understand about people's grief, ours and other people's. I'd like to pray, and then we're going to get to our notes. Let's pray. Father, I thank you that you are our comforter. And Father, while we need to be responsible to each other in profound ways, and hopefully this will help us do that at deeper levels to each other, we need to be responsible. but God, your Spirit is our comforter beyond what words and what humans can touch. And I pray that as we go into this study that it would be more than a study, but that the truth of this that you placed in this book would be used to quicken our minds and our hearts and be used by the power of the Spirit to, number one, teach us about people we can minister to in despair and teach us about ourselves and some of the things we go through. We just pray you control this time in Jesus' name. Amen. Moving into your notes, if you have them, I hope you do. They were out in the table in the foyer if you want to get some. I don't know if there's anybody out there to hand them out. But there's four things I want you to know about the book of Job as we begin. The first thing I want you to know is that you're going to need your Bibles. I really encourage you to have your Bibles with you. It's going to be a lot easier for you to follow this if you have it, just because a lot of this is going to be dialogue. And I'll be reading right from the text. If you don't, I don't think you're going to get lost, but I just encourage you in the next couple of weeks to bring it if you can remember to do that. The second thing I want you to know about this is that Job is the oldest book in the Bible. Now, that doesn't sound like this terribly significant thing, but it is, and I want you to know that because it is significant. Genesis is not the first book written in the Bible. It is in the Bible, but it wasn't the first written book. Job was the first written book. And the reason I think that's significant is this. It tells me and it tells us that from the very beginning, God knew and he cared about people who had a hurting heart. I think that matters. And we're going to hear that all through this book. There's a third thing I want you to know about the book of Job as we just pile into this, and that is this, that there are three divisions in the book. There are three divisions in the book. First of all, there is the prologue, chapters 1 and 2. There is what we would call the poem or the dialogue in chapters 3 through 41. And then there is thirdly the epilogue, and that's chapter 42, the epilogue in chapter 42. The funny thing, and I mentioned this briefly last week, is that most of what we know about Job is in the prologue and in the epilogue, in the first two chapters and in the last chapter. And the reason I believe that we know so much about those two chapters and then the first two chapters and then the last chapters because what we find in those two chapters fits very nicely into what we think people ought to look like when they grieve. It fits very nicely into what we think we want to look like when we grieve. Job is responding real appropriately. He's saying very nice things. He means them, but it's real safe, and it keeps all of our little boxes and all of our little paradigms of how we're supposed to act very, very secure. I think one of the reasons we don't know much about chapter 3 through 41 is because much of what we read in those chapters is puzzling, it's troubling, makes us nervous, we can get very confused, and it will shake the foundations of simple solutions and easy answers. And if you have simple solutions to pain and easy answers to people's despair, Job chapter 3 through 41 is going to be a hard thing for you to hear. I think one of the reasons that those chapters shatter our simple answers is because chapter 3 through 41 is coming from the perspective of being in pain. 1, 2, 3 formulas are very satisfactory before you've had pain. Do you follow that? Little simple answers and nice little appropriate responses work real well until you've had real significant pain. C.S. Lewis wrote many books, but two of them were, One was A Grief Observed, and another one was The Problem of Pain. A Grief Observed was a book that he wrote in response to his own wife's death. And as he later looked at the two books that he wrote, he commented on both of those books by saying this, The problem of pain I wrote, and the perspective I had, was that of pain under the microscope. Do you understand that? It's kind of what we're going to do a little bit. It's like looking at Job and observing pain, and he wrote down what he observed, and he made tremendous insights. a grief observed he said i was on the slide different perspective job is on the slide and and when you're on the slide the one two three stuff doesn't satisfy very much and so a lot of that stuff's going to get blown up the fourth thing i want you to know is that job's a drama the reason that's important to know is because this i'm not going to teach this the way i normally teach the things i teach as you know i believe that before the foundation of the world, there were three points to everything. And it just doesn't, this doesn't work like that. And it's a drama. And so if you're waiting for my three points, you're going to be panicking when you're waiting, because I'm going to, he's really going to go long today, because I'm never going to get to it. It's just going to be a drama. And in fact, when we end, there's going to be a sense in which things are going to be kind of hanging up in the air, and things aren't going to be resolved. And that's okay, too, because that's like life. And that's what this book's about. I want you to know that as we go through it. Let's get into the book and find out a little bit about our hero. I read the text, just the first couple chapters last week, but I want to go a little slower and pick a few things out. Let's just find out a little bit about the personage of this book, Job, chapter 1, verses 1 through 5. There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil. And seven sons and three daughters were born to him, His possessions also were 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and very many servants. And that man was the greatest of all the men of the East. And his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite three sisters to eat and drink with them. And it came about when the days of feasting had completed their cycle, that Job would send and consecrate them, rising up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. Thus Job did continually. What do we know about Job so far? Just get a little profile on him. First thing we know about him is he is called blameless. He's a godly man, a genuinely godly man. So whatever that means, in vague terms or in very specific terms, Job was a godly man. He was an upright man. I would say there was no, he wouldn't have been called godly if he was a hypocrite. So his godliness was not hypocrisy. It was real. He was upright. He was rich. We see that with all of the possessions that he had. He had a tremendous amount of status. It says that in the third verse, he was the greatest of all men in the East. So he had tremendous status. And the other thing, whether we can relate to any of those other characteristics, we can probably relate to the last thing we know about Job from those verses. And that is this. worried about his kids because they were doing things that made him nervous and he was always trying to go and fix them or at least make sure God was okay with him. I don't have time to do his inventory on that. The scene turns to heaven in verse 6. Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan also was among them. And the Lord said to Satan, from where do you come? And Satan answered the Lord and said, from roaming about on the earth and walking around on it. And this eighth verse is like, I hope this conversation never happens about me. You know what I mean? It's like this is the most unfair verse. I'm going, oh, please, oh, please, don't do this. And the Lord said to Satan, setting him up it feels like, we're going to, by the way, come back to this. In the last talk, we're going to come back to this because this really bugs me. Have you considered my servant Job? For there was no one like him on all the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. Feels like God is picking a fight here with Satan and he's using Job. Verse 9, Then Satan answered the Lord sarcastically, Does Job fear God for nothing? Give me a break, God. I mean, he doesn't serve you and obey you and love you because there's all these wonderful motives. You've paid him off well. Look at the payoff. Verse 10, Hast thou not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. What makes his faith so special, God? I don't see anything special at all. You've blessed him, you've honored him, you've given him status, you've taken care of him. Of course he blesses you. But if you take away his props, he'll curse you to your face. That's what Satan says in verse 11. But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he has. He will surely curse thee to thy face. Take away the hedge. In verse 12, permission is granted as this drama continues. And the Lord said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only do not put forth your hand on him. So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord. Verse 13, It happened on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house that a messenger came to Job and said the oxen were plowing, the donkeys feeding beside them. The Sabians attacked and took them. They also slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. Right after that, in verse 16, while he was still speaking, another also came and said, The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you. And while he was still speaking that, another also came and said, The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels, took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. And while he was still speaking that, another also came and said, The worst news of all, your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house. And behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house. It fell on the young people, and they have all died. You've lost your family, Job, and I alone have escaped to tell you. He's having a real bad day. his financial empire has evaporated in one day the status that he had in the community is gone in one day and worst of all his kids are gone in one day and Job's initial response in verse 21 is this he rose, tore his robe, shaved his head, fell to the ground in worship that is one of the signs, clearly a sign of grief doing that and then he said, naked I came from my mother's womb, naked I shall return there. The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Through all of this, Job did not sin, nor did he blame God. And with that, we're real comfortable. That feels real good. And I don't want to assume any big agendas on Job right now in terms of bad motives. There are some possibilities for that response, though, and I want you to consider every one of them. One of the reasons he responded so appropriately could be because of genuine nobility. He's just hanging on to God for dear life, and that is a real possibility. And by the way, these possibilities I'm going to throw out at you will kind of get a handle on which was the real one as the drama continues. Another possibility is that he's in denial. The real depth of what's going on hasn't hit him at all, and he's just kind of going through some things that he knows he ought to say. I'm not real sure it's denial at this point. It seems to me that he's pretty in touch with this as an awful thing. He shaved, he tore his robe, he shaved his head, he fell on the ground in worship, and he's crying out to God. The one I gave you last week, however, is one that I'd like you to consider, and I think it's a possibility that without trying to defame him too much, there's something that I think we can all relate to a little bit, and that is that he may just be working his formula a little bit. All Job's life, if he did the right thing, his relationship with God was this. If I do this, this, and this, God will do this, this, and this. And to keep working the formula, he's basically saying this very possibly. I need to handle this well. I need to respond to this pain right. Because if I respond to it well and I respond to it right, it might go away. I don't know that Job's doing that, but I know I've done that. And I think that you've done that from time to time. The response was really fueled by a hope that if I respond right, this will go away. God will respond to my trust by making things better. One of the ways you can spot that that's what's going on is this. If you're doing that behavior to make the pain go away, if the pain doesn't go away, you know what happens after that? You go absolutely nuts. I mean, it turns into rage. but now the plot thickens he's responded well he passed the test if you will if this was a test and again there was a day chapter 2 and the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan also came among them to present himself before the lord and the lord said to satan where have you come from satan answered from roaming about that's what he did the lord said have you considered my servant job again there's none like him on the earth a blameless and upright man fearing God, turning away from evil. And Satan said, again, chapter, verse 4, I'm just kind of moving down here quickly, fine, but skin for skin, you let me touch his body. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. However, put forth thy hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face. And God gave permission. In verses 7 and 8, Satan does just that. Satan touches his body. He ends up with sore boils from the sole of his feet to the crown of his head in verse 7. It says that he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes, and that's just a piece of pottery. I don't know if you can... I can't even deal with that. I don't know what that was like. And then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die. The way I picture that is this. His wife walks in. He is an absolute mess. Everything has gone to pot. His body is filled with boils. Status is gone. Everything is over. He's sitting there scraping the pus off of his sores. His wife comes in and looks at him and says, Aren't you a little tired of acting so spiritual? Why don't you get off this high and mighty thing and do what you really want to do, curse God and die? Now, some of that was projecting her own thing because she wanted to curse God and die. Job hangs tough again not only has he lost his possessions his family, his status and his health but now his wife's on his case and he said to her verse 10 you speak as one of the foolish women speaks shall we indeed accept good from God and not adversity and all of this Job did great he put his wife right where she belonged You can't say that. And again, maybe that's because he was just so noble and so righteous and it was wonderful. It could also be that she was getting a little too close to the real feelings he had. It could also be that if he was still working this formula, the biggest fear he had is if he gave in to some of the things he was really feeling, it would be over. I'm still working this thing, hoping if I respond right and long enough, everything's going to be okay. Still looking real good. and then some comforters come. And now we begin to approach the area where Job doesn't do quite as well. But there's some neat insight as his three friends come. Verse 11. The drama just continues to move with these three guys coming. When Job's three friends heard of this adversity that had come upon him, they came each one from his own place. Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar the Nahamite, Namathite. I wish one of them was like a parasite, something like that. And they made an appointment together to come and sympathize with him, to comfort him. I can see that like on a Sunday, a couple guys, three guys meet out in the foyer. They say, you know, Job, I hear he's really messed up. He's really hurting. He hasn't been to church for a while. Why don't we go over there? It's visitation night on Tuesday night. Let's go over there and see him on Tuesday night. So they went over there, and when they lifted up their eyes at a distance and did not recognize him, they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe, and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky. And then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great. Stop right there. Something is happening here that is very good. We are going to be introduced to these three helpers in just the following chapter, and their help is going to turn into very unhelpful help. But right here, there comes a therapy and a help from them that is absolutely immeasurable, and there are some things in this that we need to learn about. They never spoke a word. It's very significant that they didn't say anything. One of the things that I said at the very beginning is one of the reasons that very often when we come in contact with people who are in grief, that we stay away is because we don't know what to say. We're afraid we're going to say something stupid. We're afraid we're going to say something that's going to produce more pain, and so we don't want to do that. We really do care about the person, and so because we don't want to create more pain, or we just don't want to be embarrassed ourselves, or we don't want to get in touch with some pain ourselves because maybe we've just gone through something that this other person's gone through, we stay away. And that's the last thing the person who's in grief needs, is for people to stay away. What they need is for people to come. The last thing they need also is people trying to fix them. The last thing they need is people trying to explain it because there is no explanation. There is no good reason. There is no why. You don't know why it happened. We are talkers. We have a tendency, I don't know if it's just because of our culture, our evangelical culture. I think it has something to do with our evangelical culture. We come to things with words. We have to have an explanation, a reason, a rebuke, a cure. We're just compulsive about things like that. And if we don't think we have an answer, we just stay away. Their silence ministered profoundly to Job. I'm using two texts through this as just little helps. They aren't really actually about Job, but they're kind of insights that I have along the way, and you might be interested in getting them. Dialogue and Despair by William Hulme and The Problem of Pain by C.S. Lewis. William Hulme says this about this silent part. I just want you to listen to this. They spoke not a word. Their silence, however, spoke loud and clear. Theirs was what he calls here sacramental silence, nonverbal and yet tangible communication of the spirit. And the spirit here is small s, human spirit to human spirit, not God's. Mine to yours in silence. Symbolic communication is dramatic and conveys more deeply at times than verbal communication. Most of us have had the experience of not knowing what to say when ministering to someone overcome with grief. And fortunately, most of us have the good sense to say nothing. Our presence spoke for itself and was the basis for whatever words we may have said at a later time. You need to understand that when you're walking into the hospital room or walking into the home or walking into the mortuary, that being there is what is needed most. Saying things is not necessary. You don't have to fix anybody. Be there. Three friends, Ministry of Silence has something to say to our talk-oriented culture. One of my students, he says, raised the question whether we can take this account of such a prolonged Ministry of Silence with any credence, meaning is this really a valid thing? Fortunately, we had a Chinese student in our class who expressed his surprise that this question should even be raised. In the Orient, he said, the procedure of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar at least at the beginning, was still practiced. When one is overtaken by misfortune, his friends visit him. Unlike the Western, her visits for only a short period of time, the Oriental friends may stay for days. Yet during this time, they don't talk. For as the Chinese student said, what's there to say? Instead, they feel with their friend, weep with him, and thus share the sorrow with him. I don't want to embarrass this person, But last week when we were beginning this dealing with despair, Dwight Martin came up to me in the foyer afterwards. And some of you know, but his mom passed away over Christmas. Hard thing. God's teaching him all sorts of neat things. The thing I remember about what Dwight shared with me, many things I remember, but as it relates to this, was this, that at some point during the funeral or in the wake period or the reveal time, Wayne Thyrin from our church, whose mother-in-law passed away just about, I think, the same day, came and came to the funeral. And when Dwight saw Wayne, and they don't know each other that well, there was an immediate connection. It was like a bonding happened right now. Wayne didn't have to say a word. It wasn't about words. It was ministry. They were there. That's all. That's what's needed at this level. we're very afraid of each other's pains of each other's pain and our fear keeps us away sometimes our fear is that it raises doubts that we have about God and about our own position and so we really have a hard time doing that I think words very often protect us from our doubts and we keep everything in their little nice little thing instead these guys came, said nothing they felt, they sat, they wept, they shared the sorrow and the pain. Drama continues. Wouldn't it have been great? Don't read chapter 3 yet. Don't look ahead. Wouldn't it have been great? In fact, wouldn't it have been typical? I can guarantee it would have been preachable. If after seven days, for us, it would have been after one hour, because that's how long we would have lasted. I said, I could never last more than that, I don't think. Job would have turned to these people who just came and sat and wept with him and just felt his pain and entered in and just hugged him. It would have been so great if Job would have just turned to him and said, Guys, I'm so glad you came. You can't even imagine how much I appreciate this. I know I'm really bad off right now and I don't look so good, but, you know, the Lord is good. The Lord is good. And he's in control and he's on the throne and I'm still trusting him and I believe that all things work together for good. And his friends would have said, Job, this is incredible. You know, we came to bless you and you have blessed us. That would have been great and everybody would have felt good and it's happened that way for you sometimes and I'm not saying that if it happens that way, that's not real. What I'm saying is that it didn't happen that way with Job, not this time. You see, and I have a theory as to why it didn't, because right after this, he lets out with a burst of pain and anger that it just comes from his toes. And I think I know why. I don't know I know why, but here's what I think. I believe that what happened here was this. In their silence and in their weeping with him, a bond of love was created. A trust was created and an understanding was established. And Job got the idea that maybe for the very first time in his life, he was with someone who he could tell how he really felt. Couldn't tell that to his wife for whatever reason. He couldn't even do it to himself for whatever reason. But these people just came and wept with him. And they hurt with him. And somehow the bond that was created there gave him an inner permission to say how he really felt. I don't have to hide anymore. I don't have to play anymore. I'm going to pour what I feel in my heart out. I think these guys can handle it. If anybody can, they can. And afterward, Job opened up his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. Guys, I wish I never was born. And Job said, Let the day perish on which I was to be born, and the night which said a boy is conceived. Let that night perish. Verse 8. Let those who curse the day, who are prepared to rouse Leviathan. Verse 11. Why did I not die at my birth? Come forth from the womb and expire. That would have been better. Why did the knees receive me? Why did the breasts receive me that I should suck? For now I would have lain down and been quiet. I would have slept then. I would have been at rest. Why didn't I die when I was born? verse 20 why is light given to him who suffers I'm not just talking about my pain I'm talking about pain in general now and life to the bitter of soul why does God give life to people who are going to have all sorts of pain who long for death but there is none and dig for it more than for hidden treasures who rejoice greatly they exult when they find the grave why is light given to a man whose way is hidden and whom God has hedged in. For my groaning comes at the sight of my food. I don't want to eat. And my cries pour out like water. Why was I ever born? He is bitter. He's trapped. He's depressed. He's angry. He needed somebody to share it with. He thought that if there was anybody he could share it with, it was these guys. But he was wrong. It wasn't okay. They were terribly threatened by his outburst. Let me give you a little word real quickly about his outburst. Again, in William Hulme's book, quoting C.S. Lewis. C.S. Lewis is perhaps the most literate of recent Jobes. After the death of his wife, he experienced the full onslaught of the loss. In his little book, A Grief Observed, he gives expression to the questions and protests that stem from the agony of bereavement. this is quoting him what chokes out every prayer and every hope he writes is the memory of all the prayers that Helen and I offered and all the false hopes that we had not hopes raised merely by our own wishful thinking hopes encouraged even forced upon us step by step we were led up the garden path time after time when God seemed most gracious it feels now like he was really preparing us for the next torture Lewis describes his lament at that time as a yell rather than a thought what we hear Job doing here is yelling he's just yelling the words are almost insignificant it's just a scream sometimes godly people scream Job's a godly man he doesn't sound real godly and I'm telling you what his scream threatened the daylights out of these three guys. But, Pastor, you know, Job said some things there that just weren't right. It's just not right to talk like that. We're so threatened when people say the wrong thing. It just drives us nuts. And I think the problem is, and there's a principle I want to give to you here before I even get into their response to Job, What we do is we have a tendency, rather than responding to people's pain, we react to their words. Instead of responding to people's pain, we react to their words. And let me give you a little thing about responding to pain as it relates to, as it's contrast to reacting to words. One of the ways that I think I'm usually able to respond to people's pain is when my concern really is for them. Now, you kind of switch back and forth, and I don't want you to beat yourself up when you see how you don't do this well, but when my real concern is you, and I really just care about ministering to your pain, I have a capacity, generally, to respond to your pain. I'll start reacting to your words, though, when I start getting threatened, and my real thoughts are about me, because you're going to start somewhere along the line saying things that start threatening how I think. You're going to start threatening my little paradigms, my little ideas of what is okay, and my little boxes of where appropriate behavior lies. And all of a sudden, my whole concern is no longer anymore. It's not even in view, your pain and concern for you. Your words have suddenly bashed up against my little structures and my little ways of thinking. And now my whole ministry is designed to shut you up, to keep you quiet, to push those words back in your mouth, not because I care about you and want the best for you and are afraid that if you say that, you're going to get struck with lightning. That is not why I'm saying this shut-up stuff. I'm saying it because your words are threatening me. And they're causing me to ask questions about God and me to raise questions about existence and what's fair. And so I'm going to do everything I can to be quiet. But my ministry for you right now has nothing to do with you. It's all about me. responding to people's pain can happen when I can really get outside myself and say, I just need to hear you I can do that when I'm responding to that but when I'm reacting to your words it's because it's all become about me instead of being physicians of the soul we become defenders of God and God does not need us to defend Him Job was yelling. Chapter 4, verse 1. Eliphaz enters the picture. Great comfort. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, Job, shee, wow. If somebody ventures a word with you, will you become impatient? Come on. But who can refrain from speaking? Behold, you have admonished many. You have strengthened weak hands. Your words have helped the tottering to stand. You have strengthened feeble knees. You've been a man of God. You were active in the church. You preached from the pulpit. But now it comes upon you and you're impatient. What's the deal? It touches you and you're dismayed. Is not your fear of God your confidence and your integrity and the integrity of your ways your hope? Is Eliphaz wrong? Did Eliphaz say anything wrong there? not technically I suppose but the fact is this that right words said in the wrong spirit at the wrong time can cause enormous amounts of pain in fact Job in chapter 6 verse 25 says how forceful are right words how forceful are right words you didn't hear my heart at all you reacted to my words and now you gave me a bunch of right stuff my fear my fear of God does need to be my confidence. And I have done that, and now I am hurting. But don't just hear my words. And your right words back at me are incredibly powerful. Good for you, Eliphaz. You said the right thing. You put down what he was feeling. But what Job was really going through there and what Job really needed, and now I'm talking to you as if you're a counselor right now, What Job really needed here was an ability to just spill his heart. And Eliphaz, for whatever reason, you were threatened by the spilling of his heart, and so you reacted instead of responded. And what Eliphaz missed here was an incredible opportunity to minister love and mend and listen and hear. But I want you to consider something else about Eliphaz's response. I want you to consider the real purpose of Eliphaz's response. When he tells him that you're impatient now, and it touches you and you're dismayed, and isn't the fear of God your confidence? What's the real purpose of Eliphaz's words? How are those words supposed to make Eliphaz feel? How do they make you feel? What is the hoped-for response? Say it that way. Is it to encourage Job? Is it to uplift Job? No, the design of Eliphaz's words at this point are to set Job straight. They're to get him back in line, and the ultimate design of Eliphaz's words at this point is really to just shut him up. Again, Eliphaz, like us, is threatened by Job's cry of pain. He can't handle it. He has no answer to the anguish in Job's soul. No answer. He doesn't need an answer. He doesn't need one. He doesn't know that. But this is threatening Eliphaz's structure and his paradigm for what's okay. And so this entire ministry that started out with empathy and compassion for Job, the entire ministry now, Eliphaz is totally self-possessed and his entire focus is protecting himself against Job's tirade. That's what's going on. It's designed to make him feel guilty. And by the way, guilt is a wonderful tool if you want to shut people up. If you can make people feel guilty, you can shut them up. If you can make people feel guilty, you can control their behavior. You can get the whole thing back to normal. And at this point, after Eliphaz brings this godly, evangelical, if you will, rebuke, reminder, you know, of how you're supposed to talk, the response of Job is supposed to be this. Eliphaz, I'm sorry. I blew up. I didn't mean it. I really am trusting the Lord. Man, thanks for the word. Yeah, that's right. That's what I needed. Make people feel guilty. You can control them. Pastors do it. Parents do it. We do it to our friends. It's a manipulative hook. But Job didn't back off. He didn't back off in chapter 7, or chapter 6 rather, verse 2. I will not be condemned. Oh, that my vexation, I will not be shut up. Oh, that my vexation were actually weighed and laying the balances together with my iniquity. I think I have a case. Job says. Verse 11. What is my strength that I should wait and what is my end that I should endure? Is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh bronze? Is it that my help is not within me and that deliverance is driven from me? How much of this can I take? How much of this do you expect me to take? Chapter 7. Verse 6 and 7. My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to an end without hope. Remember that my life is but breath. My eye will not see good again. Again, I don't know if you've ever gone to that length, depth of despair, but one of the things that is a tip-off that you're in despair is that whatever joy you had at one time in your life, you're absolutely convinced right now that you're never going to have it again. That's just something that despair does to you. In verse 11, though, is where we hear the feistiness. Therefore, I will not restrain my mouth. I don't care how much guilt you dump on me. I don't care how much little manipulations you use to try to shut me up. I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. And he doesn't look like a very good Christian right here, does he? I will complain. Where is that? I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, and I will not restrain my mouth. You will not shut me up. I'm out of hope. I'm in despair. I'm hurt and bitter. And I will not pretend that everything is okay. I won't do it. In chapter 6, verse 14, we'll move back. Job is continuing to answer back. And the way he's going to answer back here is this. It's almost... The way I see Job in this whole thing is he's like, He's just a thrashing person. He's going to go from one emotion to another. He's going to be real aggressive one minute. The next minute he's going to be piled in a big pile of depression and mush and begging for help. Other times hanging on to God. Another time shaking his fist at God. Denial, anger, blaming, depression, not getting here yet. But all of these weird things going back and forth. And he's been reeling and he's feeling real big and real militant right now. And I will not shut up. in chapter 6, verse 14, it's like he's using their tactics. You're going to make me feel guilty? Fine, I'm going to make you feel guilty. Let me tell you about the counsel that you've given me. It's been great. For the despairing man, there should be kindness from his friend. I'm going to tell you how to be a good counselor, okay? Lest he forsake the fear of the Almighty. If your counsel isn't good to me, I'm going to forsake the fear of the Almighty. So it's your fault. my brothers that you have acted deceitfully like a wadi you have set me up like the torrents of wadis which vanish which are turbid because of ice and into the into which the snow melts when they become waterless they are silent when it is hot they vanish from their place the paths of their course wind along they go up into nothing and perish the caravans of timah looked the travelers of Sheba hoped for them, but they were disappointed for they had trusted. What's he talking about? The caravans of Tima looked. The travelers of Sheba hoped in them. What it was is we're walking through a desert and we're looking off and we're dying of thirst, okay? And we're just ready to die. And the travelers of Tima and Sheba are looking off in the distance and you know what they see? They see a wadi, a little oasis, some water. But it wasn't. It just looked like water. It looked like refreshment. It looked like a safe place. And so they went there and they ran and they spent the last bit of their energy to get to that pool of water. And for Job, it was these three friends. He was just resigned to having nowhere to go with his feelings. And then he saw Wadi, Eliphaz, Zophar, and Bildad, a drink of water, someplace I can go. And he ran. And when he got there, dried up. And that makes me angry. You have acted deceitfully with me. They came to that place in verse 20 where the water was supposed to be and they were confounded. Indeed, you now have become such. You see my terror and you're afraid. You're defending yourself. You're defending God. You don't have to defend God and you don't have to defend yourself. Just hear what I'm trying to say. Just help me sort out the junk. I got a lot of junk. People in pain have a lot of junk. They say really stupid things. They say things they don't mean. They mean them, but they don't mean them. I'll get to that in a minute. Have you ever ministered to somebody or walked into a room and just been with somebody who was in dire trouble? Just incredible grief. One of the questions we ask is how are you taking it? Or maybe we can even separate it a little bit. You've been with someone in dire pain, and now you're talking to me. And the thing I want to know about the person in pain, how are they doing? How are they taking it? And what I want to hear is they're doing really well. And if they say they're doing really well, what that means is what? They're not crying. They're happy. They're encouraging me. They're saying all sorts of nice things. And if they say they're really not doing very well, that means they're crying. They're feeling bad. They're saying bad words. And I'm not telling people to do that. But when that kind of stuff comes and confusion comes, we back away because we get afraid. And sometimes the tactic we use when people come out with their pain is we try to shut them up with pious platitudes, and we come on real strong. And I just don't think love. Love doesn't do that. Love moves right in, and it feels it, and it hurts with the person. Wrap up the thoughts we've got so far on Eliphaz. He's our first counselor. Pull it together. What we've got is Job in real bad shape. What we've got is Eliphaz disappointed that his ministry wasn't received. He's kind of feeling self-righteous that he gave him the right answers. Tell you what, I don't know if you've ever heard this kind of thing, and maybe you've said this kind of thing. Tell you what, I gave Job the word. Gave him the word. and I'm just going to leave them with the Lord. That's all I can do. We went through a thing in my family once, and in fact, it's the thing in my family that brought us to our understanding of grace. It's a family I grew up in. We were very, very... I'm not going to mention any names, so I won't mention that. We had formulas to live the Christian life. I mean, if you do these five things, you're going to be okay. And my parents did the five things and the 15 and the 20 and the 30 things. And they did them. And the kids were still bouncing off the walls. And I had two older sisters who were in enormous kinds of pain and acting out in some very inappropriate ways. My dad was a pastor, so this was hard, too. And the Christian culture he was in didn't look real nicely on all that stuff. But at one point with one of my sisters, in the context of some real deep pain, and inappropriately expressed pain by any evangelical standard, the counselor that they were with asked my dad, well, after this outburst of stuff, asked my dad, how do you respond to that? How are you going to deal with Sherry's pain right there? And my dad, just believing that this was the only response he had, it was the only one he knew how to make, and it was this. At that time he said, well, I'm just going to leave her, I just have to leave her with the Lord. And my sister Sherry started to sob. I wasn't there, this story's been told to me. My sister Sherry started to sob. And then this counselor said to my dad this, evangelical pastor, great guy, said this, maybe it's time that you take your daughter off God's doorstep. and bring her to yourself. Stop that pious talk as an excuse to not strongly enter your kids' lives. God used that to break, and this is off the subject a little bit, but God used that to break my father. Formulas don't work, God works. That's where God taught my dad grace. That changed my family. It may be why I'm not in a lot of trouble instead of doing this. But I'm in trouble here too, so. Love moves in and feels the hurt. It doesn't have to fix all the words. Eliphaz gave him the word and left him with the Lord. Let your heart hurt just a little bit when you hear in verse 20 of chapter 7, Job say this. He's talking to God here. And again, we're seeing Job go back. He's angry. He's hanging on. He's spitting mad at his friends, and then he's wishing that they would help him. But right now, he's in one of those, I'm before God, and he's just confused. Have I sinned? Have I sinned? What have I done to you, God? And he's not mad here. He's really asking a question. Oh, watcher of men, what have I done to you? Why did you set me as a target so that I am a burden even to myself? Anybody ever feel like that? Two things. I want to know. And again, just ask, just monitor your own spirit. Have you ever felt like a target? Why am I a target? And I'm so much a target that, and I feel the pain so much, and I'm so aware that I'm not doing real well, I'm not acting very Christian, that I even don't like me. You know, it's like I'm real mad at these guys for not being with me here, but I don't even like me, so I'm not sure why they should anyway. Because I'm a burden to myself. Is it okay to talk to God like that? Yeah. I think God's so real and he's so big that I can tell him exactly how I feel and he ain't going away. It's where intimacy starts. It's where formulas start to break down and relationship begins. And it just seems to me that it's always pain that does it. I don't know why. I don't want that to be the formula. But what breaks down the little one, two, threes, and these knowing the right answer as being the essence of our relationship, and the coming to God with a real heart stuff, is when the formulas don't work anymore. And you're saying things that are not appropriate. You're saying wrong things, okay? The things Job is saying sometimes are wrong. His perception is wrong, but they're real. And it's the path to intimacy, because he is going to come out the other end. But that path is very scary. Let's keep moving. Next helper, Bildad. Bildad. Bildad's got a job. His job is not only to correct the mistakes that Job is making, but he has to beat back the hostility. Okay, Bildad's job is not only to correct the mistakes, but to beat back the hostility. And what that calls for is more guilt. Got to just use more guilt. chapter 8 verse 2 basically this how long are you going to blow off steam job then build dad the shoe height and answered how long will you say these things and the words of your mouth be a mighty wind actually what he is doing here is picking up job's words in chapter 6 verse 26 in chapter 6 verse 26 he says this job says this do you intend to reprove my words when the words of one who is in despair belong to the wind the words of one who is in despair belong to the wind That is a powerful lesson. Don't just slide over that. Please know that when you're dealing with people in pain, their words are as wind. That means they're saying things that they don't mean. What we have a tendency to do with people, when they say things that are real angry and off the wall and shaking their fist because of their pain, we have a tendency to think, Oh, well, that's how you really think. and we stick them right to the wall with that with that outburst that was coming from a wet reservoir of pain and maybe the the outburst they gave you maybe it was because they didn't like you okay and i don't know where to go with that and there needs to be some working through i don't want to give license to people to go blow everybody up but maybe the reason they were giving you some of their pain wasn't directed at you at all. It was because they trusted you. It was a gift. King James says it this way, the speech of a despairing man is as wind. Job was trying to teach them something very important, but they were too busy instructing them to hear. And Bildad just indicates here in chapter 8 that he didn't catch at all what Job was saying about wind when you speak in despair because he just says how long you're going to keep on blowing your words around like a mighty wind. I think we make a real serious mistake when we try very often to deal reasonably and intellectually with emotional responses and again the problem becomes that we're not responding anymore to their pain. We're reacting to their words. Sometimes, an illustration of what I said just a moment ago about that's how you really think. Sometimes that happens between parents and children, where an outburst will come from things that don't seem to correspond with the little interaction you have. Kids come home from school, and you'll say, can I have a cookie? No. And all of a sudden, boom! It's all over. And it's really about something else completely. But all of a sudden, it's escalating and escalating and escalating and I don't know if you've ever heard this in your house, but all of a sudden somebody's saying to somebody else, I hate you. Oh. So that's how you really feel. Again. You know, picture a seven-year-old. I hate you. And tears are streaming down their cheeks. They really hate them, right? I mean, there's a lot of anger there, but something else is going on. Wouldn't it be nice if we could see past those stupid words and just look for the pain? Because there's pain in those words. Sometimes it's said between a husband and wife. Sometimes between kids. Sometimes at work. Somebody gets a little frightened. They're despairing. They come out with some hostility. There's no place to go with the fear that they have. It comes up. It goes out. And then we stick them. That's it. You're in a box. You're a creep. You're not a good Christian. You don't really care at all about me, and there's nothing you can do to get out of the box. Maybe you can even relate to it that way. Maybe you haven't done that to someone, though you probably have, but someone's done it to you. That's where we can feel it better. Someone's done it to you. You said something stupid. You really regret that you said it, and now to that person, you'll never be able to get out of it. That's what you are. A lot of childish stuff comes out when we're hurting. Childish stuff comes out of me when I'm hurting It does I don't like that, I hate that It's a true thing I really hope I'm around people who love me when that happens Job is saying basically this I wish you guys could hear me Do you have to assume that I'm bad? Do you have to automatically assume that I'm wrong And judge me? Please give me some room Don't you realize that the speech of a despairing man Is this wind? I think you need to understand that if you're going to counsel with people who are in despair. I wonder sometimes how many long conflicts and separations in homes and in churches would end if we could catch what Job was trying to teach there. I think we really would do well to, instead of being so right and dissecting everybody's words, just see the pain and see the despair. Look for that. The thought even dawns on me, though. In order for me to be able to do that, I'm going to have to be real honest about my own pain. I'm going to have to be real honest about the fact that what that person just said threatens an awful lot of my own security. And if I'm not willing to look at that, well, you're never going to go any deeper than that. So even the capacity to counsel is going to take an awful lot of honesty on your part about your reactions to what you're hearing. Bill Dadd. I don't like Bill Dadd. There are personal reasons I don't like him. I don't like him for one reason, because he uses unfair tactics. In verse 3, he uses a rhetorical question to manipulate and push guilt. A rhetorical question, by the way, is just a question that has an obvious answer. And it's an obvious answer that's designed to trap you. Here's his rhetorical question. Job, I got a question for you. Does God pervert justice or does the Almighty pervert what is right? What's he supposed to say? Yeah. Yeah, he perverts justice, okay? there's nowhere to go with that that's not a question that's a question that is manipulative and it's designed to shut him up again it's a dishonest device it's one designed to make somebody eat crow to prove that I'm right there's nothing that Job could possibly say it's kind of a sick game And again, it's designed to shut him up, push guilt, so that everything's cozy again and everything's safe again, and we don't have to do any work with Job's pain. It totally avoids the things in Job that threaten Bildad's paradigms, his little formulas. But Bildad doesn't stop in verse 3. He goes on, and this is a real low blow in verse 4. Job, you've just got to look at this. If your sons sinned against them, and how many times did I tell you they were drinking wine at their party? Remember that? If your sons sinned against God, then he delivered them into the power of their transgression. What does that mean? You know what he just told them? He just told them your sons got what they deserved. That's what he said. Now this guy knew that Job was sensitive about his kids. He knew that that was part of his pain. And what he's saying is here, Job, this thing that you lost your kids, that's a spiritual problem. But there's something even more basic about it. I don't like his rhetorical question. I don't like the fact that he's using a low blow. But there's something even more that I don't like about Bildad, and that is this. He has all sorts of answers and explanations for very complex problems. He is a person who can explain life with little formulas, and everything is very simple. If you have trouble, it's all very explainable. It's because you did something wrong. You see, if you do something right, God will bless you. If you do something wrong, God will punish you. If Eliphaz is a moralizer, and a moralizer is not a moral person, a moralizer is someone who is kind of lofty and self-righteous, if Eliphaz is a moralizer, Bildad is an oversimplifier. And I've already blown up this whole thing about formulas, but that's where Bildad is. Life is defined in simple forms, and there is no flexibility, and there isn't any thought. In chapter 8, verse 5, Bildad gives three steps to successful Christian living. It's a seminar he put together. It says this, Job, if you would do, number one, seek God, number two, implore the compassion of the Almighty, and number three, become pure and upright, then surely he would rouse himself for you and restore your righteous estate. I've got three things. I'll put it right on the board. Seek God. Pray. That means implore the compassion and straighten your life out. sure thing if you do those three things God will restore you verse 21 you're going to be happy again he will then fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouting i really do have the best for you job i really want you to have your your mouth full of laughter and your lips shouting and and so job just get back on your knees and seek god and and pray and straighten out your life and you're going to laugh again and it's going to be great and we won't have to talk about this anymore. It'll just be great. It's biblical even. Three steps. This is tough. How do you fight right words? Have you ever had anybody come with you with three steps, five steps, whatever, something, a little formula? It's hard to fight because there's always this little passage next to it. But there's something not only about the fact that he says it, but the way he says it that disturbs and it angers. And I think what disturbs me the most is the giving of the guarantee at the end. The giving of the guarantee. Surely now, if you do these three things, God will restore. Surely, guaranteed. I don't have time and I don't know, I don't want to get into stuff here that is not appropriate. But I have a real problem with seminars and things like that that give five easy steps or 25 ways, and you're leaving with your thick three-ring binding thing that if you just follow this, now I got it. I don't even have to walk by the Spirit. I'll just do this stuff. We're just absolutely sure. And see, there are certain times in our lives when we go to those kinds of things, and we just feel like, I have discovered the secret of the Christian life. We're just dying to find the nine insights, the four principles, the seven steps that will put our life together. And we love it when somebody says, and I guarantee you, if these things don't work for you, you'll be the first one. So I'm going to do them. Beware of geeks bearing lists, I tell you what. I got to do something about my anger. I don't know what to do with it. Okay. The biggest problem I have is that while a lot of times biblical principles are right and they're true and they're right, the problem I have is there's a sense of dogmatism with them and this guarantee that these formula inside steps, if they fail for you, you'll be the first one. The formulas don't work. I've got some bad news for you if you're counting on them. I've got some good news for you if they're failing you. Because formulas don't work. God works. Your only hope is God. And see, while your kids are going off the deep end, and while things aren't adding up, and while you're unbelievably confused, and while you loved your kid, and while you thought you married the right person, and those things aren't happening right, your only hope is not a formula. Some people end up in incredible despair and even walk away from Christ for maybe a period. I hope not long. I suppose some could just walk the rest of their life away because they lived their life according to the formula. It didn't work and they equated that with God somehow. You hear the disillusionment of a parent who says, I loved my kids. I sat down and talked with my kids. I played with my kids. I spent time with my kids. I brought them to church. I didn't just bring them to church. I shared with them my heart. And they chose another God. and I don't get it because I poured my life there and I don't think it was maybe it was, I know I blew it but I gave him everything I had and then I see a kid over here and I bless this, I'm glad it happens but the parents didn't spend any time didn't impart the life of God at all drop him off on the doorstep for Sunday school walk away, the kid goes into the ministry I don't get it explain that to me some woman comes into the office and says to you or to me, explain this to me. I went to Bible college. I fell in love. I thought that maybe Bible college was a safe place to meet a man who was seeking God. The man I met was seeking God. We got married. We thought we were going to go into the ministry. We're married for five years. Things aren't going right. Find out he's a homosexual. That's not fair. And then I look at my friend over here. She met her husband at a bar. And now he's a Christian leader. I don't get it. I'm not recommending going to a bar to meet your husband. It doesn't always add up. It doesn't always add up. The formulas don't work. God works. Your only hope is Jesus. And that's why I don't like Bildad, because he gives this guarantee. It'll be great. You don't know that. Don't ever tell anybody it's going to be. You don't know that. You've got to hang on to people. It's at this point that a sensitive, loving friend would tug Job's arm and say, Job, you need to know that what Bildad says is a bunch of baloney. God never gave three easy steps He never gives four simple answers God does not offer formulas He offers Himself And maybe that is even A little insight into how to counsel And how to deal with people in pain Because if God offers Himself Maybe what He's calling me to do With you and you to do with me and with us Is to offer ourselves Maybe that's the gift Again I come back to that whole thing of silence Being with the person we're not going to go through a course like this and come out therapists okay and people need therapy sometimes and you're not going to be qualified for that and i'm not qualified for that but we can counsel and we can love one another with some things like this we can move strongly into people's lives with some things like this and do incredible ministry with simple things like this. God gave himself. We need to give ourselves. One of my favorite passages on this, Jeff is going to elaborate on this in a couple weeks. In 2 Corinthians 7, it says, Paul is saying, I love this, For we were in Macedonia, and when we were in Macedonia, our flesh had no rest. We were persecuted on every side. Conflicts without fears within. This is Paul talking. And God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus. There's two things that encourage me about that. It really encourages me to know that Paul got depressed. Isn't that depraved? It really does. It just encourages me to know that Paul got depressed. It also encourages me to know that Paul was not comforted by a formula. He was comforted by a friend. But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus, who just came to Paul and said, you know, Paul, if you do these three things, He just came and encouraged them and was with them. And I don't even know what he said. He didn't have to say anything. Evidently, what he said didn't matter. It didn't matter. If it mattered, it would have been written. It wasn't written. He came. That's what mattered. There's a neat thing happening in Job here that I want you to catch. This drama is happening. We're not hardly letting it happen because I keep making comments about it. But you know what? Job was a formula guy too. And he was like Eliphaz, Zophar, and Bildad. He had all sorts of formulas. But his formulas are getting ripped out of his hand right now. And it's the pain that's doing it. And that's why even as terrible as this pain is, by the end of this we're going to see that as agonizing as it is, do not pretend it's pretty. Job, no one going in, would have said no. Maybe on the other end he would say, really, it was worth it. But it's almost like it's going to be a gift because all the superficial stuff, formula-ridden stuff, is getting taken out of his hands. I want you to meet another guy. We have time for Zophar. Before we get to Zophar, I want to make another comment about Bildad. Bildad was trying to shut him up, more guilt bombs and stuff like that, but the problem is that Bildad's attempts to shut Job up backfired. And see, that's another thing. Again, this is kind of disjoint that I hope you can follow through here and put things together for yourself. Part of Bildad's problem was that while he was trying to shut him up, his attempts to shut him up made it worse. He came out stronger. And when you're dealing with despairing people like that, that's what's going to happen. See, the problem was Job was not a bum off the street. He knew the Word of God, and Job was, like I said just a moment ago, a formula worker. And when Bildad starts giving him more formulas to work, Job is clicking off in his mind. I've tried that one, I've tried that one, I've tried that one, I've done that one, I've done that one, and it doesn't work, it doesn't work, it doesn't work. And it's like Bildad has never dealt with anybody like this before. He's never had to deal with a real person. And Job says, In all honesty, I look at what you say, and all my life I have lived by the formula, but what I see is that the formulas have profited me nothing. Chapter 9, verse 2. Here's Job's response to Bildad. We're not going to get to Zophar yet, and I want to still finish Job's response. I'm going to skip that. In truth, I know what you're saying is true, Bildad, but how can a man be in the right before God? If one wished to dispute with him, how could he could not answer him once in a thousand times? Wise in heart and mighty in strength, who has defied God without harm? It is God who removes the mountains. They know not how. When he overturns them in his anger, Who shakes the earth out of its place and its pillars tremble? Who commands the sun not to shine and sets a seal upon the stars? Who alone stretches out the heavens and tramples down the waves of the sea? Verse 10. Who does great unfathomable things and wondrous works without number? Were he to pass by me, I would not see him. Were he to move past me, I would not perceive him. Were he to snatch me away? Who could stop him? He's all-powerful. He can do what he wants. If he wants to crush my life, he can do that. who could say to him what are you doing can't say that this is incredible verse 19 it is a matter of power and God's powerful and behold he is the strong one if it is a matter of justice who can summon him though I am righteous my mouth will condemn me though I am guiltless a little kind of self-defense there but I'm still going to be declared guilty I am guiltless, you are not. But I do not take notice of myself. I despise my life. It is all one. Therefore, I say he destroys the guiltless and the wicked. He just crushes everybody. That's what he's saying about God. If the scourge kills suddenly, he mocks in the despair of the innocent. He's saying that about God. Good Christians don't talk like that. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not he, if it's not God who does all that bad stuff, then who? You tell me. Verse 28. I'm afraid of all my pains. I know that thou wilt not acquit me. I am accounted wicked. Why then should I toil in vain? What is it going to profit me to work this out? If I should wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lie, yet you would plunge me into the pit. Whoa. And my clothes would abhor me. For God is not a man as I am, that I may answer him, that I may go to the court together. I loathe, chapter 10, verse 1, I loathe my own life. Look at chapter 10, verse 18 through 20. Why then hast thou brought me out of the womb? Would that I had died, and no eye had seen me. I should have been as though I had not been. carried from the womb to the tomb, would he not let my few days alone withdraw from me that I may have a little cheer? He's talking to God there, and he's saying, God, can't you just back off for a little bit? Give me a break. I need some room to breathe. Something's happened to Job here that's very scary. Now, so far, we've been able to identify and kind of chuckle and go, yeah, boy, I can really identify with that. But some of you have even gone this far. And Job has gone so far here. If I wasn't reading the Bible, you'd be real nervous. If I just went into, and you had a conversation with somebody out there in the foyer, leaving, and they were saying these things about God. Who is he? I mean, if he crushes the good ones, he crushes the bad ones, he doesn't give a rip. And if God doesn't do it, who does? You tell me. I mean, we would go, whoa. and all this pushing by Eliphaz and Bildad has instead of calming him down it's brought even more out of anger you see far deeper than one question that a person in despair would have that would threaten us would be there must not be a God how could there be a God if he's allowing all this kind of stuff You need to know that Job here is not questioning the existence of God. You know what he's questioning? His character. C.S. Lewis, in the middle of his pain with his wife, he said this, I do not feel that I am any grave danger of ceasing to believe in God. What terrifies me is my coming to believe such terrible things about him. The conclusion I dread is not, aha, no God after all, but rather, aha, that's what he's really like. He doesn't care. He doesn't care. That's a scarier thing than saying there is no God. Yeah, there's a God, he's powerful, he crushes people, he don't care. People in despair feel like that. I think people in despair need to be given room to get that out. Blessed are those who get out here, what is in here. They alone are going to get in touch with the comfort of the Spirit. If you don't feel that, don't feel that. But if you do, don't pretend you don't. Our minds begin to grapple. We can't conceive of a good God doing things like that. And sometimes in grief, we actually begin to wonder if he's a devil. Maybe he's not bad. Maybe he's good. But he's impotent, maybe. Does God, like us, remain helpless in times of trouble? He just can't do anything? When you're in pain, you ask questions like that. And if he can't do anything, why should I trust him? I can't believe the pastor is saying this stuff. I want you to consider something. It's a major theme of the entire study in Job. What I want you to consider is this, that intimacy with God is not attained by avoiding those kinds of questions. Intimacy with God is come to by voicing those kinds of questions. Because I think it's only then, when those questions are really there, that God becomes more for you than just a cliche. Because God is real, and God is big, and he's big enough to handle any question you have. Thank you.
