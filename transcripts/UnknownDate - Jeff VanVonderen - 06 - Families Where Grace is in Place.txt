Okay, for this session I want to talk about it's called Families Where Grace Is In Place and it could more maybe accurately be called Relationships Where Grace Is In Place. I want to talk a little bit about where all this other stuff really comes from in terms of theologically and what Scripture has to say and then also talk about relationships that are healthy in terms of scriptural kinds of perspectives. I want to say that this session, more than like a how-to, like here's the five, okay, now that you know this stuff, here's five things you do or five things to not do, is more about a way of thinking about things. I really think that, I think that in Romans 12, it talks about being transformed by renewing of the mind. And what I try to do with this and the stuff I do on parenting and marriage and churches is more about help people in their thinking about relationships so that when they come to the relationship with this new thinking, they can find the kinds of do's and don'ts that fit with that relationship rather than giving you some little formula. And now instead of this old formula that you don't like that didn't work, now you're going to do Jeff's formula that you do like and does work, and then you can check that off and measure yourself by this new thing instead of the old thing. I don't want to do that. I'd rather just talk about ways of thinking about relationships and grace, and then you can filter this out in the course of your own process of having relationships. So, this all starts in Genesis 1 and 2, actually. Surprise. And what it looks like, and even though now this is being applied more toward marriage relationships, I don't want to insinuate that this doesn't work for just relationships in general, because it does. Marriage relationships are important to married people, but other people who aren't married, who have never been married, who are no longer married, who wish they were and aren't, have other important relationships in which these dynamics can work and do work, or don't work, whatever the case may be. But in Genesis 1 and 2, we see a relationship between God and man and woman. And it says in Genesis 2.18, it's not good for man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him. The word suitable there does not mean like an assistant. God doesn't look at Adam and say, well, I'm going to make him an assistant. The word suitable there means corresponding to, like a corresponding part, a fit. It's not good to be alone. I'll make a corresponding part, someone that corresponds to. And then, to illustrate what that isn't, he makes a list. Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky and brought them to man to see what he called them. And whatever the man called the living creature, that was its name. And the man gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and every beast of the field. but for Adam there is not found a helper suitable for him. See, the thing about animals and birds and fish and all that kind of stuff is that they are the assistants. Follow this? They're there to serve man. But they aren't suitable. They aren't corresponding to. So God caused the deep sleep to fall upon man, and he slept and he took one of the ribs and closed the flesh up at the place. And the Lord God fashioned into woman. I like the word fashioned there, by the way, Because fashioned communicates a very careful kind of thing. This was not just a flip kind of deal that God did. He fashioned woman. So God was very careful to make someone who corresponded to. Into woman, the rib was he taken from the man, and he brought her to the man. So the picture is that Adam opens up his eyes and sees Eve, and he, in my opinion, gives the right answer. So this is the correct response. This is now bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man. So God's plan for this relationship was a one flesh relationship. And then the next verse says, for this cause, this bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh cause, for this cause man shall leave his father and mother cleave to his spouse and the two shall become one flesh. So we have a one flesh becoming one flesh relationship, which I don't really understand that and can't explain that very well. I don't know how you can be more one flesh than one flesh, but that's kind of what it says. Do you understand? One flesh seems pretty close to me, but this is saying now it's even going to be closer than that. I can't tell you what that looks like exactly. I think that I've experienced some of that in my own marriage, but I can't explain it. And the man and his wife were both naked and they were not ashamed. Now, in Genesis 1, verse 26, it says, Then God said, Let us make man in our image according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. And God created man in his own image, and in the image of God he created him male and female. He created them, and God blessed them, and God said to them. So in Genesis 1, the responsibility to rule and fill and subdue the job of bearing God's image was given to man, but man was them. And so if you really want to see the image of God, you have to see male and female. You know, theologians throughout history have asserted that male of the species carries the image of God. We are the image bearers. That's not true. I don't agree with that. I think that male and female bear God's image. But the responsibility to rule and to fill and to subdue was given to both of them. And so what we have is a dependent upon God, one flesh becoming one flesh, co-ruling, co-filling, co-subduing, bearing God's image relationship. So if you can get a picture like this, this is God, and this is male and female, and they're dependent on God, which means that they're underneath God's rule or his authority. They're dependent upon God, and it's not a big thing. In other words, there's no place in here that God says you better do it or else. You know, he's met their needs for free. They don't have to do anything to get their needs met. It's all there, right, provided for them. There's only just one thing, don't eat from the tree. Well, so here's Adam and Eve, and in as much as they're dependent upon God, you see, you can see a picture of God. It's almost like looking at a mirror. So you see a reflection of God in this relationship when this relationship is dependent upon God. well the serpent comes along and basically says just do this okay in other words you can be in charge better than God's in charge you can do a better job of being God than God the temptation in Genesis 3 you know when the serpent says in the day you eat from the tree you'll be like God knowing good from evil the hook I think the payoff isn't so much in the day you eat from the tree you'll be like God because in Genesis 1 it already says that they're created in God's image. Do you understand this? And in Genesis 2, God says don't eat from the tree. So they already know good from evil. They only had one thing to remember. Don't eat from the tree. That's good. Eat from the tree. That's evil. Get it? That's all there is. So for the serpent to say the day you eat from the tree, you'll know good from evil, well, there's not that big of a payoff there because they already kind of knew what that was. They clearly knew what that was. The payoff is control. God's in control. You can be in control. God doesn't have your best interest in mind. He's trying to cramp your style, and you can meet your needs with what you do better than letting God meet your needs with what he does. So basically what the serpent did was say, just tip the picture upside down, and you be in control. Well, when they attempted to do that, they didn't pull it off, obviously. They didn't tip the thing upside down. What they did was they moved out from underneath a dependent relationship with God, and then this relationship, because it was no longer dependent upon God, got distorted and does not reflect God's image anymore, and that's called the curse. And so the curse is in Genesis 3. God shows up in the garden, and Adam and Eve are hiding. So now with regards to God, they're going in the opposite direction and hiding. And inside themselves, it says they felt fear. Okay? And they also have shame. And the reason we know that is because before this happened, they were naked and weren't ashamed. Now they're hiding. Okay? Which means that they are ashamed. People don't hide stuff they're okay with. People hide when they're ashamed. You know, if someone's ashamed of something, they go over here and don't let you see it. So on the outside, they're running from God. And they've got fear and shame on the inside. And God calls to the man and says, where are you? As if he didn't know. And the man says, I heard the sound of you in the garden. I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself. And he said, who told you you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree which I commanded you not to eat? And the man said, not my fault. So basically, what we have is blaming going on here. so now in a man to woman direction interpersonally we have blaming we have fear on the inside hiding from god and blaming interpersonally it's not my fault the woman that you gave me she gave me the apple so it's not really my fault i'm not really responsible actually it's your fault for giving me her and her fault for giving me the apple and if you wouldn't have given me her and she wouldn't give me the apple i'd be okay so i'm just a victim and i'm not responsible and then he says to the woman, what have you done? And she says, it's not my fault either. So nobody's responsible for this. Everybody's pushing responsibility and blaming someone else. Then verse 16 says this, to the woman he said, I'll greatly multiply your pain in childbirth and pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband and he will rule over you. So in woman to man direction, what it says is your desire shall be toward your husband. So what we have is the phenomenon of desire toward going in a woman to man direction, but he will rule over you. So in a man to woman direction we have rule over. But see what you need to understand is that this is the curse. This is not the plan. The plan is a dependent upon God, one flesh becoming one flesh, co-ruling, co-filling, co-subduing, mirroring God's image relationship. And this, all of these dynamics are what it looks like when this relationship stops depending upon God to meet the needs and comes over here and then gets distorted. And these are all the distortions of the plan, not the plan. This is called the curse. Now, the reason I know it's the curse even from the text is because of the dynamics of desire toward and ruling over. Desire toward, your desire shall be toward your husband. You know, I've heard people teach this way, and I've talked to people who've been taught this way, that says, I'll greatly multiply your pain in childbirth, and pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, which is to say, even though having kids is going to hurt like the dickens, you're still going to want to be sexual with your husband, which is not what that means. Your desire shall be towards your husband does not mean, like in a wedding ceremony when they quote the book of Ruth, where he goes, you will go. Where he goes, you will go. What he wants, your people will be his people. That's not what that's about. Desire toward is the same word that's used in Genesis 4-7 that says, if you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you don't do well, sin is crouching at your door and its desire is toward you. but you must master it. So, in a woman-to-man direction desire toward what it means is it's a controlling, dominating usurping control trying to be in charge throw the person in the dust put your foot on their neck and don't let them get up. That's what it is from a woman-to-man direction. But he will rule over you is the same thing. It's a despotic, tyrannical oppressive despot. You know, it's an oppressive ruler. So what we have is that the woman is going to try to usurp control and be in charge and put herself over the man, and the man is going to put himself over the woman, and the result of the curse now is two people, both of whom are over someone and both of whom are under someone because both of them are putting themselves over the other person. That's the curse, though. That's not the plan. It's the curse. The plan is one flesh becoming one flesh, dependent upon God, co-ruling, co-filling, co-subduing, co-bearing God's image relationship. This is the curse. That's why it's called the curse. Our job as believers is not to do the curse. It's not our job to do the curse. It's our job to do the plan. Now, I have heard countless sermons. There are hundreds of books, probably, and seminars and stuff that are designed, actually, to help Christians do the curse. Except for that we're supposed to do the curse in a nicer, more spiritual-friendly-looking version than the world does the curse, but yet we're supposed to do the curse. Our job is not to do the curse. Don't spend five minutes trying to get your relationships with others to look like the curse, even if you're nicer about doing the curse. It's the curse. this is the plan, this is the curse, don't do the curse now I spent a whole hour last session illustrating what it looks like when the curse finds its way into real life relationships do you understand? because both of those people in that relationship are coming over the other person manipulating, dominating, controlling, trying to get the other person to be a certain way so that you can be okay based on their performance so that whole talk was the real life everyday expression of what it looks like when you have two people, both of whom are coming over the other person and both of whom are ending up underneath the other person because they're both coming over. It's a controlling kind of thing. Codependency is about living out the curse. Idolatrous relationships is about living out the curse. It doesn't work. It makes people tired. The curse wasn't given as the new plan. Okay, like you guys goofed up the first plan, so we'll give you another plan. The curse was the curse. The curse is supposed to make you tired to drive you back to the plan, not to be a substitute for the plan. And the reason I think that is because of Ephesians 5. So now I'm going to show you what this looks like in Ephesians 5. Ephesians 5, verse 18, says this. Don't get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation. That's a waste, that's unhealthy. Don't get drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit. now verse 18 when it says don't get drunk with wine but be filled with the spirit one of the things I want to show you about that verse is that Paul is not telling us to get with the spirit like we used to get with wine in other words it's significant that he uses a different word when referring to wine than he does when referring to the spirit so he's not saying to us remember how you used to get drunk with wine well don't do that with wine anymore but do that with the spirit. Although I do know Christians who are drunk with the spirit and they get the same way with the spirit as they used to get with wine. Meaning when they used to get drunk with wine they didn't feel what they're supposed to be feeling and they didn't notice what they're supposed to be noticing and they didn't hear what they're supposed to be hearing. They were numbed out. They didn't care about stuff. They didn't enter into stuff. It was their way to escape dealing with reality. But now that they're not drunk with wine anymore, they're drunk with the Spirit. So now they're so spiritual that they still don't see stuff and they still don't hear stuff and they still don't care about stuff. They're numbed out and it's their way to not deal with what's real because of the Spirit. Paul isn't telling us to do that. He's saying don't get drunk with wine, be filled with the Spirit. One other thing, and this refers big time, I guess, to the talk I just gave before, is that it's significant that Paul starts off his talk about family relationships and then even slaves and masters in Ephesians 6 with the phrase be filled with the spirit. Now I used to wonder why those two things were together. In other words why is Paul, be filled with the spirit sounds like this lofty spiritual kind of thing and then later on he's going to talk about husbands and wives and parents and kids. How do those two things fit together? But then I started counseling people and marriage counseling And what I saw in marriage counseling was husbands who were trying to get filled from their wives. And I just showed you that last talk. Husbands who were trying to get filled from their wives, and wives who were trying to get filled from their husbands, and parents who were trying to get filled from their kids, and people in relationships who were trying to get filled from other people. And Paul says, no, be filled with the Spirit. In other words, we're going to talk about family relationships. Husbands, love your wives. Don't get filled from your wives. understand this? Get filled from the Spirit. If you're going to get filled someplace, which you're going to, get filled from someone that fills you, not from the people around you. So when he says be filled with the Spirit, then he goes on to talk about what that looks like. So one of the things about being filled with the Spirit is that in this text, that's the should, meaning that that's the imperative, that's the command, be filled. It's called an imperative in the Greek. So be filled with the spirit is an imperative. It's the should, it's the command. Another thing about this is that this is passive. Now there's a difference between an active and a passive voice in the Greek. Active is a command that tells you to do it. Passive is a command that tells you to allow it to be done. Okay, so the difference would be if I was talking to Anna and I said, Anna, open the door, that would be an active command, and she has to act upon that. If I said, Anna, allow the door to be opened, that's a command also, but it's a passive command. In other words, either way, Anna will benefit from an open door. One of the ways will be that she actually did the action. The other way is that she will benefit from the action. Understand this? Active and passive. When Paul says be filled with the Spirit, he's not saying fill yourself with the Spirit. He's saying allow yourself to be filled with the Spirit. One of the ways to not be filled with the Spirit then would be to prevent this from happening by trying to get filled from something else. Understand? You cannot make yourself be filled with the Spirit, but you can get in the way of it. and the way you could get in the way of it would be trying to get filled from something other than the spirit wouldn't be getting filled with the spirit the last thing about this though is that this is a present tense and whenever you see a present tense in the Greek what that means basically is whenever it's now just add that word those three words onto the end of the sentence and you basically have the meaning whenever it's now Allow yourself to be filled with the Spirit whenever it's now. So that would be like saying, allow yourself to be kept being filled. When? Now. And now, and now, and now, and now. Now, I've heard people say that their husband is a Spirit-filled Christian, or my wife is a Spirit-filled, or our pastor is a Spirit-filled Christian. there's a sense in which there really isn't such a thing as a spirit-filled Christian. Do you understand? There's only Christians who are being filled and being filled and being filled and being filled and being filled. That's the command. This be filled is not a quantity word. It's not, Paul's not saying you're only half filled, so get the rest of the way filled. Okay? It's more like, it's the Greek word pleroma, And it's more like fulfilled, filled full, okay? And it kind of is the concept of a sailboat with a sail that's full of the wind, and when the sail is full of the wind, the boat moves, okay? But those of you who know aerodynamics and physics know, when a plane is taking off, it seems like, when you think about it, it seems like what makes the plane go up in the air is the wind pushing on the bottom of the wings, right? But it's not really that. What is it? Do you remember? It's called lift, okay? And what lift is is that when the wind is pushing on the bottom of the wings, it creates a negative pressure on the top of the wings and actually pulls the plane up into the air. You ever drive down the road when you're driving and you have your hand out the window and you go like this, you know, all that kind of stuff like that? It seems like it's the wind pushing on your hand, but really when the wind hits the bottom of your hand, it creates a negative pressure on the top of your hand, and your hand is actually being pulled, even though it feels like it's being pushed. Well, in a sailboat, when the wind fills up the sail, it creates a negative pressure on the front side of the sail. So actually the sailboat is being pulled along rather than pushed along, and that's why you can get a sailboat to pretty much sail into the wind if you wanted to. If you can fill the sail just right, you could even go almost right into the wind if you can create that negative pressure on the front end of the sail. So being filled with the Spirit is not about being pushed along by the Spirit. It's more about being drawn along by the Spirit, pulled along, which is not something that you can make happen, but it is something you could get in the way of happening if you tried to get filled from something else. Which, once again, in marriage counseling, I see family members trying to get filled from other family members, And that's why it's significant that this passage is here. Well, then he says, Don't get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Now, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs is not the should. In other words, in the Greek, that's not a command. That's just a result. The command is this. Allow yourself to be kept being filled. One of the ramifications of that, one of the results of that, one of the ways that looks, one of the ways that comes out is speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. So Paul's not saying talk nicer to each other. You should really speak nicely to each other. He's saying get your filling from the Spirit and one of the ways that looks is, one of the fruits of that, One of the products of that is speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. But what I want you to look at here is that now, instead of blaming interpersonally, we have a different kind of dynamic going on interpersonally, and that is we have psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, but this is not a should. That's the point. The point, the should is be filled with the Spirit. Then he says, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. Well, Paul is not saying you ought to sing more. Start singing to the Lord more, okay? He's saying, be filled with the Spirit. That's the command. Singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord is a result of if you pull this off. So one of the ways it looks like when you get your filling here is a song in your heart. He's not saying you ought to have a song in your heart more. Following this? A lot of us have been taught that these are shoulds. Speak more nicely to each other, sing to the Lord more, and be more thankful than you are. Well, that's like the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness. The fruit of the Spirit are not shoulds. That's not a list of shoulds in Galatians. The should in Galatians is in verse 16 and again in verse 25 where Paul says walk by the Spirit. That's the should. Present, keep walking and walking and walking. Walk and walk and walk now and now and now. And one of the results of that, what it looks like if you do walk by the Spirit, which maybe is a Galatians 5 way of saying what we're saying here in Ephesians 5, one of the results of that is that the Spirit produces in your life love and joy and peace, but they're the fruit of the Spirit. They're not the fruit of you trying to have the fruit of the Spirit. Paul's not saying, act like you love people you really can't stand, and when you're really miserable, paste a smile on your face and fake joy and grit your teeth and tolerate people and call it patience and don't make any waves and call it peace, that's not the fruit of the Spirit. Do you understand? That's the fruit of you acting like you got the fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit doesn't tire anybody out because the fruit of the Spirit is the fruit of the Spirit. And you just bear the fruit of it. You don't produce the fruit. The Spirit produces the fruit. Same thing with this. This is just fruit that the Spirit produces that comes out in our lives. And so now, instead of fear and shame, though, on the inside, because remember in the curse in Genesis, we had fear and shame, now we have a song. And then it says, always giving thanks to all things, even to the Father. Well, Paul is not saying you ought to be more thankful. He's saying, be filled with the Spirit. One of the results of that is going toward God with thanksgiving. But for a lot of us, see, we've had thanksgiving legislated where we're supposed to act more thankful even though we're not that thankful. And then, of course, even when we do that, we know it didn't count because God knows that we weren't that thankful in the first place. So it's really a dead-end street. But let me tell you this. When it sinks into a person's heart and into their mind, how much God really loves them and how forgiven they really are and how off the hook they really are and how much God has done for them and how redeemed they are and how special they are and how much of a family part of God's family they really are when that begins to filter into the the the core of their life one of the ways that people respond is that they feel thankful for that it's like there's gratitude there there just is so if you came to me as a counselor and you said you know, I'm really struggling with being grateful to God. I don't think I'm grateful enough. I wouldn't try to help you be more grateful. Do you understand? I would try to help you understand what it means that you have this God that loves you so much and all that kind of stuff. And if you got it, if that sunk in, you'd be grateful. So that's just a result, once again, of being filled with the Spirit. So now you can see that the ramifications in relationships that result from the curse, that resulted from being independent from God and now having relationships be distorted, Paul is saying, no, be filled with the Spirit, get dependent on God again, be dependent on God. All Paul is doing here is telling us to do what if Adam and Eve had remembered to do it, we wouldn't be having this talk in the first place, which is to be dependent on God. And what that looks like in people's lives are psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, a song in your heart, giving thanksgiving to God. And then it says in verse 21, being subject to one another in the fear of Christ. Now, being subject to one another looks like this. Here's X and here's Y. One another is a reciprocal pronoun in the Greek, which means that both people will benefit from the action of the verb because both people are doing the verb, which sounds kind of fancy, but all that means is this. When it says love one another, it just means that both will be loved because both are loving. When it says comfort one another, it means both will be comforted because both are comforting. When it says bear one another's burdens, it means that both will have their burdens borne because both are bearing burdens. So when it says be subject to one another, it means that both will experience someone being subject to them because both are being subject to the other person. It's the Greek word hupostasis, which means arrange yourself underneath the other person. It's a military term. Being subject in this way, arranging yourself underneath the other person, is what privates do to sergeants, and sergeants do to captains, and captains do to majors, and majors do to generals. So, being subject to one another in the fear of Christ looks like this. Person X places himself underneath person Y, and person Y places himself under person X. the resulting relationship is two people, both of whom are over someone and both of whom are under someone because both are placing themselves underneath the other person. Now remember in Genesis, the result was two people, both of whom are over and both of whom are under because both are placing themselves over. In Ephesians, both are over and both are under because both are placing themselves under. But it doesn't say be subject to one another. It says being subject to one another, which means that's not the should. The should is be filled with the Spirit. And one of the results is that in your relationship with someone else, you can place yourself underneath the other person because you're already filled coming in on the front end, right? You don't have to try to get filled from that person because if you did, you'd have to place yourself over that person like we talked about in the dynamics of the relationships last session. So what we have are person X, person Y, both of whom are over and both of whom are under because both are putting themselves under. But then it says this, wives be subject to your husbands. Now what's interesting is that in the English translation, in my Bible, and in most Bibles actually, it says wives be subject to your husbands, but the word be subject there, the two words be subject is in italics. Does anybody have your Bible open to this? Is there anybody here who does? Well, if you look in there, you'll see be subject in italics. And I don't know if you know what that means. Does somebody know what that means? It means it's not there. It's not really there. So the verse does not say wives be subject to your husbands. It says wives to your husbands. Wives to your own husbands. Which means that Paul is stealing the verb, be subject. He's stealing it, borrowing it from the verse before, because that's where you find it. Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ, wives to your husbands. So let's put this up here. Here are wives. Here's husbands. Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ, wives to your husbands. Well see, if I just stop there, if I don't say anything more, then I don't have being subject to one another in the fear of Christ. Do you understand this? In other words, I think that Paul is not starting a new thought when he says, wives, be subject to your husbands. I think he's illustrating an old thought. He's applying that thought, being subject to one another in the fear of Christ, he's applying that to the marriage relationship. It's like he's saying, being subject to one another in the fear of Christ, i.e., for example, wives, your husbands. But if he doesn't finish the thought, then he hasn't illustrated what it means to be subject to one another. It would be like if I said to Jeff and Anna, you know, being subject to one another in the fear of Christ, Jeff to Anna. And then I go home, okay? If I don't say anything more, I don't have being subject to one another in the fear of Christ. I just have Jeff being subject to Anna. So I have to say something to Anna then that would illustrate what it means for her to do her part of the deal so that we have the finished illustration of what it means to be subject to one another. And I think that we get that. Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ, wives, your husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. So, here's what this looks like. If this is Christ, this is Christ, and this is the church. And what it says is that the husband is the head of the wife, like Christ is the head of the church, which means if you want to see what it looks like that the husband is the head of the wife, you've got to see what it looks like that Christ is the head of the church. And whatever that looks like is what this is like. So to understand headship of husbands over wives, you have to understand headship of Christ over the church. Follow this? So, how is Christ the head of the church? Well, in Ephesians 1, verse 18, I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of his might, which he brought about in Christ. So we're talking about the Father in relationship to the Son. Which he brought about in Christ when he raised him from the dead, seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one to come. And he put all things in subjection under his feet and gave him his head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all. What this talks about is this, that regarding everything in the universe, the Father put Christ over all of that. Or he put everything in subjection underneath Christ's feet. So it's almost like he did this. It's almost like God kind of just put everything in subjection under Christ, gave that to Christ for him to be over, and then gave Christ as head to the church. So that's one way. I'll apply this in a minute. Ephesians 4, verse 7. But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift. Therefore it says, now this is a little bit nebulous here, and usually when you're reading your Bible for your daily devotions, you get to this spot, you skip it, because it's kind of weird, okay? Therefore it says, when he ascended on high, he led captive a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men. Now this expression, he ascended, what does it mean except that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth? See what I mean? He who descended is himself also he who ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all in all. And he gave some of his apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastors, and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the building up of the body of Christ. So here's the picture that's painted as this. It's an allusion to an Old Testament picture of the conquering king. So you're the people, and I'm the king. And over the hill here, they got a bunch of our folks captured, okay? And they got them in bondage, and they're prisoners. So what I do is I come with our army, and I ascend the hill, and I descend over there, and I beat up the enemy, okay? And I totally decimate them, and I take all the captives and set them free. That's our guys. And then I take the captors, and I make them captive. And then I take all the gold, all the silver, all the horses, all the jewels, all the cattle, all the sheep, and I come up over the hill, and then I descend back to you guys, and then I give you all you guys back, all your people back, all your family back, all the jewels, all the gold, all the horses, all the silver. But what this is really a picture about is Jesus, who, when he died, descended into the lower parts, and what he did when he was down there, wherever that is, He went up to the door of hell, kicked the door open, went in there, took captive the captors, set free the captives, blew the ceiling off the place, and ascended and gave gifts to the church. So, in these two pictures, what we see is that Christ's headship results in God using Christ to provide the church with everything that the church needs to become everything that God wanted the church to be. You see, if Christ is over us, if you're a believer and Christ is over you, it's not because Christ put himself over you. Do you understand that? Someday, every knee will bow. Everybody's going down someday, right? Ozzy Osbourne's going down. Everybody's going down. They don't even have to like it. They're going down. But when that day comes and God pushes everybody down, he's not going to have to do that with us. You know why? Because we're down already. That's one of the ways of talking about what a Christian is, is somebody who comes to Christ and says, I am under you. You are king. You are Lord. I'm going to place myself under you. So the church is under Christ because we have placed ourselves under Christ, not because Christ has put himself over us. Following this? But the way that Christ is our head is that he's there to make sure that we have everything we need to grow and become what God created us to be. And then if you look back in the original text that I was doing, Ephesians 5, it says, the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church, he himself being the savior of the body. Now you see, it tells in that text how Christ is the head of the church. He himself being the savior of the body. Okay, so here's Christ, and here's the church. Whose life did Christ count as being the more important life? His life or your life? Your life. So the way that Christ is the head is to lift you up, lift us up, and treat us, act toward us as if we are more important than his own life. In fact, in verse 25 it says, Husband, love your wife. It says, Christ loved the church and gave himself for the church. So where does Christ put himself in respect to the church as someone who gives himself for the church and acts like the church's life is more important than his own life. He places himself underneath the church. He lifts the church to the high place. He takes the low place. And the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church. And so if that's true, then the husband is underneath the wife and now we've got being subject to one another in the fear of Christ. See, if we have husbands and wives and wives placing themselves under their husbands and husbands placing themselves over their wives, then we don't have being subject to one another in the fear of Christ and what we have is a version of the curse. Understand? Now, as I'm saying this, as I'm saying that the husband is also subject to the wife, don't hear me saying that, so therefore the wife doesn't need to be subject to the husband because I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that what it means for a husband to be subject to his wife is to treat her life like it's more important than your own. Well, try doing that by trying hard. And in order to pull that off, you'd have to get filled someplace else because if you're getting filled here, you can't come underneath someone. You've got to get over that person. If anybody in the family is a servant, see, I think it's the husband, not the wife. And especially in light of a culture and in light of history that has put women down and given women many more messages that are shaming and that they're defective and that they're slaves and things like that. If there's anybody who needs to be a defender of them, it's Christian husbands who are heads of the wives like Christ is the head of the church. The strongest advocate, the biggest voice in that person's favor, you see. So what it means is that I take everything about me that is male and all my strength and all my power and all my knowledge, everything about me that's male, and come underneath my wife and serve her and build her and equip her and set her free to become who God created her to become, which I don't even know what that is, but God does, and I'm just a resource in the process. And she brings everything about her that's female and comes underneath me to help me become the best male that I can be, you see. And now we have two people coming under each other. and now we have being subject to one another in the fear of Christ. I also think that you need to pay attention to how Paul does a little bit of a switch on the definition of head. Because if you look in the dictionary for head, what you see is CEO, like boss, chief executive officer. And if you look in this culture for that, you'd find the same kind of thing. And if you looked in the Greek literature of this time, you'd find the same kind of thing. And so what Paul is doing in Ephesians 5 is the same thing that Jesus did in Matthew 23 when he talked about whoever would be the leader would be the servant. You know, where are you going to find a definition of leader that says leaders equal servants? Nowhere except in Matthew 23. And it's almost like Jesus is saying, look, everywhere else that you look, everywhere else in society, in the whole world, leaders are the person in front, the one in charge, the one who calls the shots. But in the kingdom of God, leaders are servants. And so he's giving us almost like a kingdom dictionary. Do you understand? And when he says, in Ephesians 5, when Paul says, heads are the one that treat the other person like their life is more important than their own life, you're not going to find that definition anywhere else. It's like Paul is saying, you know, everywhere else that you look at what a head is, you see the person who's on top. But in the kingdom of God, you know what the head is? the head is the person who comes under and serves and builds and equips and is willing to die for the other person. That's what heads look like in the kingdom of God. And so the resulting relationship is two people, both of whom are under someone and both of whom are over someone because both are placing themselves under the other person. A relationship that looks like this. God, male, female, children, slaves, pets. Okay. There does not need to be a God in heaven to do this. Now this is what it looked like at Ephesus, and you have to try to put your Ephesian ears on once and try to hear what this sounded like if you were one of these people hearing this. When Paul comes to this woman right here and says, wives, arrange yourself underneath your husbands, that's not news to this person, do you understand? Because she was already underneath her husband. If there is news there, it's because now, instead of arranging yourself underneath your husband because culture demanded it, it was your place. It was just your place. Now, come underneath your husband as an expression of getting your filling here instead of here. The real news, though, is to the husbands because for this husband to place himself underneath his wife is going to go against everything he's ever heard, everything the culture says. His friends are going to think he's off the deep end. I mean, in order to pull this off, he'd have to know that he was okay because of Jesus because the message he's going to get is he is not okay. Something's really wrong with him. So the real confrontation is on this male. When Paul says in Ephesians 6, children obey your parents, and so he comes to the kids and he says, children, put yourself underneath your parents. That's not news to the children at Ephesus. It's just that the children at Ephesus had to obey their parents because if they didn't obey their parents, they got sold. or beaten, you see. The real news is not be under your parents. The real news is that now children come underneath your parents as an expression of getting filled here. The real news is to the parents at Ephesus who didn't have to treat their kids like they were special. You know, Paul says in Ephesians 6, 4, fathers don't provoke your children to anger. In other words, fathers. And it's interesting that he addresses fathers. The reason he does that is not because it's not possible for mothers to provoke their children in anger because they do all the time. It's because at Ephesus, the father had the title of parent even though the mother did most of the work. Kind of like today. So he came to the fathers and confronted them and said, you know what, when you're coming to your disciplinary situation with your child, there is a time when you defer. There's a line that you don't cross, and it's the line that to cross it would provoke that person to seething hostility. instead bring them up in the nurture and discipline of the Lord provoking deceiving hostilities pushing down instead bring them up and so what he's doing is he's telling parents to come underneath their kids that's news to the parents at Ephesus and especially the men it's news to the men to treat their wives as special women kept house and raised the kids and the husband went out with other women and had sex and had companionship and had friendship and went to the temple prostitutes and had spiritual revelation revealed to them and then they came home once in a while. And for that husband, you see, to now be told by Paul to treat that wife like Christ treated the church is like brand new news. Understand? And then he says to slaves, in verse 5, slaves be obedient to those who are your masters. Well, you know, slaves be underneath your masters. That's not news to slaves. Do you understand that? The news to slaves is this. Now we have a different motivation because our old motivation was, because they'll kill you if you don't, okay? This motivation is, with fear and trembling and sincerity of heart as to Christ, not by way of eye service, not just because it looks good, not as men pleasers, not just to get somebody off your case, but as slaves of Christ doing the will of God from the heart. Well, see, you can do something from the heart if you get filled here. If you get filled here, I might do what you want me to do. but I'm going to fake it just to get okay from you. With goodwill renders service as to the Lord, not to men, knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free. And then he says an incredible thing. Masters do the same to them. Well, you know who the masters were at Ephesus? Men. Women weren't allowed to own property. Only men could own property. And what he's saying is, you know, slaves come underneath your masters, but now he's telling masters to come underneath their slaves. And all of these are illustrations of being subject to one another that I talked about in Ephesians 5. So what we have is a relationship dynamic that you cannot pull off if you're getting filled here. Archie Bunker had this relationship. Do you understand this? There doesn't need to be a God in heaven to have this relationship. You can do this by trying hard. The world has done this without any relationship to God whatsoever. Our job is not to do a nicer version of this than the world does of this. Our job is to do the plan, but you can only do the plan if you come back into a dependent on God relationship and get your filling there, then you can come to relationships as a full person to spill fullness off into other people versus an empty person to try to get full from the other person. one last thing typically because of that other dynamic I talked about when husbands and wives come into marriage counseling husbands always know more about the wife verse than they know about the husband verse and the wives always know more about the husband verse than they know about the wife verse and parents always know more about the kid verse than they know about the parent verse the kid verse, children obey your parents Do you know who that verse is addressed to? Children. It's not addressed to parents. It doesn't say, parents, get your kids to obey their parents. It says, children, obey your parents. For parents to use that verse to try to get their kids to perform is like opening somebody else's mail. That's not your mail. You got your own mail down here in Ephesians 6.4. For wives to remind husbands of their verse, or husbands to remind wives of their verse, is dealing with mail that's not yours. You have your own verse. and if everybody had their filling here instead of here and did their own verse this would be okay. The reason that's hard is because you can't see the spirit that we're supposed to get filled from and here's your spouse right here acting weird and doing it the way you wish they wouldn't and here's your kids being weird and people looking at them and knowing that you're the parent and now you're supposed to get your okayness from a source that you can't see in the face of all this stuff that you can see, and that's a fight, but that is what we're supposed to do. That's why it's called the fight of faith. One last little illustration. And this kind of ends where I started, and that is that I'm a needy person. We're all needy. It's not a good or bad thing. It's just a thing. And so here's Jeff. Jeff, the needy person. and God is my source which means that another way to talk about being a Christian is a person for whom God is their source I tried to get life from a lot of stuff that promised life and didn't give it and then one day I got life from where life was and that's God so I'm a needy person, God's my source but God knows that I need to get here to give this talk and get home afterwards so he gave me a car. Well the car is a resource from the source to serve me to serve you. Understand this? Cars are really good resources but they're really lousy sources. but I know people who treat their car like it's their source. And they drag you over by their car, and they point at their car, and they don't say it just like this, but they kind of say, do you know how wonderful I am because I have this car? I mean, do you know how many points I have as a human being because I have this car? Because cars are so powerful, see, that they can give me points as a person. And so these end up serving their car instead of the car serving them. And they drive it on the end of the parking lot and park it in two spaces because if you're going to get okay from your little false god car, you don't want dents in it. People hate their false gods that have dents in them, so they want to make sure nobody dents their car. Now, see, I'm not saying don't wash your car, don't take care of your car. Understand? I'm just saying don't get okay from your car. Cars don't have the power to do anything but get you from point A to point B. That's it. I used to have this Dodge Colt, you know, that... Somebody opened the door up on the oncoming traffic and it got crunched and so it's rusted and things were falling off of it and stuff. And whenever I would see somebody park their Z or whatever they were parked down in the two spots at the end of the lot, I would go park as close as I could to them. You know what that's called? It's called evangelism. See, I might never get to tell them that cars don't have the power to make anybody special, but I can make them suspicious. And I can raise some insecurity in them, and you may get to tell them someday that that's it. And the best I can do is just make them a little nervous about their false god, understand? It's also, I was feeling kind of rebellious too, but that was just a minor point. Okay, well God knows that I need to not get rained on in freezing the winter, so he gives me a house. And the house is a resource from my source to serve me, to serve others. But I know people who treat their houses like it's their source too. And you walk in their house, and you can't even walk on the carpeting, and you can't even sit in the furniture. The furniture's all covered up, you know, because if you're going to get okay from your furniture, you don't want to have people sitting on your furniture, right? You might get a stain on your false god. People hate their false gods to get stains on them. See, I thought furniture was here to serve people. But sometimes you have a scenario where people are serving furniture. You can tell what someone's false god is by what happens if you get too close to it. Because when you get too close to people's false gods, they start getting nervous and irritated, you see. I mean, if you walk into somebody's house and track dirt on their carpet and the fruit of the Spirit disappear out of their life, no joy, no peace, no peace, gone. See, it wasn't the fruit of the Spirit. Do you understand this? It was the fruit of the carpeting. Well, God knows that I need a job to pay for all this stuff, so he gives me a job, but a job is a resource. But I already told you how some people treat their jobs like it's their source, and they get their sense of identity and value and all that from their job. Jobs are here to serve me to serve you. Well, God knows that I have companionship needs and friendship needs and intimacy needs and those kinds of things, and so one of the people he puts in my life is my wife, my spouse. If you don't have a spouse, maybe you have a friend. It doesn't matter. God provides relationships that are resources to us to meet these needs, but my wife is a resource from the source. You understand? She's not the source, but sometimes I treat her like the source, And whenever I treat her like the source, guess what? She fails because she's a lousy God. Okay, she's an okay wife. I'm an okay husband, but I'm a lousy God. And whenever I'm in a position of having to be God for her and do it right enough so she's okay, I fail all the time. And then when she fails, then I fix her instead of love her. And when I fail, then she fixes me instead of loves me. Children are a gift from the Lord, it says in Psalm 127. Children are a gift from the Lord, but I know people who treat their kids like it's their source, like they're their source. Instead of loving their kids, they're fixing their kids all the time. Last verse, 1 Timothy 6, 17. Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to become conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly gives us all things to enjoy. That verse does not say money is bad and God is good, so fix your hope on God. That verse says, money is uncertain and God is certain. So fix your hope on the certain thing. Who gave us the uncertain thing to enjoy. Instruct those who are rich in cars not to become conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of cars, but on God who gives us cars to enjoy. You can tell when someone starts fixing their hope on the uncertain thing because they stop enjoying it. And they start fixing it and getting anxious about it and protecting it and, you know, guarding it instead of just enjoying it. And we're told to fix our hope on the certain thing, enjoy the uncertain things because they're uncertain and they change and we might not have them tomorrow.
