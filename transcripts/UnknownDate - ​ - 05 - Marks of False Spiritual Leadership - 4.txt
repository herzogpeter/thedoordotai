Okay, let's pray. Okay, as we begin, we thank you for your word again, and as we deal with this particular issue, we thank you for the fact that you cared about this enough to fight for it and say it out loud. And I pray, Father, that your spirit would be released among us for continued work of healing in our hearts. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. You're obviously aware of the fact that we're dealing these weeks with the issue of spiritual abuse. And one of the things I just kind of wanted to reflect on as we begin tonight is that having grown up in the church, I heard a lot, and I think if you grew up in the church, you also heard a lot about the kinds of things that could destroy the purity and the vitality and the vigor of the work of God. And generally, when we were identifying what the enemy was that could destroy the work of God, the source of the danger was some ism, like secularism or humanism or materialism and liberalism or Satanism. And while I believe that those things indeed are serious, powerfully serious, there was a sense that was kind of built into me about the kinds of things that could destroy the church, that the kinds of things that could destroy the church were always out there. There was some evil thing out there. And one of the hard things we're learning about this issue of spiritual abuse is that this form of destruction in the body takes place from inside. It's an inside job. And that's one of the reasons I believe that God is so adamant about the issue why Jesus spends such a significant period of time on it. I think it's significant that the final sermon Jesus ever preached, and that's what Matthew 23 is actually, if you want to call it a sermon, it's his final public sermon or declaration, is not spent on salvation, it's not on sanctification, it's not on service, it's not even on the power of God and the believer. It's a warning about false leaders because one of the fundamental, I don't know, I think it's safe to say that the greatest danger to the church and its integrity and its life is an inside job. Generally, when outside attacks come to the church, what happens? The church gets stronger. It's a weird deal. When we get attacked from the outside, the church gets stronger. When there's a withering away of what matters on the inside, that's what really begins to undo things. The first thing we've done in this text or in this chapter in terms of dealing with the exegesis is discovered that in verses 1 through 12, Jesus identified who false leaders are. And the characteristics, I've got most of them listed here, false bases of authority. They lack integrity, meaning they say but do not. They weigh people down with the performance-based legalism and external manipulation. And they wear their religion on the outside. Image is everything. Looking good is what matters. They require the accolades of people. They love to sit at the place of honor. They love to sit at the banquets. Respectful greetings in the marketplaces are absolutely vital to them. As we came to verse 13, as we said just a couple of weeks ago, there was something kind of switching in the focus of Jesus. Rather than simply remarking on or confront or revealing the characteristics of false leaders, he then moves on in verse 13 and following to talk about the impact of false leaders. And my kind of assessment of that switch is that it's as if Jesus is saying, I'm not going to allow you to minimize this. I'm not going to allow you to kind of maybe even recognize these characteristics in the system you're in and then just kind of consider them to be benign as in not harmful. Because the truth is what these characteristics do, false authority, lacking integrity, weighing people down, external religion, and requiring the accolades of men. When you have those ingredients in the system, they shut off the kingdom from people who are trying to enter. I think we did that last week. Was that last week? Okay. They shut off the kingdom from people who are trying to enter. They devour people. We talked about that because of what we call the role reversal. Instead of the shepherds being there for the sheep, the sheep are there for the shepherd. And I get my, or the leaders get their sense of value and identity from how the sheep are looking and things like that. Sorry. Where was I? They devour people. Okay. The role is a reverse. The other thing is they reproduce. They reproduce themselves. we saw in verse 15, what are you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte, but when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourself. And what we talked about there was the fact that while they were zealous to make proselytes, it looked like they were zealous for evangelism, but what they were really doing was they were recruiting, they weren't evangelizing. And the way we know they weren't evangelizing was because they weren't making sons of God, they were making sons of hell. That's how you could tell, I mean, textually wise. We went on to talk about how instead of evangelizing, they were recruiting. And I kind of told you that story about the people who came and tried to get me saved. And when I told them I loved Jesus, they didn't believe me because I didn't buy their system. That was the idea. I made a distinction between, biblically, the Pharisees had a view of a proselyte of the gate and a proselyte of righteousness. Remember that? The proselyte of the gate was the Gentile who, upon recognizing Yahweh as the true God, bent their knee to him and believed in him as God. And the Pharisees then really weren't very impressed with that kind of belief. It was what we would call a simple believer. And the proselyte of righteousness was a Gentile who became a convert to Judaism, if you will, recognizing Yahweh as the true God, but bought the bag of Phariseeism. got circumcised, learned the traditions, and the focus of their energy was no longer learning how to be a man or a woman of God. The focus of their energy was learning how to be a good Pharisee. Today, it would be being more preoccupied with being a Baptist than having any idea what it meant to be a man or a woman of God. More preoccupied with being Alliance or Lutheran or Catholic, that's the preoccupation, than being a born of the Spirit, child of God. Dangerous stuff. I think it's dangerous stuff. And the other thing is, it's everywhere. I was pastor of this church for four months when I went to my first denominational meeting. And I had heard wonderful things, and I was assured that as soon as I got to the denominational business, that I would be delighted and we would have a wonderful old time. And something happened at that denominational meeting. I'll never forget. There was a new college president of our denominational school being inducted. He was one of the youngest presidents we were ever going to have. And he had at one time been the youth pastor here at this church years ago. And so he was going to address the assembly. And I'll never forget this because I was looking forward to it. Because I kind of felt this kinship with him. We were kind of serving in the same place here. He had been here several years before. And he was just coming in and I was just coming in. And so it felt great. What I'll never forget is that, again, you've got to know that I didn't know a soul here. So I'm just trying to find my place in this meeting of this denominational deal, this district thing. I'm listening to him talk, and he gets on this thing where he began to lament the fact that a young woman who had grown up in his ministry, then had gone to the denominational Bible school, then met a guy from another denomination, which was the one I was out of, this BGC, met a guy from that denomination, and they got married. And then she went with him to go into full-time ministry in the context of the BGC rather than our denomination. Okay. Except that the next words out of his mouth were this. We're losing our young people. I said, what? I thought, what is this? You know, again, I'm trying to figure out what is this denomination? Where am I? You know, what is this place about? We're losing our young people. We raise them, we train them, and then we lose them. That made me nervous. The next thing he said made me more nervous. It was this. Not only are we losing people out of our denomination who understand our distinctives, and they're going into other denominations, but we're beginning to get pastors and church leaders from other denominations into our denomination. And the phrase I'll never forget was this. They don't understand our distinctives. They don't understand our distinctives. Alliance distinctives. I'm trying to be really nice here. Like, don't name names. It's like you don't know what I'm talking about. The Alliance Distinctives. That was the exact quote. Again, I've been in the Alliance four months. I found out later everybody didn't think like him. Everybody doesn't think like this person did. But there was a message to me four months into this church, four months into this denomination, the message was this. It is not going to be enough to just love Jesus to fit in here. You're going to have to buy the bag. If you're going to fit in here, you're going to have to get into the system. And I ran like a maniac. It took a long time for me to even have an inkling of interest in what the alliance was doing. I've changed some of that, but that's abusive. That is a mark of a false ingredient. I was very careful not to call the alliance a false system. There's a false ingredient, at least in that meeting, that was wrong. That was false. Okay. And by the way, I think, I just think that's more widespread than we like to believe. And that kind of talk gets amened at those meetings. That was another thing that scared me, was the rumbling of amen, amen. Okay. The last two things we kind of closed up with last time was they don't talk straight. It's another ingredient or a mark or an impact. The other was what we left with was inverted spiritual values. And that's where we kind of open it up. And I asked you to give some examples and I couldn't stop you. Remember that of things that didn't matter. All of a sudden they become paramount and we get all upside down. Moving on quickly. The next characteristic would be in verse 25. What are you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inwardly they are full of robbery and self-indulgence. You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean as well. Obviously, on the surface, and that doesn't mean superficial, but on the surface, the obvious confrontation here is that these false systems are hypocritical. Their focus is polishing the outside of the cup and looking good. These are all issues we've dealt with already in this chapter, but on the inside, there's something wrong. So obviously, on the surface, this is a focus on hypocrisy. I think, however, as it relates to their impact, There is something in this verse that reveals this kind of impact. They are full of robbery and self-indulgence. The word that caught my eye was the word robbery because in the Greek the word is arpage and it means to rob, plunder, or to rape. To rob, plunder, or rape. Now put this together with some of the other things we have kind of taught in this and heard in this chapter so far. The picture you have is that of a cup. There's a cup and it looks good on the outside. Let's make it a church. There's a church and it looks good on the outside. a synagogue, and it looks good on the outside. There's a theology, and it sounds good on the outside. There's somebody greeting me at the door, and they have a smile, and it sounds good, and there's a great come on, and the outside of the cup is polished and bright and shiny, but one of the impacts of getting involved in this system is that when you climb into the cup that looks bright and shiny, when you climb into the cup, you get plundered, you get robbed, You get used. Self-indulgence. Rape is the word for robbery. You get the life sucked out of you. Again, I think part of the reason for that is what we've already dealt with, and that is role reversal, where leadership begins to use people for their own ego satisfaction. They use people to build their own kingdom. They'll have God words all over it, but it has nothing to do with God in an abusive system. It has to do with their own kingdom. self-indulgence is the Greek word akarsia. It means an unrestrained desire for gain. An unrestrained desire for gain. And on the outside of the cup that you were drawn to, this church that looked nice and shiny, it says evangelism. And on the outside of the cup it says giving. And on the outside of the cup it says advancing the kingdom of God. But when you climb in, you find out that evangelism was really recruiting, that giving was really taking, that advancing the kingdom of God was really advancing the kingdom of me. And what he says to these systems or these people is you better look inside. Clean the inside of the cup first so that the outside may become clean as well. I don't want to be redundant, so I don't want to last long on this, but I think we need consistently to be looking past what we see out here. Not only, you know, not just in you or you and me, but you and you and me and me. Looking past what I'm doing out here to looking down in here, what's going on inside my heart. Because this is where it needs to be real. This is where it needs to be pure. Because it's not that hard. Pharisees were able to policy outside of the cup and have it look good. One of my favorite passages as it relates to this is David's psalm when he says, Search me, O God, and know my heart and see if there be any wicked way in me. What I like about that is that that communicates something about David's awareness of his own heart. And it's this. Search me, O God, and know my heart because I don't always know my own heart. I want to allow you to put the spotlight of your spirit and your truth on what's really going on in here. That's a terribly frightening thing to do. It is so much easier to just keep polishing the outside of the cup. If you grew up in a church, you know how to do it. If the original hearers, these Pharisees, did that and looked on the inside, What do you think would have happened? What do you think if they would have looked past their flacteries that they broadened and their tassels that they lengthened and all the giving that they did and the Bible verses that they memorized and looked past all that to the heart? What do you think would have happened? They might have repented. Before repentance, what would have happened? Brokenness, what? Would have felt real convicted in their heart. Anything else? Could have found nothing. Okay, what else? I think before any of that, I think all of those are right. I think all of those are right, but I think before any of that they'd have been scared to death i think they'd have been scared to death because for me to look past the inside and risk the potential of seeing robbery and self-indulgence if i care about how things look there's no way i can admit robbery and self-indulgence there's no way there's so much equity there's so much equity built up it would have produced brokenness it would have produced conviction but before any of that what would keep us away from doing any of that would have been the enormous amounts of equity we had built up in looking good and all of that is going to there's going to be a very large flushing sound i sometimes wonder and this is this is dave talking okay this is not a theological statement it's honestly just something i wonder about i i honestly wonder if there comes a point where we literally can't get it the equity is so built up that save an absolutely earth-shaking miracle of God, the potential of looking inside and affirming the robbery and self-indulgence that's in there, I wonder sometimes if it can get so thick, the delusion, that that becomes, save enormous pain. Normally that is what it takes, by the way. Enormous amounts of pain to break through the delusion. And rarely is it done voluntarily. Just like I'm going to look inside now. Especially if what you're committed to is this external thing. But if they would have looked inside, it would have been their salvation. It would have produced brokenness and it would have made them desperate for grace. See, the people, that's what's ironic. The things we run away from and wanting to look good and wanting to maintain this image, because we're scared about what we're going to discover if we look inside. If we do look inside, it's not going to be good news. We're going to see some junk. But the irony is it opens us up to life because when we see the junk, that's when we understand our only hope is grace. And we become meek and gentle and hungry for righteousness that we recognize we can't produce. But if you're polishing the outside of the cup, you're still convinced you can produce it. So keep on polishing. I would that you would look inside and that by a redeeming work of God, the inside would be made clean so the outside is clean as well. Okay. Move on to the next one real quickly. 27 and 28. This is one that a lot of us are familiar with. In fact, before I did Matthew 23, this was the one verse I knew out of Matthew 23. For you are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones. Even so, you too outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. Redundant. I mean, he's basically saying the same thing. Outside you look white and pure, inside you're full of dead men's bones. He's speaking there of a tomb, and what he's saying is that you are hypocrites. Okay? that's the surface thing there's something deeper than that that i kind of got to by by doing some study on what this tomb business was all about graves and tombs that people were buried in were scattered everywhere like today we have cemeteries and people are all kind of you know clustered and clustered we know where they are and we stay away according to ceremonial law if you ever touched a grave you were unclean now you've known from our study there were a number of things that could make you ceremonially unclean, and touching a grave would be one thing that would do it. During Passover, which is what's going on right now in this text, everybody's cramming into Jerusalem because of the Passover, what's happening in Passover is that pilgrims are coming from all over, literally, the world. And as a service to travelers on Passover, and that's, by the way, this little reference to whitewashed tombs would have clicked for these guys coming in from Passover, as a service to all the pilgrims from all over the world, everybody who knew where their personal family graves were would go out and whitewash them. Why? So you would what? See them, so you would what? Not touch them. Stay away from them. They're whitewashed sepulchers. If I touch a tomb, I'm going to become ceremonially unclean, so I need to stay away. One of the things that Jesus is doing here, beyond exposing again the hypocrisy, which he did in the verse before with the cup and the inside and now the outside whitewash inside dead men's bones on top of that there's a there's an implied instruction here and that is this when you see systems like this what stay away stay away why because they corrupt because they defile because they're going to leaven you i'm going to open it up here for a little discussion about this very thing some of you have asked me and i'm not going to just give you the answers because I don't know the answers. It's not like I'm going to make you work for it. I don't know the answer for each individual. But the question I want to ask is if you're in a system like this, do you, is it flight or fight? Let me ask it again this way. Do you stay and confront the system, fight it out, or do you leave? Let's talk about that for a while. How do you know when you're supposed to stay? How do you know when you're supposed to leave? Can we come up with some principles for this? I have some thoughts on this. I got one right here that says you better beware systems like this according to this text contaminate you so you'll have you got some biblical thing for leaving get out of there because you'll get ceremonially unclean you'll get 11 okay what do you think about that give me some some reasons to stay okay give me some reasons have you have any of you been in an abusive system where you felt that god was telling you to stay okay okay well okay then then i need your help that you're an abusive system you knew it was abusive and and god you felt god told you to stay tell just share some reasons for that because i think there are valid reasons for that yeah okay just to tell the truth and expose what's there to be to be the one to turn the light on to kind of be jesus in the courtyard of the gentiles i don't want to make it that grandiose but okay well that is though it is that though yeah joe Okay. Okay, no one to patch the wounds if you left because people were getting wounded. Okay. So you're going to be director of traffic? Go over there. Interesting, okay. Okay, I've heard that more than once and where somebody would just know that at certain levels of leadership it was very abusive but I'm in the young people's department or I'm in this area and boy grace is just coming out all over the place and they kind of leave us alone so we're able to bring the kingdom to this little pocket of people in this in this bigger thing and God told you that you just felt like God was telling you to do that okay what else what another reason yeah I know some people just leave and they went to a new church setting and she really felt it was real legalistic and everything so she slowly got a group of people together to pray while the Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. Good. Good. That's good. Anything else? realizing we couldn't we we we stayed because if we tried to leave it would cause a fight it did and it did it caused a big war you can't leave here okay going in front of matthew 18 okay boy that doesn't sound okay let's let's talk about that reason not to leave maybe we need to elaborate on that because i'm not sure that's a reason to stay that's that's another form of abuse that's another form of abuse being laid on you that almost sounds cultic like you're going to be in some way cut off or excommunicated yeah that's a word i heard over there okay what what do you think about have any of you experienced that like if you leave you're okay okay from your situation Yeah, Marlene. I was told that I was in another denomination, actually. I was a nun in the Catholic Church in the convent. I was told that if I left, I would go to hell. I mean, that was the way it was. So they were kind of using a subtle approach. wow okay The trouble I had in trying to discern that is that it was good, and it was dying to myself to leave because there was a lot of good relationships. I felt it was good, even with the bad. So it was a, you know, if I've got to do this, you know, I want some clear directions. And I think the Lord eventually gave me that, but there was a lot of dying to myself to let it go. Okay. So one reason you stayed was just because there were some legitimate good things there. that you saw some negatives, but there were some legitimate good things. Okay. The pastors and pastoring, and those people that are full of grace tend to start pastoring people, and then you feel the responsibility of these people looking to you, and you are fulfilling the role of a pastor to them, and then when you, which is a positive thing, you're hoping to fill them with some love and grace, well, then when you want to leave, it gets turned on you, When you're pastoring these people, they're going to fall away. If you leave, it's going to be your fault. Okay. You go in and drop the motives, and then those motives get turned right back on you. Okay. And this is what I was involved with. A lot of people stay in, and they still stay in because of fear. In our group, I was involved with what we used to do is we used to find out why everybody left and found sin in their lives, and we discredit everybody who left. And it's just like phobia and indoctrination. It instills everybody with fear that if they left, they go into some lower level of spiritual existence. Or we thought that somebody had died or something like that. That would be brought up in leadership meetings and things like that. And so they would constantly use it. Meaning they died because they left? Oh, yeah. They say things like, you know, see what happens when you leave God. So, okay, you just said something real big. Leaving that church was tantamount to leaving God. Okay. Okay, so your reason for staying then was fear. Like, maybe not the same kind of fear as that, but kind of like there would be this enormous loss of some sort spiritually. Nobody else had anything good to say. Okay. Nobody else had any proof. Okay. Because nobody else understood the kingdom's proof. Any other reasons to stay? Yeah. There was also hope and prayer that God would break this pastor. Okay. Hope and prayer that God would break the pastor. Because you saw enough good things and enough of a heart for God there that if something's changed, it would be incredible. Okay. Yeah, I've heard that a lot. Yeah. Are we using a state temporarily to help other people get out? Yeah, we've got a traffic director. yeah okay so okay i'm hearing you a little more in a trap not just like that more more helping them see some things they weren't seeing okay i think one reason can be at least for me it wasn't so much what was said, more like a pervasive attitude, like you don't know what to do. It's like you can't put your finger on what is going on. I don't know if you know what I'm saying, but it's like you can't determine really what's going on, so you're staying in it because you don't know what to do. It doesn't really feel good, but you're afraid and all those things come up, but it's not necessarily because like everyone else has had something said to them for me it was so confusing because the messages were kind of hidden okay okay oh yeah yeah tell me some reasons legitimate reasons for flight in a system like this in a system like this again the characteristics are the ones we're talking about here in a system like that reasons for flight Okay. Okay. Okay, just knowing you're not in a position right now because of the woundedness in your own spirit to be the helper to somebody else, you needed help. Okay? That's a reason to go. And a biblical thing for that would be, you know, you touched the whitewashed sepulcher, you've been leavened by this, and you need to go get healed. Okay. Okay. Okay, anything else? By saying you're agreeing with the system, you're supporting them with the contributions, you're perpetuating them, and people are saying, well, you know, They're looking at you and saying, what he said, if you didn't hear, was that sometimes when we stay, we're perpetuating the very abuse that we're trying to kind of, that we don't agree with, and with our support and financial support, we're going on. We're supporting it. A person that I have enormous respect for left a system that he called abusive, and I believe it was, for him especially, and he went through kind of two periods in this whole thing, and I'm tying it in with what you just said. He went through a period where he was really believing that God had laid something on his heart to be positive leaven in the church. You know, there's negative leaven, the leaven's the whole lump, and then there's positive leaven. In fact, that's biblical too, where it says the kingdom of God is like a mustard seed, or a kingdom of God is like leaven, and that we permeate. There's a kingdom permeation principle. He was significantly gifted and had some authority in the church, and was in a position to do that kind of thing. But after a while, I think the Spirit of God revealed to him and something switched in him and it was that very thing. What he said was, the people who I'm trying to give this message of grace and freedom to, some of them want it, but most of them don't want it. They don't. And the leadership doesn't want it. They're fighting it every way, every single way I go. And basically, my presence there, it wasn't even so much that I support it. Well, it was this. But my energy is keeping it alive when maybe what this needs to do is look as bad as it really is. Then maybe what this needs to do is look as bad as it really needs to look. And for some of those influences to be removed, it could crumble, and that may look like a disaster, but that may be what creates the brokenness that raises it up again. So that's another reason to leave from time to time. I was in a church. Someone called us to find out why, and he said that he wanted to leave the church. And he wanted to leave his church and come to another church. He talked to their friend right there, and she said, I know the Lord said, if we're at such and such a church, that would be the good place to be at. And he said, we just got here, you're leaving. And this was real scary to me, that we didn't even know. That people would be influenced by that and maybe get abused in ways that, Yeah, but there's people out there that are saying, that the rules are there. Right. Right. Because they respect you. And here we have left, and we have spent several years talking with our pastor and going through these things. People out there didn't know that. They didn't realize they were going through that. Right. It was real scary. Right. Okay. Anything else? For me, I think it was because of God. Mostly because I kept praying and I wasn't getting any leave from anything in church. And I had this urge like crazy to read the Bible. And I didn't have one then that was in Braille. And I said, can somebody, you know, can we read the Bible or whatever? And they said, no. And so I left. Okay. And I think I'm terrified. Okay. Okay. that's a good question I don't know I think it was an abusive system I don't think it was just an abusive system for him I don't think everybody there felt the same thing he felt. But I think it was an abusive system. Yeah, that's what I think. I think to answer that question, if you look at every family as dysfunctional in some way, every family on the face of the earth. Okay. Church or several other people is going to be dysfunctional because human beings are in it. Okay. It's going to be more abusive for like if a group doesn't mind drinking and an alcoholic comes into that system. it's going to be very abusive to that person more than it is for another person. That helps. That helps me get it. Well, for instance, if you have every family is dysfunctional in some way. Same with a group of people. For instance, if you have a group of people, like a group of young people, who don't mind going out to a bar and having a wine food, and an alcoholic joins that group, it's going to be an abusive system, and they tell them, oh, don't worry about it. But for another person who doesn't have that problem, it's not necessarily going to be abusive because they don't have that kind of a preceded problem within their lives. And if there's no sensitivity to that, it's going to be a very big difference from both perspectives. The person I'm even thinking of, that's a neat illustration, put that in a church system. The person I'm thinking of had been in this church for a long time and never felt abused, started coming to an understanding of grace, and all of a sudden, lights started going on all over the place. In fact, this guy was somebody who was a tremendously effective preacher and laments to this day, sermons he used to preach and ways in which he used to tie heavy weights on people. And so was it abusive? Yes, did he feel it? That's kind of what I was driving at. There was a period of time he was in that system, part of that system, then it wasn't abusive for him. It was abusive. But he came to the point where he started seeing it and experiencing it. And when he would start talking about that, some people literally just thought he was nuts and mean, that he was even mean. It's a weird thing when you're trying to bring grace that you're such a bad guy. It's just the weirdest thing. It is a weird thing. But that happened to Jesus. Got to keep moving here. Let me wrap this up a little bit and get to this last piece I want to teach tonight before we move to our opportunity for a ministry time. To wrap this up, false leaders shut the door of the kingdom of the people who are trying to enter. They devour people, reproduce a disease in their converts. They don't talk straight. They invert spiritual values. They spiritually rape. They contaminate. a further one here that I'm just not going to have the time to go into is they honor the prophets of the past but they hate the prophets of today I'll give you a little piece of that is it's like it's like okay I'll give you a little tiny thing I'm picking on the alliance tonight so I'll keep doing it um it's it's like A.B. Simpson who started the alliance everybody loves A.B. Simpson but if A.B. Simpson came into a lot of alliance churches today and said now what he said then they'd go bonkers okay that's because we love the prophets of the past it's just the prophets of today we don't like And we even say things like this, where are the Isaiahs? Where are the Jeremiahs? And these Pharisees would have said, where are the Moseses? Well, they had Jesus. The ultimate prophet, they had Jesus, and they nailed him to a cross. And one of the other marks of a false spiritual system is they love the old guys who are dead and don't talk anymore, but if they were in their church saying what they used to say, it'd blow the system to smithereens, but they like their picture. They always have somebody's picture on the wall, but the prophets of today, they despise and run out on a rail. that's another mark. Pull all that together. There's one final mark of them, and that is this, or characteristic, and that's this, that they're targets of God's wrath, and that's what I want to close with. The targets of God's wrath. Verse 32 is where I'm going to pick this up. Fill up the measure of the guilt of your fathers, you serpents, you brood of vipers. How shall you escape the sentence of hell? From verse 32 to 39, I want to break it into three parts. The wrath of God revealed, the grief of God expressed, and then the grace of God extended. The wrath of God, as revealed in verse 32, towards systems like this, and we've already seen the wrath of God on this system by Jesus blowing it up in the temple and turning over the tables, but now we're going to hear his words. Fill up then the measure of the guilt of your fathers. The first thing I want you to see about his wrath is that it's personal. It's personal. He's personally angry about what they're doing to people who are trying to get into the kingdom. I want you to simply note, even in the phrasing of that verse that this is not a dispassionate, objective, judicial kind of word. There's anger in this word. Philip, then the measure of the guilt of your fathers. There is no careful objectivity. He is not simply giving consequences all the while saying, Pharisees, it's not really about you. It is about you. I'm really angry, Jesus is saying, about what you've done to people looking for me. I'm really angry about how you use my name to promote your plan and use my name to get people what you wanted them to do, your snakes, your vipers. You're bound for hell. That's hard. But what I want to just give you a flavor of is that this verse, Philip, then the measure of the guilt of your fathers, it's personal. You brood of vipers, that's personal. There's something else here that communicates that this word is personal, and it's this phrase, Philip, the measure. Philip, the measure. It's term, filling up the measure, that's used often in scripture to speak of sin and judgment. And the picture is that of a cup or a bowl. Fill up the cup of, it's called a cup of wrath, a bowl of wrath. The picture I have in my mind's eye are these medieval castles where the people protecting the castle would be on top of the wall with a great big cauldron of hot oil. Remember that? And they would pour it over and that's what I thought of when I thought of fill up the measure of your whatever. What is unsettling and again what reveals the personal nature of this word here is that when he says fill up the measure of the guilt of your fathers, it's in the imperative. It blew me away when I saw that in the Greek. Imperative simply means it's a command. Jesus is saying, keep it up. Fill it up. Keep doing this. I want you to keep doing this. It's the equivalent of the spiritual equivalent of Clint Eastwood looking down the barrel of his 357 magnum saying, go ahead, make my day. Just keep doing this because, and this is something that I don't think we're all real settled with in terms of the character of God, when God sees systems abusing sheep and literally keeping them out of the kingdom, he gets angry about that. He takes it personally. And what he's saying is this, whether we like it or not. You know, if you guys do this much abuse to my children, I'm going to give you this much judgment. If you do this much abuse, I'm going to give you this much judgment. If you do this much abuse, I'm going to give you this much judgment. And I'm so angry about the wounded sheep from this system. Keep it up. Because I'm going to give you everything in the cup. It's personal. Now, I don't think he's calling for more sin, like keep it up. The power of the metaphor here is that I think God wants us to know, Jesus wants us to know 2,000 years later that he takes it real personal when a sheep get wounded. Takes it real personal. Verse 34 gets even a little bit weirder. Therefore, the Greek word there, therefore, is a Greek word called hapos, hapos, and it's a purpose clause. Therefore, or for the purpose of, I'll give you this in a second. Behold, I am sending you prophets for the purpose of, wise men, some of you will crucify, that upon you, for the purpose of, I'm getting very confused. I'm confusing here. Let me just read it straight. Therefore, I am sending you prophets, wise men, scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify. And some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city. That upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed upon the earth. That upon you is the hapas clause. And the reason, go back up, that I am sending you these prophets, these truth tellers, these ones that could possibly reveal your error. The real reason I'm sending them to you is so that the guilty blood is going to fall on you because I know you're going to reject them and I know you're going to kill them. And the reason I'm sending them to you isn't even for your redemption. It's so that you will get what has been coming to you from the beginning. I'm uncomfortable with that. What the intent of the text, I believe, is to say this. God takes it real personal when his sheep get wounded. He takes it real personal. and I'm going to send you people who will tell you the truth and you're going to reject them and I sent them in order that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from Abel to Zechariah it's personal and not only is it personal it's cumulative and that's kind of picked up there that upon you may fall the guilt of righteous blood shed upon the earth from Abel to Zechariah the son of Berechiah whom you murdered between the temple and the altar truly I say to you all these things shall come upon this generation it's cumulative therefore what's the therefore therefore you always ask that therefore or because of this because of what because of the fact that you shut off the kingdom from people who are trying to enter because of the fact that you devour people because of role reversal because of the fact that you have inverted spiritual values you lack integrity and you have this external sham, you play the game. Because of that, I am sending you truth-tellers. And the purpose will be not so much for a second chance, but that upon you will fall all the righteous blood from Abel till now. Cumulative wrath. Cumulative wrath. The picture I have in my mind's eye and the way I teach this is that of a snowball. A snowball at the top of redemptive history is where it started and it began to roll down the hill with Abel. It was a little snowball. And with Abel, the judgment on Abel was about this big. But it kept rolling down the hill of history and with more time when it got down from Abel to Zechariah who was murdered and everybody knew you shouldn't be murdering people that the the the ball of judgment wrath was bigger by the time the ball of judgment and wrath continued to go down to the time of Pharisees the ball snowball goofy illustration had gotten bigger okay and by the way 2,000 years after the Pharisees were given this word about a cumulative judgment that you're going to get all of the judgment from abel to zechariah two thousand years later we have to add this and i think it's accurate and on top of that the judgment of the pharisees and all of that that's built up since the pharisees till now and if you're going to be a spiritual abuser now you get the judgment ball bigger than what the pharisees got and they got it bigger than what zechariah got and zechariah got it and the murders of zechariah got it bigger than what abel got and it keeps getting bigger and bigger not only is their cumulative judgment going down the hill so we stand at a time in history where the ball goofy snowball of judgment is bigger than it's ever been just because time has passed i think there's a there's a a parallel snowball deep theological truth of revelation that's just the same way that one's cumulative too let me explain to you this way cain who killed abel had revelation uh cain had enough revelation about what was right and wrong at the time he killed abel to know that it was wrong to kill abel would you agree with that he had enough right he didn't have what we have he didn't have the same amount of revelation we have but he had enough to know that was wrong as time passed god gave more revelation about who he was and what his character was as time passed he gave the law he gave the prophets he gave moses isaiah jeremiah he gave the entire old testament and when zechariah according to this text is the next person zechariah from the blood of abel to the blood of Zechariah. By the time Zechariah was murdered between the temple and the altar, the temple had been built, so there had been enough revelation about God to build the temple. There had been enough revelation about God to build an altar, so the snowball of revelation and truth was much bigger than it had been at the time of Abel. By the time Zechariah was murdered, there was a tremendous amount of revelation to ignore and still go ahead and kill Zechariah. Okay? By the time the ball had gone down to the Pharisees, it had gotten even bigger. The result is this. Since the revelation was greater, the accountability is greater. Since the accountability is greater, the judgment is greater. The illustration I use for that is like, if I have a one-and-a-half-year-old boy and he's out in my driveway, remember my story about the car? And he's got my little can opener and he's writing his name in my car with his can opener. He's going to have consequences for that, but he honestly doesn't know what he's doing at one-and-a-half. So he doesn't have a whole lot of revelation. If my 16-year-old is out there with a can opener doing that, he's got a little more revelation. He's going to get a little more wrath. When we come into this chapter here with this teaching on the judgment of God upon systems that are abusing people, we're years past Zechariah. And what that means is that they have years more revelation. They had the law by this time. They had the prophets. They had Moses. They had Isaiah. They had Jeremiah. They had the example of Zechariah, that that was wrong. They had the completed Old Testament. They had the sacred writings. They had John the Baptist, and they had Jesus himself. What that means is they had an enormous amount of revelation to ignore, and they managed to ignore it. They had an enormous amount of revelation to reject, and they rejected it. And they hung on to their legalistic, external, abusive system. And because they ignored at this time overwhelming revelation, they got overwhelming judgment. Here's the deal. These Pharisees had the word of God in their hand. They had the word of God in their mouth, and they used the word that they had. And by the way, you know, I don't think I have to prove this, but these Pharisees and scribes knew the Bible backwards and forwards. And they used the Bible, the word they had in their hand and the word they had in their mouth, to establish false authority, to tie heavy weights on people, to shut off the kingdom, and to devour people. And that's why verse 36 says, you get it all. And all of these things, these judgments that have started from Abel to Zechariah until now will fall upon this generation. And some say that's kind of some apocalyptic thing for that generation and not for us. And for this generation, and for this generation, and for this generation, and for this generation. And you get it all. it's cumulative again we come down the pike 2,000 years after that and we too have the Old Testament and the prophets and the law and John the Baptist it's all in here that's how we have it and we have the record of Jesus in the gospels but far see what's weird I think we would all connect with this but we have way more revelation than the Pharisees had even though they had Jesus standing in front of them we have more revelation than they had we have the teaching of the apostles they didn't have that. We have the explanation of the epistles. In the epistles, we have the entire New Testament. We have the resident Holy Spirit. We have the new covenant. We have the gifts of the Spirit. We have the mystery revealed. That is the gospel hidden to those in the past. Plus, we have pastors and teachers and evangelists and prophets and books and tapes and videos and on and on and on. And seminars any weekend of the year. We know so much, it's absolutely frightening. And the snowball of God's wrath towards systems that use his name and in the name of God with the word in their hand and the word in their mouth, use it to hightly heavy weights on people and shut off the kingdom from people, the snowball of his revelation at this time in history is absolutely immense. And so is the snowball of his wrath. Like the Pharisees in Matthew 23, the word is in our hand and the word is in our mouth. Unlike the Pharisees, the word that is in our hand and in our mouth is infinitely more complete than what they had. But like the Pharisees, if we use the word and the revelation that we have to establish a false authority, to tie heavy weights, to pretend, to shut off the kingdom, to devour people, the weight of judgment since Abel's blood will be upon us. It's a pretty heavy word. Let me go to the next piece of this, the grief expressed. The grief expressed. I don't want to end with something that negative. Here's the grief expressed. So Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones, those who are sent to her, how often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling. Behold, your house is left to you desolate. Repeating Jerusalem twice, biblically, communicates pathos, communicates sadness. It's like David, when his son died, Absalom died in rebellion. David said, O Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son. It communicated enormous grief. The point is this. While the wrath of God satisfied his strong desire for justice, he takes no joy in it. Takes no joy in it at all. Jeremiah 13 says this. If you will not listen, there will be judgment. If you will not listen, there will be judgment. But my soul will sob in secret at your pride and my eyes will bitterly weep because the flock of the Lord has been taken captive by its own sin. Before the cleansing of the temple in Luke 19, the first cleansing, before he cleansed it, he wept over Jerusalem. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her. How often? I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling. What I want to just touch on right there is that the heart of God, while the wrath is real, the heart of God is not to give wrath. The heart of God is to gather. The heart of God is to gather. It's the heart of God. It's to draw people. It's to bring them. It's to redeem them, to protect them. It's to heal them. If you want an accurate picture of what the heart of God looks like as it relates to gathering people, even abusers, even perpetrators of this kind of stuff, it would be to picture Jesus with his arms extended, hanging on a cross, saying, come unto me. Even to the disobedient, he says that. To the vile sinner, he says that. Even to the Pharisee, he says that. even to the perpetrators. The last thing he did when he was on earth, the last words out of his mouth, just about, were, Father, forgive them. I want to extend that to them. And with his last breath, he gathered in a thief. He pulled them to his side. The analogy he uses in the text is that of a hen. Like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling. That's an incredible picture. The picture is that of a hen with chicks. okay the picture i don't know if god gave me this picture or not but i've never been able to forget this when we are living dependently upon the father and hanging on to him for dear life there's protection like chicks like a hen would offer to the chick under the wings of the father and i the picture i got was this you know david if you keep hanging on to jesus and take the word in your mouth and the word in your hand and use it to lift the load and open the kingdom and on and on and on you're gonna and you stay under the wings not only will there be protection but you know i think god fights battles for us that we don't even know about i just had this goofy picture of a little chicken under there under the wings kind of stupid oblivious that's what we were kind of oblivious to the spiritual warfare going on and under the wings of the father dependent on him staying there there all hell could be breaking loose in the heavenlies in on our behalf i mean the chicken hawk that wants to come and steal you away could be swooping like crazy and there could be an enormous conflict going on and i don't even know about it because i'm just sitting under the wings i'm just there and i think god does that for us in ways that we don't even know there's there is protection and there are there are battles on our behalf by god that we don't even know about but a lot of times like arrogant ignorant rebellious little children we say no it's my life i'm gonna do it my way and leave me alone and so we go i had this little thought about rebellion a couple weeks ago and i never got it into a sermon and i don't even remember the context but the kind there was some sort of rebellion to god going on and and i just had this thought flash through my brain and and the thing about rebellion is that makes you stupid makes you rebellion makes you stupid it's like it makes it like puts brain things in your brain and it makes you go goofy especially as it relates to god and this is not to shame anybody but the truth is that when i rebel i usually run away from the people who want to help me the most. Not always. Sometimes I need to rebel. There's a rebellion in the heart of God towards this system. I would hate to have that phrase used to make people stay in a system that's abusing them, but sometimes I rebel against the things and the people I care about the most. I'm watching my kids go into adolescence, and you know what? You know what I think? This is what I think. I don't think there's anybody on the face of this earth who cares about my kids more than me, but you know what I know? My kids are going to have rebellion. They're going to go through periods to rebellion. I hope they don't, but I expect a little bit of that. And what I'm going to be looking at is rebellion that's going to make them stupid. You know why? They're going to be taking advice from people who don't give a rip about them. That bothers me. That hurts me. And as a father for a child, I worry about that. I worry about that. They're going to take advice about where to get life, and they're going to take advice about what can make them happy from another 13-year-old, probably. Just a little thing. We run away from the thing that can protect us the most. It reminds me also of Jeremiah 2.13. You've forsaken me, the fountain of living water, to dig your own wells. And if you want to dig your own wells, fine, you're on your own. You're on your own. Isaiah 50.11. You've left the light that I can provide and you went to build your own fires. I can't make you stay here by the fire and by the light that I provide. You want to build your own fire, build your own fire. But you're going to have to live by the like that you can provide, and you're going to have to live by the water that you can dig up. The result of all that, verse 38, your house is being left to you desolate, and that's just another way of saying you're on your own. You get what you want. Your house is being left to you, but it's desolate. Desolate simply means barren, empty, vacant, uninhabited, cold. The picture here for the people of Israel, these God's people, is this. God no longer plows the ground. He no longer prunes the plants he no longer protects the hand of god the influence of god is removed as it says in the old testament ichabod and when ichabod is written what the glory departs behold has left you the house desolate i think it's an incredible picture and what really brings the picture to full focus is that one day previous to this statement he'd been he's in the temple now and one day previous to this statement he was in the temple when he turned over the tables and a day previous to this you might remember that when he turned over the tables, he said, this is my father's house, and you've turned my father's house into a house of a den of thieves, but he called it my father's house. A day later, he's saying, this isn't my father's house, this is your house, this is your house. That caught my eye. I looked this phrase up in the Greek, and literally what this phrase says in the Greek, desolate isn't in there, it's kind of an insertion to give us a picture, and it's accurate, but literally what the Greek says is this, behold is left to you the house of you. Behold is left to you the house of you. That's to say this, this isn't God's house, it's your house. God didn't build this house, you built this house. By tying heavy weights on people, by manipulating people, you built this house, God didn't build this house. So since it's your house, you get to keep it and I'm leaving. In a good sense, to give you a picture of this, if somebody walked into my our house and walked through the furnishings and saw the furnishings and the way things were arranged, nobody would compliment me. They would look at my wife and they would go, you know, Bonnie, this house is really you. This house is you. There's a reflection in the house of who my wife is. That's a good thing. I'd like to think, though, when God walks among his people, his house, as it were, not a physical building, but when God, in some sense, moves among his church, in his church, that his assessment is this. This is God's house. This is a house that God is building. To these people, he said, this house really looks like you. This is really you, because it ain't me. So you get to keep your house. It's the house you built with your manipulation and your heavy load you put on people, and you're using God's talk to get people to do what you wanted to do, and this isn't God's house at all. It's yours, so you get to keep it. Behold, it's left to you, the house of you. Final thing is grace is extended. For I say to you from now on, you shall not see me until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Now, I think that has some eschatological ramifications for the Jew especially. I think it is speaking in one sense of the end times when Israel will be redeemed. And they will say, according to Zechariah, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. But beyond that specific historic word to Israel, I think there's a timeless truth there. as it relates to perpetrators and systems like this, to people of God who've lost their focus, whose house has become desolate, who see not the face of God. Verse 39 says, you're not going to see me again, but if you cry out to me again and say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, my only hope is you, I will restore. And I think he does. I think he can. Father, I pray first of all for people here who need a gift from you today. Father, sometimes when we deal with these issues, and maybe even on this wrath piece, it stirs up and we get stirred in our spirit and all there is is anger. And Father, you're angry. But sometimes we need help sorting all that out. Sometimes the feelings aren't anger at all. It's just an absolute frozenness in our spirit and an inability to trust and wondering if there's ever going to be the juice of life again. And I pray in your name that you would come now with gifts of healing and gifts of life that you would break down some of the workings of the enemy that have wounded people and shut off, maybe not as far as salvation, but as far as experiencing the joy and the liberty of the kingdom of God that having had it shut off from them, that even today that you would open it up, that you would bring your grace and bring your healing. I pray for boldness for people who need a touch. Lord, sometimes when we've been abused, it's very hard to ask for help. And so I pray just for a spirit of grace here and a spirit of courage to ask for the help that's needed. I pray that you would mobilize people even beyond the altar ministry people, that people who are even sitting here who may get a word of grace and pray for each other, that there would be liberty for that. And I pray for the altar ministry too, for just sensitivity and an anointing on them to pray grace and healing. I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you.
