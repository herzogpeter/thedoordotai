Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Now there was a man named Simon who formerly was practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great. And they all, from smallest to greatest, were giving attention to him, saying, This man is what is called the great power of God. And they were giving him attention, because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts. But when they believed Philip, preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike. Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed. Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, saying, Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit. But Peter said to him, may your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money. Therefore, repent of this wickedness of yours and pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you. This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. It's a fascinating story, really. a disturbing story. Kind of getting into that, there's this guy named Simon who believes. That's good news, and is baptized and continues along with Philip and this new thing that's happening in Samaria. But at first blush, it actually looks not fascinating or disturbing. It looks just kind of irrelevant, to tell you the truth, because a guy named Simon, who, according to verse 9, is astonishing all the people of Samaria with his practice of the magic arts, is not something that feels terribly relevant to me. It's not something that I think we're going to face, somebody practicing magic arts. And if we did face something like that, it's certainly not something we would fall for because we don't see that kind of stuff. We don't believe in that kind of stuff, that kind of snake oil salesman stuff, but maybe more than we think we do, we do see this kind of stuff. It just comes in a different package today. It comes in different shapes and different sizes today, which is one of the deserving things, actually, that happened to me as I began to get into the story a bit more. But in order to see all of that, what's unveiling here, what's unfolding here, or at least begin to see all that's going on here, because I think we're going to be in here a couple of weeks. I want to remind you simply of where we are in the story. That is the book of Acts, because this story of Simon and what's going on in Samaria comes in the context, as you know, of a much bigger story. That is the book of Acts. The birth of the church is where it all began in Acts chapter 2 with what we've come to know as the baptism of the Spirit. They were immersed into the Spirit and life immediately came. This power associated with this baptism translated into 3,000 being saved, coming to faith in one day at the first sermon of Peter, 5,000 coming to faith at the second sermon of Peter in Jerusalem. It was an incredible time, but it was not a time without resistance, because right in the middle of all those really good things, exciting things, there were some really difficult things, frightening things, indeed horrible things. The first was this, the resistance from the chief priests, but then the culmination of that resistance in the stoning of Stephen. He was stoned to death in Acts chapter seven, followed by what the text refers to as this great persecution, headed up by this guy named Saul, who amazingly would one day become Paul. But Saul was given himself to ravage the church, causing everyone in Jerusalem, these brand new believers in Christ, to run for their lives. They were being scattered everywhere. but right in the middle of all that horrible stuff and frightening stuff was some more good and exciting stuff beginning to bubble right out of that horrible stuff because this very same persecution that scattered everyone, that actually threatened to put out the fire that had begun amazingly by the Spirit in Jerusalem, this terrible thing called persecution served only to spread the fire, to scatter this movement, to make it even bigger, because those being scattered, it says in verse 4 of Acts chapter 8, were preaching the word everywhere they went. They were telling the story about this Christ, and people were believing, and as it turns out, some of them who were being scattered went as far as this place called Samaria. Philip, being one of them, It says in verse 5 of Acts chapter 8, because when he got there to Samaria, he did what everybody was doing when they were being scattered. He began proclaiming Christ to these Samaritans who he had never met or been with. And they were eager to hear like so many people were when this wind of God was blowing in such a wonderful way. It says in verse 6, because multitudes in Samaria with one accord. They were all saying yes, giving attention to this teaching as they heard and saw the signs that Philip was performing. For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them shouting with a loud voice as demons tend to do when they're told what to do by the power of the Spirit of God. And so it is that right in the middle of some difficult circumstances, some horrible things, indeed they were the very things that forced Philip to end up in Samaria in the first place, was this explosion of wonderful things as well, these good and exciting things. Because Samaria was a pretty exciting place to be right now in Acts chapter 8. As more and more people were coming to faith, were being drawn into what God was doing in that place. And what God was doing in this place was obviously a legitimate and explosive work of God's Spirit, such that it says in verse 8 of Acts chapter 8, there was much rejoicing in that city. So from the persecution, which is awful, comes this wonderful stuff, resulting in much rejoicing in that city. But round and round, this story continues to go because this pattern continues to play out because right along with all these good things, much rejoicing in that city, that's a wonderful thing, come some negative things. Right in the middle of all of that, again, confusing and hurtful things, things that do in fact pose a very real threat to the life of this fledgling little church, to its very existence, actually, because this time in Samaria, the threat to the life of this just baby kind of movement here comes from a different angle than it came to them in Jerusalem. It's going to come to them with a different strategy. It's of a different nature, because in Jerusalem, the threat upon the life of this church and the work of the Spirit was a direct threat. It was an in-your-face threat that threw rocks at Stephen. That's kind of direct. And through those rocks until he was dead, the message in Jerusalem to this work of God's Spirit was, we hate you and we're going to kill you. But in Samaria, the threat didn't even look like a threat, which is a little scary because if a threat really is a threat but it doesn't look like a threat, you might be unguarded around this one, And a little more subtle was the threat in Samaria because the threat in Samaria actually looked like a friend. Embodied as it was in a certain man named Simon, it says in verse 9, who basically said a very different thing than these people were hearing. Philip was hearing in Jerusalem because what they were hearing in Jerusalem from the chief priests anyway was, we hate you and we're going to kill you. Simon, who was kind of a big deal in Samaria, he was one of the powers there. So we don't hate you. We love you. We believe in you guys. In fact, we want to join you guys. It says in verse 13 that along with everyone else who was jumping on the bandwagon, that the work of God's spirit in Samaria was even Simon himself believed. It says that he, and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip. Fascinating, he continued on. So he wasn't just a, you know, one and done guy. He's part of the program. He's part of the entourage. He's in the worship band. I don't know if that's true. The picture here is this. It's really interesting. He isn't hostile. There's nothing resistant in Simon toward this moving of God's spirit. He's not at all like the chief priests and scribes in Jerusalem. He's actually joining them. Indeed, he seems to be their biggest fan. Amazed was he. It says verse 13. As he observed the signs and wonders, the great miracles that were taking place, it says he was constantly amazed. You guys are incredible. as if to say, this is the coolest church I've ever been in. In fact, I've never been in a church. Anyway, that's a bad illustration. This is the coolest thing I've ever been part of, which is something we as pastors love to hear. Sign you up. Go tell everybody how cool we are. But his faith, there was something false here. There was something false. In fact, in verse 21, it says that his heart was not right. There's something wrong. Your heart was not right with God. Indeed, they finally determined you have no part. You have no part. You were believed. I know. You got baptized. You stayed with him, but you have no part in this. You have no part or portion in this thing. But before they get to that realization and say that very hard word to him, you need to see him right in the middle of it all. in this stories in the middle of this mix because he believed. We'd sign him up too, and he was baptized. He's one of us. And he continued on with Philip and the church and this movement, but like a weed in the garden, it's just not right. Something's off with this thing, like a little leaven can leaven the whole lump of dough, says the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians Romans 5, the whole leaven thing, when Paul is speaking of that, he's saying, don't, don't, you know, encourage yourself that it's just a little bit of leaven, because a little leaven can destroy this whole thing. This is a very real threat to the life of this early church, this kind of infant stage of life to its very existence, because while the open hostility and persecution that they had to face in Jerusalem, which was a scary thing to face. And we, as a church, as we were going through the wind of God's Spirit and the waves of resistance, some of us wondered, would we be able to stay faithful to God in that kind of persecution? And you kind of hope you'd do. But as scary as that was, and difficult to endure, and as serious as a threat is that persecution posed to the life of the church, a greater threat was this, this phony faith, this flattery, this, you guys are great, was just as dangerous, maybe more dangerous than this persecution thing because now you're popular. I love that. But when you're popular, there comes this problem. It's this. You can't be sure. You don't really know why they're here. When you're in persecution, the people who are staying faithful are paying an incredibly high price. So there's really not a lot of question. I mean, you're paying a really high. Why would you be here? There's nothing to serve you in this. But when you're the hottest game in town, you start wondering what it is you like about us. I'm not really sure what it is they really want, what it is that they really believe. Why is it that they're cheering? Because they're cheering. I'm just not sure why. I think I know. They believe and we're baptized. That's why. What is it that they love? Is it God? Yeah. Or is it us, or is it the show? I don't know. Now, as this dynamic of the story began to kind of emerge to me, it was fascinating, because as that came to me, I had this kind of memory, because this story here reminds me a bit of a season in the life of our church. Years ago, When this kind of thing happened, we had just moved from our building in the Crystal area to the Cooper High School auditorium. Some of you were even with us when we did that thing. It was a really exciting time, and the church was growing rapidly. In fact, so rapidly that Cooper High School didn't accommodate us for very long, so we moved very quickly to the Robbinsdale gym. The gym was bigger. We went from one to two to three services, more and more people every week. It felt like a multitude of people. It really did. I don't know if it was, but it felt like that. And it also felt like, because it was a legitimate work of God's spirit in this city, as with one accord, just like Acts chapter 8, with one accord, we were giving attention to the teaching of Philip. I'm not kidding. We were giving attention to the teaching of Peter and Paul, and most notably in the early days of Robbinsdale, it was the teaching of Matthew as we went through the book of Matthew. And people were being delivered from a variety of things in a variety of ways. and there was much rejoicing in that smelly old gym with the creaking bleachers and the broken scoreboard. We didn't care. God was moving. But then, it was the weirdest thing. It began to dawn on some of us that not everybody here is actually here for the same reasons. In fact, through a variety of things, it began to dawn on us that not everybody here is actually hearing what we're actually saying, that they're not all understanding what we think it is they're understanding. Because for some of them, not all, maybe not even most, but for some of them, it was the flavor of the month. It was the latest thing, kind of like the latest fad to go through town. So when we decided, you know, well, we need to sharpen the sword a little bit. In fact, some of you do know the story. There was this season where Open Door, the whole message was grace. And all of a sudden, we started hearing and seeing, kind of manifested in people's lives, that some were hearing that grace was so amazing that things like obedience didn't matter. And we were going, whoa, what are you hearing? So we decided to sharpen the sword. How do you do that? I don't know. Let's teach the book of James. That'll scare people off. Because we wanted to clarify what we meant by what we were saying. And I remember that time, and we got letters, some of which complained, you know, Dave, you used to teach grace, and now you don't anymore. You're not graceful anymore, which was fascinating to me. But I understood it, and here's why. Because James had this, it was why we picked the book actually, he had this ancient biblical way of saying, you know what, I think you're full of baloney. That's the original Greek right there. In fact, we kind of fashioned James as, we kind of talked about him as being like a kind of a tough, loving, but real tough-minded chemical dependency counselor who's trying to help someone out of their addiction. And when you need help out of your addiction, you need to get all of your delusions blown up. So James is a guy who says, don't give me that. I don't buy that. You're lying. I can tell. He's always talking like that. James chapter 4 verse 1, he says this, the real source of quarrels and conflicts among you, James 4 verse 1, is not because you took some righteous stand on some issue you think is holy, because you think you are taking a righteous stand, and That's why you're in conflict with everyone around you. The real reason is because you lust and you do not have. You envy and you do not obtain. In other words, you really wanted something. Epithumia is the Greek word for lust, strong desire. You really wanted something. And probably what you really wanted, what you lusted after, was your way, getting your way. But you didn't get your way. And that's why you're in conflict, says James, because you're selfish. You're self-absorbed. It's all about you. You don't care about a righteous cause. You say you do. This is not about God or anybody else. It's about you because you care about you. But when you start talking like that, you're a little less popular than you were the day before. And the crowd begins to shift. And you start to wonder why. And then it begins to dawn on you, not everybody here is actually here for the same reason. Not everybody here is actually even hearing what you're actually saying. So you better get ready, church. You better get ready, leadership. At least be aware that when the kingdom of God begins to authentically move in a city or in a church, it's like among other things, says Jesus in Matthew 13, verse 47. It's like among other things, a dragnet. A dragnet that is thrown out into the sea, and when you pull it up, this dragnet is full of fish. This is great. Fish of every kind, which is really great. We've got diversity here. But what it means is you drew a crowd, you have fish of every kind. It's a multitude of fish, but not all the fish are good for eating. Oh. In fact, if you eat that one, you'll get sick. If you swallow that thing, you will pay a price. You're going to get sick. You're going to get spiritually sick. So when the net is full, the text says, and they draw up this stuff to the beach, and all the fish is there to gather the good fish, which sounds very, you know, judgmental. They gather the good fish because the good fish will nourish you. The good fish will be good for you. It will actually help you, but the bad fish they throw away, not because they're mean. They throw it away because if you eat that, if you eat that, you're going to get sick. You will pay a price. You better not swallow that line of bologna. you will be spiritually sick if you buy what that guy's selling. You can do it. The whole crowd is over there, but if you buy what that ministry is promoting, you will get sick. You may recover, but this is what will nourish you, and this is what will grow you, all of which brings me back to Simon, to a certain man named Simon, who is not, in fact, just some guy, some certain guy. Rather, he is, in fact, the embodiment, I think, the expression of a much greater threat to the life of the church in its infancy 2,000 years later. I believe this is a greater threat to the church right now than even the persecution that that early church faced in Jerusalem. It is, in fact, this false faith that they faced in Samaria flattery that's dangerous. It's the popularity, the celebrity. And then comes the use of money to get power. I'm sure you saw that as Mary read that, because when Simon saw in verse 18 that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles' hands, and he'd also seen these signs and wonders and people being healed and delivered from demons, he offered them money. and he offered them money, obviously, to get what? Power. I want to have that power of the Holy Spirit and the gift of healing and the gift of deliverance. He wanted the power to heal people. All right? That's a good thing. He wanted power to see them delivered and redeemed and made whole, right? Yeah, no. No. That isn't why he wanted the power. He wanted the power, and he offered the money to get the power, and he wanted the power to get more money. And he would get more money from, you know who he'd get the money from? Sick people. No, you know who he'd get a lot of money from? Desperate people. Hopeless people. People who were, is there any chance I could be delivered? Is there any way I could be healed? He would get money from people who really needed healing and deliverance and hope and who really did believe that he had power to heal and deliver and make whole. And so they'd send their money to Simon. They'd give their money to Simon. Sometimes everything they had is what they would give to the television preacher who says, I'll pray for you. If you send in 50 bucks, 100 would be better. You'll be healed. You'll be delivered. You'll have health. And you'll have wealth. Just speak the word and send the money. It's like a seed and it will grow and you'll get rich and so will I. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So Simon offers money to get power. And he wanted power not to heal or deliver. He was going to heal and deliver if you got it, but it would be to get more money from desperate people. His name was Simon. It's time to meet him a little more closely, to get to know him a little more clearly, so we can spot him. Because this thing, actually there's a word called simony that comes out of this. It's an actual, you can look this word up. Because simony, this exchange of power and money and And celebrity is a much greater threat. You've got to spot this than persecution. Often referred to as Simon Magus in different places, not so much in the text. From the Greek word magion, we get the word magic. And he astonished people with his magic arts, it says in verse 9. So he was skilled in magician lore, much like the magi, the same magi who looked for and honored Jesus in kind of the Christmas story we've been in the last several weeks. Simon would be in that general family of the Magi, which was in fact Magi. There was kind of a broad category. There were kind of different kinds of Magi or different manifestations of who they were. Because on one hand, a Magi and Simon could be seen in the day as a first century scientist, a first century philosopher as a Magi. They were often into astronomy. And all of those things are respectable. That astronomy thing is why the magi who were looking for Jesus followed a star. Remember that? But mixed into all of that kind of respectable stuff, things you might trust, was also the fact that he was seen, and magi often were, as soothsayers, dealing not just with astronomy, but astrology, what's your sign, that kind of thing, and divination as well, and the conjuring of spirits. He dabbled in the occult kinds of things, and he actually dabbled in lots of things, a little of this and a little of that. He was quite diverse. His spirituality was very broad, and his capacity to actually do some things was quite significant, actually, enough to astonish people. They were amazed by him with his magic arts, and he actually did enough. to impress himself, which I find is hysterical. He claiming himself. It says at the end of verse 9, claiming himself to be someone great. Yeah, I am. I'm really quite something. So it is before Philip and the church, get the picture, before Philip and the church ever came to town with the authentic manifestation of God's Spirit, this Simon was a celebrity. He was, in fact, the celebrity, the only game in town till Philip showed up, because they all, it says in verse 11, before Philip and the church showed up, everyone in that town, from the smallest, verse 10, to the greatest, were giving him, that is, Simon, attention, saying, this man, Simon, is what is called the great power of God, which is a fascinating title, actually, having its roots historically in what's come to be known is Gnosticism. Now Gnosticism is a word that some of you maybe have heard, you don't know a lot about possibly. Some of you know far more about it than I do. In fact, some of the scholars that I read this week consider the possibility that Simon is actually the founder of this Gnosticism thing, at least among the founders. And the essence of Gnosticism is this, very simple expression of it, that God is way up there and humans are way down here. And the way to connect the two is through what's referred to as divine emanations. That's what they call them, divine emanations. And a divine emanation comes to certain select people called mediators or powers. The great power, he was called the great power of God, and they are the seers. They are the knowers. They are the Gnostics. Gnostics, his kind of special knowledge is what they have. have, and Simon is considered one of them, one of the great powers, one of the divine emanations of God. You can kind of find out who God is, because God will emanate or reveal himself through these kinds of people like Simon, but he's not the only one. He's not the only one, so because so would Mohammed be a divine emanation, and so would Buddha be a divine emanation, And with that kind of thinking, Jesus, this guy named Jesus, is now being spoken of in Samaria. And maybe he is too, along with Simon and whoever else. So what we have in Samaria, it's fascinating really, what we have in Samaria is at least two things. In the culture, before Philip ever comes, he's going to have to deal with it, but he doesn't know it's there when he gets there. First of all, there is already a problem with the power of celebrity. It's deeply ingrained in this Samaria place and also what I would call the spirit of the age. The spirit of the age in Samaria, kind of generated by this Gnosticism, is a spirit or a way of thinking, a way of believing that embraces everything and everyone. It's very hip and very cool. It's open-minded, all-inclusive, which is what we all want to be. I don't know about all-inclusive. This was all-inclusive, but I didn't want to be open-minded. If someone accused me of being closed-minded, I would spend a considerable amount of energy trying to convince them that I'm not closed-minded. I'm very open-minded. And if you wanted to prove that, you just kind of go along with that. But before you know it, if you're all-inclusive and you're accepting everything and everyone, before you know it, all the fish are good to eat. All the fish are good for you. No, they're not. Because if you eat that one, you're going to get sick. If you buy that line, you're going to get sick. If you swallow that load of fish, you will be sick, spiritually sick. And it's into all of that kind of thing that Philip comes. Having been driven out of Jerusalem by these scary people wanting to kill everyone, he comes to this place proclaiming Christ. What a cool deal, because multitudes with one accord were giving attention to what he was saying, and they believed, says in verse 12. They believed what Philip was preaching, verse 12, this good news about the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ. They were all being baptized, and even Simon himself believed and was baptized, says verse 13. And even after being baptized, he continued with Philip, which is just so weird. He became part of the group. He went to the 101 membership class. Thought by Al Shuck. No. He joined the club. He joined the club. He joined the club. He was part of the movement. But there's something wrong with this fish. something that smells funny about this, and even Philip didn't catch it right away. Philip's not a stupid guy. He didn't catch it right away. You wouldn't either. I probably wouldn't either, because he believed, and he was baptized right out in the gathering place between services, which is why Peter and John, the fact that Philip didn't get it right away, And this thing is in the soup, which is, that's why Peter and John, we didn't read this text, but in verse 14, it says that Peter and John came down from Jerusalem because Peter evidently emailed them and said, I'm kind of in over my head here. There's something going on I don't get. So Peter and John came down to try to sort this out because by this time they're starting to figure out if we eat this fish, if we buy this guy's line, if we swallow this stuff, we're going to get sick, spiritually sick. This whole church is at risk. This movement might be over if we buy this. Explain how it happened, actually, in Samaria, because born of this Gnosticism, what happened in Samaria when they believed and were baptized was simply this, because it was the spirit of the age. The people there just kind of embraced everything and everyone, So when Jesus came along or a word of him from Philip came along, we'll embrace him too. Of course, because we embrace everything and everyone. And what they ended up doing is what a lot of people do. They simply added him to everything else they thought. Everything else they believed, they simply added this Jesus story to their Gnosticism. It fit right in to Gnosticism. They just added it to their Samaritanism and to their culturalism. They simply added Jesus to their consumerism. Ouch, ouch. They just added Jesus. It fit right in to their capitalism and to their Americanism because God wants me rich, right? And God wants you rich too, shouts the television preacher, who then says, I'll pray for you. If you send 50 bucks, 100 would be better. You'll be healed, you'll be delivered, you'll have health and you'll have wealth. You speak the word and send the money, it's like a seed and it will grow and you'll get rich and so will I. Praise the Lord. So they simply added Jesus, at least Simon did, to his desire for celebrity, to his desire for money and power. Indeed, it didn't take long for these guys like Simon to figure it out. I can't actually use this Jesus thing to get celebrity and money and power, even to draw a crowd. But the crowd is fickle. Wow, and it's so in this story. The fickleness of the crowd is one of the things. Wow, this is fascinating. In verse 6, for instance, this is when Philip was beginning to proclaim. Verse 6, chapter 8, the multitude with one accord was paying attention to who? Philip. And they were all, wow, this is incredible. Much rejoicing in that city. Verse 10, however, just a couple of verses later, they were all from the smallest to the greatest. Everybody in this same city was giving attention, same word, giving attention to Philip in verse 6, giving attention to Simon now in verse 10. Two verses later, verse 12, they all believed Philip. Bling, bing, you know. In Jerusalem, Stephen talked to the chief priest and said, you are stiff-necked people, legalistic, and here they're rubber-necked. I believe that. Wow. Now, do you all believe Philip? I think we'll follow him, get baptized too. The church is exploding. Isn't this awesome? But then it begins to dawn on you. And it did dawn on Philip eventually. It took some time. Not everybody here is actually here for the same reason. Not everybody here is even hearing what we're actually saying because for some, it really is the flavor of the month. It's just the latest thing they've seen, like a fad, like some religious show, but then it hits you. I mean, who knew? I mean, be one of these original believers in Samaria watching this, experiencing this. Who knew? When we were running for our lives to get away from Saul who was ravaging us, who knew that more dangerous than that hostility and persecution would be this flattery, this celebrity, this popularity would be this, you guys are great, would be this ability to draw a crowd. Nothing wrong with the crowd. hear me on that Jesus drew a crowd multitudes, multitudes came to him and so did Peter and Paul and Philip and John but when the crowd shows up you better get ready I'm not kidding, you better beware that when the kingdom of God begins to authentically move in a city or a church it's like know this it's like a dragnet that gets thrown out into the sea and when you pull it up, it's full of fish. You got your crowd. Full of every kind of fish, a multitude of fish, but not all the fish, you gotta know this, are not good for eating. Indeed, you eat that one, you're gonna get sick. You might get healed, but you will get sick. So when the nets are full and they draw them up and they gathered the good fish together, they gathered them together as if to say, Okay, that one's a real deal. That's a real deal. You can eat that. I mean, really, that will nourish you. That will help you grow. And the bad, they threw away, which sounds kind of mean. It wasn't because they were mean. It was because they had been called by God to protect this infant church that could easily die from persecution. Persecution didn't even come close. The place just exploded. The fire grew. but what about this? This could kill it for real. And so the apostles rose up. John and Peter and Philip, they finally got a clue what's going on, and they said as loud as they could, if you eat that, you're going to get sick. If you swallow that, if you end up buying what this guy's selling, what Simon is selling, we're going to get spiritually sick. The church is in trouble, could even die. And so it is when Peter and John, along with Philip, were finally able to discern, finally able to see, dial into what was actually going on. They very gently came to Simon in verse 20. I lied about the gentle. And said, verse 20, remember this? May your silver perish with you. Greek word for perish, there is literally translated perdition. and so as indelicate as it is, I really want to say it this way. What they're literally saying is, Simon to hell with you and your money. Not kidding. Simon to hell with you and the way you use money for control to get what you want and what Simon wanted was power, but not power to heal. If he could do that, that'd be great. Well, he didn't care about people who needed healing or deliverance or to be made whole. It was power that he wanted to promote his own celebrity, to promote his own popularity. So Peter and John did what I think few would do. Because if you do what Peter and John do here, you could lose the crowd because the crowd is fickle. Promise. They pulled out their sword, as it were. And they called him out. Verse 12, verse 21 rather, saying, you know what? I know you believed and you were baptized and you continued on with us, but you've got to know something. You have no part in this. You have no part or portion in this for your heart is not right before God. This is all about you. And we need people where it's all about God. And you're not one of them. And they didn't do it to be mean. They did it because they'd been called on God to protect this infant little church, these infant little people who had just come to faith in Christ, but these people didn't have a chance if this simony thing took root. Because more dangerous than the persecution they faced in Jerusalem was this flattery, this celebrity, this popularity, this playing to the crowd, and 2,000 years later, wow, it's true, isn't it? It's true, even today. Persecution, wherever it expresses itself, it's horrible. You wonder how, oh man, how, when you go through trouble, what were you expecting? You will be persecuted, Jesus warned, and then we have, and how are you gonna get through this? Faith grows stronger. It's just weird. Faith grows stronger. There's something, the fidelity is there. It's almost like it burns off the stuff, the people even, who are there for the show. But when the popularity comes, the celebrity comes, and you think of the church today, and it gives me a chill, and it makes me think, Lord, have mercy. I told you that this thing goes in many different directions and so I'm going to give more on this next week we're going to go a little deeper into this story and look more carefully at certain little components of this but let me just close with this I mean we close a lot of different things but this is weird you know what I want you to do? think about this I just want you to think about this and then with the words of Jesus, let him who has ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches right here, right now, in our day, in our day. Would you stand with me as we close? God, I thank you for, wow, I thank you for this story. Thank you for these stories that we look at them and they just look like, well, whatever, and then we're in the story, and this is happening again. It isn't ancient. It is ancient and it's present. And, Father, I pray that you would stir in us the things that need to be stirred, the protections that need to be brought, the eyes that need to see, the ears that need to hear, so your church can stand up straight. Eat fish that nourish the human soul. And be distributing the kind of food that does indeed make people strong in you. We pray. In Jesus' name. All God's people said. Amen. you
