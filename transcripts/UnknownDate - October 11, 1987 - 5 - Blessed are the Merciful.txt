We come again this morning to what we have come to know as the Beatitudes, the Sermon on the Mount. And one of the things that I think is important for us to keep recreating in our minds as we come to this is the sense that we are very clearly coming to the feet of Jesus. And these weeks we are surrounding ourselves around our King, our Master, and with submissive, meek, teachable hearts asking Him questions about the Kingdom. He's telling us week after week after week, as truths of the kingdom are being disclosed to us. We're aware that all of this began several months ago for us in our study, but it began in chapter 4 as in verse 12 and 13, the light went on. The light dawned, the beginning of Jesus' ministry started. And that light was a kingdom that he came to bring, and that kingdom was the reign of God on the earth. And that kingdom and that bringing of the kingdom was a declaration of war to Satan. Satan, I want my turf back. Your rule is done on this earth. And I am bringing to earth the reign of God. And in this kingdom there are people. And they are people that you wouldn't expect. They're apostles. We call them apostles, but they started out as fishermen and people who weren't highly regarded by society or by religious people. And we also see that in that fourth chapter, as the kingdom was being unveiled on earth, It was a kingdom of power and authority. Power and authority over the rulers of darkness. And that power and authority was demonstrated when he came in contact with the powers of darkness, such as demons, and they were cast out. They had no place to stay anymore. And he came in contact with disease, and the disease was cured. Demonstrations of power, and the result of the coming of the kingdom, and the demonstration of the power of the kingdom, was it drew a crowd. Remember that? In verse 24. All the news about him spread through all Syria, and people were coming from everywhere. Verse 25 of chapter 4, multitudes followed him, and Jesus, seeing that maybe some of these people were not coming because they really sought the kingdom that he brought, but because they were seeking the power of that kingdom, and the glitzy stuff said, hold on, you need to hear some teaching about what kingdom power and kingdom reality is really all about. And so he brings his disciples to himself, and disciples at this point is not just the twelve, it's followers of Christ, people who were interested in this person calling himself the king and the bringer of the kingdom. And he says to them these words, I want to tell you the kind of people who are going to come into my kingdom, and I want to tell you the kind of people through who the power that you just saw is going to flow. And the thing is this, ladies and gentlemen, Jesus would be saying to them and to us, the people to whom my kingdom belongs and through whom my power will flow, they are not the righteous, they are not the proud, they are not the ones that we look to as being the ones who have arrived, they are not the pious, they are not the ones who are always right and doctrinally correct necessarily, they are not the powerful or the performers, they are the broken, lesser are the poor in spirit. People who've come to the end of their striving and know they need a healer, people who are sick and know they need a Savior. They are those who are mourning because they have been broken of their striving, people who have quit pretending that everything is great out here and are beginning to get out here what is in here. Those are the people who are part of my kingdom. And those are the people through whom the power is going to flow and blessed are the meek, who because they have been broken and come to the end of themselves, they have somehow become teachable and they have somehow become a gentle breeze to people who are in pain and they have somehow become a soothing medicine. Those are the people of my kingdom and those are the people through whom the power of my kingdom will flow. No one else. And blessed are the hungry. Remember that last time? Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for a righteousness that is not their own. And we talked last time of people who are hungering for their own righteousness and wrapping themselves with all sorts of wonderful behavior so people think they're okay. Blessed are those who are hungering and thirsting for my righteousness, the kind of righteousness that comes from God alone, they alone shall be satisfied. When you look at those characteristics, brokenness, mourning, meekness, and hungry, you've got kind of a motley crew. Paul said it this way, there are not many wise, there are not many mighty, there are not many noble. And do you know why that's true? It's true because among the wise and among the mighty and among the noble, there are not many broken. and there are not many among the mighty who mourn who get out here what's in here they look mighty and among the noble there are not many who are meek and among the wise there are not many who are hungry for a righteousness that is not their own they think they've already got it and then today blessed are the merciful for they shall receive mercy let's pray as we begin father god i have a sense in my spirit of sitting at your feet it's very humbling it's very exciting my heart wants to tell you that i want to learn this stuff and i want you by your spirit to work it in me and work it in us at the beginning of our study we talked about the kind of church we're going to become and father i pray with everything that in me is that you would make us this kind of people. We don't want to be a big church. We don't want to be a neat, fun church. We want to be a kingdom people who have come to you broken and mourning, but receiving as we do your grace, your power, and your mercy so that your mercy can not only come to us but flow through us. Teach us what this means this morning. Be literally our teacher. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. These weeks as we've been dealing with these concepts, I've always struggled with how to bring the information. How do I structure it? It doesn't structure well for me. I don't even know if I've got an outline for you. I mean, I've got one in my books. I don't know if I'm going to give it to you. Let's just start out by defining it. One of the things we've done every week is kind of asked you to enter into the concept. When it was hungry, we kind of said, roll it around in your mind. What does it feel like to be hungry? Roll this concept around in your mind a little bit. Mercy. What does it feel like? Would we all agree that mercy is a virtue? Who would say it isn't? No, I don't want to be merciful. No, we would all say that this is a mercy, that mercy is indeed a virtue. Does it feel good? Is it something I want to come to me? Do I get a warm feeling when I talk about mercy? Is it something, again, that you desire for yourself? Is it something that you desire to have literally flowing through you? Let's just start by defining it. The word in the Greek is eleaimanos, and it means to aid the afflicted. It means to help the wretched, and it means to rescue the miserable. And as soon as I give you that definition, something clicks in my mind. I would love to be the kind of person of whom it was said he rescued the miserable, and he aided the wretched, and he helped, who was those other creepy people? The afflicted. I would like to be that kind of person who aided the afflicted, and everyone knew that I was an afflicted person aider, you know. And I'm okay with being on that side. In fact, I kind of like this one because it says, Blessed are the merciful who help the wretches. But I have some problem, you see, right off the bat as I define it, seeing myself being okay with the other position, being the one who is in need of mercy. Now, on one hand, I would say that I would be okay with that, but when it talks about being wretched and needing help and being afflicted, I don't like being in that position. It's a much better thing for me as a Christian to be the helper. I have a very hard time being the helpee. Something I need to just give you a slip of insight right from the beginning is this, That true mercy, that is kingdom mercy, is a mercy that will not be ever really known by you unless you see yourself in need of mercy. Mercy will never flow through you until you see yourself as what? Broken. To the end of yourself, mourning over your sin. People who have a hard time being on the receiving end of mercy will never be able to give mercy. You might be able to do merciful acts, Just like the emperor in the arena when the gladiator had the sword to the throat of the wretch who was about to die, the emperor could stand up and do a merciful thing. He would go thumbs up and he would live. And he would feel real merciful. He did a merciful act. He was not a merciful person. Mercy and general mercy flowing from the life comes from people who see, first of all, their need of mercy, understand that they have received grace and mercy from God. People like that flow with mercy. I think we would all agree that mercy is a virtue. See, secular people would agree with that. You watch the 10 o'clock news, it's great. They have this big long list of all this garbage that goes on in the world and the way it's just about to blow up. And they always like to end with good news. You know that? There's a little pattern. This little human interest story about this neighbor who went over and helped someone. And Don Shelby, at the end of it, says to Pat Miles, we really need more people like that yeah Don we really do on and on and on nobody's going to say that mercy is a thing that we don't want we all want it Shakespeare said it this way the quality of mercy is not strained it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blessed it blesseth him that gives and him that receives it is mightiest in the mighty it becometh the throned monarch better than the crown. We all agree. Let's goeth and doeth it. The problem is it's not that simple. See, what I want to know is where does mercy come from? I've already given you some insight into where I think mercy comes from. Where does it come from? Does mercy come flowing from people because they hear a sermon on being merciful? Blessed are the merciful, they'll obtain mercy. So everybody go be merciful. You'll leave this morning going, oh, yeah, I haven't been merciful. I really ought to try to be more merciful. Thanks for the reminder I'm going to be merciful from now on. Rules don't make people merciful. If telling people how to behave made people behave that way, see, telling people how to behave can get you to agree that that's how I ought to behave. But there is no power in telling you that to get you to do that. Ephesians says this, Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and evil speech be put away from you. Okay? You know what I know? Every Christian I know would go, yeah, that's really true. Let all bitterness and anger... They know that's the thing they ought to do. But an awful lot of Christians I know still have anger, bitterness, all those things flowing from their lives. Seeing, knowing that it is the right thing to do doesn't give you the power to do it. Just because you know you're supposed to be merciful doesn't mean that mercy is going to flow through you at all. I think one of the best examples I can come up with about that would be Pharisees. Do you think, do you think, I hate it when that happens. You already think I'm young, don't you? And now my voice cracks. Do you think that the Pharisees and the scribes and the chief priests had a rule about mercy? Do you think that as they studied the Talmud and as they studied the Word of God and all their law, that mercy was one of the virtues? I'm sure it was. And in the Pharisees' bedroom, there might have been a poster on the wall about mercy. But knowing that mercy was a virtue to the Pharisee didn't make him merciful. It didn't make that flow from him to other people. Why? Well, what is it that we know about Pharisees and chief priests and scribes? What we know about them from our study for a long time is that what made them feel good about themselves was their own righteousness and all the good little things they did. And it wasn't God's righteousness, and there was no sense of brokenness in them, no sense of mourning in them or meekness in them. And there's something I know about people who are proud and self-righteous. Generally, what flows from them, though they talk about mercy and not being gossips and not being bad things, they are characterized by rigidity, indifference, intolerance, judgmental attitudes and condemnation and condescension. Very spiritual, very pious, always right, but very little grace and very little mercy. but it's a funny thing that I notice about people who I'm around who have been broken, who've come to the end of themselves, who know that the only hope I've got is you, who've begun to get out here what is in here, who've begun to mourn, who because of that have begun to be meek, and who because they are broken have begun to have a hunger for a righteousness that is not their own, and they've quit performing. You know what I know about them? Funny thing, mercy flows. Mercy flows. You know why? Because they know what it feels like. They know what it feels like, first of all, to need it. Because they have a sense of their sin. They know what it feels like to need it. And they also know what it feels like to receive it. I've come to the end of myself. And blessed are the hungry, for they shall be what? Satisfied. They will get graced. They will get mercy. Mourners get what? Comfort. Let me say it this way. The only people through whom mercy will flow is people to whom mercy has come. The degree to which, I'll say it another way, the degree to which you see yourself in need of mercy, broken, mourning, on and on and on, is the degree to which you will freely extend mercy. It all begins with brokenness. Let me give you some examples, and this is where it begins to make sense to me. One of the examples of mercy in the Bible is that of the Good Samaritan. In fact, by the way, there are two directions. Let me give you a definition of mercy. I didn't even finish my definition. One of them is doing a kindness for another. That's one direction that biblical mercy goes. Doing a kind thing for another person. Another way that the usage of biblical mercy goes is letting someone off the hook. Withholding punishment that is due. You deserve a punishment, I forgive you instead. I pardon you. Okay? Let's use the first one first with the Good Samaritan doing a kind deed. Now you know that story, and you know the story of how this man was beaten and robbed and stripped of his clothing and was laying in the gutter, bleeding and dying. And a priest came by and said various things and felt all sorts of pity, but he walked on by. And then a Levite, who was another religious guy, saw the guy bleeding there on the thing and felt real sorry for him, but then he walked on by as well. And the Samaritan came by and didn't just feel sorry for him. It was compassion in action. He sat down, got with him, picked him up, clothed him, and brought him someplace. That's mercy. My question is this, and we would all go, boy, that's what we ought to do, and I feel sorry. I saw somebody on the side of the road who needed a ride, and I didn't give it to him, so shame on you. My question is this. It isn't about who was the right guy. We all know that. My question is this. Why did the Samaritan stop? Why did he do it and the others didn't? Here's my theory. He went to the Sunday school class just before he saw this guy, and there was a lesson on mercy, so it was right in his mind, that's why he did it. He had a rule in his mind that said, when I see bleeding guys on the side of the road, I help them. I don't think that's why I did it, and neither do you, or you wouldn't be laughing. I think that what happened with this Samaritan guy was that, see, he knew something that the chief priest and the priest and the Levite didn't know. I think the Samaritan knew what it felt like to be in a gutter. that's what I think he was a Samaritan he was the off-scower he was a Samaritan from our study you know about these people nobody liked them they were called half-breeds the religious people of Israel looked down their spiritual noses at Samaritans and they were nobodies he knew what it felt to be in the position of needing mercy and I think when he saw the person bleeding there it wasn't mercy extended because mercy is a good thing to do and nice godly people do merciful things. It was because he could identify with what it felt like to need mercy and he could identify with what it felt like to receive mercy and he knew that this person here needed it as well. Phil Box came up a little bit ago and talked to us about a support group that is going to be given for people who are victims of abuse. You know why I think Phil wants to do that support group? Because there's a rule that says Christians care about people who've been abused. It has nothing to do with that. Phil Box is in a position where he knows what it feels like to need mercy and grace and healing. And you know what the result of that has been? He has received grace and mercy and healing. And you know what the result of that is? He wants to give mercy and grace and healing and forgiveness. That's the way it works. You ever notice how people who just get saved are always zealous about their faith? We've talked about that a lot. They're zealous about their faith, and they want to share their faith. Why do they do that? Why is that pumping through them? Well, there's a rule that they learn as soon as they become Christians that says if you become a Christian, you have to share your faith. That is not what pumps through those people's veins. They embarrass us because they're telling everybody. They're walking up to people, and they're talking to the waitress. You know, you don't even meet these people for breakfast because they're going to try to save the waitress. Let me just eat my food. you know why I think they're zealous and they're making trouble in their families and all sorts of other things I think they're zealous because they've got a real strong sense and they remember real well what it felt like to be in need of mercy and forgiveness and grace they know still they haven't been saved long enough to get arrogant they know still what it feels like to need a savior and to need grace and to need forgiveness. And now they have received it, and you know what they want to do? Give it. But then they get saved for a while. And they start coming to church. And they get involved in this group and that group, and they start memorizing their Bible, and that's great. And they start learning about how many hours you're supposed to have your devotions, and that's great too. And they start going to seminars that teach you how to live the Christian life, the perfect Christian life, and it's great. and they do it. But all of a sudden, something's different in them. You see, all of a sudden, they don't have that sense anymore of their own need of grace and their own need of mercy because now they're doing pretty well. They feel pretty good about themselves. After all, look at all the Bible verses I know that I didn't know then. Look at all the seminars I've gone to that I hadn't gone to then. Look at all the biblical truth that I understand now that I didn't understand then. And they kind of feel much better about the fact that they aren't like this anymore and out of weakness and trembling sharing the life that they have been given, now they feel kind of good about themselves because they know so much. And in fact, they feel a little superior because they know so much. And rather than mercy flowing from them, you know what happens to us? All of a sudden, without even realizing it's happening, rigidity begins to move in, intolerance begins to move in, and if you're not living the Christian life the way I am, Christians sometimes act like Pharisees. And everybody has to measure up now. Mercy flows through people who have a sense of their need of mercy and have a sense that they have received mercy and then mercy flows. It's just the way it is. But I've got a question here, and I'm going to just kind of raise some questions that cause my little formula there to blow up. My little formula, I feel real secure with it. Mercy flows through people to whom mercy has come. But you know what? When I say that, I think of an example where that didn't happen. Can you think of an example where that didn't happen? Matthew 18. I don't want you to turn to it now. You can turn to it later. But in Matthew 18, there is a story that you've heard of, and some of you have already thought of it. I know that. That doesn't work. I know of a guy who got mercy. It was a slave. And he was in debt to the landowner, and he had a debt that was insurmountable. It was absolutely beyond his ability to pay ever. In his whole lifetime, he could never pay this back. And he came to the landowner, and he said, Please, let me off the hook. I will pay everything back. He didn't even say, let me off the hook. He said, I will pay everything back. And the landowner said to him, No, no, no, no, you don't get it. That's not the way it's going to work. What I'm going to extend to you is mercy. I'm going to give you mercy, and I'm going to just forgive the debt. The debt was forgiven. And people to whom mercy has come, mercy flows, right? Not this time, because the story that you remember in Matthew 18 goes like this. He received mercy. But then he turned around, and what happened, this slave had a couple of his slaves who were friends of his who owed him a little pittance, a little minuscule amount of money. And you would think that if my little formula worked, from him, mercy would flow. instead the story goes that he grabbed this guy by the neck and said you're going to pay me my debt he couldn't pay the debt he threw him in jail okay let's just forget my sermon here this doesn't really work blows the whole theory it doesn't blow the theory it will deepen i think my understanding of this whole thing and i want to say it this way i want to add a nuance to the thing i gave you I do believe with all my heart that people to whom genuine mercy has come, I believe that through those people genuine mercy will flow. I do not believe that everyone, however, to whom mercy is extended and to whom grace is extended and to whom forgiveness is extended, I do not believe that every one of those people receive that grace and receive that mercy and receive that forgiveness. And if you maybe see yourself in the need of it, but never really let it in, and never let it really minister to you, the mercy that has come to you will never flow through you. Now you've got me totally confused. Let me explain it this way. I believe that before we can talk about giving mercy, we need to talk about receiving mercy. The people that I come in contact with in my office, in our church, and the circle of people that I move and breathe with, I find that one of the things consistently, as ironic as it seems, as much as we talk about grace and forgiveness and mercy, we have a real hard time letting that stuff in. And for some people, again, as I said before, it's easier to give it than it is to receive it because most of us are hung up when it comes to grace, when it comes to mercy, when it comes to forgiveness, that most of us feel like before I can receive it, I need to deserve it. I need to deserve it. And if I get to a point where I feel like I deserve it, then I'll let it in. How many of you are like that? I think every one of us are like that, and it's the battle of our life to realize that grace is free, mercy is free. We keep pushing it away. Let me give you two people that fall into this category, and these are two people through whom mercy, genuine mercy, will never flow. First of all, I've already talked about them, the Pharisee. We'll call them self-righteous just to get another name. Self-righteous people are incapable of receiving real mercy, therefore incapable of extending real mercy. Why is it that self-righteous people can't receive mercy? One, they don't feel like they need it often, okay? So they need to be broken. But another bottom line reason that they never receive mercy and therefore never extend it is because when it comes to mercy, grace, forgiveness, any of that, the whole paradigm within which they function is this. Mercy and all those wonderful things are things you have to deserve. And so the Pharisee goes to Sunday school, goes to seminars, memorizes the scripture, that's what scribes do, and as I do all those things, I feel better and better about myself, and I feel better and better about how I look and how I act, and we talk of grace, and they'll talk of mercy, but way down deep, while they talk of those things and how grateful they are for them, way down deep in their gut, they have this contented feeling that they really do deserve it. Because look at all I'm doing. And there is no brokenness, there is no mourning, meekness, hunger, and because of that there's no mercy. Let me go back to Matthew 18 and use this guy. Right to the end, one of the things that this guy in Matthew 18 was saying as he was being confronted with his need for mercy and the fact that he had a debt he couldn't pay, one of the things he said was this, I'll pay it all back. Now, most of us, in hearing that, would think of him, that was a virtuous thing to say, wasn't it? That was the right thing to say. In fact, that's probably why the guy let him off the hook, because he was repentant and said, I will repay it all back. He wasn't repentant. That is not the language, beloved, of brokenness. I'll pay it all back by my hair on my chinny-chin-chin. That is not the language of brokenness. The language of brokenness is coming to a debt that you can't pay and saying this, I can't pay this. and I'll strive and I can work and I've been working all my life to pay this and I could work but I can't pay this and I'm at the end of myself and all I can do is get at your feet here and say I need mercy. That's the language of brokenness. You see, I have this sneaking suspicion that having said I'll pay it all and the guy said you don't have to pay it it's a free gift. I have a sneaking suspicion that he walked away from that encounter feeling way down deep that he got let off the hook and felt relief but way down deep, I think he felt like he deserved it. You know what? People to whom mercy has come, but they haven't let it in, they really don't have a sense of brokenness, mercy will not flow from people like that. It's just the way it is. By the way, self-righteous people do have a brand of mercy. I kind of said a little bit ago, at the very beginning, I said some people can act mercifully. They can do merciful things. Self-righteous people can do merciful acts. That doesn't mean they're merciful people. One of the ways to spot self-righteous mercy is this. Mercy that is coming from a self-righteous person always has strings. You know when that person does a nice thing for you, you better keep track of it because they are. Yeah. You have to pay him back. You need to know something that that kind of mercy, excuse me, isn't mercy. the mercy of a self-righteous person is very often selective have you ever noticed that if you want to spot self-righteous mercy that's what it is it's nice to some people and it's not nice to others and you know who it's nice to people who what deserve it very often this kind of mercy is about control i don't know if you can feel it but i sure can i said it at the very beginning but there is something powerful about being the helper the merciful one and you being the wretch. I am in a position of power over you. It's wonderful. I like to find people who are a mess and I can come down and just kind of condescend and say, oh, you really are a mess and I'll be nice to you like a little puppy and pet him. That's a controlling thing. I've known someone in our church a long time ago who was just so nice to everybody and nobody liked her. And she kept coming to me going, why is that? Nobody likes me. I'm so nice. I try so hard. I do so many nice things and nobody likes me. I don't get it. They must not be spiritual. The problem was this, for this particular person that all her giving and serving and helping wasn't mercy at all because it never came from brokenness. It never came from her own sense of mourning. It never came from a gentle, meek spirit. It always came from a superior. I've got it all together. You don't. That isn't mercy. And you know what? It'll just feel yucky when it comes. It'll feel like this. Like you owe something. Like you have to pay it back. Like you can't refuse it. You ever have anybody want to do something nice for you and you know you can't say no even if you don't want it? You got to take it. Because they get their sense of value from all the nice things they're doing for you. That is not mercy. Another person who has a hard time letting this in is the person who is self-abased or shamed. Same as the self-righteous person, the basis of the mercy that they receive and let in, is that they think mercy is something and grace and forgiveness are something that you deserve. There's a difference, however, between the self-righteous person and the shame-based person. Both of them think grace and mercy are things you deserve. The self-righteous person thinks he deserves it. The self-abased person, no matter what he does, thinks he doesn't deserve it. And when mercy is extended and grace is extended and forgiveness is offered, they go, oh, that's what I need. But as soon as it comes, they push it away. And some of you struggle with that. It's the life battle for you. You can't ever really let grace in until you feel like you deserve it. If you have to wait till you deserve it, when it comes, it won't be grace. If it isn't free, it isn't grace. Never really let it in, and you never really feel clean, and you never really let yourself feel complete, And you never really let yourself feel forgiven. In fact, you've got this so twisted that if you really did just bask in the grace of God and let yourself feel clean as you are and complete as you are, you usually feel guilty for letting yourself feel like that. Why? Because you don't deserve it. And all heaven weeps as it says, that's the point. You don't deserve it. You can't ever deserve it. I'm giving you a gift. Would you let it in? And people who come broken, and realize they don't deserve it and say, God, I'm sorry and I need righteousness that isn't my own. To them, he gives comfort and help and grace and mercy. They get filled and when they do, you know what they do? They give grace, comfort, mercy, forgiveness. You have trouble accepting gifts? That's kind of a tip-off that we struggle with this kind of thing. Just last week, I was put in touch with this. Mary Moss watched our boys one afternoon this last week. And I'm not going to embarrass her. I'm not going to try to embarrass her. I'm going to embarrass her. I don't want to embarrass her. And I came home after work. My wife had been working that afternoon. So I came home and I was going to pick them up. So I went to their house and got the tour of their new hall. And it was really fun. And at the end, I said, you do daycare. And we kind of did this. And so what do I owe you? And she says, nothing. And I spent 10 minutes trying to talk her out of giving me the gift. And I had all sorts of reasons for that. And that is that I know, first of all, I know my boys. And see, I think the kids, I love my boys. I'll tell you, I think they're full of energy. And I love the noise they make and the wrestling. But not everybody else appreciates that. But I think generally that people who watch my boys should get combat pay. Not even just regular, not even just regular help. And she kept saying, no, it's a gift, it's a gift. Don't worry about it, don't worry about it. And I spent 10 minutes doing that. And finally I gave in. And I said, okay. And all along I was hoping you would be firm about it. But I began to think, especially in light of what I'm doing here, why is it so hard for me to accept the gift? I talk about this stuff all the time. Well, one, I don't deserve it. And they don't deserve it. But the whole point was that Mary was saying, that's not the point. This is a gift. And how much more enjoyable it is to just take it and let them give the gift. Jeff Van Vonder and I was talking to him about this week and he was saying that people who go out to lunch with him have come to realize that you don't offer to pay lunch for him if you don't mean it. Because if you offer to pay his lunch, he isn't going to argue with you. I can take a gift. But you know what? Some of us have problems with that. And we laugh and we go, yeah, that's really not very polite. Some of us, I'll tell you, self-righteous people who think they deserve it and self-abased people who think they don't deserve it have a lot of trouble with people who, having needing mercy, receive forgiveness just like that and feel free just like that. People who are self-abased and can't take a gift have a lot of problems with people like Mary Magdalene, who was a prostitute, who when being offered forgiveness and mercy and grace said, that's what I need. I accept it. I sit down in it. I feel clean. I feel free. Went and washed Jesus' feet. And the Pharisee said, what is she doing here? how come you mess around with people like that she doesn't what deserve it and when she took the gift freely and said I take it, I thank you self-righteous people, self-abased people go that's not very spiritual and we do that I've been saying all morning the source of this the source of mercy starts with brokenness and to just give a synopsis of what I've said is this. You can't give what you don't have. You can give what you don'T have. If you have never come to a place where your knew you needed forgiveness and then received forgiveness and let it in, then you don't have forgiveness to give. If you have never come to a place where you knew you needed to be accepted and then you came to God and found out that by his grace you were and you accepted it and you said thank you Lord. Unless you've come to that place, you don't give any acceptance to give. Unless you are loved and unless You have come to grace that same way, knowing that the only hope you've got is God's grace, and then you heard that he gave it, and then you let it in, those people have it to give. But if you have never come that way, broken, giving up on your own striving, let the gift in, you don't have it to give. The same is true with mercy. Did you notice something very quickly about the text? In the first four, blessed are the poor, the broken in spirit, blessed are those who mourn, the gentle, those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. Those are all inner attitudes. And when brokenness comes to me and I see I need help, something else comes to me. I get filled. I get the kingdom when I'm broken. I inherit the earth when I'm meek. I get comforted when I'm mourning. And I get satisfied when I'm hungry. Basically, you're talking about a person who is getting filled up with grace, forgiveness, and all sorts of other things. And then all of a sudden in verse 7, having received all these things and having gotten all of those things to fill me up by the Spirit of God, the people around me begin to get mercy from me. Issues from me. In the first four verses, things come to me and the next thing, something comes from me. And the result of it all in verse 7 is this. You get even more mercy for they shall receive even more mercy. Beloved, I hope you get the point this morning that this is not a sermon that gets you walking out the door trying to get merciful but drives us back again to the main point of seeing that the people in the kingdom are people who know they need a savior who know they need grace who know they need mercy and when they know that they get it and when they let it in it starts to flow from them the thing to focus on is this am i wrapped up in my own self-righteousness am i wrapped up in my own self-abasement by the way self-abasement turns into self-righteousness too i start feeling righteous about how abased i am or am i someone who having been broken is willing to let it in and let myself feel cleansed how do you get that i don't know i don't have a formula that says here's how you get it you know what i do believe i believe god gives it as a gift we're going to have a time of worship here and i got no little formula if you do these three things then you'll know but I would like to pray as the worship team comes that the spirit of God would come and the spirit of God would begin to minister and set us free and some of you who aren't broken need to be and some of you who are broken and mourning and all those things you're hearing about grace and you're hearing about forgiveness but you can't let it in that the spirit of God would move on you to let it in and that mercy would begin to flow among us and it could be as well that the spirit of God needs to do other entirely different ministries God is here God is here and he wants to meet you today wherever you are in whatever circumstance you find yourself in and I believe the spirit of God can minister to you in that when we're done we're going to leave the altar open for a time of prayer and the work of the spirit among us but let God talk to you while we worship let me pray first Father we thank you for your word we thank you for your grace and your forgiveness we thank you God for the power of your spirit that sets it free. And in Jesus' name, I release your spirit now among us. I pray, God, that you would begin to move among us. I pray, Father, that hearts, maybe some hearts that haven't heard a word I've said, haven't understood a word I've said, haven't liked a word I've said, that God, by your spirit, you would move and soften them and point to them and draw them to yourself so that they could know the life of God in them. Draw people to yourself. redeem God I pray the work of redemption among us for those who don't know you for believers who are struggling and can't let it in or have become self-righteous I pray that you administer that as well do your work we invite you to work here in Jesus name Amen Amen.
