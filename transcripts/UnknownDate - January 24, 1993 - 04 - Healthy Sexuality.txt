I think that most of you are aware of the fact that we are dealing these weeks in the context of our study of the book of Acts with the word in the book of Acts found in Acts 15 verse 20, wherein the Apostle James at the Council of Jerusalem instructs the new believers in Antioch, Syria, to abstain from, among other things, fornication. The Greek word pornea, we have been using interchangeably with that word. Now there are this morning two issues of importance that I want to address to point out before we actually begin our study. Number one, this week, more than others, I think it wise on my part to indicate that some of the material I'll be dealing with is rather explicit. I have no desire at all to shock or to be sensational in any way, but I do have desire to be true and clear about this issue. So without knowing a better way to say it, this sermon is rated PG. Parental guidance is suggested. Second thing I want to say in preparation here is just to kind of give you a handle on where we're going with this series. There are three issues that remain for me in this issue we have uncovered relative to the pain of pornea. Three, what I am going to be calling whatabouts. What about, first of all, healthy sexuality? Is there such a thing? We're going to deal with that today. The second whatabout, coming down in the weeks to come, is what about singleness and sexuality? when fully 48% of the adult population of this church, and I think, as I've even thought about that, having been given that statistic, that it may be higher than that here, I cannot possibly raise an issue as important as what we're talking about and not somehow embrace and speak to the single population in our church. The third what about is what I promised at the very beginning of this series, what about homosexuality? But it all began for us back in Acts 15, verse 20, when James said, abstain from fornication. Verse 29, abstain from fornication, for if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Let's pray as we begin this morning. I pray, Father, that by the power of your Spirit, once again, you would come and beyond words that we hear, concepts that we understand, we thank you for that, and we thank you for how the truth does have power. but I pray that you would empower us to live in truth. And that really does take a working of your spirit as we come to you and ask you to do these things among us. Bring life to the truth in our living. In Jesus' name, amen. Over these weeks, as we have been in some sense swimming in the reality of what we've come to call around here, the pain of pornea, The response I've gotten from you relative to this issue has been, quite frankly, overwhelming. Cards and letters, some of you connecting with me just in the hall, sometimes just wanting to grab me quickly and saying, basically, yes, this Dave is big. We think this is important. It's right and good and timely. Others of you over these weeks have, most often through letters, with amazing vulnerability and openness shared with me your story, shared with me literally the pain of porneia in your life, how it either came to you where you were victimized by it in some way or how, in fact, you perpetrated it yourself and the pain that was in your life and how God has done and is doing some things that need yet to be done in and for you. Magazine articles, newspaper clippings, recommended books, tapes, current studies are beginning to fill my desk, and believe me, very helpful. I really appreciate it. But all of them are consistently relating and underlining and pointing to the reality of the pain of pornea. It is great in our culture. It is great among us. Last week, we did hear what I believe was a wonderful thing, where in response to the teaching of 1 Corinthians 6, we realize that this pain of porneia, whether a victim or a perpetrator, is not just his and his and hers and hers, but because of the fact that we are interconnected as the body of Christ, it is indeed our pain, whether it be that of the victims or that of the perpetrators. and we spoke last week of odd things foreign to us like corporate repentance not just him and him, her and her but we repented and we spoke of odd things like corporate mourning and corporate healing but even more than speaking of those things consistent with Joel chapter 2 we here proclaim the solemn assembly We gathered the people. We assembled the elders. And literally, if you were here last week, you recall that I called the congregation to come, and I called the elders to come, realizing as we do, it's not just his and his, hers and hers who need either to repent or mourn over this. It's something we need to repent over. We need to mourn over. And you came, elders in front. And whatever else that event for us as a body did, it allowed us as a body to feel the weight that many of our members feel and we owned it together. Now, this week, I want you to step back from this pile of pain that over the last few weeks we have been getting the lid off of and looking at and I want us to step back today and look at that pile of pain. And as you do, I want you to ask yourself a question. can anything be done to salvage this? As you look at this pile of pain that is produced by pornea, ask yourself this question. Is there any context within which sexuality can be experienced as a healthy, holy, happy thing? Does that exist? Is there in fact such a thing as truly safe sex? And not just physically safe, produced for us by the wearing of a condom, but emotionally safe sex, spiritually safe sex. Does that exist? Now, someone respond to that quickly. authoritatively even possibly defensively saying yes there is for sure a safe place in marriage you will find a safe place i've heard you preach it dave one man one woman no options leave cleave the two become one flesh there is your healthy holy happy sexuality there it is safe, and some, to be sure, have and are experiencing that. You have experienced it, and you are experiencing it. But some, if honest, would have to say, in our marriage, as it relates to sexuality, it's legal, but it isn't safe. Even there, Dave, in our marriage, our sexuality, to me, feels like a taking thing. Even in our marriage, it feels like a dehumanizing thing. Even in the marriage, where we're hearing it's supposed to be okay, it feels like a manipulative thing. Happy, healthy, holy, interesting words to put on our expressions of sexuality. And I'm married, some of you might say. Reflecting on this, some of you might think, married, our bodies touch, but nothing else is touching, nothing else is interacting, and feel we no joy in it. We call it making love. and I think that's a good term for it if indeed what you're doing when you're making love is this literally making known your love your love is over here your love is a real thing and physically sexually in a marriage you are making your love known there problem many of us even married when we come to the marriage bed are not making love known. We're desperately trying to make love that is not there. Desperately trying to make intimacy that is not there. Wondering then why this physical relationship that we thought held so much promise is unfulfilling, disappointing. disenchanting. Some, in fact, I'm sure among us, ran to marriage, believing that there, automatically, because it's marriage, we would have healthy, holy, happy sexuality. It would there be safe. And all of the pornea of my life, whether perpetrated upon me or whether I was perpetrating it, somehow magically would be healed in marriage because there is healthy, holy, happy, safe. And when you found out that marriage did not cure those things, in fact, in many cases, marriage made those things more apparent, You are coming out of your marriage relationship, your sexual experience, disillusioned, disenchanted, disappointed, beginning to believe that there is no context within which sexuality is healthy, holy, or happy. And sometimes the response to that, one way to handle that is to shut it down completely. turn it off, let it die, in that at least there is no pain, and people just go numb. The word is withdrawal. A man from a woman, a woman from a man, we withdraw. And in more ways, beloved, please get this in on the front end, in more ways than sexually do people withdraw. And before you know it, you have in a marriage someone living here and someone living here, and you are withdrawn sexually, yes, emotionally, happened before it happened sexually, emotionally withdrawn, spiritually withdrawn, disillusioned in that relationship, resentful, unfulfilled, we call it marriage. I call it another manifestation, possibly, of the pain of porneia. Now as you consider that scenario, know this, right off the bat, that this scenario that I am painting for you is nothing new. Referring back again to the text we focused on last week, 1 Corinthians 6, we will this week move into 1 Corinthians 7. The people in the city of Corinth had in it, And for our interest, the people in the church in Corinth had in it a significant number of people who, because of their life before redeemed and because of the culture they lived in, were coming into their Christian faith having almost drowned in a sea of pornea. And because of that, they're having a hard time seeing sexual activity in any context being a safe thing. And they were beginning in the Corinthian church to embrace the teaching of the Stoics, which espouse that physical pleasure of any kind is basically bad. Specifically, sexuality is vile. Now, if your only experience of sexuality is a distorted one, if it has been in your life a dehumanizing experience, an abusive, manipulative experience, this approach makes a lot of sense. In fact, it feels like a safe thing to embrace, especially if I can embrace it in the name of purity and holiness. Among the Stoics, what was being taught was that singleness, for one thing, was more than a viable option, which it is, was being taught by the Stoics as spiritually superior. And the reason was this. In singleness, we could avoid all of that vile activity of sexuality. And we could, by our separation from all of that stuff, ascend spiritually to a higher plane. And so it is in Corinth. Singleness was being perpetrated as superior, not because it really is a viable option, which it is, but literally as an escape from having to deal with our issues about porneia. You don't have to deal with it. You just can let it all die. But that mentality also in Corinth spread to marriage. And you had people, married people, in the name of purity, devotion, and holiness, withdrawing from one another sexually, but withdrawing from one another emotionally and spiritually as well. Now, as I put that scenario together, An interesting paradox occurs to me in the Corinthian church, a twisted thing. Think about it with me. When it came to porneia, an issue that Paul dealt with in 1 Corinthians, from 1 Corinthians 3 to 1 Corinthians 6, they were able in Corinth to do that. Sexually, their bodies functioned really well, unfortunately, when it came to porneia. Three chapters on it. When it came, however, to a context within which they could experience healthy, holy, happy sexuality, they were incapable of that. They were withdrawing from one another when it came to that. Odd picture that, but not unique, comes to my mind the couples that you have met, that I have met, that tell this, story, before we were married, before we had a context within which we could maybe experience healthy, holy, and happy, we were very sexual. We did pornea real well, and then we got married, and that whole thing dried up and blew away. What is that about? I have the answer this morning. well I don't know what it's all about we need to peel the onion a little bit but what I will say is this whatever that is what's going on in Corinth it happens among us whatever it is though seems to me it's got the thumbprints of Satan all over it Satan whose job it is to steal and kill and destroy and twist and turn and as we wade through it, I just want to highlight a couple of things that we see. The first thing he says in verse 1 is dealing kind of with this stoic problem where people were withdrawing from one another, but also the thing that made singleness and celibacy the ultimate thing. He says, first of all, in verse 1, singleness and celibacy is good. Read the verse. Now, concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman. Turn it around. It is good for a woman to not touch a man. What that's meaning literally is this. Singleness and celibacy is a good thing. The Greek word for good there is kalos. That's significant. It means fine, profitable, beneficial. It's also significant that that word in the Greek is not a comparative word, meaning this. Singleness is not better. It's not worse. It is a very good thing. I want to affirm those who are single, it's good. Those who are celibate, it is a good thing. This word, by the way, does confront two issues as it relates to singleness. It confronts the mentality that some might have that in marriage, that only in marriage you can find some sense of identity and value and love and life. Marriage is not the only way. This is not a comparative. marriage isn't better singleness isn't singleness and celibacy is good this word here also confronts however specifically in Corinth the stoic heresy which said singleness and celibacy is the only way no it's not the only way it's a good way it's good it's kalas then he goes on in verse 2 and says while singleness and celibacy is good know this as well sexuality and marriage is good as well and you in Corinth have begun to speak as if sexuality somehow is in and of itself a vile thing, not true. In fact, let a man have his own wife, verse 2, let a woman have her own husband. Having her, having him. Sexually, clearly it means that. In other ways as well, I hope you catch that. To have him, to have her means more than sexual, but it includes that. Clearly, by the way, just to put a finger on this, we are dealing in the context of marriage. A husband and a wife are to have one another. It is in the context of marriage that this takes place. Stop right there and think with me for a moment about this. Wherever it is that we have gotten the idea that human sexuality is somehow vile, dirty, or unspeakable, we did not get that idea from Scripture. We have maybe gotten it from a twisting of Scripture, but we have not gotten that idea from the Word of God. Repeatedly in the Word of God, we have been pointed to and warned about the dangers of the pain of pornea, but repeatedly through the Word of God, we have heard also this, the Word of God speaking of and celebrating the joy of sexual love between a husband and a wife over and over. The Song of Solomon is graphic in its description of physical intimacy. An interesting passage in Genesis chapter 26, verse 8, relative to sexual love between a husband and wife finds Abimelech the king looking out his window, and it says, Abimelech the king looked out his window and saw Isaac sporting with his wife, Rebecca. That word sporting is significant. I looked it up. It doesn't mean volleyball. They were not playing badminton. That's a wonderful term for sexuality in a context that is good. It was sporting. That connects with my mind as playing. It was playful. It was fun. It was good. It was good. Hebrews 13.4 says this, Let the marriage bed be undefiled. That means two things. That means on one hand, let it be undefiled. Keep it that way. It also means before you keep it undefiled, you've got to go before that and affirm this. The marriage bed is undefiled. And the bed there is speaking of the sexual relationship between a husband and a wife. You need to have it declared that that union is undefiled. It's good. Proverbs, specifically Proverbs 5, speaks of sexuality. If we're looking, and we are looking for, maybe just some sort of snapshot of what human sexuality, healthy sexuality, in contrast to the sea of pornea that we're very familiar with, can we get a snapshot somewhere of what a healthy thing might look like? Proverbs 5 is helpful. The picture here is of ancient wisdom, comes in the form of poetry, and the picture is that of a father speaking to a son. I think without playing with the text at all, you could make applications of a mother talking to their daughter, or father talking to their daughter, father talking to their daughter, son, whatever. But here is the advice, ancient wisdom relative to sexuality. Son, verse 15, drink water from your own cistern and draw water from your own well. What does that speak of? It speaks of a relationship that is exclusive, your own cistern, your own well. Should your springs be dispersed and streams of water be poured into the streets, son, daughter, may it never be. That would not be profitable for you or for anyone else. Let them be yours and yours alone and not for strangers with you. Again, speaking of exclusiveness and sexuality. Rejoice, it goes on to say, in the wife of your youth. Rejoice in the husband of your youth. That speaks of past exclusiveness. It speaks of exhaustiveness, extensiveness. The wife or husband of your youth follows through. One man, one woman, no options. It is exhaustive, it is extensive, it is exclusive. And the final thing is it is exhilarating. Son, as a loving hind and a graceful doe, Be exhilarated always with her love. Be exhilarated always with his love. And in an exclusive, exhaustive, extensive relationship, exhilaration is the result. And it's good. So let that just sit there. It's good. At the risk of offending some, let me state very frankly what physical sexuality is. In its starkest form, it is this, two people physically approaching one another, one of whom opens totally to the other, the other entering, literally discharging himself into the other person. How do you feel when I say that? It's like something that delicate shouldn't be said so loudly. That's a graphic description. Whatever else, that description, graphic as it is, that I describe to you of what sexual love looks like, what it speaks to is this. Total abandonment of myself to another person. Total abandonment of that person to me. And when I think of abandoning myself to someone, my wife, when I think of her abandoning herself to me, there's something else that rises in me, quite frankly, from my toes. And that is this. This feels incredibly vulnerable. And it seems to me that if I am going to enter the life of someone that freely, and she is going to do the same for me, it seems to me that something in my soul would cry in that context for safety. Something secure. Something that when we're done with this incredible abandonment, people aren't going to be walking away. Now, if that kind of abandonment physically is taking place in a context other than exclusive, Proverbs 5, exhaustive, extensive relationship, that kind of abandonment will not be safe. I'm not saying it won't be pleasurable. That would be a lie. Pleasure is safe. No. And in time, physical abandonment like that, that is not in the context of exclusive, exhaustive, extensive relationship, on the front end, wonderful. But over time, promise, that kind of experience will be unfulfilling, disappointing, disillusioning. You will find yourself thinking, it's the partner. Find another one. Maybe we need some toys. Let's get something in here to juice this up. It's not a physical problem, however. If it's not in the context of exclusive, exhaustive, extensive, at best it will be unfulfilling. At worst, it will be deeply damaging. but let me add something to that if that kind of physical abandonment this time let's put it in a marriage and even in a marriage this physical abandonment is inconsistent with somehow separated from emotional abandonment and spiritual abandonment say it this way this physical entering in and opening up is not happening emotionally In other words, we are not opening up to each other emotionally. We are not entering into each other's lives emotionally or spiritually. And if all you're doing is the physical abandonment without the others, that sexual experience, even in your marriage, will be at best disappointing, unfulfilling, disillusioning. At worst, even in your marriage, deeply damaging. Why? Because just maybe there is something more involved with my sexuality than just skin to skin. Something of my spirit, my humanity is somehow involved and needs to continually be integrated even in my marriage. And if that is separated, something is lost. Why is it unfulfilling? Because sexuality does not, sexuality cannot, even in a marriage, create intimacy. What sexuality, healthy sexuality, by God is designed to do is celebrate, be a picture of, be a manifestation or an illustration of intimacy that's taking place over here as well, emotionally and spiritually. Emotionally, entering in, opening up. Spiritually entering in, opening up. Physically entering in, opening up. And in that kind of dynamic, you have something that is coming somewhere near healthy, holy, happy, safe. I was given a book this week called Hidden Bedroom Partners. It was written by Frank Hajak and Patricia Garwood. they're secular writers and they speak of interestingly all the ways people use sex to create things in their relationship to establish things for themselves and to protect things that they call non-sexual in fact they coined this phrase and it's the thesis of their book non-sexual sex and their thesis is that non-sexual sex destroys sexual pleasure let me describe it to you according to these writers secular psychologists sex therapists non-sexual sex is when you use sex to prove for instance your masculinity let me just stop on that one if i'm moving even married into sexual relations with my wife but the reason i'm doing it is to prove i'm a man it has nothing to do with the celebration of our intimacy I'm bringing to that bed something I need to prove. In that sexual relationship I am going to oddly feel unfulfilled because sex can't prove my masculinity. It can't do it. It doesn't have the power to do it. Guess who else is going to feel unfulfilled? The wife, the woman I'm using to do that for me. People use sex to establish their femininity. Same dynamic happens. People use it to affirm their sexuality. They go on. They use it to avoid loneliness, to establish intimacy, to avoid intimacy. That one caught my attention. My whole thesis is that we can't use sex to establish intimacy. These writers said that sometimes people use sex to avoid intimacy. I read on that. I thought, what is that about? What would that look like? Interesting. You got this relationship. And in this relationship, every time something, as it relates to emotional or spiritual issues in their lives, would begin to come up that might cause some tension, that might cause some grief, that might cause us to open up and enter in emotionally or spiritually, so frightening was that, we would shut that down, begin to seduce one another without dealing with any of our issues. We'll just go to bed. After enough of that, people come up out of that bed feeling disillusioned, disappointed, unfulfilled, wondering why we have great sex. but it wasn't a celebration of this. You were trying to avoid that. They go on to talk about people using sex to mask their anger, deal with their depression, establish control in the relationship, use it to punish their partner, reward their partner, to get affection, to be rebellious, to get revenge. And then they went on to say that if you use sex for any of those things, your sexuality will ultimately be, at best, unfulfilling, disappointing, disillusioning, at worst, deeply damaging. Why? Well, now I put the book aside and I'm going to talk. Here's why. Because healthy sexuality was never given to us by God to establish intimacy. It was given to us by God to celebrate, to illustrate, to manifest the opening up and the entering in of a woman and a man at other levels that finally expresses itself wonderfully in the sexual arena. And when you get that kind of dynamic, we're beginning to move a little bit closer to something that feels healthy, holy, and happy and safe. now when Paul says in verse 5 of chapter 7 to stop depriving one another what is he saying he's speaking of sexuality stop depriving each other sexually well they were withdrawing from one another so in fact he was speaking at least of that level stop depriving one another sexually come together but I believe firmly he was speaking of that to maybe even force the other issues. Overall, he's saying this, you need to stop withdrawing, to stop closing up, to begin to open up and enter in emotionally, spiritually, sexually, yes. But you need to enter into each other's lives. You need to begin to open up to each other's lives. You need to go toward each other. But let me make you a promise. If you hear a verse like that, and whatever level you are not entering in or opening up, whether it be emotional, spiritual, or sexual, and then you hear a verse like that that says stop depriving, and you decide, you know what? I'm going to start moving toward my wife, and I'm going to begin opening up to my wife in any of these areas. I promise you this. Every issue in your life is going to pop to the surface. Every fear you've got about opening up, about entering in, is going to be in your face. and when it comes into your face, you'll have a choice to make. And the choice will be this. As I consider the possibility of entering in and opening up emotionally, spiritually, or sexually to my wife or husband, and now I feel afraid, I can either look at that, acknowledge it, feel it, talk about it, maybe even go and get some help together to work through it, or when that fear comes up and I desire to close up and withdraw, I do that. I close up, withdraw, and we got two people living here and living here emotionally, spiritually, and physically. Paul's saying in a variety of ways, not in married life, I'm driving you together. Stop depriving one another of each other. Verse 3, he says, same basic thing let the husband fulfill his duty to his wife likewise also the wife to her husband i don't know how you respond to that one but i'm looking at that i'm going how romantic fulfill your duty okay you know i look i look at things like this and i go no wonder you're single paul you know man oh man the fact is this if you've been married at all and you know anything about of your own sexuality and how it works there are not many things that will kill sexual pleasure quicker than doing your duty okay i mean so what's he talking about here it's got to be more than that than it is step back dave johnson i got to think about this what would it mean for me to do my duty to my wife, to embrace my responsibility as a husband. And I think of things, and we need to think of things, before we ever get to physical sexuality. My responsibility to my wife, according to the Word of God, is to leave, to cleave, one flesh relationship, to enter her, open her spiritually, and to enter her life physically, and to open myself to her physically as well. I am responsible to enter her life spiritually as well, physically as well and also in all three arenas to open myself to her in any arena I begin to do that I promise you this every issue in my life is going to come to the surface all of my fear, all of my pain all of the ways in which I've been wounded in the past when I opened up rejected in the past when I entered in every fear I have will rise to the top and when it does I will have a choice and so will you. What am I going to do with this fear? One thing I could do would be to say it out loud to see it, to acknowledge it, to feel it to share it with my wife to bring my wife and I somewhere maybe to get some help to work through these things or soon as I get afraid to enter in or open up on any level I can just shut it all down. It's too scary. It's too big. And in the emotional life, spiritual and sexual life, which mirrors ultimately this, I choose to die. Verse 4, I saved for last because it is a, maybe the most powerful, graphic, confrontive word about mutual abandonment, about opening up and entering in completely to another human being. Seen sexually as a metaphor, in this verse it has to do with more of an attitude. It says this, the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Stop right there. How do you like that verse? I don't know. I thought of that verse. I thought, picture, Dave, just picture speaking that word on the steps at the University of Minnesota. whoa whoa that wouldn't sell real well and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does and for some of us everything in our being rises up and says I don't belong to you. There is no way you belong. It's mine, it's me, and in our marriage, we need to make it very clear. On the front end, this is me, and it is mine, and this is mine, and this is mine, and you can have that, and that, and that. We are so swimming in the sea of pornea, we have a hard time seeing this as being healthy at all. So we need to get a snapshot, some sort of glimpse of how this would be healthy, good, how it is I could do this. Let me take my best shot at that. To me, a healthy manifestation of this would be this. Me, looking at my wife and saying to her, Bonnie, you. Not just your physical body, you, but you. your emotions, your spirit, everything that makes you what you are, you belong to me. I, not just my physical body, I, but me. I do belong to you. Irrevocably, unreservedly, one thing, David, you should never wonder about is whether I belong to you. Abandoned am I to you. and then on my part it would look like this her looking at me and saying David you not just your physical body you but you your heart, your spirit, your emotions you belong to me and me turning around and hearing those words saying back at her Bonnie I not just my physical body I but me my heart my life everything that makes me what I am does indeed belong to you let me tell you something Bonnie you got that right when you said I belong to you irrevocably irreversibly never wonder about that but the fact is this for either of us my wife or I for anybody here to even begin to approach that kind of open life abandonment to another person requires above everything else trust if I think that by entering into her life or opening my life to her I am going to get splattered. Believe me, it will be my life. Somewhere along the line, trust has to come. And let's say we got our fingernails on some trust. I've begun to trust you. You've begun to trust me. On the basis of just a modicum of trust, the next thing that is required for this kind of abandonment of people to people is this. You've got to take a risk. And the risk is this. Based on the small amount of trust we have, I enter in a little bit. I open up a little bit my heart, my life, my thoughts, my fears. And when I open up, and when I enter in, if she or he or whatever the case would be would receive that, you know what you've got now? Some more trust. And now based on the trust you have, you enter a little more, and you open up a little more and if it's received, you've got a little more trust and you keep on going and you're getting to know one another as you enter in and open up. And in a relationship where people emotionally and spiritually are entering in and opening up, when that relationship then becomes absolutely exclusive, exhaustive, and extensive in what is called a marriage, you can, you will experience something that is healthy, sexually, holy, happy, and safe. It is possible. But know this. With any one of these verses, if you even begin to take a tiny baby step toward this abandonment. I belong to you. You belong to me. Just a tiny baby step. Emotionally, spiritually, or physically, when you do that, every issue in your life is going to pop to the surface. Every fear you have is going to be manifested in your spirit. And when it does, you'll have a choice. Do I look at it, deal with it, go get some help for it, keep it out in the open, or do I shove that back down, close back up, withdraw, And allow myself to die. Emotionally, spiritually, and sexually. Working through these issues that pop up. Working through, saying out loud these fears that emerge as we would attempt as husbands and wives to enter in, to open up. Working through those things is what marriage is. There's wonderful ideas about marriage. I just thought marriage would be skipping through the meadow. We'd always be open. We'd always be entering. We'd always be free. It would just be easy. And I didn't know about issues coming up at 10 o'clock at night. and we're still talking about it at 2 o'clock in the morning. I didn't know about that. That's a wonderful passage in 1 Corinthians 7, verse 28. Later on in the same chapter, Paul is talking to the singles and believe it or not, he's recommending singleness to them. Many reasons among them is this, because in marriage you will have trouble. the Greek word's great the Greek word is flipsis if you have marriage marriage is good but no don't be naive you're going to have flipsis you're going to have the coming together of people and they're going to rub on each other and as they come toward each other whether it be emotionally spiritually or sexually when they come toward each other issues are going to pop up I don't know what a perfect marriage is. I mean, I don't know what it is. But I can tell you this, and delight in telling you this publicly. I adore my wife. I adore her. And I think God has given to us an experience and glimpses of what it feels like to be bonded, to be soulmates. But I need to tell you, in light of what I still think is a real healthy marriage that fights and does their things and up and does their flips at 2 in the morning. Our marriage is horribly flawed. You know why? I'm in it. Relax. Stop the clapping. Listen, listen. There's another reason our marriage is horribly flawed. My wife is in it. You laughing at me. I got news for you. The best marriage in this congregation is horribly flawed. You know why? You're in it. And you and I, to our marriages, bring all of our stuff. Sometimes it's the pain of porneia. Sometimes it's the fact that we have been horribly wounded by someone who took something away from us that they had no right to take. And now as we come together emotionally, spiritually, and sexually, we're shutting down, closing up. I don't trust anybody. We're going to have to work through that. Maybe some of you will. Some of you have. There is hope for you. Just don't let it die. Don't withdraw and close up. Keep looking at the pain. Walk right into it. It's called courage. But in a context where people exclusively, exhaustively, extensively, are committed to one another in a marriage, commit themselves to moving toward each other, not depriving one another, doing their responsibility toward each other of opening up and entering in on every level, I believe with all my heart, we can indeed know. Get glimpses of healthy, holy, happy, but deal with the pain that pops up. And don't think you're crazy or defective if pain does pop up. It will. pop up. Just keep going this way. Final word. Some of you I want to embrace specifically because quite frankly at this time in your life you would be incapable of opening yourself to anybody, abandoning yourself to anybody, doing verse 4 with anybody. Why? Well maybe because what needed to be given away for free was taken away from you by force. I'm talking about pornea perpetrated on you. And along with whatever else was taken was your capacity to trust, open up, and enter in. And the issues in your life right now that might be manifesting sexually, either sometimes in promiscuity, believe it or not, thinking that by that we'll fix this some way, or even by that, medicate the pain some way, maybe manifesting itself in the other extreme, an inability to function sexually at all, what you need to realize is that maybe at the core of it all is that you've been terribly wounded, and the issue is trust, vulnerability, and feeling safe. So what do you do? What do you do if you're in a marriage like that? Well, Paul says this, whatever you do, don't withdraw. Whatever you do, don't close up. Whatever you, don't shut down. Don't walk away. And here I'm not talking sexually. We're going to have to wait for that if we've got these kinds of wounds. Talking emotionally, talking spiritually, open up, enter in, go toward each other. And when you do know this, the pain will pop up. And when it does, don't walk away. Keep walking toward each other. And when you do, the pain will pop up. And when it does, don't walk away. And that's called process. Look at it, feel it, mourn it, ask God to touch it. and if we can continue the spirit we had last week as you deal with all of that stuff, we will feel it with you. We will bear it together. God, heal our pain. Cause us to move toward one another. Others are not incapable of giving yourself away. As many who have been wounded are, your problem and pain may be opposite that because maybe in a context that was not exclusive, that was not extensive or exhaustive, far too easily did you say, I belong to you, and now your problem is no boundaries. You don't have a no. And now sexuality very possibly feels dirty and cheap to you, and worse than that, maybe you feel dirty and cheap. So what do you do? We'll start with this. and take this like personally from me. Don't walk away. Don't walk away from us. Don't close up. Don't withdraw and don't deny. Enter in, open up. What would it look like to do that? Well, it certainly wouldn't mean open up some more sexually. No, it means open up, enter in, say it out loud. Blessed are those who mourn, those who get out here, what's in here, start saying it out loud. And maybe as a body and maybe with some friends and maybe going to get some help, we can establish some healthy boundaries over here so I don't so quickly give myself away. Thinking by doing that, I can get what my soul so desperately needs. Begin to build some healthy boundaries, some healthy no's, so that maybe one day you could indeed give yourself to someone and open yourself up and enter in, emotionally, spiritually, and sexually, in a way that's healthy, holy, and happy. I didn't say this last night, but this morning this came to me, and I think it's from the Lord. In closing, I want to say a word to the couples in our church, the singles. maybe engaged maybe dating the first group of couples dating or engaged that I want to address are those who right now are being sexual whatever pull I have I don't even know what I have but I'll just say it pull back from that pull back from the physical abandonment you're giving to each other, the full opening up, the full giving, just pull back from that. Dare I say, please pull back from that and begin to take that energy that's being spent there and look at your emotions and look at your hearts and begin at emotional and spiritual levels to enter in and open up and enter in and open up and learn a little something about emotional and spiritual intimacy and maybe use this time where having already maybe been sexual to back off of that and build some very important trust. Believe it or not, I told you at the beginning I would speak frankly, but believe it or not, it can be done. one of the core beliefs of sexual addiction is that sexuality is a need it's like eating if i don't have it i will die here's the deal here's the deal men and women you're not gonna believe this you won't die you will not die you maybe need to stop long enough to find out I didn't die. Very frankly, nothing is going to fall off. Nothing is going to blow up. It can be done. Back up. Back up. Enter in. Open up at levels that maybe now you're not exploring at all. And I want to tell you something. If you are not married, it is not exclusive, it is not exhaustive, and it is not safe. It isn't. Because any time, get up, walk away, and you have been used. Another word to some couples who maybe have been dating, maybe dating a number of people, maybe you're engaged, but you have not been sexual. I'm going to say something to you that occurs to me you won't hear anywhere else but hear. Here's what I want to say to you. Good for you. Good for you. Good for you. Think about that. Think about it. That sounds a little corny to you, to say that. I feel powerfully compelled to say that because in every other context of your life, you will not get a good for you for that. In fact, quite opposite, you will have, for some of you, intense pressure to give that thing away before it really is an exclusive, exhaustive, extensive commitment. I'm glad you clapped. I hope those of you who are in a sea of pornea, hanging on to a thread of purity in your single life, I hope you heard it. I hope you let it in. Good for you. We're going to embrace it. But, you know, we're going to embrace those of you who have given it away, too, who want now to deal with it and bring some things back. And that does lead me to my close. How do we close something like this? With all the variables and all the different places we are, I want to bring back the spirit of what I did last Sunday, not to ask all of you to come, but in the spirit of that, I want to blow a trumpet in Zion. I want to gather the people, assemble the elders, come together to God and say, God, we recognize, first of all, that this is not just about him and him and her and her. It's about us. And so, God, we come to you and we ask that you would reclaim for us, restore and renew for us what we have lost, what has been taken, what we have given away, and help us enter into holy, healthy, happy, safe sexuality. God, even before sexuality, help us learn about opening up and entering in, taking risks, building trust, discovering the terrifying delight of intimacy. with people. I want you to stand as we close. And the best way I can describe this is that Dan has a gift for us through a song. As we sing, I want the altar ministry to come and those of you who need prayer, you feel free to come. This is a song that I just actually finished yesterday so you don't know it. But it's simple and as we sing it, I want you to sing along with me after you hear a little bit of it. May my body be your home. May my passions be your own. Though temptations cloud my view, may I follow you. Sing that with me. May my body be your home. May my passions be your own. Though temptations cloud my view, may I follow you. May my eyes turn from what's wrong. May your spirit make me strong. Living like you want me to, may I follow you. This is the prayer that I pray. Give me the will to obey. May I yield my everything. May I serve you as my king. In each little thing I do, may I follow you. May I love the things you love. May my thoughts be from above. Hating evil, loving truth, may I follow you. Hating evil, loving truth, may I follow you. Lord, we pray that as we seek to follow you, as we seek to, in marriage relationships, to be vulnerable to one another, that you would help us. Lord, as we seek to call what you call sin, sin, and to turn from it, I pray you'd help us. Help us to walk close to you. Change our hearts. Help us to love the things you love. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.
