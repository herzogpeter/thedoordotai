My name is Steve. Welcome to Open Door. And I want to apologize for the very all-boy band nature of this weekend. You will hear from nothing but males, and that is a travesty on many levels. But it's because several hundred women at Open Door are up in Alexandria this weekend at a women's retreat. And my wife is up there. She's been one of the speakers, along with Kristen, Becky, Vicki. And we've been hearing amazing things that have been happening, so I can't wait to hear more about it. because it's been an amazing time. But what that means is that many of us, husbands at least, are at home with the kids all weekend. And so people have been asking me, like, Steve, how have you been doing with the kids? Are you making it? Are you all right? And like, who has the kids now? You didn't leave them at home, did you? And I'm like, you know what? It's been a little hard, but when Mary's away, we kind of use it as an opportunity to do experiments with things that we normally wouldn't do. And one of the experiments is that we push things to their limits to see just how far they can make it without breaking. And so, you know, one of the myths that happen or that's going along right now is that Nalgene bottles, they don't have a Nalgene bottle. So there's a myth that that thing cannot be destructed. Well, check out this video and see if that's true or not. Yes, that's what happens in a house when there's four boys hanging out. All right. Well, that was a freebie and not at all a part of my talk, unless you want it to be, and then you can find some application in it. But I would like to transition now into my talk, and what I'd like to do is pray, but what I'd like to do is invite you into the prayer, and when we open up God's Word, what we're hoping for is that God actually speaks, that God would actually speak to us, and God would actually speak to you. And believe it or not, all that does not depend on my ability to break it down. It's you opening up your heart to hear what you need to hear from God. So I want to invite you to pray that you would actually hear from God. And then once you've heard from God, that you would have the courage to take a next step into what you then need to do. So let's pray together. So God, we open our hearts up to you. We're all imperfect, and we all really are desperate to hear from you in our own situations. So please, God, come through the power of your spirit and speak and give us the ability to not only hear but then take a next step in whatever it is that you want us to take a next step in. In your name, amen. Well, I want to start off with a question, and the question is this. Have you ever felt like a cog in the machine? have you ever felt like a cog in the machine have you ever felt like you were just a small piece in a huge organization or job or even family where your gifts and your skills were really pretty replaceable have you ever felt like your role didn't really matter I remember I took a job as a painter one summer when I was in college and these college painter businesses where everyone has to buy a pair of white pants and you wear a red shirt and everyone wears the same uniform and so we started painting houses but a couple weeks in my bosses came up to me and they said Steve we would like to promote you to being the team leader on your team? And I was like, wow, that's awesome. First question, how much more does it pay? Really good question. So they told me how much more it paid, and I was like, well, that's really good news. And then I had another question, and I said, I'm just curious, why did you pick me? There's other people on the team. Why did you feel like I could handle this responsibility? So they kind of nervously looked at each other, and this is what they told me. Well, you see, there's a big trailer that you need to pull, you know, and it carries all the ladders and all the equipment, and you're the only guy on your team who has a hitch in your car, so... And I felt so honored. I mean, I felt so incredibly honored and known and seen. Well, on one level, who cares? It's a college job that I earn more money. I got some leadership experience by failing a bunch, mainly. But what are the environments where it's really important that you not feel like a cog in the machine? there's five people in my family my wife Mary, myself and our three boys Isaac, Ben and Lijah and it's really important to me that not one of those people feel like a cog in the machine at any time that every single one of those people feel like they play a valuable part in our family without any of whom we just wouldn't be our family and then I think about the body of Christ. I think about it big C all around the world, but I also think about this body of Christ, this community of followers of Jesus together. And I wonder if anyone feels like they're a cog in the machine. Where your gifts don't really matter, where you're not really seen, where what you bring isn't really that important. And even if it was important, there's probably someone that could do it better than you could. And so I wonder if anyone feels like a cog in the machine. Well, you know, we're wrapping up Colossians. This is the final week of teaching. After three years, next week we're going to do sort of a greatest hits of Colossians, I guess, before we move on to our next study. but in the last few verses in Colossians, we read the names of people that make up the church at Colossae. And it's names that you've never heard before, most of whom anyway. Names like Aristarchus and Mark and Justice and Epaphras and Luke and Demas and a woman named Nympha. and Archippus and, of course, Paul. And this letter that started out so majestic, speaking of the Jesus that holds all things together, the Jesus that spoke the universe into existence, the Jesus that is the exact representation of God's image, this cosmic Jesus is how it starts in chapter 1. It ends with some different names. names that make up the body of Christ without whom that wouldn't be the body of Christ names that really really matter names that are not just cogs in the machine and as we think about those names there's a couple other names that we need to think about like you and me what role do you play in the body of Christ and do you believe that God has given you a part to play that's really important that you play without which we just wouldn't be complete or do you feel kind of like a cog in the machine so let's look at some of the first names that paul writes about first name he writes about in colossians 4 verses 10 11 you can open up your bibles or your smartphones whatever you have to those or look up on the screens colossians 4 verses 10 11 we read this my fellow prisoner aristarchus of just majestic greek name i love that name send you his greetings as does mark the cousin of Barnabas. And then we read, you've received instructions about him. If he comes to you, welcome him. And that little note we learned about last week, because Paul and Barnabas had this huge dispute, this huge disagreement about Mark. Can you imagine being Mark and seeing Paul and Barnabas ping pong back and forth about you? And Paul said, I don't want to bring Mark. He deserted us. Barnabas said, no way. We're bringing Mark. We have to. Paul said no, and they ended up splitting ways because of it. Well, we read in Colossians 4, very subtly that loose end gets tied up, and Mark and Paul have mended their ways. And then Paul says to the Colossians, hey, if Mark shows up, welcome him. He's a part of the body of Christ. Beautiful story of redemption right there between the lines. And then Jesus, who's called Justice, who you've never heard of, he also sends his greetings. And then Paul writes this verse in verse 11. It's this beautiful, vulnerable verse that doesn't really even fit in the whole narrative of the story. It says, these are the only Jews among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they've proved a comfort to me. Why did he write that? Paul was a Jew, and he worked mainly among Greeks and Gentiles, people who didn't grow up learning about God, didn't grow up believing in God, some of whom don't believe in God yet. And I think what Paul is saying in this verse here is that the ministry that I've been called to and I've accepted is a lonely place. There are people that I work with and people that I interact with that really don't understand me at all, and people that I work with and people that I interact with that I'm starting to get to know and starting to get to love even, but I don't really get them, and I don't really understand them, and it felt really lonely. And so there needed to be some people that made me feel less alone. So it makes me wonder in this body, if some of you are maybe discouraged, and you need to know that you're not alone, that the area of the kingdom that Jesus has called you to sow seed in, so to speak, is a place that's been difficult for you to be in. And you've felt discouraged. And you've felt lonely. And maybe you've even felt rejected by those people. And you're in it, and you're doing it, and you're called to it, but you're feeling discouraged. What do you need when you get in those moments? last week, I just hit a moment of pretty deep discouragement around something. And there's a person that goes to this church. His name is Joel. And he knew about my discouragement, and he sent me a text. And part of what the text simply said was this question. Hey, Steve, what can I do? And you know, when you're in a season where you're feeling pretty discouraged, to have someone take the time to notice that you're discouraged is pretty big, isn't it? And then to take the time to ask, what can I do? Now, of course, our response to that question is always, I don't know, unless you're really desperate. and then it's like, get over here right now because I need someone to talk to. I think in the body of Christ, especially those of us who are called to do the things that often feel so lonely, God needs to raise up people in the body that encourage you and that comfort you. And we need to be open to God's voice. When God sort of brings someone to your mind. Because how hard is it to send a text or to make a phone call? So for those of you who are pressing into areas that feel pretty discouraging and you're in a place where you need someone to bring some comfort, I want to pray for you right here and right now. We want to invite the Spirit to come in and bring you comfort and even to raise people up in the body to do the same for you. So if that's you, receive this prayer. If that's not you, pray with me for these people right now. Let's pray. God, for those of us who feel deeply discouraged, we pray that your Spirit would come right now and bring comfort. Right now. And also that you would raise up people to come to their aid, to come and bring comfort tangibly so that the body of Christ can be the body of Christ, every person playing their part, every person feeling encouraged, every person feeling empowered to do what you've called them to do. Amen. Well, the next name we read is a beautiful name, Epaphras, in Colossians 4.12, I did a talk solely on Epaphras a couple years ago. And so I love this guy. Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, well, he sends his greetings as well, Paul writes. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, so that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured. What if you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was someone in the body of Christ who is committed to praying like that for you? That you would be mature and fully assured that you would know the will of God in the areas that you need to know the will of God in, in the areas that you're confused about. What if you knew someone was absolutely and utterly praying for you? And this phrase, wrestling in prayer, he's always wrestling in prayer. The word wrestling is a Greek word, agonizomai, and you need to say this with me. Would you just, agonizomai. Wow, that was like a mumble. That was great. Agonizabai is where we get our word agony. Some of you get woken up at 3.30 in the morning with someone on your mind to pray for. And your first reaction is, oh, wow. But if you stay with it, you realize, I got woken up to pray for someone that really needs it. And sometimes you don't even know who the person is. You just sense, I need to pray for this. And so you start praying. And some of you are eating your lunch, and it's 1237, and you're listening to a podcast, and it's a beautiful day, and all of a sudden someone's name pops in your mind. And you're wondering, well, where did that come from? see here's the deal some of you are holding deep and painful struggles as you pray for others and the hardest part about this is is that most of the time you don't see the results but you're called to hold this thing in prayer it might be for a relationship that you know is strained it might be for a person that you know has lost their way it might be for a whole church or ministry or someone's profession. Who knows what it's for, but you're holding it. And you're holding it as well as you know how to hold it. But it's a weight. There's a woman in our congregation who is on the women's retreat, I'm sure, because I've not seen her this weekend. Nonetheless, I might embarrass her by saying her name, but that's what the point of this whole talk is, is to say people's names. And so her name is Twyla, and she prays for me. so every once in a while she'll send me an email and it'll start with these beautiful little words hey Steve I just thought I would share these with you they're just impressions I have and then she always ends it with now if these resonate with you you know you just then take them from God but if they don't resonate with you you just delete this email right now because she's humble enough to know that not everything she gets is like from God you know so that would be a little hint for some of us to hey, I got a word. Well, maybe you got a word, but a great way to give that away is, hey, this might be from God. It might not be from God. If you don't sense it is from God, you delete this email right away. But it might be from God. So if it is, then you can interact with that because a person that knows how to hold prayer is like what I talked about last week, is a server, like someone who gets a meal from the chef who made it and delivers it in just about the same exact way that they got it from the chef. I'm not going to alter it. I'm not going to add my own opinion to it. I'm just going to give it to you the way God got it, and then it's up to you to figure out if that was from God or not, and you can bring that into your own community. And so some of you have been gifted with this gift, and it doesn't feel much like a gift for you, does it, when you wake up at four in the morning or when you're carrying this burden, but it is a gift because it's a gift for the people that you pray for. And this is the fuel on which the body of Christ runs. It really is. So I want to pray for those of you who hold this gift in prayer. I want to pray for the prayers. So let's pray together. And if this is you, receive this prayer. If this is not you, you just pray for the prayers. God, we ask you to bring incredible strength to the folks who you've given the gift of intercession to, that they would pray faithfully and that they would get up in the middle of the night and that they would follow the promptings to pray for someone and follow the promptings to give it away to those people because God, this is the way or part of the way that the body of Christ works and that you've ordained the body of Christ to work, to be dependent on prayers. And so I ask you to give incredible strength and courage to those of us who've been called to prayer. Amen? Okay, the next set of names we read in Colossians 4, verses 14 and 15. And we read our dear friend Luke, who wrote the book of Acts, and also Luke's gospel. He's the doctor. And Demas, they send their greetings. And Paul writes, give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea. And then this is what caught my attention and to Nympha and the church in her house. Because when have we ever heard about Nympha and the church in her house? That must have been a pretty amazing church, right? because we've all heard about it, and books and books have been written about it, right? But Paul said, no, there's a little church near Laodicea that meets in the home of this woman named Nympha, who's accepted the call of hosting this church in her home and leading this church in her home, and I wonder how Nympha felt doing this honor, and like, God, why didn't you ask someone else to do it? Because frankly, my house is always a mess, and it's not big enough, and I don't really know how to do this. I don't know how to lead this deal, but it's meeting in my house, so I kind of have to. And I kind of always heard that if you called someone something, you give them all the instructions for how to do it, and I haven't gotten all the instructions for how to do it, and I don't know what I'm doing, and I feel kind of alone, so what's going to happen? And then she's sitting in this community, and this letter is read out, and maybe she's dozing a little bit at the part where Luke in Demas' name, and then the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and then she perks up a little bit, because she's one of the sisters at Laodicea, and then she hears her name read out in front of the other brothers and sisters. And I want you to imagine what happened in her spirit when her name was read out. All of a sudden, she was no longer a cog in the machine. She was an important part of the kingdom of Jesus that's spreading. And Paul wanted her to know it so that she could go another day. Because you never know who is just day to day. because most of us are kind of day-to-day in terms of how we feel like we're gonna make it, especially when we're doing risky things like Nymphomus have been doing. So I believe some of you are doing something in the kingdom that feels incredibly risky and way over your head. It's like, whoa, I mean, I feel like I'm being called to it, but I don't know what I'm doing, and I don't know how to do it, and it feels really vulnerable. I think about Nina Barnes, who shared her story a couple weeks ago. She walked up here and told about a childhood filled with torture and abuse and about how God is bringing redemption in her life. And then she also talked about how every time she speaks about it, she wants to throw up because it makes her so nervous. And then she talked about how she's being asked more and more to do this. Awesome! And she's saying yes. Not because she wants fame or fortune. Neither of those are coming to her. She's saying yes because she wants other women and men who are trapped in cycles like that to stand up and get redemption. And so she throws up in a bucket before she speaks most times. And she gets up and does something vulnerable and risky. Another woman in our community, her name is Kim. And years and years ago, she got pregnant and she was not married and she was going to have an abortion. But felt like that was not the right way to go. she had her daughter and now she's this beautiful 20-something-year-old daughter. And the experience that Kim has had working with women in crisis has prompted her to take over a nonprofit that works with women in crisis, part of whom had this mission statement, we provide life-affirming support to women and children in crisis. I want you to think about women and children who are in crisis. Just for a minute. How overwhelming it would be to say, I want to put a dent in that problem. I mean, I want to do something about that. Because every single woman and child that's in crisis is someone that feels alone, abandoned, and without resources. They don't have a voice, and they're pretty invisible. No one really knows what to do. So this woman, Kim, she's like, yeah, I'm going to do something about that. Now, you know, when you do something like that, the money just rolls in. You know that, right? And no one has any kind of thing to say about how you're doing your deal or whether or not you should be doing it this way or whether or not you should be working with those people. So it's pretty easy to do, frankly. It's risky, and she's way over her head. And she's a friend of mine and, you know, whew, part of this church. and many of you are doing things that feel just as risky. So, here's a quote from you from one of my favorite authors, Donald Miller. He's talking about writers, but I think it applies to anyone who's doing anything risky. This would be a treasonous kind of prayer, treasonous to the dark powers of evil that would come against you just to say, stop doing it. It doesn't matter. It's not even making a dent that you would say, no, God, I agree with you. You gave me a voice and the gift was not in vain. You gave me a voice to be a gift to others and that gift is not going to be in vain. So God, empower me to do what I don't feel like I can do because the world needs it. The world in all of its brokenness needs people who are following Jesus into the risky and vulnerable places in their life, amen? And if that doesn't happen, then the world is just gonna keep crying out until someone answers the call. So I wanna pray for those of you who are doing risky things, that God would empower you. Now if that's you, you receive this prayer. If that's not you, you pray as I pray, okay? So let's pray together. Holy Spirit of God, you come and we beg of you with unbelievable amounts of courage for these people. so that they can just keep going today. Give them a breath of your spirit, the wind of your spirit blowing inside of them to do what they're called to do. I think about Pastor Dio in Haiti right now as he deals with thousands of people in crisis. We unite as a body with him right now and say, Holy Spirit, come. Do something. Do something to give him what he needs. Think about everyone else in this community that's doing anything risky. Come, Lord Jesus. Have mercy. Amen. I feel like I just need to... After that one. the next name Archippus Colossians 4 17 see to it Archippus that you complete the work that you receive from the Lord this is the only one that like he gets singled out that's got to feel awesome right he just talked about nympha hey Archippus talking to you now I don't know if it was like that but Archippus was doing some work that for some reason it had maybe stalled out or maybe he had given up on it or maybe he was chugging them right along, but Paul wanted to say, Archippus, it's really important that you complete the work that you've received. Now, the experience that I've had with assignments from God is that they're difficult to carry out. And many times, this is how we feel. You know, I'm just, I run marathons, I don't know why, but someone took this picture of me at mile, obviously, 23 here, and what you're feeling at mile 23 is that you'll never finish. That's what you're feeling. There's no way this particular thing will ever end. And you would give your whole bank account for it to end right then. But you've been called to do something. Take it away from marathons. I mean, on one level, marathons are sort of ridiculous. Take it into real life and what God has called you to do. You. Not anyone else, but you. and most of us hit times where you feel like, I don't know if it's doing any good. I don't know if it's making any difference. I don't know if I should quit. I don't know if I even heard right. I'm doing it and I don't even know what I'm doing. Some of you, when you're in that place, you just want to quit. Some of you already have quit or maybe you're just so tired that you can't imagine going on. So I want to give you something that someone gave Mary and I a little while back. This is a picture that is in our room, our bedroom. So love this picture of the chair. If you can't read what it's written to the right, it says, this grace sat with me until I could walk in it again. It's a picture of brokenness. Some of us need to come to a place when we're doing the hard thing that God has called us to do and we just kind of need to say, God, I've been trying so hard. I've been working so hard. I've been going so hard at it. And I just, can I sit down for one second? I'm not quitting. I just need to sit down. And we need to hear the words that says grace will sit with you until you're ready to walk in grace again. Anyone feel like, you know, there was a time in my life where I walked in grace. I was doing better than I am right now. I mean, I was. Like people, I'm just not doing very well. What if grace could sit with you until you could actually walk in grace again? What if Jesus was that good? so I want to pray for those of you who are in that place of needing grace to sit with you because it just feels too hard so if that's you you receive this prayer if that's not you you please pray for these people as I pray so Holy Spirit come with the kind of grace that can only come as a gift allowing people to sit down in it and just rest right now. They're not quitting. They're not giving up. They're just resting in your strength, in your grace right now, Lord. Bring your grace. Bring your strength. Give us the ability to sit until we can walk in your grace again. Some of us have lost our way and we're way off course. Give us the strength to sit down so that grace finds us so we can go back to you again, God. Amen. Last name that Paul writes is so fitting. It's his own name. Yeah, we talked about Nympha and Archippus and Epaphras and Justice and Mark. But as I close here in the last verse of Colossians, Paul writes, I need to tell you about me. I'm writing this greeting in my own hand and then he writes this very vulnerable thing hey guys I'm thinking about you I'm remembering you I love you you're in my heart you're in my prayers I need you to remember my chains I need you to remember that I'm in prison and it's really really hard I need you to remember that so just would you remember that he doesn't even go on earlier on in Colossians he asked for prayer that he may proclaim the mystery of the gospel with boldness right he doesn't even pray you know, it would be so nice if I got out of prison. He just says, listen, remember my chains. Remember my story. And then he says, grace be with you. Question, how did Paul go through being in prison? And we read elsewhere in the scriptures, he was discouraged, he was depressed, he was shipwrecked, he was hungry. All these crazy things happened to him. How did he do it and hang on to his faith? Well, in Philippians 4, 12 and 13, we read, it's just this window into his life. I know, he said, how to live on almost nothing. I've done it. And I know how to live with everything. I've done that too. I've learned, this is again Philippians 4, 12 and 13, I've learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it's with a full stomach or an empty stomach, whether it's with plenty or little. And here's the deal. I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength. I can do hungry. I can do full. I can do shipwrecked. I can do depressed. I can do betrayed. I can do abandoned. I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength. There's a part of me that wants to go. Either Paul is an absolute raving lunatic. That's a possibility. Or else he really experiences a strength from the Spirit of God that enables him to do that which he otherwise could not do. You got anything in your life that you feel like, I cannot do it. I'm not able. I'm not capable. I don't have the power to. The word strength here is a Greek word, edunamun. It means to make someone able who isn't able, to give capability to someone who has no capability, to strengthen someone who's weak, to empower someone who has no power. That's what the Spirit of God does. Amen? I mean, without that, we are absolutely lost. The body of Christ is built up person by person by the Spirit of God which gives you the strength to do that which you cannot do on your own. So the journey of being, of life in Jesus is a constant journey of falling on your knees and saying, I'm not able, I'm not capable, I can't do it. Lord, fill me up with what I need. That's the journey of being with Jesus. That's the journey of the Spirit. Lord, fill me up once again with what I cannot, with resources so that I can do what I cannot do. Because all of us need to know that God's strength empowers us as we attempt to own and live out our actual lives. Here's the thing. We spend a lot of time wishing we live different lives in a lot of different ways. I do. I wish my boys were easier. Whatever. No, I wish this was easier. I wish that was different. I wish, you know, I was different. I wish, where the only question Jesus has for me is, will you live out your own life? I mean, will you carry out your own calling in your actual life, in the actual universe that actually exists right now, not the fake universe where? And I think so many of us live as if this is what the reality of our own existence is. It's not our own lives. It's just we're just one of many. We're just replaceable. You know, if that little house on the left burns down, they're just going to pop another one right back up. I mean, there's a master plan. There's only like three different houses in that whole development right there. They're really easy to make and they're easy to maintain. If one breaks down, you just replace it. And that's how many of us think of ourselves. And that's a huge tragedy in the kingdom of God, that we would think of ourselves like that. So to counteract that, in closing, I'm gonna leave you with a picture. Those of you who have children or know a young child, especially that you just are very fond of, you know, get that picture in your mind, your own kids or maybe a nephew or niece, just get that picture in your mind. And then imagine that person coming up to you, that little kid, and saying, Would you rather I be someone else? Would you rather trade up? Would you rather not have me in your life? Would you rather I change into a different kind of person? What would you say to that little five-year-old? I mean, you'd get down on their level and touch their face and say, you have no idea how precious you are to me. I mean, you have no idea. Of course I wouldn't trade you. Of course I don't want you to be someone else. Of course I don't want you to change so that you earn my approval. You are irreplaceable to me. this picture is my son Elijah and some of you know Elijah he is a really quirky amazing brilliant little three and a half year old and I love this guy and to me he is irreplaceable and he will always be that way When God thinks about you, God gets down on your level and holds your face in God's hands and says, you are irreplaceable to me. I have given you a personality and gifts that need to be spread out into the world so that this world can be a bright place. And I've given you everything you need. I've given you what you need to be you. I'll give you strength through the power of my spirit. I'll give you a calling so that you can take your personality and kingdom gifts into this world. When you feel down, I'll encourage you. But you need to never, ever, ever think that you're replaceable to me, God says, because you are not. You are my child who I love and with whom I am well pleased. Holy Spirit, allow that reality to sink all the way in right now. That to God, you are irreplaceable. Isn't that a breathtaking thought? 1 John 3, 1, see what manner of love that the Father has lavished on us that we would be called the children of God. And we really are, exclamation point. Read it for yourself. 1 John 3, 1, we really are irreplaceable to God. Amen. Let's pray together. God, into the quietness of this moment, we recognize the working of your spirit. so all I want to do is fan into flame that which you're starting God work in the hearts of those of us who need desperately to hear a word of grace from you a word of favor from you a word of acceptance from you and our response to that God is to thank you and give you our lives is to say God I am yours holy and completely everything I am and everything I'm not you shine the light into my darkness God you reveal that which needs changing and I will submit that to you God because I am yours you're the one who calls me irreplaceable I'm yours God I'm yours Holy Spirit come and empower us to realize how precious we are in your sight. And allow that to fan into flame the gifts that we have so that this world might be a hope-filled, grace-filled, redemption-filled center of your kingdom. Amen. Amen. I want to invite you to stand for the benediction. now before I give the benediction I want to make it known that there's going to be people praying for anyone who has needs for prayer for anything so you please you you come and you just get prayed for if you need to just sit in your seat after we're dismissed you can feel free to do that maybe the rest of us can sort of file out a little more quietly. If you need to talk or pray with someone that's right next to you, I ask you to take the courage to ask for that. And if you have felt something stirred in you about taking a next step in your journey with God, I want to invite you to go to the Next Steps kiosk. There's a ton of people there that would love to just talk to you right now about what your next step might be. So receive this benediction. May the grace of God seep into your life until it absolutely overwhelms you. May the power of God give you the strength to do what you could never do on your own. May what is broken be healed. May what is in need of redemption be redeemed. And may you know as your truest identity is that you are an irreplaceable child of God. Amen? Amen. you
