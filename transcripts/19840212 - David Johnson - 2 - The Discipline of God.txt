Open your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 12. Our continuing study picks up once again in verse 5. Chapter 12, verse 5. Chad Walsh wrote a book called Early Christians of the 21st Century, and he said this in that book, Millions of Christians lived their lives in a sentimental haze of vague piety, with soft organ music trembling in the lovely light of stained glass windows. Their religion is a quiet, pleasant thing of emotional quivers. It is divorced from the intellect. It is divorced from the will. It is divorced from the reality of life. And it is divorced from commitment, demanding little from me but lip service to a few harmless platitudes. And I want to tell you something about that quote. What I feel about that quote is this, that it is entirely possible to find a church that will allow me to live like that, that will allow me to live with my spirituality, being nothing but pious platitudes, divorced from the will, from the intellect, and from the reality of life. It is possible to find a denomination that would let you feel comfortable living that way. It is possible, I am sure, even in our church, where the word of God, we believe, is proclaimed, to find a group of friends who, because of their lack of commitment, would allow me to feel very comfortable with my lack of commitment. But one of the things that thrills my heart as we are going through our particular study is this, that the Word of God does not let us get away with that kind of thing. The Word of God, if we are to be faithful at all, comes into that phony kind of religious piety, half-baked commitments, and blows them up. You remember last week? The exhortation was this. Get rid of the fat. Get rid of the excess baggage. Fix your eyes firmly on Christ, meaning look away from everything else, and run the race that is set before you. Taking mediocrity and blowing it up, it isn't okay. You remember from the study that we began last week in this 12th chapter that this letter is written to a hurting, discouraged group of people. In fact, if you would turn back to chapter 10, verse 32, we would see an account of some of the things that they were going through. Remember the former days, people, when after being enlightened, you endured great conflicts of suffering, partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated. For you showed sympathy to the prisoners, and you accepted joyfully the seizure of your own property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one. That was their history. And the result of those kinds of situations, negative, troublesome, painful situations, the result of that was that they were under intense pressure. They were under pressure from their friends, and they were under pressure, if you can imagine, being under that kind of pressure from within their own hearts. You've got to be able to imagine what their friends must have been saying to them. dear new Christian having left the Jewish faith can't you see with all these things coming down around your ears can't you see the fallacy of Christianity what good is it doing you you accepted this Jesus as Messiah you have left Judaism and all the security that was there from Abraham and Moses right on down the line what good has it done you all I see in your life is nothing but trouble and as those words were echoing in their ears, their own heart would begin to move against them because they would remember possibly when they first came to Christ and all the wild-eyed enthusiasm they had. And I thought for sure when I would come to Christ that my questions would be answered and the way would be made smooth and all the problems would fly away like little birds. but the truth is this that since i became a christian my trouble has only gotten worse just give it up just give it up last week we heard an encouragement from the word of god to not give it up to hang on and we are hearing the same encouragement continued in chapter five in verse 5 of chapter 12, it says this, you've forgotten something that you need to remember. He is going to encourage them, but he is going to exhort them strongly as well. Don't grow weary, we said last week. Don't lose heart. Hang on. We learned something very important last week also about encouragement. Do you remember that? We learned that encouragement that is really effective, Sometimes it is a caring and touching and gentle thing that comes along and puts the arm around and says, I'm here, I'm not going to say anything, I just want you to know you're loved. And that's a helpful thing. But there comes a time, very often, an encouragement, and we often forget this dimension, and that is this, that the encouragement that gets me up off my seat and moving again is an encouragement that says basically this, hey, get up, dry your eyes, blow your nose, run the race that's set before you. And what we had last week was what I guess I would call kind of a tough teaching. It was hard-nosed stuff. It wasn't feeling sorry for them at all. It was saying, get moving again. Today that tough teaching is going to continue. I want you to know that the encouragement is also going to continue, but it is not a feeling sorry for kind of encouragement. This is a tough teaching this morning and I believe it may be even tougher than last week. Not because the exhortation is any more important but rather because this exhortation and this bit of teaching that we are going to have this morning may be a little bit closer to the wound. You know what I mean by that? There's a wound on your arm and you kind of feel like there's other parts of your body you can touch and when somebody starts getting a little close, you just start recoiling a little bit and it's as if this morning this writer puts his finger right on the wound. Because the thing we're dealing with this morning is something that very often we try like crazy to avoid and we try like crazy to deny and that is this, that sometimes Christians suffer and we don't understand why. You know, you're telling us all the way through this 11th chapter that we need to believe God like these other people did. And then you told us last week from the word of God that we are to run the race. But if you're telling me over and over and over again to believe God and believe God and believe God and that's the way to go, tell me this. Why is it that I am in such a mess? And why do the godless seem to get away with things and don't suffer the same kinds of penalties in their heart that I sometimes do? And how does suffering do anything for me of value? And I know about the pious platitudes, but how does it do anything for me of value that I can see and feel and really understand? Chapter 12, verses 5 through 11 is going to be a lesson this morning. And I want to tell you something. I encourage you this morning to take notes because there's going to be some teaching this morning. The lesson is this, what the discipline of God is and how to take it. What the discipline of God is and how as a believer I need to receive it. The reason this is a tough lesson, I believe. Well, you're going to hear it. It's hard to hear, especially if you're struggling this morning. Let's read the text, chapter 12, starting in verse 5. you've forgotten the exhortation which was addressed to you as sons. The exhortation is this and it goes back into the Old Testament. My son, don't regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him. For those whom the Lord loves, he disciplines. And he scourges every son whom he receives. It is for discipline that you endure, for God deals with you as with sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? But if you are without discipline, here's a warning, of which all of you have become partakers, but if you are without discipline, then you are an illegitimate child and not a son at all. Furthermore, we have had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them for their discipline. Shall we not much rather be subject to the father of spirits and live? For they disciplined, speaking of our earthly fathers, they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, meaning they did the best they could. And obviously they made mistakes along the way. Sometimes they disciplined in anger and the desired result of discipline was not seen. But he disciplines us for our good every time that we may share in his holiness. All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but sorrowful. Yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. Let's pray as we begin. Lord, I love your word, and I love the things you teach us in it that are so practical, sometimes very hard to hear. And Jesus, I pray that as we hear your word this morning, we will be informed about some things maybe we don't know and need to know, that we will be challenged. But Father, far more than any of those, that we would be changed. I ask these things in your name. Amen. I think it's pretty obvious as I read through that text that the key word is the word discipline. In some of your translations, the key word is chastise. The word that's being used is chastise or chastening. Now I want you to know something. As we get into this study this morning, that it is absolutely crucial that we understand that term. If we are going to draw from this the truth of what is being said here about God's discipline in the life of the believer, I have first of all got to come up with a healthy definition of discipline. The reason it's so important is that I dare say most of us have an imbalanced perception of what God's discipline is. Chastening and discipline does not mean God's brow beating of you because of sin. I want to say something else. Discipline is not God's punishment of you for sin. It is not you do something wrong and if you do something wrong you will pay for what you did wrong. You need to know something about the gospel. Now we do know this. that you can't pay for your sin. God's punishment is not what we're talking about here. We're talking about discipline. Let's understand the word. It comes from a Greek word called paideia. It is a term that is used in connection with the family. Okay? Get the feel of the family. You need to do it. It has to do with the raising of children. It means literally not to punish with impunity and retribution and you're going to pay for this. It means to train, it means to educate, and to instruct. It is a broad term, and it refers to the training process of parents and children, and that training process that is designed by those parents and by God to cultivate character, to correct error, and to control the passions of that child in order that that person may be beaten up. No, that he may be mature, healthy, responsible, and productive. Discipline. It is not browbeating. It is not, you're going to get yours and you're going to have to pay for what you did. It is not getting what you deserve. If you got what you deserved, you'd be going straight to hell. If you got what you deserved for the sin in your life, even now you would be dead. Discipline is training, educating, instructing. Real strong distinction between God's discipline and God's punishment. We need to get it. God's people can never be punished for sin in the full sense. Why? Because punishment by definition, get this, punishment by definition is payment for sin. You deserved it, you're going to get it. The problem is for the believer, is that if I am a believer, then Christ has already paid the payment, and God would never exact double payment. It is done, it is finished, is paid in full, in no way does the Christian suffer punishment, that is payment for sin. He is, however, disciplined by God. Mark this, the difference between the punishment of God to the unbeliever and the discipline of God to the believer, get this, is not, the difference is not seen so much in the nature of the pain. The Christian might suffer pain just as much as a non-Christian. The difference is not in the nature of the pain. The difference between punishment and discipline is the purpose of the pain. Get this. In punishment that God meets out to unbelievers, God is playing the role of the judge. You got it? In discipline that God meets out to believers, discipline, he is the father, not the judge. Totally different relationship. In punishment, the object of his impunity, the object of his action is his enemy. And the goal of his punishment upon his enemy is just that. It is retribution and it is condemnation. In discipline of the believer, the object of his discipline is his son, totally opposite of his enemy. The object of his discipline is his son. And the purpose or the goal of his discipline is not retribution and condemnation. But exactly the opposite. It is holiness and righteousness. Maturity. Godliness. Verse 10. For our good that we may share his holiness. Verse 11. The peaceful fruit of righteousness. Today some important teaching. God's discipline I'm going to break it down into three areas as we go into a deeper definition of the word and basically the way I've broken this down into three areas is not so much broken down from the text but it's broken down from a good strong study of the word discipline and what it means and then we're going to fit the text into that you're going to understand that as I go but I want to give you three basic purposes God's discipline has three basic purposes in the life of the believer as revealed by our study. And I just trust that as we go through this, it's going to deepen you in terms of your ability to grasp some of the things that God, even this very moment, may be doing in your lives. I'm going to give you the three right now. God will bear His discipline in my life. Again, it is not punishment. He will bear His discipline in my life, first of all, for correction, for correction. Secondly, for prevention, prevention, and thirdly, for education. Let's get to it right now. First of all, God will discipline me and his aim will be correction. Again, I want you to note something that his discipline in this particular area is not redemptive. Redemptive simply means to pay the price. Every once in a while, I hear somebody say something like this. Sometimes we're halfway kidding and sometimes I wonder if it's really part of our thinking. All of a sudden, some things begin to blow up in our lives and immediately we think, oh, I must have done something wrong. I'm really paying for that fun I had two weeks ago. I'm really paying for it. Okay, I understand what we're saying, but I think we need to firm up our thinking a little bit. God will bear discipline on the life of a believer. It is not in payment for, but he will do it to correct, and I want to add this, it will be painful. For the believer who persists in his sin, whether that sin be an activity or an attitude that he is harboring, the correction, the corrective discipline of God will be borne upon his life. And I'm going to say something I don't say very often, but it's this, I guarantee it. How can you do that? Well, verse 6 says this, those he loves, he disciplines, and he scourges every son whom he receives. That statement right there is what we call an exclusive, inclusive statement. It is an exclusive statement, meaning this. He disciplines exclusively those who are his sons. Okay? He doesn't discipline non-believers. He will mete out punishment to them, but exclusively he disciplines everyone who is his son. But you know what? It's also an inclusive statement. It means this. Everyone who is his son will receive the discipline of God. I tell you, there's a couple warnings in there. We could just go on and on with this kind of thing. But one of the warnings is this. If you are living a life that is consistently characterized by consistent sin over and over and over again, and you and your spirit never do sense the discipline of God, if you're able to just go your merry way, feel no pull from the Holy Spirit, hey, this is no sweat, and you're living in absolute opposition to the Word of God, I've got some news for you. If you are able to do that with tremendous freedom, you are not his son. He will correct. You ever think of this? Every once in a while I hear someone say and I even think this sometimes I think you know it's really something sometimes the most sour bitter unhappy people I know are Christians and one of the things I kind of draw from that is the fact that it just makes it look like Christianity doesn't work. You know? Christianity is supposed to be joyful and fun and free and happy, and the joy of the Lord is our strength. Isn't that great? I want to tell you something. In light of this particular thing, that God's promise is this, that if as a believer you decide to live in sin, you will be corrected with discipline from God. I wonder if the fact that some Christians are so unhappy and bitter and just wrapped up in themselves and aren't able to give it all is an evidence not that Christianity doesn't work, but that in fact it does. because the Spirit of God living in you if you decide to live a sinful life away from the fellowship of God if you're his son he will not leave you alone and a Christian who is living a sinful life outside of the will of God I want to tell you something it is the most miserable life of all everyone who is his son will receive the discipline of the Lord in a corrective way classic example real quickly is David you know the story he took Bathsheba to himself that was an adulterous thing not only that he arranged the death of Bathsheba's wife husband that was murder not only that after he did that whole thing he spent an awful lot of time and energy hiding everything he did that was guile mark this God moved against David with corrective discipline first he lost his child maybe the greatest dimension of David's pain was that internal pain the torment of his own heart my sin is ever before me he says in the psalms psalm 32 he says this as a result of his sin that he did not confess my body is wasting away God your hand is heavy upon me my vitality is drained away as with the fever heat of summer have you ever felt like that? because of something you know in your heart and in your mind you did that was absolutely outside of the will of God finally Nathan came to David and he confronted David in a public way can you think of anything harder than that than to be confronted publicly he pointed his finger at David and said David thou art the man painful embarrassing ultimate confrontation and I want to tell you something else David was going through a cycle of pain because of his sin that was the corrective discipline of God He wasn't paying for what he did. God was coming to him and saying, David, you need to come back, and I'm going to inflict upon your life and your heart, and I'm going to drain from you the life of your living. Whatever it takes to bring you back. And if, I believe, and if after Nathan had pointed his finger at David and said, Thou art the man, he would have still denied it. I believe that discipline would have continued, and you know what? It would have gotten worse. it would have gotten worse 1 Corinthians chapter 11 talks about the carnality of that Corinthian church the jealousy and the strife they had forgotten what it meant to be part of the body and in 1 Corinthians 11 it says some among you are sick and some among you sleep that means some among you have died Dave do you believe that God's corrective discipline goes as far as death? Absolutely. Verse 9 even speaks of this. Verse 9, How much we respected them, shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits and live? I want to tell you something. The pattern goes like this. Number one, if you are His Son and you decide to live outside the will of God, I guarantee you will be disciplined. If no discipline is being born upon your life and you're just footloose and fancy free and nothing feels nothing, then you're not a son. The other thing I want you to know and know this for sure is this, that God's discipline born upon you is not to punish you and get you to pay for what you did. Its purpose is to redirect you, to correct you, and to change your course. My question to us this morning is this, how much pain does it take to redirect you? That's a toughie. how much pain does it take before the spirit of God can get you into that position of obedience Jeff Van Vonderen in his counseling ministry introduced us to a term called hitting bottom you know that? hitting bottom he uses that with alcoholics and things like that but basically it works with any relationship any form of disobedience or behavior that isn't building hitting bottom is when I've had enough it's when I just I can't take it anymore and I'm not going to pretend anymore and I'm going to say I'm a sick person, I am messed up, I have sinned, I've hit bottom. The pain born upon me, I can't take anymore so I'm going to do something. You know what the problem is though in this concept of hitting bottom, as he says so well? It's this, some of us have bottoms that are lower than others. Usually that gets a laugh, you know, you do it better. What that means is this, some of you need more pain before you respond. Some of you need more discipline before you finally say, yes, Lord, I know what you're dealing with me about. You've been dealing with me about this for five years. And I will not give up, and I will not give in, and I will not let it go. And I'll tell you something, God's going to discipline and discipline, and it's going to get worse before it gets better. Good news. Psalm 89. I want you to turn to it. I want you to see it with your eyes. Psalm 39. I'm sorry, Psalm 89. Psalm 89 verse 30 speaks very clearly to this. If his sons forsake my law and do not walk in my judgments, if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments, I want you to notice something. He is speaking to sons. Okay? Parts of the family. If my sons do this, here's the promise. then I will visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes. I will discipline them. I will come to them. But, verse 33, I will not break off my loving kindness from him, nor will I deal falsely in my faithfulness. God is saying here, he is not saying, I'm going to come to you and you're going to pay for that. That isn't it at all. You couldn't pay for it anyway. But I will come to you and give you what you need, and however much you need to bring you back correctively into the path you need to follow. The first dimension of his discipline that we need to know is that God comes upon the life of the believer in a corrective way. And the more we resist it, the more his correction, the more severe his correction will be. I think it was Pink who said, I was reading this week, I hate to do this when I don't have it written down, but he said we need more to respond right away to his taps. And if we would respond to his taps, we wouldn't receive his raps. There are some of us, and some of you, who could be sitting in a church service, and maybe an attitude just got out of kilter, and you hear a song, or you hear a Bible verse, or some dimension of the sermon, and man, the Spirit of God will just begin to tug you and grip you, and you'll say, ah, you know, it doesn't belong. I need to give this back to the Lord. I need to ask forgiveness. I need to let this go. And just with a little tug, just with a little conviction of the Spirit, things are made right. Brothers of us, hold on and hold on, and that discipline can become severe. The second dimension of this discipline that he brings to the life of the believer that these people needed to know was that sometimes the discipline of God is a preventative thing, and it has nothing at all to do with the fact that you have sin in your life. Would you please remember that? That would be a dangerous, terribly dangerous thing for us to just decide that every time I have trouble, or every time my friend has trouble, or something invading his life that doesn't quite seem to fit the pattern, that they must have done something wrong. That doesn't fit the dimensions of God's discipline in the life of the believer. In fact, two-thirds of the time, that isn't the issue at all. It isn't sin at all. Sometimes it's prevention. You might think, well, what in the world? God disciplines me in a preventative way. I don't get it. Sometimes God bears things upon your life not to turn you from sin, but to keep you from sin. Sometimes even as a father, there are things I do. I put restrictions on my children, not because they've done anything wrong, but because I want to keep them from doing certain things. The best example is 2 Corinthians chapter 12, and I want you to turn to that too. I want you to see it with your eyes. 2 Corinthians chapter 12, verse 7. Do you know that God disciplined the apostle Paul not because of sin that he had, but because he wanted to keep him from some sin that was a terrible potential for him. Paul, believe it or not, had a real problem with pride. Let's look at verse 7. And because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations that I have for this reason to keep me from exalting myself, to keep me from pride, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh. Now what was a thorn in the flesh? I don't want to go into that again. Some people think it was, I read something today, this week, that it was a blindness in one of the eyes. Some other people think it was a hearing problem. Some people think it was some sort of physical thing. Other people think it had nothing to do with a physical problem, but rather the fact that he was constantly being harassed by other Christians. And he was never free from that. He had problems with self-doubt and things like that. You know what? It doesn't matter. What matters is that God disciplined him for a preventative measure. Pride could have destroyed his ministry. God gave him something to keep him from that. There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me or discipline me to keep me from exalting myself. Paul prayed three times for that to go away, and finally he got the message. I'm going to use this in your life to keep you fiercely coming after me.
