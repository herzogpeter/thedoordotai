Open your Bibles with me to the book of James, the third chapter, picking our study up this morning in the second verse through verse 12. We are going to take two weeks on this particular section, the taming of the tongue. Won't that be fun? A murmur went through this whole place. Wow. A few Sundays ago, the beginning of December, David Busby began a series of talks among us that he's been continuing on Wednesday nights through January entitled, Oh Taste and See that the Lord is Good. And he began it with this premise, that one of the reasons people who have even heard a lot about, and even seem to know a lot about Amazing Grace, often don't find Amazing Grace all that amazing, is because they have never taken a good, hard, honest look at their own depravity. They have never deeply inhaled, never completely acknowledged or even at all acknowledged what he referred to as the stench of their cesspool of sin. Because when we do get a whiff of it, as it were, when we do acknowledge our sin and see our depravity, when our denial is destroyed and our blaming is obliterated, and it really dawns on us that that really is my cesspool. It's not yours. It's my stuff I'm smelling. When that happens, grace suddenly looks really good. Grace suddenly looks like what it really is, our only hope. And people who have had that interchange of seeing deeply their own sin and then seeing wonderfully amazing grace come up amazingly grateful for grace. Well, as we come to our study this morning in this particular section, dealing with the issues of the tongue, prepare yourself to get a whiff of your inner cesspool. You're going to have to deal with it for 40 minutes as I talk. I've had to do it all week long as I've studied. Not entirely present, but let me encourage you to do something that every instinct of your humanity is going to want to do. Resist the temptation to run from this. to deny it and allow yourself rather to hear it and see it and maybe even, if you can stand it, to smell it just a little bit. It all begins in verse 2 with this acknowledgement from James when he says this, For we all stumble in many ways. As if to say, for we all sin, we all have an inner cesspool, as it were. And then he goes on to say that among the ingredients that all of us have in our cesspool, are sins of the tongue. Indeed, in verse 2, if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man. As soon as I hear that, what dawns on me is this, but nobody's perfect. That's absolutely right. Verse 8 confirms that with this. Here's why we're not perfect, because no one can tame the tongue. If anything else, it seems to me that verse is saying, anything after the taming of the tongue would be kind of easy. But nobody's perfect because no one can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, verse 8, full of deadly poison. As we begin to deal with this section entitled, as I've already said, the taming of the tongue, we would, I believe, do well to start with this acknowledgement. Let's just kind of all put our dukes down and just start with this acknowledgement. None of us have tamed our tongue. None of us. All of us in this room stand in similar need of repentance and forgiveness and grace for the things that we have set afire by the words that we have said. I'm going to encourage you. I can't make you do this, but I want to encourage you over the next couple of weeks to resist the powerful temptation of hoping Harry hears this, of spending my whole sermon scanning the audience, wondering if Harry's here, I'll buy a tape. The sermon's not for Harry. In fact, as I preach this sermon, the work I have to do is this sermon's not for you. It's not for my wife. It's not for my kids. They need to do their work. For I have a restless, my tongue is a restless evil and my tongue is full of deadly potential. With that in mind, let's pray together. Lord, help us better. Lord, help me. Hear this. Break by your spirit with relentless truth our denials, my denials, our defenses, my defenses. Give gifts, Father, of true repentance, forgiveness and grace, wherever that is necessary. In Jesus' name, amen. The first sin after the fall was a sin of the tongue. God came to Adam and in effect said, Adam, what have you done? Why did you do it? And Adam's first response was this. The woman that you gave me. And he blamed God. It's your fault, God. Well, everybody knows that that's not true. That is a lie. I don't think in Adam's defense of himself and blaming of God, he was trying to slander God. But when he lied about God, that's exactly what he did. That's a slander on God. Now, if at that moment God would have confronted him about that dimension of his sin, I think Adam would have said what we often do when we slander and don't know we do it, because that's one of the nature, the dynamics of slander is that sometimes we do it and don't know it. he would have said, I didn't mean to, and he didn't mean to, but he did. First sin after the fall was the sin of the tongue. The Apostle Paul in Romans 3.13 identifies the focal point of our depravity as sins of the tongue. He says this, our throat is like an open grave. With our tongues we keep deceiving. The poison of asps is in our mouth. Isaiah chapter 6 verse 5. You know the story well. Isaiah has this incredible encounter with the living God. He sees him in all of his holiness. Isaiah the prophet, the great truth speaker of God, has this response in seeing the holiness of God. He says this, I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips. An interesting reaction, first reaction, to seeing fully the holiness of God, an awareness of his unclean mouth. Think with me about Isaiah's unclean mouth for a minute. What do you think that was about? Do you think he was swearing a lot? Do you think he was using a lot of bad maybe? I don't think so. I think it was deeper than that, more subtle than that. Do you think people around Isaiah, when he said, I'm a man of unclean lips, everybody sighed a sigh of relief. They said, phew, I'm glad you finally get it. We're always hearing your dirty mouth go off all the time. I don't think they thought that. I think they would have been surprised to hear Isaiah say of himself, I got an unclean mouth. I think God revealed something deeper about the half-truth, the protection of himself, the selective truth, the fear of not saying all the truth. And it came around his lips. The Word of God speaks repeatedly of the damage that is done by the sin of the tongue. The Word of God over and over again speaks of a wicked tongue. It speaks of a lying tongue. It speaks of a deceitful tongue, a perverse tongue, a bitter tongue, an angry tongue, a crafty tongue, a slanderous tongue, a flattering tongue, gossiping tongue, a blaspheming tongue, a foolish tongue, a boasting tongue, a murmuring tongue, a contentious tongue, a tail-bearing tongue, a vile tongue, a whispering tongue, and on and on and on. The easiest way to sin is with the tongue. Because I can say anything. Think about that for a minute. I can say anything. Now, I may want to punch you. Now, all three services I did, and I'm doing it again. I don't want to make eye contact when I say that. I may want to punch you. I don't want to punch you. I don't want to punch anybody. But close my eyes. in my spirit, I'm really mad at somebody, I may want to punch you, but I'm probably not going to. A number of reasons. You might punch me back. That's probably the biggest, and you might hit harder than I do, but it's probably more than that. I'm not even thinking that far ahead. It's just not very classy, and I'm a little more sophisticated than that. I'm not going to get down into that. I mean, I haven't been in a fight like that since weeks. It's been a long time. And you'll get down to that level. You got pretty low. And you all know that. So instincts. You say, I'm not going to punch you. But I could shred you with my mouth. And I could nail you with my mouth and still be legal. Nobody's going to arrest me for the words I might say. Nobody's going to charge me with abuse. Well, maybe verbal abuse. But that doesn't get you arrested. Physical abuse does not verbal. I could shred you with my mouth and I might do it. I might even shred you with my mouth. If I'm really good, I'll do it calmly. If I'm really good, I'll shred you with my mouth with a smile on my face. If I'm really good, I'll shred you with my mouth at a distance. Word of God talks about words being like a knife. Word of God also speaks of the word of God, of words being like an arrow. The arrow imagery is interesting because an arrow can nail somebody at a distance. You could get hit by an arrow and the guy who shot it, they've already shot the arrow. They turn around. You don't even know what hit you. I could shred you with a smile on my face. Psalm 55 verse 21 says this. His speech was smoother than butter, but his heart was war. Have you ever heard from somebody like that whose speech was smooth? His speech, his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords. What a picture that is. Softer than oil. Smile, calm voice. Words that were a sword. Smile on your face. What that's called, psychologists call that dynamic passive-aggressive. You know, Psalms doesn't call it, and he was passive aggressive, much, much more graphic. I'm like passive aggressive. I've never known what that means. I get Psalm 51, 21, 55, 21. Psychologists call that passive aggressive. They look calm on the outside, but they're very aggressive. The Bible calls that sin. Its power is in its stealth. You can't pin it down. You don't know for sure if you even got slimed or not. If you try to confront it, oh, no, you misunderstand. I was just joking. I didn't mean that. How could you think that of me? Da da da da da. It's almost easier to deal with somebody who's outside verbally shooting at me than someone who's smiling at me and ripping me to shreds. The point is this. The tongue has incredible capacity to do damage without showing up. People skilled at physical torture devise and study ways to inflict pain invisibly. No bruises, no cuts, no welts, just lots of pain. Sins of the tongue have that effect. Picture it this way. Much like a physically stronger person has an advantage over a smaller person, and much like we would want to come to the aid of a smaller person in a physical fight, because it's not fair, there are verbally stronger people. And sometimes they're even physically small. They can't do the physical damage, so they back off and they learn how to use the tongue. Who never throw a punch. But instill with their words in their families, in their workplaces, in their churches, possibly wherever. They can instill with their words great fear. People walking on eggshells around them. You know what I'm talking about. You've been around them. Maybe you've done that kind of thing. we can do grave damage with our tongue someone once said that we should take a hint about the tongue and the damage it can do simply by noticing how it is that God has put it in the body God put my tongue in my mouth and he surrounded it he put cheeks around it and he put lips in front of it and then after the cheeks and the lips he barricaded it behind bars of teeth like this but isn't it amazing even behind my teeth, my tongue just keeps on going and lagging away. You know, yesterday, last night, after the service last night, a woman came up to me and told me how she broke her jaw or had some sort of surgery on her jaw, and her jaw had to get wired. And she said, my husband found out that even with my wire jaw, I can still get that job done. Even behind the bars, you know, I can do it. Why? Because my tongue is restless. It continually, there's an obsession almost. It needs, I need to use my tongue. It's ready to protect myself. It's ready to promote myself. It's ready to make sure you get the right impression. It just wags away. Because that's true, David in Psalm 39 verse 1 said this, I will guard my ways that I may not sin with my mouth. I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle. A muzzle. I mean, a muzzle is what you put on a dog, so it can't do what it's prone to do, and that is to bite, so I'm going to put a muzzle on my mouth. Okay. I don't know how that strikes you, but one of the things that strikes me about that is that he would say that, and it certainly means that there needs to be restraint on our mouth, but also the second thing that affected me about that was this. That doesn't sound very free. You know, a muzzle is what's stopping you. He's saying, you know, I hope my heart stops me. I hope wisdom stops me. But if that doesn't stop me, I'm going to muzzle my mind. I'm going to put a hand on. Just be quiet this time. I don't do that very well. I'm a talker. It's hard to believe. But I sometimes say things before I think. And damage is done. Proverbs 10, 19 says this. He who restrains his lips is the wise one. He who restrains his lips is wise. Now, you know, we can hear that on a Sunday morning and nod our head and think, oh, that's wise. That's a good thing. But stick that word from God into our culture. In a culture that holds as an inalienable right. freedom of speech freedom more than speech of expression saying whatever I want to say whenever I want to say it a word that comes to that culture saying he restrains his lips as wise strikes a dissonant chord because I can say whatever I want whenever I want to whoever I want wherever I want you got to remember this when you were a kid playing on the playground and somebody swears or somebody calls somebody a bad name and everybody turns around you can't say that you shouldn't say that and then we say what well it's a what it's a free country and that just seems to settle it doesn't it okay okay swear away say mean things away well here's the deal you have that right to say whatever you say, wherever you want to say it, to whoever you want to say it, you have that right. You are a fool. For he who restrains his lips is wise. Take it out of the big world context of the culture, bring it into the church, in a kingdom context, where we have as a core value, not just our church, but the church, Matthew 5, 4 being a core value where it says, Blessed are those who mourn. We found out in our church that mourning means not just walking around being sad, but the Greek word penthos means to get out here what's going on in here. Hold that as a core value, a high value. Blessed are those who get out here everything that's going on in here for people who see that as a high value to now hear restrain. He who restrains everything coming out here, He who restrains that is wise. It sounds like a dissonant chord. Here's the deal. That is not a dissonant chord. That is a harmony note. That is a counterbalance. That is wise. Hear them together. Get out here. Everything that's going on in here, but he who restrains his lips is wise means get it all out into the light. Get everything out into the light. But do it with the right people, in the right context, with the right boundaries. But there's a problem with the right context, right people, right boundaries. And that is this. The tongue is restless. The tongue hardly ever wants to wait. We have a very hard time holding things. We. Me. and we don't know much about boundaries and we don't even think sometimes about context yeah that's a true thing but that true thing in that place is inappropriate don't just say it, it's true and more often than not the person we have the issue with who by the way, remember I said say to the right person, the right person is the person you have the issue with. More often than not, the person we have the issue with, who is the right person, is the last person to know that we have an issue with them. They're the last person to know what that issue is. And by the way, every one of us have been on the receiving end of this, and every one of us, I think, have been on the delivery end of this. For someone who had an issue with us, rather than coming to us does their work with 15 other people first. You know what I think is okay? You know what I think is valid? You got an issue with a friend. You got an issue with a co-worker. Whatever it is. Your child. Whatever. To have an objective friend who can give you what I call a sanity check. Am I crazy? Is this worth talking about with this? And I think that's appropriate. When you've gone past that to share it with a circle of people, you're not getting a sanity check anymore. You're getting sides. The right person, the right context, the right boundaries, we know very little about that. The tongue is a fire. The very world of iniquity, the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body sets on fire the course of our life it's set on fire by hell. With all of that as kind of an introduction that's why we're going to take a couple weeks on this. Come with me now to the text and marvel at the power of the tongue to do among other things three things. First of all, marvel at the power of the tongue to control the direction of your life. Verses 3 and 4. Now if we put the bits into the horse's mouth so that they may obey us, we direct their entire body as well with a tiny little bit. Behold, the ships also, though they are so great, are driven by strong winds, they're still directed, even though the winds are strong, they're still directed by a very small rudder, wherever the inclination of the pilot desires. Second thing I want to talk about and marvel at is the power of the tongue to damage people. We'll see that in verse 5 and 6. So also the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it boasts of great things. Behold how great a forest is set aflame by a single small spark. I've already read verse 6. The tongue is a fire and I'm not going to read that again. The third thing we're going to deal with next time, not next week, but the week after, is to marvel at the power of the tongue to then reveal our cesspool or reveal what it is that's driving our loose tongue. We'll see that in verses 9 through 12. let's look first at the power of the tongue and marvel at the power of the tongue to direct and influence the course of our life verse 3 and 4 to illustrate his point he uses this bit and this rudder the bit in a horse's mouth the rudder on the back end of a ship the point of it is this that something very small something very subtle and something seemingly insignificant has a very large effect think of the rudder on a ship The small rudder, big ship, the slightest movement of the rudder has the power to move that ship either into safety or a slight movement of the rudder a different direction can move that ship into disaster. Doesn't take a big movement. Most of us have an idea of slander being a great big bold thing and when we move in it subtly and in small ways, a tiny little wag of the tongue, we don't see ourselves as participating in something that's going to do great damage. The whole point of this text is that most of the things that start the forest fire are tiny little things you think are insignificant. A bit in a horse's mouth allows a nine-year-old child to ride a massive animal relative to their size. For that little four-inch bit determines its direction, right or left, straight or back, stop or go. Verse 5 at the beginning. So also the tongue. Though it is a small part of the body. Boasts great effects. Verse 6 in the middle. The tongue sets on fire. Or sets into motion the course of our life. It sets into motion the course of my life. If I'm a talker. And I am. And it sets into motion the course of someone else's life. The person of whom I'm talking about. Slandering. And I've been on the receiving end of that, and so have you. So we play both parts, all of us do, of doing it and having it done to us. But it sets in motion the course of people's lives. It works like this. The tongue moves. A tidbit is shared. A half-truth, a selective truth. What you said was absolutely true, but you kind of left this piece out. I remember when I was a teenager. I'm going bowling, Dad. I come back. Where'd you go? Bowling? that's selective truth I did go bowling I didn't tell you where I did it I also went after that where I wasn't so you share your little tidbit you share your little truth your little half truth your little piece of it and it's about somebody else this time and the person hearing it says something is that true? well Harry says it is we're picking on Harry today and then you have a decision to make you heard this little piece of information about somebody else that Harry says is true and the decision you have to make is whether I believe it or not let's say you believe it stop right there here's the question why? when we believe that little tidbit that we just heard about somebody why do we believe it? well Proverbs 26, 22 tells us why we are prone to believe it because the words of a whisperer are like a dainty morsel. Can't relate to that, can you? The fact is this. The dainty morsel, the little tidbit of information you got about somebody else, the bad report tastes good. And the fact is, we can try to dance around this and say it's Harry who does this, but a bad report is often received by us with delight. If you doubt that, go look at your supermarket and you may not buy them, but tabloids would not have anybody buying them if there was not delight in a bad report in the hearts of people in general. It's part of our cesspool. But there's a problem with taking in that dainty morsel. And the problem is in the second part of Proverbs 26, 22. For that morsel, that rumor, that little tidbit, it says in the verse, goes down into the innermost parts of your body. Now, that's an interesting analogy. He's talking about a morsel, comparing it to a rumor, and you swallow it, and now the morsel goes into your body, and there it's being, this is kind of disgusting, but it's being digested now. Oh, I don't want to go there. Yes, I do. Becoming exactly what it is. as it's digested. Tasted good. Now it becomes what it actually is. Now, I think the real point of that, it goes into the lower parts of your body. What I think that really means is that little morsel, that little rumor, that little tidbit that tasted really good becomes part of you. Becomes part of how you think. Part of what you believe. Say it this way. Down there, after you've tasted the morsel, it tasted really good, now you've swallowed it. Now that rumor becomes what you believe is a fact. A strongly held opinion. Now that it's there, a strongly held opinion, I've got it figured out even though I only heard this one little piece. And at that point we often make another mistake. And it's all part of this fire spreading. The other mistake we make is at that point we often share that little morsel as if it were a fact. Because to us it's become a fact. And now we share it as if it's a fact to someone else. In fact, if it's a particularly juicy morsel, we share it with anyone who will listen. Why do we do that? Well, that's the question in two weeks I want to address. Again, because I think if we don't talk a little bit about what drives us to wag our tongues and receive these juicy morsels, then we are doomed to do it over and over and over again. We'll say we're sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry and never stop if we don't understand the why. I want to get into some of the deeper dimensions of that in a couple of weeks but now let me just answer that question this way. Here's why you receive it and then pass it on. Because we have no rudder. Because we have no muzzle. We have no bit in our mouth. We have no restraint. We don't know much about boundaries. We don't know much about context. We don't know much about talking to the right person relative to the issue we have. And because we don't have restraints, the course of a life is set in motion. The course of your life as a talker and the course of someone else's life about whom you're speaking. Impressions are made. Opinions are formed. Judgments are finalized. The damage is done. now that leads me to the second thing I want to marvel at I want to marvel at the power of the tongue to damage people it's about nine years ago a story exploded in the national press about a Christian singer performer who had a tremendous effect in the church but even broader than the church, his influence was broader than that Andre Crouch was arrested one day, I think in California, and the charge was possession of cocaine. Some of you might even remember that. It was about nine years ago. The truth is this, that days after that, like a day later, what they spread all over the country about cocaine possession in Andre Crouch's car Turned out to be the residue of some baking soda stuff that his wife had had in their back seat with a potluck dinner she had been going to the day before. And this white substance declared to be cocaine was baking soda. He was absolutely innocent. The problem is this. Impressions were made. Opinions were formed. Judgments were finalized and the damage was done. The retraction, just a couple days later, was in the paper. It was in all the papers. Guess where it was? You know where it was. It was buried in an obituary somewhere, right in the middle. Andre Crouch didn't have cocaine. I don't know if that incident is the only reason, but the truth is this incredibly influential person in the kingdom of God and even in the culture for the kingdom of God disappeared for about nine years. Now, I'm really happy to say, it's interesting, I was talking to Mark Johnson about this, That Andre Crouch is up for a Grammy right now for an album that he's a Christian album that he just came out with. But it's been nine years. Impressions get formed. Opinions get made. Judgments are finalized and the damage is done. Let's say something else. Ultimately, when we're talking about the damage that is done by our restless tongues, while damage is done to other people, ultimately, if I have a restless tongue, and I do, and so do you, The restlessness of our tongue that needs to speak and that needs to believe the morsel and pass it on to somebody else. Does damage to somebody else but ultimately does damage right back to me. For while the arrows of half truth and selective truth and slander do hurt people. Psalm 64 7 says God shoots back arrows of his own. And suddenly, verse 7, they will be wounded. Who is they? The ones who shoot the arrows. Their own tongue is against them, and all who see them will shake their head. It is interesting that James uses the analogy of a fire to try to illustrate the damage that the tongue can do. Think about it this way. If I was driving by my car and I carelessly, without any regard for anybody else's feelings or the damage it might do, throw out of my car window a glass of water, I don't care. That water has no potential of becoming a flood. It's not going to happen. It's growing. No, it's just evaporating. He didn't choose water. He chose fire on purpose. The nature of the fire is that a very tiny little thing can spread and spread and spread. It is in the nature of the fire that the sins of the tongue are revealed. Think about fire in appropriate boundaries. I was talking about needing to have restraint a little bit ago. Needing the right context, talking to the right people, having appropriate boundaries around my tongue. Think about fire in boundaries. There's fire in my home. It cooks my food. It keeps my house warm. I'm very grateful for that when it's 20 below. I don't do this every day, but I probably ought to go around my furnace and say, I'm thanking you for your fire. Stay in my furnace. Oh, please, oh, please, don't leave. Stay right there in my furnace. That fire is very helpful to me. It's necessary to me and to you, but it has to stay in its boundaries. And it doesn't take a big explosion to ruin my house. All it would take is a spark to ruin my house. An explosion would just do it quicker. And it's really fun to sit around a campfire, and it's warm, and it's gooey, and it's romantic, and it's great, as long as that fire stays in the rocks, the circle of rocks. And it doesn't take a big explosion to ruin the forest. All it takes is one little spark. Set free from the restraints. Even a small spark brings down the forest. And by the time the blaze is out of control, the person who lit the match, the person who drove by and threw the match out the window, by the time the blaze is going, the person who threw the matchup will make no connection with his little tiny word and the destruction that's going on right now in the organization or in the family. It wouldn't make, because it's so big. I mean, I literally picture this. A guy on his vacation driving through a forest or through whatever, and he just carelessly throws a cigarette out the window, drives on, forgets all about it. Five hours later, he's exhausted in his motel room, just resting. He's watching the news about this terrible fire, and he didn't see it. It was right where he drove, And he wouldn't make any connection with the little tiny thing he did. And he'd be all indignant. Oh, some careless camper probably. Oh, he'd say, arrest that guy. It's you. See? False report, a half-truth, selected truth, a juicy rumor, can ruin a reputation, destroy a marriage, cripple a church. Top it all off with this. This is, again, the nature of the fire. And that which a fire burns cannot be unburnt. It's another reason I think James chose this analogy. That which a fire burns can't be unburnt. Can it be forgiven? Yes. Can it be undone? No. Can it be reborn and regrown? Yes. But when the sins of the tongue are released in a marriage, in a relationship, in a church, in a workplace, in a family, on the mission field, in a Christian college. When sins of the tongue are released, the damage is done. And you know what? It takes time to regrow. It takes time. Forgiveness, yes. Grace, time. It still takes time. story is told of a vicar in the church of England many years ago visited by a man the man came into his office and said this three years ago I left your church angry over a decision you made and for three years I shared with anyone who would listen bad things about you recently I was made aware of what it was I was doing. I came up repentant. And I have come to you to say this to you. I am so sorry. Would you please forgive me? Well, the fact is, this priest, this vicar, had known about this because word was coming back to him from people this person was speaking with. And so it was that this was a tremendous relief to him. And with tears in his eyes, the vicar said, Yes, I do forgive you, but do one thing for me by way of restitution. And the man, a little surprised, said, fine. Go and get a large feather pillow and return to my office with that pillow. Wondering what in the world this could do with restitution, he said, fine, got it, came back, entered the office. They went then up into the bell tower of this historic old church. When they got up there, the vicar pulled out a scissors or a knife, split open that feather pillow. A gust of wind came and carried all the feathers all over the countryside. They waited and waited and waited for all of the feathers to be distributed. And some of them, it took a very long time for them to land. And then they did. And out of sight, when they all were, the vicar turned to this man and said, Now, please do just one thing. Go and pick up all those feathers. A look of despair obviously came on his face, and he said to the vicar, I can't. I know, said the vicar. And now you know too. And now you even have a little bit of a picture of what it is you're even saying you're sorry for. We say we're sorry really quick. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Wait a minute. Just stop a minute and let it in. And by the way, we could never let it in. We could never feel the weight. We could never smell the cesspool if it wasn't for amazing grace. But there is amazing grace. And there can be things rebuilt. There are things. But you not only spread this, but for all the people you said it to, They repeated it and they repeated it. And I want you to know even in the light of that, I really do forgive you. Morgan Blake, a writer for the Atlanta Journal, said it this way. I am more deadly than a screaming shell of a howitzer. I win without killing. I tear down homes. I break hearts. I wreck lives. I travel on the wings of the wind. No innocence is strong enough to stop me. No purity can daunt me. I have no regard for truth. I love half-truth. No respect for justice, no mercy for the defenseless. My victims are as numberless, are as numerous as the sands of the sea, and often as innocent. I never forget, I seldom forgive. My name is gossip, slander, rumor. Behold how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire. The tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity, but no one can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil full of deadly poison. Let me wrap this up this morning with some advice, some helpful hints for putting out the fire. Number one, have the moral courage when the fire comes to you that's been spreading to throw a glass of cold water on it. Have the moral courage to be a wet blanket. Now, if it's just a spark and it just started, that glass of water is going to be very effectual. It could put it out right now. Boom. If the fire is blazing out of control, your little glass of water isn't going to, in fact, it's going to evaporate. Do it anyway. Have the moral courage to be a wet blanket when the fire of innuendo and false is spreading. Have you ever done that? Have you ever had it done to you? I've had it done. I hate that. sitting in, and I'm doing it. Let's say I'm doing it, and I start to share this little thing out of my hurt or my neediness or something to somehow make somebody else look smile. It's true. It's true. That's what we all say. Well, it's true. And I say it, and we've been having a nice night, and then the person comes back and says, you know, have you talked to them about that? Have you dealt with that? Well, no. You know what? I'm mad at them. They just put a wet blanket. It spoiled the party. it's my best friend who does that it's your best friend who does that I've done that too and so you maybe have been a wet black I have too from time to time and this is not have you ever been at that point in the evening where that thing begins to happen you had a great time you went out for dinner you went to a movie now you're out for dessert and right around dessert you're about to get a great time and this little thing starts to slimy in there it's a morsel it tastes really good but you know you've tasted morsels enough to know in a couple hours this morsel's going to taste really bad. And so you put the time out in. It took a lot of courage. Have the moral courage to be a wet blanket, to spoil the party, even to risk the fact that you might not be invited back to the party. Number two, be slow to believe a bad report. Again, next time, not next week, but the next week, I want to talk about why it is we are so prone to believe a bad report. again I think that's important to get into the why of it but here's the advice be slow put a muzzle not only on your mouth put a muzzle on your heart and on your mind and what you choose to believe number three be wise enough to know that someone else's fire someone else's issue someone else's hurt feeling can set you on fire I think that's really helpful because that's exactly the analogy James is using. Somebody's fire, a spark, start something else, and it starts something else. Be very aware. Be on your guard. Be on your guard. Somebody else's fire can start your fire. I'm a very emotional person. I know it's hard to believe, but I am. And I respond to things emotionally. And people come up to me, and they're full of joy, and I start to feel their joy. Yeah, I get excited. If they get excited, I'm excited. If they're sad, I start to feel their sadness. If they're angry, immediately, without him, I start to feel their anger. I'm going to pick up their cause. And I have walked into things. So have you. So embarrassed. I'm all, I've decided about something. I'll even go to that person that I have no issue with at all. I'll go, did you, did you, no, they didn't. You did, you didn't. Okay. I'll spend three days building my case that I don't even have with them. I hate that about you. Grow up, all of you. Listen to what Proverbs says about this. It's amazing. Proverbs 26.1. Like one who takes a dog by the ears. Stop right there. What does that mean? Who takes a dog by the ears? You know that guy who takes a dog by the ears? An idiot. I don't know. It's an idiot. This idiotic person. Like one who takes a dog by the ears. Whatever it is, it's a bad thing. It's like stupid people do this. Like that is he who passes by and meddles with strife not belonging to him. Oh, boy. Here's even better or worse. Proverbs 26, 20. For lack of wood, the fire goes out. For lack of wood, the fire goes out. For where there is no whisperer, contentions quiet down. Be wise enough to know that someone else's fire can set you on fire. Then I'd kick it back. Have the moral courage to throw a glass of water on that. You're being their best friend. Be direct. Fourth, be direct. Have the issue with the person you have the issue with. Ephesians 4, 25. Speak the truth in love. each one to his neighbor. I've said this a million times in this pulpit, not to 15 other people first. Be direct, finally. And this just pulls us all together, I hope. Be honest. About all the times you've wounded your brother or sister because you didn't have the courage to be direct, and you dealt with 15 other people first. And you know what? I really do believe that sometimes a sanity check is important. And go to that confidential person or go to that safe person who maybe is a little bit separate from the city and go to them and get a sanity check. Am I nuts? Is this something that needs to be confronted? Go to that person. Do that. That's fine. But if you start getting into 10, 15 people, you're not doing your work anymore. You're getting people. You are inflaming other people and supporting you in your issue. And we'll gang up on this. Let's be honest about all the times we've done that. And if it wasn't for grace, who could look at that? Because we all do that. If you're not doing it right now, you have. And you'll be prone to do it some other time, especially if you're hurt or scared or feeling lousy about yourself. Those are some of the things that drive this. We'll talk about it in two weeks. Let's be honest about all the times that we have delighted in a tasty morsel. That in the truth, when the word came about somebody else's marriage or somebody else's problem, our response out here was, oh, man, oh, boy, oh, yeah, that's so bad. And you even felt a little bit of genuineness. But somewhere, somewhere in there, there was this thing that made you feel a little bit better about your marriage because their marriage isn't as good. And you thought yours, and they thought, there's this little delight. let's be honest about the times we've been very quick to believe a bad report and pass it on as fact when we didn't know and we were inflamed and were part of the fire rather than having the moral courage to put it out and then when you start to smell all that be very grateful for grace and let the grace in next time I want to marvel at the power of the tongue to reveal our cesspool, to reveal our core and our heart. In that, I want to discuss the way of slander because slander is often subtle. We don't always know we're doing it when we're doing it. I also want to discuss the why of slander, what drives our need to do it because as I've said, if we don't get to some of that, we'll just keep saying, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but keep on doing it unless we understand what's driving some of why we do that. I'd like you to stand with me as we close. Let's pray. Father, I thank you for the word. I thank you for the word that once again, through James, confronts us. It occurs to me that we could leave this morning, if we've really heard this, with some heaviness around this. And I pray that you would give us the strength to let it feel heavy for a little bit. I pray, Father, that you would remind us of amazing grace, that there's nothing beyond forgiveness, there's nothing beyond restoration and healing. Some things could take time. I pray, Father, that even the word that Dave Busby shared with us Wednesday about seeing Christ as the forgiver would be ever before us as we see some of these things rise up in us. But I pray, Father, that we would not duck. and that we would not run away and deny. But we really hear from you on this. Do the work we need to do. Protect our marriages. Protect our relationships or church, the work of God in the world from sins of the tongue. That starting with a spark can bring down the forest. I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
