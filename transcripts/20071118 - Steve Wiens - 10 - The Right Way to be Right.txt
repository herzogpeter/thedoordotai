It's good enough to be like Him Just to be like Him He's living not above the master But it's good enough to be like Him Just to be like Him Make us more to look like Jesus Hold us in His likeness To people like Him I'm following the footsteps of the teacher Learning how to walk with him How to walk with him Discipled in the way of the master Teaching us to live by him How to live like Him That's all we seek to know Make us more to look like Jesus Form us in His likeness To be more like Him Make us more to look like Jesus Before us in His likeness To be more like Him To act and think and speak Like our humble King Wise and gentle we will be To act and think and speak Like our humble King Jesus, for the sin is kindness, to people like him. Well, hey everybody, my name is Steve, and I was just thinking recently as I was preparing to do this that that was about 13 years ago when I first came to Open Door, and I sat up on the creaky bleachers over on the left side, and as I began to soak in the teachings, I wandered up to the bookstore up on the second floor of the Robbinsdale building, and I asked, if I was going to get a group of teachings that really represented what this church was about, like, what would I buy? And they said, oh, you need to check out the Beatitudes. And so they gave me the sleeve of like 100 tapes, and I listened to them. And as I heard the message, that blessed are the broken. Blessed are the ones that have come to the end of their rope and realized that we need someone bigger than ourselves to save us. Blessed are those who get out here, what is really in here. Blessed are those who are honest enough to be transparent about their sin, and about what hurts them. Blessed are those because they'll be comforted. Those teachings begin to be a part of me. And so it's just weird for me. It's a bit ironic and a blessing for me to be coming at a time when we're back in the Beatitudes. And I love that. So with that in mind, let's pray as we start. Jesus it's no small thing to say that all we seek to know is to be more like you that's no small thing and I pray that we would have the courage to actually do that to become like you actually are that we would strip everything else away so that we would begin to live our lives the way that you would live our life if you lived it. And I pray that that would be true about us as a church so that Maple Grove High School would be a better place. So that the people that work at Walmart and Rainbow would be blessed because we are becoming more like you. Amen? Well, about a year ago Dave started this series called The Way of the Rabbi. And at this pace, my six-month-old son Isaac will be somewhere in high school when we get done. Actually, I love that. But our basic assumption has been that Jesus was a Torah-observant Jew, that he wasn't a Christian. And that shocks us as we hear that, but it's true. And as a rabbi, he gathered disciples around him to teach them his way, his yoke, his way of living and thinking and relating in the kingdom of God. That he was acting as if the kingdom of God had come because he had come. And he proclaimed that the kingdom of God was available. And he wasn't talking about getting to heaven when you died. He was talking about a way of living under the rule and reign of God, right here and right now. And as we've looked at the way of the rabbi, we have learned that we've been invited into that same way of living, that we've been invited to be Talmudim, disciples of him, not to simply cheer for Jesus on the sidelines, but to join his mission of proclaiming and living out the kingdom of God right here, right now, in our homes, in our jobs, and in our neighborhoods, even in our church. We've been invited to live our lives the way that Jesus would live our life. if he was married to our spouse and if he lived on our block and if he went to our school. And we've learned that his specific rabbinic style of teaching was marked by questions and stories hidden with meaning and paradox and great reversal themes which actually disrupted, disturbed, and even subverted the conventional wisdom of his time. He was not a nice guy because nice guys don't get executed. He was executed because he actually taught a message and lived a life that was so radical that he disrupted the economic, political, and especially the religious systems of his day. And perhaps the best example of this kind of subversive teaching is found in the Sermon on the Mount, beginning with the Beatitudes. And so that's where we started. And he turns the current understanding of who the kingdom of God would come to and flow through completely upside down. And he begins by saying in Matthew 5, 3, blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. In a time when it was assumed that the kingdom of God would come to and flow through the religiously powerful who ran the temple and controlled the interpretations of the law, Jesus reverses the order, and he announces that the kingdom of God actually comes to the absolute lowest of the low, the tokos, the unemployed and unemployable, the beggars. That's who God comes to. They are included. And that was good news for some people. And it was bad news for others. And then Jesus went on to say, blessed are those who mourn, for they'll be comforted. And what I said earlier, what has become a common phrase around here, blessed are those who get out hear what is really going on in here. Blessed are those who mourn their sin and have the courage to fully feel their pain. And blessed are those who mourn in such a way that their hearts break, as we saw last week, so that their mourning turns to mission. Which brings us to Matthew 5, 5, the text for this week. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Now, when you think about the word meek, pictures and images and words come to mind. When I think about meek, I think about Phyllis from the TV show The Office. This is the picture of meek for me. You see, meek knits. And when Meek notices that his neighbor's dog has done his thing on his lawn again, Meek never says anything. Meek endures the loud, obnoxious, belching fan sitting behind him at the Vikings game that keeps kicking his chair, and he'll never do anything about it. Meek is the kind of person who, you know, when you eat Chipotle for lunch and you come out and you have a huge piece of lettuce stuck in between your teeth and you think, why didn't that person say anything? That's Meek that didn't say anything. When the wrong meal is delivered to Meek at a restaurant, even if it's something that Meek hates, Meek will never send it back. I'm pretty sure Meek drives a Ford Tempo, but he got it used, right? See, Meek is weak, right? Meek is weak. And Meek never, ever gets angry. I remember growing up, there was this kid in third grade whose name was Jimmy. And Jimmy was kind of a bully. And sometimes he bullied me and sometimes he bullied others, but I would get mad at Jimmy. And I would even say things like, I hate Jimmy. But then a teacher or someone would say, now Stevie, hate is a strong word. We don't say hate. You may strongly dislike Jimmy, but you do not hate Jimmy. And so you kind of, okay, I strongly dislike Jimmy. and we learn that we can't be angry at anybody for anything and so we go around pretending that we're not angry for them or at them and we go and we pray for them with others telling them what we should have told that person because meek never ever gets angry because it's weak well if that's true that meek is weak and meek never gets angry, there's a biblical problem with that. Because in Ephesians 4.26, Paul writes this, in your anger, do not sin. Paul assumes that there will be times when you will get angry. And even that you should get angry. But he admonishes us not to sin in our anger. In the message, Eugene Peterson's paraphrase of the New Testament, he says this, and I think this is a better understanding. He says, go ahead and be angry. Some of you are like, I don't know if that's true. Go ahead and be angry. You do well to be angry, but don't use your anger as fuel for revenge. So if Jesus said, blessed are the meek, we need to learn what he was talking about. The word for meek in the Greek is praus. And it's condition of the mind and heart which demonstrates gentleness, not born out of weakness, but out of strength. It's a virtue born of strength of character. Aristotle says it this way, praus or meekness is the middle course in being angry, where on the one extreme, you get this explosive, bubbling over, just ah, kind of anger, which blows up at everything. That's one extreme of anger, and that's not Prowse. The other extreme of anger, which is not Prowse, is being never angry at anything, being so passive that nothing can stir you up. And our reactions to things that stir us up generally go that way. We generally don't go the middle way. We go either we explode or we go passive. I remember a few years ago, I lived in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and my wife came home one day and she said, Steve, unbelievable. I was driving down this road and I saw some road rage going on. There was this guy that cut someone off and then he started tailing him. And at the stoplight, the guy who had been cut off got out of his car and walked over to the car in front of him and reached in and just started punching him. I mean, that's unbelievable. That's the one end of anger. The other end of anger is shown in this movie. I don't know if you've seen this movie. It's somewhat obscure, but it's called Stuart Saves His Family. It's based on this character, Stuart Smalley, who's good enough, smart enough, and doggone it, people like him. And there's this one character in this movie that's so mousy that she starts every sentence with, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, would you like some lunch? I'm sorry, can I take my break right now? I'm sorry. And it just drives you crazy because everything is, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just, ah, stop. Well, picture this. The picture of the middle road of Prowse really is a wild horse that is tamed, but still has all of its power. A wild horse that's been tamed has every ounce of strength that that horse had when he wasn't tamed, but now it's submitted, and it's under control, and it brings goodness. It's the picture of strength. Prowse is this. It's getting angry at the right time, in the right measure and for the right reason, especially when injustice is done. It's what strength looks like. Prowse. Jesus does this all the time. One of the clearest times where he demonstrates Prowse or meekness is found in Luke 19.41 when he was approaching Jerusalem for the last time and he really knew that this was gonna be his last time and as he was heading down into Jerusalem, we read in Luke 19, 41, these words. As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it. Now you have to ask the question when you see something like that, why? What would stir Jesus up to weep? We have to remember this was Jerusalem and inside Jerusalem, the centerpiece of Jerusalem was the temple. And the temple was the center point for all spiritual things back in the day. And pilgrims would make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem from all over. And that's where they met God. So poor people, rich people would all converge on Jerusalem. And there had been a thing going on that Jesus was reacting to in that the religiously powerful were blocking the way into the temple for poor people. See, when you come into the temple, you had to have, and you've heard this before probably, but you had to have a sacrificial lamb. and that lamb had to be spotless. And so you would raise this little lamb to be spotless and you would almost be a pet and you would bring this lamb to be sacrificed. But the religiously powerful whose living was made by running the temple would say to these poor people, well, that's a cute little lamb. It's just not clean enough. And that's upsetting for you, I know, but if you have a little bit of money, you can buy a spotless lamb that we've inspected and we've pronounced clean. And in that way, they would be forced to take money from people who didn't have any money or to force them to turn around and go back. So into that scene, Jesus comes into Jerusalem, weeping over that. And what does Jesus do? He goes right into the temple. Let's pick up the story this time in Matthew's version, in Matthew 21, 12 through 15. It says, Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those who were selling doves. It is written, he said to them, my house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers. And the blind and lame came to him at the temple and he healed them. But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things that he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, Hosanna to the Son of David. No one likes it when kids shout in church, right? They were indignant. See, notice when Jesus gets angry, when Jesus demonstrates not an explosive anger or a passivity, but when he demonstrates a meekness that gets angry at the right time in the right measure for the right reason, a certain group of people get driven out. and when they're driven out, they are indignant. But another group of people flock to Jesus. The blind and the lame came to him at the temple and he healed them. What do the blind experience when they come to Jesus? Well, this word prowess also has the meaning of being a soothing medicine and a gentle breeze, which among other things means that when they experienced Jesus, their suffering got a little less and their pain got addressed. And that was really, really good news to the blind and lame. But to the Pharisees, who make their money on having the blind and lame not healed and not into the temple, they were confronted. they experienced bactine. Remember bactine when you skinned your knee and your mom said, come here, Stevie? And then, oh, she would break out that bactine and you would cringe as the little spray was sprayed and they would sting and that was the sense that Jesus was spraying into the Pharisees not to condemn them, to clean them, to bring them healing as well. but here's the deal if your agenda if your mission blocks the way to the kingdom to people who are suffering and you listen to what the rabbi has to say and you pay attention to the way of the rabbi if your way blocks people from entering the kingdom then your way is not the way of the rabbi and you need to let that in so how do you tell how do you tell if prouse characterizes who you are how do you tell if you have a meekness that's not characterized by explosive anger or by passivity well you need to ask this question who is it that flocks to you and who is it that is driven away from you who gets angry at you see if controlling a religious people oppose you and the outcasts of society are drawn to you, then I think you're on the track of the way of the rabbi. But if outcasts flee from you, and if controlling religious people flock to you and support you, then you need to do some reflecting on your own agenda and how it relates to the way of the rabbi, because it probably is not the way of the rabbi. I have a friend who years ago started hanging out with some people that were not like church people. And these people were sort of rough and their theology was all wrong and all this kind of stuff. But my friend began to make friends with them and another person that went to the church that we went to, they were talking about it and about these people and the other person said this to my friend. He said, you know, here's the deal. If your friends start coming to our church, my friends will stop coming to our church. And I don't know if that was said in a spirit of vindictiveness or just like the spirit of like, I don't know what to do with that. But when that's true, we are not following the way of the rabbi. It's said of Jesus in Matthew 12, verses 18 through 21, a prophecy that was spoken from Isaiah. here's my servant whom I have chosen the one I love in whom I delight and I will put my spirit on him and he will proclaim justice to the nations but here's his character he will not quarrel or cry out no one will hear his voice in the streets a bruised reed he will not break and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out till he leads justice to victory and in his name nations will put their hope. Now, Mike, the question that raises up in me, because this is a weird passage, leads justice to victory sounds almost military. I mean, it sounds very powerful and big. But on the other hand, you read this thing of he will not bruise an almost broken reed. He will not snuff out a wick that's just almost about to die. And how do those two things go together? Who has the power to lead justice to actual victory, but also to be gentle enough to not snuff out that candle that's just almost out? The answer is this, someone who is meek. Not weak and not never getting angry, but someone who demonstrates a strength of character. Someone who does the right thing at the right time in the right measure when injustice is done. That's what strength looks like. When Jesus says this phrase, blessed are the me, he's actually drawing from a psalm. One of the things that the rabbi knew was the scriptures. And in Psalm 37, starting in verse 9, we read this. For those who are evil will be destroyed, but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land. In a little while, and the wicked will be no more. Though you will look for them, they will not be found. But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy peace and prosperity. This is good news for those who are suffering injustice. In the end, meek will rule the earth, and that is good news. One of my favorite passages in all of the Gospels about Jesus is when it's most demonstrated, this spirit of prowess. Not becoming explosively angry and not going passive, but getting angry because injustice is done at the right measure in the right way. Doing the right thing in the right way. And the scene is this. Jesus goes to synagogue like he does every Saturday. That's his way. And sometimes he teaches and sometimes he sits. And in this particular Sabbath, there is a man present there with a shriveled hand or a withered hand. And there's also Pharisees present. And we don't know whether the Pharisees invited this man for this reason in order to trap Jesus or not, or whether he just showed up and the Pharisees noticed and said, ah, Jesus is coming. He has a reputation of healing people in all the wrong times. Love that about our rabbi. And here's the guy who needs healing. Let's see what he's going to do. Sure enough, Jesus walks in. And the scene is just ripe for confrontation. So Jesus sees this. And he's the smartest man who ever lived. So he intuits the situation. There's the guy with the hand. There's the Pharisees. He sees some snickers. He sees the look of anticipation on the Pharisee's face. And so he leads off. and he points right to the man with the shriveled hand and he says, you, why don't you stand up and come? Come here. And the Pharisees are leaning forward. And then Jesus, we find in Mark 3, verse 4, speaks to the Pharisees first. He says, which is lawful on the Sabbath? To do good or to do evil? To save life or to kill it? But they remained silent. He looked around at them in anger and deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts. He said to the man, stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out. And you need to see this picture like a movie going in your mind. The Pharisees are looking forward, now very angry that this law is being broken. And Jesus, filled with righteous anger and grace, reaches out and touches this man's hand and then he draws it back. And for the first time, his fingers move the right way. And you can probably see him feeling his other hand and his arm. And he's healed. And the elation and the hope that fills this man's face is contrasted with the anger that is shown in the Pharisees' face. And the Pharisees went out, in verse 6, and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. Two types of anger are seen here. Jesus' anger is rooted in strength. It's prowess, the right way, and it brings life. To save life or to kill it, remember Jesus said, which is lawful, to save life or kill it. Jesus' strength and spirit goes towards saving life. But the Pharisee's anger is rooted in selfish gain, and actually it's rooted in fear. And it results in death. And the interesting thing to notice here is both the Pharisees and Jesus have the same agenda, and that's to bring the kingdom of God. So fascinating. They both are trying to bring the kingdom of God. One has it right and one has it wrong. Why is this important for us to know? See, when our mourning turns to mission, And when what breaks our hearts finally moves us into action, when we get freed up to have a voice to what we see as injustice, whether it's undone to us or someone else, there's a danger. See, we can be so passionate about bringing life to the people that are being oppressed or even to us preserving life that we can wish for death in the person that's bringing that. See what I'm saying? We can actually, when we find a voice and when we resist being explosively angry or going passive, there's still a danger that we would wish for death to the people that are bringing the oppression. And that is not the way of the rabbi. Think about Moses. His mission in life, born out of his mourning, was to lead the children of Israel out of slavery. And there's two scenes that stand out to me about Moses' life. One was when he was a young man, and he was still living the good life. And he goes out to the field, and he sees a Hebrew slave, one of his own people, being beaten by an Egyptian. And his anger becomes so big that he moves all the way over to the explosive side. And he kills the Egyptian. It says in the scriptures that right before he killed the Egyptian, he looked this way, and he looked that way, and then he did it. And that's never a good sign. Right? And then you do it. Moses explodes and kills the Egyptian and then is forced to flee for years to be a foreigner and a shepherd in a land that was not his own. And in that time, I think, a meekness, a strength of character was formed in him as he spent long nights in a field as a nobody, in his father-in-law's field, because he didn't have his own land. He became poor. And on those long nights, I bet, he thought about that thing that he did, and he mourned his sin. And so when he was called by God, this is the second scene, to free the children of Israel by going right to Pharaoh, He had a different approach. And he came to Pharaoh and he simply said, let my people go. Now if you were an advisor to Moses at this time, I want you to dial into what probably would have gone through your mind. See, Moses had repeated one-on-one interactions with public enemy number one. And I think in the current understanding of how to deal with public enemy number one, you might have thought, Moses, why don't you take this poison and slip it into his drink? Take Pharaoh out. It'll be for the good of all the people. And if that doesn't work, smuggle a dagger in. And if that doesn't work, just raise your staff. It's anointed by God. You could probably strike him down right there. Take him out. Moses doesn't do this. Because Numbers 12.3 says that Moses was called the most humble man who ever lived. Guess which word was used for humble? It was the Hebrew equivalent of the Greek word praus. Moses understood the right way to express his anger. So in wrapping it up here, How can we, how can I move toward meekness? The strength of character that knows how to do the right thing in the right measure at the right time, that knows how to be right the right way. And whether it's based on injustice done to others or whether it's an injustice that's done to you, I want you to think about, if you can, try to get a picture in your mind. Who is the person, or maybe it's a group of people, that represents this thought in your mind of someone that's just coming against you or others? Who are the Pharisees in your mind? Who is the Pharaoh in your mind? Who is the person or group of people that when you think about it, you just get angry? And you even would say, I don't care about my third grade teacher, I hate that person. Or I hate that group of people. For some of you, it's the religious right. For others of you, it's the political left. For some of you, it's your father. For some of you, it's your spouse. For some of you, it's your boss at work. But there is someone or there is a group of people, maybe it's another religion, that you really would, if you could get them in a room alone, surrounded by your friends, you would tell them something. And you might do something. Get that person in your mind. And then I want to invite you into a little practice. I want to read this story of Jesus in the synagogue again. But I'm going to change the language of it so that we are the Pharisees. And when you hear about the man with the shriveled hand, I want you to picture that person that's in your mind. So close your eyes and try to see this happening in your mind. Then Jesus asked us, which is lawful on the Sabbath, to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill it? But we remained silent. He looked around at us in anger and deeply distressed at our stubborn hearts. He said to the man, stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out and his hand was completely restored. Then we went out and began to plot how we might kill Jesus. Now here's the deal. you have this in you and I have this in me even in our desire to do the right thing we can do it the wrong way when we desire death for anyone even our oppressor or those who are oppressing others we get it wrong see Jesus he had the brilliant way of desiring life for all and healing for all and justice for all that was his way That was what he did. And so when he went the middle road of being angry for the right reason at the right time in the right way, everyone had the opportunity for healing. So if we're gonna listen to this message on meekness, we need to make sure that we are not automatically saying, oh yes, that's me. I am meek. I do that the right way because if we have disdain or indignance even for our enemy we are not following the way of the rabbi because as followers of Jesus we reject our right to reject anybody amen as followers of Jesus we give up our right to reject anyone so I want to read this passage one last time and I want you to picture that person alone and undefended in front of you with all your friends around. And this time, you're not one of the Pharisees. You're not the person. You're not Jesus. You're just in the synagogue and you're watching the scene. And as you watch this, picture this person in your mind or this group of people and try to allow yourself in your spirit to move toward healing for that person, to desire healing for that person, for your enemy. so close your eyes as I read this one last time then Jesus asked them which is lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to kill but they remained silent and he looked around at them in anger and deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts he said to the man stretch out your hand try to see your enemy in the presence of Jesus stretching out their hand and in your spirit if you can in this moment even as a way of saying to God I want to want this I want to desire this stretch out your hand and the man stretched it out and his hand was completely restored and try to see your enemy with a restored spirit and then let's rewrite history this way then we went out and began to make friends with our enemies amen if you want to dial in to this want to invite you to what is called an examen and this is just at the end of every day or at the end of every week asking two questions of yourself one who is my enemy and just reflect on that and be really honest about it whoever it is just type it out write it out pray it out this is my enemy this is why I hate them but then the second question is how can I bless them and as that begins to be a part of your character you will develop the spirit of Jesus who was meek who was right in the right way amen let's pray Jesus I know I think that if just a few people did this, if we submitted our way to your way so that we would be right in the right way, our lives would change and this city would change. It actually would. And this is what we need, but we can only do it by a working of your spirit. A sermon won't cut it and words won't do. We need an outpouring of your spirit to break our hearts so that we can move in strength. toward the people that oppress and that we can even want to bless them and see them healed even as we are healed. And so, Jesus, by your spirit, do that work in us. Amen. Let's stand for the benediction. Now, a benediction, and I'm gonna try to get this just into our fabric. but a benediction is a charge. It's a sending forth. It's a blessing over you so allow yourselves to receive this. May you go in the grace of Jesus Christ. May you be filled with his immeasurable riches which are way, way more than you could ever hope for, than you could ever ask. May you be filled with all the measure of the goodness of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen? Go with God.
