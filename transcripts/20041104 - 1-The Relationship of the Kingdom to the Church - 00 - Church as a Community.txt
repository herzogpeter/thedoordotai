I'm a low-priced robot. You just push a button and he talks. Oh, I forgot to push the button. My bad. Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for being here. It's wonderful for you to be here. When Keith picked me up this morning, I told him that I really very sincerely have been looking forward to this for the year or so that it's been since Keith asked Dallas and I to think about doing this. And I'm looking forward to it for two primary reasons. One is I love thinking about these things with groups of people like you. And secondly, I love thinking about these things with Dallas and hearing him as he just really gives to us the fruit of a whole life of thinking about these things in ways that are very deep and very uncommon. So I think we're going to have a great two and a half days together. Well, today is really focused on trying to think about the church as a community of the kingdom of God. So we're really going to have a couple things that we want to hold in front of our minds this morning. And that is trying to sort of set aside prejudice or biases or sort of pre-existing ideas about two really important things. What it means to be a Christian and what it means to be the church. and what we're going to try to do is give some new meaning to that through locating those two ideas in a story or in a context or on a map so whichever one of those metaphors works best for you we're going to we're going to try to rethink about what it means to be a Christian and what it means to be a church by locating them first of all as I said in a different context. Now, it doesn't take a postmodern person or a philosopher to understand that context is key and that context really does alter meaning. So you can think about this very simply. If you heard the words, hit the bat on a baseball diamond, okay, grab a mental image of that. Hit the bat on a baseball diamond. You have a certain mental image about what that means. But if you were in the flying mammals section of a zoo and you heard the phrase hit the bat, now what kind of mental image do you have? Same words. But context totally determines the meaning of those words. And so we say, I am saved. Now, if that's located in a story or on a map or in a context that says, I'm going to heaven when I die, that will naturally and easily and routinely and intuitively lead to a certain kind of being a Christian or being the church. In other words, if the story you think you're living in is I'm going to heaven when I die, that's going to lead to appropriately, naturally in everyone's mind, a way of being Christian or a way of being the church. But if on the other hand, as Dave was just praying, our mental images are filled with images of the kingdom, the ruling and reigning of God, and that that somehow determines what it means to be a Christian or to be the church, we will naturally and easily and routinely and intuitively lead a whole different kind of life personally and corporately. So that's just sort of the basic introductory thought that I just want you to kind of place before your minds for today, for just, you know, this morning through this evening. We're going to try to work with our mental models about what it would be like to be the church or to be Christians if we reinterpreted that in the light of a different story. Because it is very easy to misunderstand something if you misunderstand the context or if something arises in a different context. I always think of this story that you may have heard. It kind of went, well, those years ago now, though, kind of went around when email was first getting popular, you know, a few years ago. Story of a man happened to have been from somewhere up in probably from here, somewhere in Minnesota, let's just call it Twin Cities, had to go to a business meeting down in New Orleans in the wintertime. So this would have been like winter of 2000 or something, let's say, or winter of 98. I can't remember. So he had to leave here in Minnesota, go down to New Orleans to this business meeting. And when he got there, he wanted to send an email to his wife to tell her everything was okay. But he's going to be late to his meeting, so he just thinks, okay, I'll do it. So he rushes over to the little desk in his room, and he gets out his laptop, and he plugs it into the data port, and he goes to type an email to his wife, whose name was Jennifer Johnson at world.net. And her email address was JenJohn at world.net. Well, in his haste, instead of typing in J-E-N-N, he actually typed in GeneJohn, J-E-A-N at world.net. Well, Jean Johnson was the wife of a pastor. He had just died about three days before. She buried him that day, had come home from the funeral, was walking down the hallway of her house. You know, you can picture this. And out of the corner of her eye, she sees on her computer screen, you've got mail. So she walks over and she opens her email and she promptly faints, falls right on the ground. The email said, honey, I arrived safely. But it sure is hot down here. So you see, I know it's a little early, but come on. So you see, what you think is going on really does make all the difference in the world. it really does shape the way we understand being Christians or being the church so you can see that context makes a difference and certainly story makes a difference the idea of what's really going on here what's what's happening around us what it what is it that that God is up to makes a really big difference in how we live our life and so one of the things that is clear to me is that a burden that we live under regarding this as contemporary people, we sort of suffer from what a friend of mine calls versatitis. And that's the disease of looking at things through verses and sort of taking little theological tidbits out of their context and then somehow trying to make sense out of these religious tidbits or these theological or biblical tidbits, but they're torn from their story. And we're never really told the story. We're just allowed to see these little theological bits of data. And it's very clear that no one lives from bits of data. We actually live from a sense of story that informs us. We actually live from our imaginations. So the little seven-year-old girl standing in front of a mirror in her room, you know, with the door shut and no one could see her. And she's practicing her little ballerina moves in front of the mirror. She's not doing that probably out of some little recipe or formula or bits of understanding about what it means to dance. She's doing it because her imagination is inflamed, as any entertainers would be, with the idea of bringing joy to others through what she does, maybe on a stage like this at Carnegie Hall. And it's out of that sense of a dream or imagination or a sense of story about what her life is about is what causes her to do what she does. And again, without a proper story, it will be very difficult for us to ever really rethink what does it mean to be a Christian? What does it mean to be the church? Again, I always think of this very funny story whenever I think about this. I come from Southern California. I mean, not now. I live in Boise, Idaho, but I grew up in Southern California. And any of you who have lived there, you know of the Garden Grove. We name our freeways. We're fond of our freeways. We give them personal names. So this one happens to be called the Garden Grove Freeway. Well, it's also California 22. So sometimes we'd call it the 22. Sometimes we'd call it the Garden Grove Freeway. Well, all along the Garden Grove Freeway grow these huge bushes called oleanders. I mean, they're enormous. They can be 20, 30 feet high. Great place for cops to hide. So this cop one day on his motorcycle is sitting there with his radar gun out. and out of the corner of his eye, he sees this car come puttering down the freeway and he looks at his radar gun and they're going 22 miles an hour. And he looks back at the car and he realizes it's these five really, really old ladies, two in the front, three in the back. And so he thinks to himself, I wonder if they're okay. And so he pulls out, turns his lights on and pulls them over, not because they'd done anything wrong, but just to see if they're okay. And so he pulls out and he comes up to the car and he notices that all of them are like, except for the driver, petrified, like scared to death, like white as ghosts. Obviously, you know, something's horribly wrong. And so he looks in, he says, ladies, are you okay? And the driver looks up at him with not a small amount of sort of self-righteous indignation and says, well, yes, sir, officer, we're just fine. We weren't doing anything wrong. Like, what's going on here? And he says, well, no, you guys weren't really doing anything wrong, but do you know how fast you were going or how slow you were going? And she says, oh, yes, officer, I know exactly how fast we are going. We are going precisely the speed limit, 22 miles an hour. And the cop, like you, sort of chuckles and wonders, what the heck? And he turns to walk back to his motorcycle and thinks, no, something's wrong here. And so he goes back to the car, and he looks in again, and he says to the driver, are you sure you guys are going to be okay? Look at these ladies in the back. And the lady looks at the officer and says, oh, don't worry, officer, we'll be fine. We just got off Route 118. Now, I take the time to add a little humor here because we can pass those things out, Keith. I take the time to add a little humor here because this is actually going to be maybe a little stretching for some of us. And I just want you to see from those sort of playful stories that actually our mental models really do make all the difference in the world. And so what I want to try to do in this first session, I don't know, do you guys all have like title sessions or anything or we just, you do? Okay. So what we're going to try to do in this session is talk about the relationship of the kingdom to the church as a way of getting at this idea of, you know, what really is the context for this? And then I want to say a bit about story. Okay, in terms of context, this is very important, but I'll wait just a second here while you're handing those papers around. And you might want to give me a couple minutes before you start looking at those things too closely. It's the problem with handouts. They divert the attention to the handout. Well, actually, I'll just tell you about the handout. I was giving a, you can see, I think, up in the upper right-hand corner, it says Todd Hunter New Wine. So in June of 2001, I was giving a talk to a, I don't remember how many, but a very large group of Anglican pastors in England. And I was explaining the kinds of things then that I want to explain to you today. And I had an overhead projector. And so I just started drawing what you have in front of you to try to explain what I'm going to try to explain today. And somebody liked it so much that they took it and went and put it on a computer diagram like this. but I don't have it electronically. I only have it in paper, so I had to just photocopy it for you, or we would have put it up on the screen. So this is what we're going to talk about in a minute. But here's the number one theological idea we have to get if we're going to move forward today on this idea of church being defined by the kingdom of God. All right, first of all, what is the kingdom of God? The kingdom simply put, well, kingdom translates a Greek word, Basileia. And we tend to think of it as a noun, like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We tend to think of it as a place. But it's far better, and the Greek history of the word allows for it, to think of the kingdom as a verb because what the kingdom actually is is the ruling and reigning of God it's the activities of God it's the realm in which what God wants done is being done now this is clear to understand if you think of Jesus's teaching of the disciples about how to pray in what we call the Lord's Prayer. He said, when you pray, pray, my Father who's in heaven, may your name be honored in all the earth. May your kingdom come. Now, I think you can see there, he's not asking for like a nation state to come. Are you with me here? He's not asking for a thing to come. He says, pray, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. So better to think about it in terms of like will so that the kingdom is the place where God expresses his will and and in his realm now what he wants done is done perfectly and so Jesus prays says pray let that realm come to us today so best to think of the kingdom as the present activity of God It's what God's up to. Now, that ruling and reigning, that activity of God, creates the church. In terms of New Testament theology, it calls the church out. Now, the reason this is important is that it makes the kingdom preeminent. And preeminent not only first in terms of preeminence, but in terms of sequence as well. that something is going on, the ruling and reigning of God, that creates secondarily, both in terms of importance and in terms of sequence or time, it creates us, the people of God. It makes us, therefore, secondary. Not unimportant, not in any way sort of worthless or to be discarded, still highly important to this story, but secondary. Now, just cut to the chase for a minute. Think of how many church disputes could be solved if they would be taken from disputes over secondary issues and amongst secondary people and tried to be adjudicated or discerned by the kingdom of God. So, I mean, I could stand here and talk about 30 ways that this would impact our church and our lives, but if you just begin to think with me, if we could begin to see ourselves as secondary, as instruments of the kingdom, as the means through which the kingdom works on earth today, we become in a very healthy way secondary or we become, in the words of the Apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians, we become ambassadors of that kingdom. So what I want to just shoot for right out of the gate this morning is altering your view of what it means to be a Christian away from church as it is commonly thought of as person, place, or thing. And I'm going to talk more about that in the second hour. Because when we say the word church, virtually everyone in this room would either think of a place like this building, or you would think of a well-known person, I go to Greg Boyd's church, or you would think of an event. I went to Eucharist this morning, or I went to mass. 99 out of 100 people, if you ask them to talk about church, what's going to come back is something to do with person, place, or event. What I want to suggest is that if we're going to advance the ball for ourselves, for our churches, and for our communities, we have to think of ourselves as people of the kingdom. It doesn't mean that churches or church meetings or any of that goes away. Well, again, we'll have the rest of the day to talk about this. It means that they're put in their place. And I'm saying that sort of tongue in cheek. I don't mean it as bad as it might sound to you, but I really do mean it. The churches no longer think of themselves as the owners of the kingdom. See, because when we think owners, we think that we then expand it. Think of the words we use in churches. Well, we're extending the kingdom. We're expanding the kingdom. Well, if you accept the definition that I'm giving you, how can you do that? How do we expand the omnipotent God's effective range of his will? We don't. It's not in our power. We're ambassadors of it. And the chief thing in the New Testament, if you just got out of a concordance and you looked up the word kingdom, you would find that the verbs most commonly attached to it are enter and receive. So we enter the kingdom, we step into this reality joyfully in which what God's will is, is done. And so we submit our will, our kingdom, our queendom, both individually and corporately in our churches, we joyfully submit ourselves to that, seeing that it is the superior life. And so we put ourselves into that realm. So we enter. The second thing that the New Testament talks about is that we receive the kingdom as a gift of grace, something that we don't at all merit, but we receive it. Now, having entered into that or switching metaphors, receiving that gift to the kingdom, we then as individuals and as communities of faith have a role in it. And our role is instrument and means. We are the agency through which God does primarily on earth today what he wants to do. In Dallas's words in one of his books, we become the cooperative friends of Jesus, seeking to live constant lives of creative goodness by the power of the Holy Spirit for the sake of the world. Now that's sort of Hunter on Willard. That's sort of me paraphrasing Willard. Let me say it again. With that as an imagination, that we've stepped into this new reality, we've embraced it as a gift, we've submitted our kingdoms or our queendoms to his kingdom, then our imagination moves away from simply or merely church or church services. Our imaginations now include those things, but they're no longer preeminent. The preeminent vision of our life becomes becoming the cooperative friends of Jesus, seeking to live lives of constant creative goodness through the power of the Holy Spirit for the sake of the world. That is my dream for myself. I organize my life around that. I organize my ministry around that. I try to make all the various components of what it means for me to be a human person around that vision. And it's got nothing to do with works. It's got nothing to do with trying to merit anything from God. The way I think about it these days is I think about myself as a little boy, let's say eight or nine years old, in Southern California. I grew up in Santa Ana, California. And I loved baseball since the time I was a little boy. My parents have a picture of me one years old with a baseball in my hand. who knows where that comes from you know it's just it was me and my whole life was dominated by the dream of being a major league baseball player and I can remember on Saturday mornings walking down to the library in Santa Ana as a little boy and I'd go to the sports section of the library and I'd get out books on hitting and this would have been like the early 60s mid-60s and and so the you know the books there would have been like by Ted Williams and I would sit there and I would imagine myself standing just like those guys and doing exactly what they did in the manner in which they did it. My whole life was just inflamed with how they hold their hands. And what were they doing as the ball was coming? And where was their shoulder, you know, compared to the bat? And I just had the whole science of hitting down. Why? Because I was a baseball Pharisee? You know, was I a baseball a legalist? No. My heart was impassioned with a certain dream. And I just knew that to do the dream, I knew that to hit a 92 mile an hour slider at Yankee Stadium with 60,000 people yelling in your ears, you don't do that by accident. You practice your way into hitting a 92 mile an hour slider. That's not normal to humanity to be able to do that. That's why you get paid so much money if you can. There are very few people who actually can. And so these days as an adult, I now just have a different passion. I have a whole different mental model of what I want to do when I think about what does it mean, Todd, for you to be a Christian. And as somebody who spent my whole life planting churches, nowadays I think, well, what does it mean to form a community of faith around these ideas of the kingdom. And so for me, my mantra has become, worth saying again, I want to be the cooperative friend of Jesus. And I want to create communities of faith for whom that's their dream and vision. Who strive to live constant lives of creative goodness through the power of the Holy Spirit for the sake of the least, the lost, and the last, for the sake of the world. So this is what I want to commend to you this morning, just sort of out of the gates as a basic vision of the relationship between the kingdom and the church. Now, as I said, I was giving a week, you might want to get your papers out now. I was giving a week-long series of lectures to this group of ministers, and towards the end of the week, I was kind of summarizing what I'd been saying. And like I said, I had a overhead projector in front of me. And so I just started drawing this out, trying to explain what I meant by what I was saying. Now, you can't see it real well because it's a bad black and white copy, but that round thing on the top left, that's supposed to be a bullseye, you know, like a dartboard bullseye. And on my copy, it's in color, but it doesn't come out on yours. Well, the first thing I wrote, actually, as I wrote this, was I put that big arrow. And I said, you know, there's something going on that when we think about being Christians and we think about being the church, there's something bigger going on, as I've just explained to you, something that's preeminent. And I've explained it to you as the kingdom, and here I said to them, what I really mean by the kingdom is God's story, God's will, his plan or his agenda, however you might think of that. There's something really big going on. In Dallas's writings, and you might wanna put this in there, in that arrow, Dallas would say this is reality. That the most real thing is not matter. the most real thing isn't terra firma or wood that what is really the most real is God and what he's up to and what we're trying to do is align ourselves with that reality with something that's going on now I don't remember if it was before or after that I created that diagram that I read this little introduction to Matthew in Eugene Peterson's The Message. You all know the message? I think the message is worth having, if for nothing else, than his introductions to the books. They're brilliant. Any of you who've ever read them know that I'd pay for the Bible just to have those introductions. And so I want you to just hear me in the context of what we've been talking about this morning. Hear me as I read this from Peterson in a kind of an imaginative way, meaning in the way that we've been talking, let this sort of wash over your imagination, place it before your mind as a way of thinking about what it might mean to be a Christian, what it might mean to be the church if we saw ourselves as living under and in and through the kingdom of God. So listen to Eugene here, just a couple of paragraphs. This is his introduction to the book of Matthew. He says, the story of Jesus doesn't begin with Jesus. God had been at work for a long time. Salvation, which is the main business of Jesus, is an old business. Jesus is the coming together in final form of themes and energies and movements that had been set in motion before the foundation of the world. Matthew opens the New Testament by setting the local story of Jesus in its world historical context. He makes sure that as we read his account of the birth and life and death and resurrection of Jesus, that we see the connections with everything that had gone before. So for Matthew, fulfilled, you know, quote, fulfilled is one of his most characteristic verbs. If you read through Matthew, you'll think, if you just think about it, how many times Matthew says, thus and such happened that it might be fulfilled. Matthew does this to show us that Jesus is unique, but not odd. Now, I just want you to think about that for a minute. What is Eugene trying to get us to see? Jesus is unique, but not odd. I would suggest it something like this. When he says Jesus is unique, he's highlighting that he is a one of a kind. And as Hebrews says, there was a one of a kind sacrifice. And so his life and his birth, life, ministry, death, resurrection, ascension, those are all unrepeatable things. He's unique. But why does one have to say he's not odd? What Peterson and Matthew were both doing is saying that Jesus arose in the context of a wider story. He was unique, but not odd. He was connected to everything previous to him, All the way back to Adam and Eve. And he is connected to everything future of him, which the Bible calls telos. Telos is just the Greek word for end. But it doesn't simply mean end in time and sequence. It has an aspect to it that means end in terms of completion. So Jesus arises in this story that has beginnings at the intention of God to create. And then it has its end in the completion of the renewed cosmos, the new heaven and the new earth. So Jesus is unique in that in that story, in that large, grand narrative, there is no one like him, never has been, never will. So that makes him unique, but he's not odd. And you know what I want to suggest after, let me do the math here, 29 years of being in the ministry? I want to suggest that maybe one of the biggest things that Christians wrestle with in terms of their discipleship and one of the biggest things that churches wrestle with in terms of their social, psychological, mental image of what it means to be the church is that they feel odd. They have no sense of being connected to a larger story and they have no sense of what that story is, past or future. And what the kingdom does for us is it becomes a paradigm, a lens, a grid through which we can try to understand what does it mean to be a Christian? What does it mean to be the church? And it allows us to be uniquely our place in the story so that when Jesus says to the disciples, look, wait here in Jerusalem. You guys, you know the story. Think Luke 24, 49. Wait here in Jerusalem. Don't go anywhere because in a few days, you're gonna be baptized with the Holy Spirit. Then you, you know, fast forward to Acts, the first couple chapters of Acts, and it actually happens, and Pentecost happens. And the continuator is now my sort of favorite translation of paraclete. You know, we've always had a hard time what to do with that word that's normally, I think the NIV gets it, comforter. You know, we've always, you know, no one's for a long time been really satisfied that we're really capturing whatever it meant when Jesus said, you know, don't freak out, I'm going to die. Now I'm thinking of the upper room discourse, you know, John 13 through 16, where Jesus says to the disciples, don't worry, don't freak out. I am gonna go away, but I'm not gonna leave you as orphans. I will send the Holy Spirit to you. He will be my continuator. My presence will remain with you through the Holy Spirit. He'll lead you and guide you and teach you. So we're unique. Are you following me here? We're as unique as Moses. was unique. We're as unique to this story as Noah was unique. We're as unique to this story as the church, as Abraham was, as the founder of this great nation. We're as unique as the priestly caste was within that nation. We have a highly unique part in this story, but we're not odd. What makes us odd and what makes it difficult for us to get an adequate imagination for what it means to be the people of God, either individually or as communities, is that we feel odd because we don't sense the connections with everything that has gone before us. And we have a hard time with connecting out the dots all the way to Revelation 22, 5, which says, you and I will rule and reign with him forever and ever in the new heavens and the new earth. See, we've gotten good as evangelicals of asking people, if you died tonight, do you know where you would go? But you know what I think is maybe a more profound question and that roots it more in this paradigm of story? What if we started asking people, what if you were going to live for a really, really long time? what if you were never gonna die who would you follow what kind of person would you become how would you think about life if you knew it was going to go on forever and ever and ever and ever but see when we take salvation like i remember going back now to the beginning hit the bat well it means one thing on a baseball diamond means another thing in the flying mammal section of a zoo if you say i'm saved and in your mind you're seeing a story that has no connections to what's gone before or what will come after and it's just about you going to heaven when you die, then all the problems that people like Dallas and Richard Foster and Eugene Peterson and Henry Nowen and Jean Vanier and all the way back to St. Francis or however far you want to go back, they all were laboring under the burden of people seeing no connection to discipleship because of the story they thought they were living in. Listen, I didn't need a coach to get me out of bed on Saturday morning down to the library. I was passionate about learning to hit a baseball. Disciples aren't motivated by legalism. They're not motivated by Phariseeism. They're not contemporary Pelagians, you know, trying to pull themselves up by their own moral bootstraps with nothing to do with, you know, the goodness of God in Christ. Those aren't what disciples are. Disciples are either young or adult people like us who have an imagination that's inflamed with trying to become the cooperative friend of Jesus, seeking through the Holy Spirit to live a life of constant creative goodness as the ambassador of the kingdom and doing so for the sake of the world. This has got nothing to do with merit. It's got nothing to do with being religious. It's simply what story do you think you're living in? What's the context that drives your imagination as a person and as a community of faith? So a couple more sentences here. Better yet, Matthew tells us the story in such a way that not only is everything previous to us completed in Jesus, but we're completed in Jesus. And this is one of my very favorite sentences of the last five years. Peterson writes, Every day, I can't tell you how much I love this. Every day, we wake up in the middle of something that is already going on and that has been going on for a long time. Genealogy and geology, history and culture, the cosmos, God. Now that is a really good functional definition of healthy belief. And let me give you a really good functional definition of atheism. A really good functional definition of atheism Is the sense that nothing good will happen today Unless I make it happen And let me tell you Yeah, I'm the director or the president of some organization And have been most of my life But whether I was a pastor Or the national director of the vineyard Or the president of Alpha I have people that I had to report to I have boards and chairmen of boards. And like any other human being, I can sometimes feel the pressure of performing. Do you think the youth pastors or musical ministers at our local churches don't feel the pressure to perform? Well, that slips over into kind of a functional atheism when it slips over into us thinking, even subconsciously, nothing good is gonna happen here unless I make it happen. Now that will lead to legalism. That will lead to Phariseeism. That will lead to all kinds of religious bounded upness. But what if every day you swung your feet out of bed and you sat on the edge of your bed and you just sort of mentally realized, I am getting up in the middle of something that's already going on. It has been going on for a long time and it's gonna have its end in that bullseye on your sheet. I don't need to make anything happen. I simply make myself available to God as his ambassadors. I don't, that, now see, that's functional theism in the best sense. That's functional beliefism in the best sense because it roots your mental model of being a Christian and as you shape communities of faith like this one that Dave and Keith are working on, it then shapes your mental idea about what you're doing when you come to work every day. You don't come to work having to make the most important things in life happen. You come to work trying to discern and partner yourself with them. It's a completely different way of looking at things. The way I'm suggesting and that Peterson's suggesting here, this is the peace-filled life. This is the life more abundantly. This is the narrow road. This is what Jesus meant when he said, these are my commands that are not burdensome. this is what it means to be fully human. To be humanity as God intended it is to live our lives under the rule and reign of his kingdom for the sake of others. Now, this is what I'm trying to get out on this diagram when I say down here at the bottom, Adam and Eve, you know, living in God's story. Well, what was God's story for them? When God created Adam and Eve, did he say to them, now just go and relate? like that's the height of you know being truly religious before god just go and have community big buzzword today you know just go and relate is that what god said to them no he invited them into this amazing story so here's hunter's paraphrase hey adam eve look at this amazing new creation i've just done come work with me in it be my subcontractors be my partners be the people through which I do all this stuff with all of creation come be with me in this amazing thing that I'm doing one thing, don't eat of this tree they eat of the tree and then I illustrate that by this arrow going off to the right and I call it people living in alternative stories so that Adam and Eve at some point said no, no I want to know good and evil and of course nothing's been worse for humanity than us knowing evil every time your spouse manipulates you it's because they know evil every time someone uses you it's because they know evil every time somebody steals from you or a friend is raped. It's because humanity knows evil. And it leads us then to living, it gives us the capacity, sinful as it may be, it gives us the capacity to think that we can live our own kingdom and manage our own lives through our anger, our manipulation, our substance abuses, pornography, whatever our deal is that makes us feel alive and feel fully human. I mean, there's plenty of drama in the will, plan, story, agenda of God in his kingdom. There's plenty enough there to make ourselves feel alive. But once someone, and to feel fully human, but once someone steps out of that story, they are constantly going to need the rush of the next deal, the next titillating photograph, the next drug or alcohol or whatever, because it makes them feel at least alive. So these are alternative stories. And I thought of that because the biblical word group for sin, the primary one in the New Testament is hamartia. It means to miss the mark. Some of the Old Testament phrases for sin mean like deviate from the goal, take the wrong road, to defy God's rule and reign, or to stray from the correct path. And so I just illustrated it by that arrow going out. And I say that that arrow has its own telos. It has its own place where it ends up. And I just am sort of paraphrasing here Gehenna as the ultimate wasted life, a kind of self-imposed exile. Like you only end up there if you really want to go there because you're determined to deviate from God's story. You're determined in your heart to stray from the path. So as C.S. Lewis says it, there's only two kinds of people, those who say yes to God and those to whom at the end God says yes to them. like okay you want nothing to do with me you you want to go your own way you want to have your own goal you want to take the wrong road okay I'm not going to make you be with me and so God creates this place that his sort of second his second best now it's horrible I'm not in any way minimizing hell I mean of course I don't know what it is but I but whatever it is from the biblical metaphors it's a horrible thing to not live in God's will, his plan, his story, his agenda. So it ends up in sort of the Gehenna, you know, was the rubbish dump outside of Jerusalem. And so when Jesus uses metaphors like fire, well, it was always burning. And when he talks about worms and maggots and all that, well, because part of the rubbish of first century Palestine were human persons. If you were a Gentile, that's where you were buried. You were thrown on the trash heap and your body's burned and it was there was never a shortage of worms or maggots even sometimes if you were Jewish and died unclean you could be just thrown under the ash heap of human history and burned forever so whatever Jesus is getting at with that metaphor it's obviously something really horrible and something that we were not intended to to be or to do or to go but yet there are people who through their own determination find their way there. On the other hand, if you look at the bullseye again, I say of the bullseye that our goal, contrary to where we're trying to live in your own story, contrary to that, our goal is to be the people of God. Where God's agenda, as I describe it there in that large arrow, is preeminent in our minds. And not as little legalists, not as Pharisees, but with the joy of that little girl before the mirror practicing her dance moves, the innocence of it, or the joy and innocence of me trying to picture myself hitting the ball just like Ted Williams. There's an innocence to this, a joy to it, that it breaks my heart as a pastor that so very, very few people ever find. They either just don't go there because they can't imagine it, or they try to go there in their own strength or with warped ideas about grace and merit and earning and legalism and all that stuff. And it's just incredibly sad to me because I believe God intended us to live in this amazing partnership with him as his cooperative people that inflamed our hearts and minds and attitudes about what all this could mean. So now just a couple things because we've only got five minutes here. is on, if you look now back at the big arrow, we have Adam and Eve and then the fall. And I say here, this is the beginning of alternative stories. And then, you know, you flash forward 12 chapters and you come to Genesis 12 and the call of Abraham. And remember when God calls Abraham, he says, Abraham, I'm gonna make you into a great nation, more numerous than the stars, more numerous than the sand of the sea. And I will bless you, I'll protect you. Anybody who comes against you, I will come against them. And then can anybody remember what verse three says? Why is God gonna do all that? Go ahead, you can talk to me. What does he say? Because you're gonna be a blessing to the rest of the world. So like Adam and Eve were caught up in a wider story of participation with God for the sake of the world, Election, this is worth jotting down either on your hearts or in paper. Election is never about privilege. The doctrine of election in the Bible is all about service. Think of election this way. It means to be invited into the family business of the Trinity. Surely somewhere around here there's an Italian family that owns a pizza shop. and if you grow up in that family you know pizza shop might have started in the 1920s you grew up in that family just sort of expected to work in one of the family pizza shops around town you're just sort of naturally invited into the family business well god has a family business the trinity using this metaphor has a family business of redeeming the world when we become christians we are caught up into that adam and eve was caught up into it by israel's very election they're elected to be a part of the family business of the Trinity, to be a blessing in renewing and redeeming the rest of the earth. Well, as you all know, you all know the story, Israel fails and falls many times. So that a theologian I like called Tom Wright or N.T. Wright, he's a British theologian and now Bishop of Durham, recently appointed Bishop of Durham. Tom Wright pictures it this way. Picture a really large hourglass shape that comes like that, that maybe comes in a game, and it's got a little white sand in it. So picture an hourglass in your mind. And the way Tom sees it is that God creates this people, Israel, and they have these amazing promises and privileges, but they continuously fail. And we could all just think through that story in the Pentateuch and through the historical books and the Psalms and prophets. You know, just think through the story of Israel. They continue to fail. And Tom sees all that failure coming down finally and all the promises of God to Israel coming down finally on the narrow shoulders of this carpenter from Nazareth. And so as Jesus hangs on the cross, and this is so crucial, there's so much more to be said about this and we'll probably get at a lot of it this weekend, is that when you see Jesus on the cross, it is so important that you see something more happening than mere atonement. I'm not in any way minimizing atonement. Of course, I'm a Christian. Clearly, Jesus is our atoning sacrifice. But there's more going on there than simply payment of sins. Wright thinks of it this way, Thinking of the Christmas carol that we'll be singing, you know, a few weeks from now. The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight. And Wright sees that as just a little way of thinking about how all the hopes and fears, and the fears being the sins and failures, now all that ends up on the shoulders of Jesus. So that on the cross, yes, atonement is happening. But here's what I want to suggest more, and there's probably infinitely more. But on the cross, I want you to just picture this is humanity as God intended it. Fully alive, even in the most bloodal, broody death. Brutal, bloody death. Fully alive, but fully obedient. Fully in alignment with the story. Not living in an alternative story. Tempted, Father, if this cup from pass for me, let it pass. But nevertheless, thy kingdom come, thy will be done. So he lives in alignment with the story. He lives in alignment with reality to the point of this brutal, bloody death. It's what made people like the early Christians and Paul record in Philippians this song that Jesus, though being God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but he let go of it to the point of dying on this cross. This is why it was also rehearsed and sung about and worship because it was this amazing bit of alignment with reality. So on the cross, yes, atonement is happening, but you're also seeing humanity as God intended it. You're seeing what it means to be fully human in the plan of God. And you're seeing Israel as God intended it. And then you say, so then what's the bottom part of this hourglass? The bottom part of this hourglass is what created you and I. It's Pentecost. Because now all the hopes and fears of Israel come on the shoulders of Jesus. He ascends to the Father, and the Spirit is poured out. And now all of that that God intended to do through Israel is done through the person of Jesus, finally. And then the Spirit comes, and there's this giant whoosh of history. As now the Gentiles are in, and the Gentiles are full of the Spirit, And the Gentiles are called. And their salt and their light and their ambassadors along with the Jews. And so now there's this army of people all over the earth sent by and empowered by the Holy Spirit. To be the cooperative friends of Jesus. Seeing themselves in their deepest parts of their hearts and minds as the ambassadors, the instruments, the tools of the kingdom. Seeking to live constant lives of creative goodness in cooperation with God's rule and reign in our neighborhoods, in our workplace, in our churches. and doing it for the sake of others. See, that's the mental image that I wanna suggest is worthy of you rethinking what does it mean to be a Christian, what does it mean to be the church? And I wanna say that I don't think we'll ever adequately get there apart from understanding that story. Now, let me just finish with this last couple of sentences from Peterson, and we'll take our break. He says, Matthew provides the comprehensive context by which we see all God's creation and salvation completed in Jesus. It all comes down to him. But in Jesus, now this is Hunter paraphrasing, we also get an imagination for what it means to be a Christian and what it means to be the church. Here's Peterson. And in Jesus, we see all the parts of our lives, work, family, friends, memories, dreams, also completed in Jesus. Now listen to this. lacking such a context, we are in danger of seeing Jesus as a mere diversion from the concerns announced in the newspapers. Nothing could be further from the truth. But from this story, that every day we wake up in the middle of, Peterson says, we're neither accidental nor incidental to this story. From this story, we get orientation away from our alternative story. We get orientation towards telos, towards what God is going to do ultimately when his rule and reign triumphs over all alternative stories. That's going to happen. There's no question about that. From that story, we get orientation about what it means to be a Christian and be the church. We get briefing, background, and reassurance. Can I say one more thing before you go to break? I didn't intend this. In fact, I just noticed it a few weeks ago that there's a tiny little gap between the point of the arrow. Can you look at that? There's a tiny little gap between the point of the arrow and the bullseye. I just noticed that. And I wrote in my paper right there, eschatology. In that tiny little gap, write the word eschatology. And then under eschatology, write the word assurance. Because, you know, as I rethink the Apostle Paul, you know, when I grew up as a young, you know, teenage Christian, I thought of the Apostle Paul as, you know, the guy who simply gave us justification by faith. Like, you know, that phrase equaled Paul. Are you with me here? But as I've read Paul over and over again for almost 30 years, I actually think that maybe the thing that animated Paul's life was the knowledge that we lived in the last split second of human history. It's like this arrow has been launched from that wall over there. And it's flown through time for however many thousands of years. And on this wall over here is the bullseye. And Paul saw that he lived in that last split second before that bullseye was gonna hit its intended telos. And from that story, Paul got orientation, Briefing, background, and most importantly, what healthy eschatology gives us is assurance. We live in the last part of the last days and that sucker's gonna hit that bullseye right in the middle. And it allows us to then get up every day in the middle of something that's already going on, has been going on for a long time. And we orient ourselves and our churches around that reality. So what I'm simply suggesting in this first hour is that that reorienting ourselves around the reality of the kingdom and its ongoing story as it comes through the rule and reign of God, it will radically help us rethink what it means to be a Christian and what it means to be a community of faith. Amen? All right, 15-minute break. -
