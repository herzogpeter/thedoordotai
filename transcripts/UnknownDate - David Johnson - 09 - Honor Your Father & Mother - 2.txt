Open your Bibles, Exodus chapter 20 verse 12. We are entering, as most of you know, into our second week of examining the fifth commandment. It is this, honor your father and mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God has given you. The Apostle Paul in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 2 called this the first commandment with a promise. The promise is this, that it may be well with you. this commandment we discovered two weeks ago is not primarily for your parents sake though if you are a parent you are very grateful for this commandment it is primarily for you as the child of your parents no matter how old you are you are a child of a parent and the benefit of this commandment is for you even to the prolonging of your life upon the earth having therefore not only emotional, spiritual, and relational benefits, but physical as well. Whatever else that means, it means this, that the honoring of our parents has an undeniably profound effect on fundamental issues of life. Issues like, as I pointed out two weeks ago, who, why, and whether we marry, how it is we relate to and treat the person we do marry, how we raise our children, even the career we choose. It has effect on our struggles with identity, intimacy, relationships, and self-esteem, propensities we might have toward alcoholism, drug addiction, physical and sexual abuse, obesity, anorexia, promiscuity, frigidity, rage, and passivity, all of which are issues traced by many health care professionals back to unresolved issues and unhealed hurts from mother and father. What we discovered two weeks ago, therefore, was that this call to honor our parents is in fact a call that makes us on one hand aware of, but on another draws us into the process of resolving those unhealed and undealt with issues. For until they are resolved in some way, we cannot authentically honor our father and mother. And until we can authentically honor our father and mother at some level, we cannot be fully free to live. Why is that? Because woven into the fabric of the universe is a law that is rooted in this fifth commandment. The law is this. You cannot dishonor your parents. In other words, you cannot ignore unresolved issues with your parents and at the same time fully realize the fruitfulness of your life's potential. And that is why God in Exodus 20, verse 12, calls his people to enter into whatever process it might take for you to get to the point where you can at some level honor your parents. But all of that raised a question two weeks ago. A question that began to drive our entire study. The question was this. What does it mean to honor a good but flawed parent? And how on earth do I honor a parent who beyond flawed was abusive or absent or maybe even evil? Well, noting the frightening complexity of this issue and its impact on every single person in this room, we began with a definition. Point number one, the essence of honor. Honor, we discovered, is at its root meaning simply this. to ascribe appropriate weight to my mother and my father. Noting that in the relationship with our parents, we tend to live in extremes of either deifying them or vilifying them. We discover that part of the work involved in honoring them is coming to a place where we can ascribe to them the appropriate weight. I told you the story last time of Victor, whose alcoholic and abusive father abandoned him and his mother when he was 12 years old. Upon his father's death 10 years later, Victor went to pick up the few things that his father had left in the world. On the pilgrimage, he met some people who didn't despise his father the way he did. They liked his father. They saw him through different eyes, and they heard him with different ears and saw him, quite frankly, as a caring person. That different perspective of his father forced Victor into a very painful place of having to re-decide who his father was. Was my father an abusive alcoholic who abandoned his family, or was my father a likable old guy who really did care? What helped Victor ascribe finally to his father the appropriate worth, the appropriate weight, and thus in that honor his father, was when he, in agonizing fashion, let in the reality that his father was both those things. point number two is where I wanted to press further this undeniable necessity of honor regardless of parental performance now I've already touched on how honoring our parents affects fulfillment in life and longevity what I want to touch on now is this is where I want to press it further is to consider how it affects not just our longevity but our identity I was intrigued by a quote that I read of Dallas Willards in his book, The Divine Conspiracy, where he said this. Each of us has a deep biological need to honor our parents. That caught my attention all by itself. A biological need to do this? This need is reflected in the commandment, honor your father and mother that your days may be long. To honor our parents means at least being thankful for their existence and to respect their actual role as givers of life in the sequence of human existence. Of course, to honor them in this way, we need to be thankful for our own existence as well. Stop right there. That confused me. When I first read that, what is the connection between being thankful for them giving me life and being thankful for my existence? I didn't get the connection. Later I did. Let me explain it with this. How many of you have ever found yourself looking in a mirror, examining something in the corner of your eye when you notice a glint, a twist of the head, a fleeting look on the face that is other familiar. It goes away in an instant, but it was unmistakable what you saw. You saw in your face the face of your mother, the face of your father. You saw them there. Now, for some of you, if you had that experience, and maybe you haven't, but if you've ever had that, some of it's no big deal, and you just go, well, I look like my dad. I look like my mom. Others of you, instinctively, without knowing what the proper response was, can have feeling from your toes come a rage. a loathing of the image you saw. And what you think you're rejecting there is your mother or your father who hurts you so bad. It's happened to me. This, you know, all of a sudden you see it. At the health club, I step out of the shower. In the health club I go to, when you step out of the shower, there's mirrors everywhere, all around you, which is a very bad idea. I mean, you see all these mirrors, you step out of the shower, and it's like, all of that work for this. You know? My hair is wet, my face is drawn and fatigued, the neon lights are without pity. As I glance at the light, it's only for a moment. In fact, if I try to stare at it, I can't find it anymore. It just went by. I see the face of my dad. And I love my dad. That's why this illustration is safe to use. And you know I love my dad. But my first instinct when I see that face, his face there, is to push it away. I don't want to look like my dad. I want to look like me. My dad was old. I'm not old. Am I old? The denial thing going on there, and that's another issue. But it intrigued me that my first reaction to that, I was like, I don't know. See, here's the problem with that. Get that out of there. Here's the problem with that. I am my father's son, and I am my mother's son. So are you. Not my mother's son. See, whether I like it or not, the nut did not fall far from the tree. and much of what was good and bad in my mother and my father is in me. You see, it's part of who I am. It's part of my identity, like it or not, for good or for bad. And when I push that image in the mirror away in disgust, guess who I'm pushing away in disgust? Not my father. You know why? Because it wasn't my father's face in the mirror. It was mine. Hang with me here. For I think this illustrates further the undeniable necessity of honor. For if you never press through your disrespect for or rejection of who your parents are, there will ever be a similar disrespect for and rejection of who you are. Because that face you saw in the mirror that you despised was not your mother. It was not your father. It was you. Dallas Willard further about this says, The promise of the fifth commandment, that it may be well with you, is rooted in the human soul. A long and healthy existence requires that we be grateful to God for who we are. And we cannot be grateful to God for who we are without, at some level, being thankful for our parents. Important clarification at that point. Not necessarily, he says, for all the things they have done. For they may have done things quite horrible, but they are part of our identity. And to wholly reject them is to reject ourselves. To reject ourselves leads to sickness, disillusion, and death. When this break in the human soul that is self-rejection remains unhealed, the individual and thereby society is open to all sorts of evil. This is where Hitler's come from. And for every Hitler who rises to power, there are millions who consume themselves and die in quiet corners of the earth. He finishes with this. this issue of honor is not something that can be bypassed. In some cases, it may be easy. And in a few, it will be unnecessary because the honor is already there. But these cases are few and growing less given the reality of our culture, end quote. Point number three, the process of honor. If it is, in fact, so important that we come to a place where we honor our parents, What is the process? What are some of the things that it commonly takes to bring us to a place of authentic honor? Well, over the last several weeks, in a variety of contexts, I have asked as many people as I could what honor looked like to them. What kinds of things it took for you to come to a place where you could authentically honor your parents. What I was looking for were common themes that would hopefully develop into four stages or six steps. that if carefully followed would result in receptivity on your parents' part, repentance maybe on your part and on their part, reconciliation and a relationship that you had never dreamt of before. If I could find the four steps, if I could find certain stages and give them to you, I could fix you all. One sermon. Well, while I did indeed find some common themes, there was no clear-cut methodology or formula to follow in this for all of us have a unique and sacred journey that needs to be personally discovered and respected. Indeed, one of the prayers that I found compelling yesterday before the service from Bruce, our bass player guy up here, he was praying that God would give us light to our path, that God would illuminate to us the individual paths that each of us need to take. And I think that needs to be laid over, what we're doing right now. It is something that needs to be personally discovered and respected, and it is a sacred journey. Let me illustrate this. You see, the stages that I'm going to have to go through and the steps that I have to take to honor my father and my mother are going to be different than yours. Not only are my stages and steps going to be different than yours, my stages and steps are going to be different than mine. Did I just confuse you there? Let me explain that. To come to a place of genuine honor of my father took for me certain stages that I could probably tell you about and certain steps to honor my father. To come to a place where I could honor my mother took different stages. I went through different stages, and I had to take different steps. So even in my life, there was a divergence, a totally different experience. Now, if I have a different experience all by myself, just spread that out from me to you. It becomes almost frightening how confusing this thing could be. The fact is this, that the first thing some of you need to do in order to come to honor of your parents may be the last thing somebody else needs to do. What may have been a breakthrough for you when you did this thing, and when you did this thing, it was so effective that now you're telling all your friends that they need to do the same thing. I promise you, for some people, the very thing you did that was for you a breakthrough could be a disaster for somebody else, the absolute wrong thing for them to do. So how do you preach this? Well, what you preach is the confusion. What I'm going to preach today is confusion. And here's the deal. In the confusion, I've already done it twice, so we're going to come out the other end on this. But if you go with me here, in the confusion, there's going to come some clarity. And the clarity is going to be, among other things, that there is a sacred and unique journey that needs to be personally discovered. And that God can help you do it. And there may be some pain involved. Let me just start to illustrate this with this. The fact is, for some of you right now, what you need to do, step number one for you. I'm looking for steps. Well, for some of you, step number one to get to this place of honor would be to go home after church, pick up the phone, call your parents, and apologize. Repent of your willful rebellion and quit blaming them for every problem you've ever had. I got a fax this last week from a friend who wondered in the fax if the reason some of us were nervous about this teaching on honoring our parents was because an awful lot of us are baby boomers whose entire identity, born out of the late 60s and early 70s, was rebellion, not just against our parents, but against everything. How many of you were baby boomers? Okay, how many of your parents are baby boomers? Nobody, they're all dead. They all died. They all, you know, some of you are. You ever wonder what it had to feel like? Because I remember, I'm a boomer, I'm a boomer, and I remember that the young great minds, the elite among us of the youth, the great slogan of the day. Do you remember? What was it? Don't trust anybody over what? 35. Everybody over 35 is an idiot. They don't even have a right to live, and they certainly can't speak into your life. And the coolest and the hippest and the most liberated among us were ones who bought into that hook, line and sinker. Try raising that kid. You know, I've made a pretty big thing around this that some of us as parents, and see now I'm a parent, and some of us as parents need to apologize to our kids. Here's another piece of this whole thing. Some of us as kids need to apologize to our parents. So, some of you have as step number one to get on the phone. Others of you may need to hang up the phone and establish some boundaries and begin to say some things you've never said before like this. No, Dad, you can't manipulate me anymore. Or, no, Mom, I don't want you to call anymore until you can speak to me and to my husband and to my children with some respect. No, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to allow our kids to be exposed to the abuse that they get from what comes out of your mouth whenever you're at your house. So we know we won't be coming home for Thanksgiving this year. Instead of just not coming home for Thanksgiving and giving them a bunch of goofy reasons, this time you tell them the real reason and you establish a boundary. And it's the most disrespectful thing your parents ever, well, I never. I need to tell you something. For some of you, coming to a place of authentic honor is going to require, first, some distance, some disentanglement, so that you can disentangle now, come to a stronger sense of yourself, And when you come to that place and get bathed with amazing grace and stand up straight into your life which is found in God, maybe then come back to a place where you can honor your parents. But I just, the way I even said that made it sound like when you come back, you'll be honoring your parents. I'm telling you that when you establish the boundary, the boundary itself that says, you know what? I'm not going to let you in anymore to abuse me or my family. That is honoring them as well. because that was step one to get to a place where maybe you could have a relationship. Dr. Dan Newhart, in a book called Controlling Parents, tells the story of Ellen, a 49-year-old mother of three, who had been dominated by her using, abusing mother all her life. A turning point for her was when her mother began screaming at Ellen's five-year-old son for moving grandma's figurines. Ellen, at this particular instance, gathered her children and did something she had never done her entire life. She left the house saying this, Mom, it's not okay for you to talk to my children that way. I want them to respect your things, but I want you to respect them. Discipline is good. Verbal assault is not. For Ellen, that move and those words looked like disrespect to her mother, who dominated her all her life. But those words and that move of leaving was step number one for Ellen to come to a place of authentic honor. To set a boundary, to disentangle, to find a sense of herself, so that hopefully she could come back. some of you need to forgive your parents. But even as I say that, I need to give you some help around that. Some of you need to be careful not to forgive too soon and just use your, oh, I forgive you, as a way to just stay in denial and not deal with any of the real pain that you have and even submitting to the pressure from somebody who's wounded you to forgive very quickly. Take it out of the parent-child analogy and use a spousal thing. If a wife or a husband has been betrayed by their spouse and repentance is there, I'm really sorry. And you authentically, when you hear that sorry and you can really tell that it's real, you say, I forgive you. And some of you thought when you said, I forgive you, that meant you were not going to forget. and you were completely done. And it just bothered you like crazy when three weeks later, the image was just as fresh as it was the first day. And there were some more things that you maybe needed to talk about and get out here and go back into and kind of work through again. And so you bring it up to your husband or your wife and they're indignant. Now they're on a morally superior high ground. I thought you forgave me. You don't have any grace at all. You need to know forgiveness might be just a process. and the initial forgiveness was real and you know what that initial forgiveness empowered you to do? Forgive the next thing you're going to need to forgive I don't mean the next behavior I mean the next level of coming even to an awareness of what your wound was the way I say it is this we get on a path of forgiveness where we are forgiving that leads to forgiveness think that through you get on a path of forgiveness we're on this path I'm forgiving I'm forgiving But this forgiving path is leading to forgiveness. It's a process. Some of you need to understand about forgiveness. That it doesn't always mean that just because you forgave them, that now you trust them. And this could work for a parent or a child could work for a spouse. And some of you may come to a point where you can honestly say, I forgive my mom, my dad, but I still need a boundary. You know where that would be true? When they don't repent. When they have no sense of their sin or wounding to you and the behavior continues toward you, there comes this place, hopefully, where you can get to a place where you can forgive them for even your own sake, for your own freedom. But you may need to continue to have a boundary. In fact, some people are going to pressure you to forgive them so that they can just move right back in redo their stuff. Wayne Mueller in his book Legacy of the Heart writes this about forgiveness. Forgiveness, while it may be healing, has its own timing. It needs to be nurtured and invited. It can't be pushed. Pressuring yourself to forgive all right now can sometimes interfere with healing. Parents or friends who may become impatient with you for not forgiving right now, let bygones be bygones, forgive and forget, may really be trying to get simply themselves off the hook rather than caring at all whether you're healed or whether you're able to move into real forgiveness. See, actually, it's in their best interest to go through this with you again. If you really care about having a relationship, if I'm the parent and I really care about having a relationship with them, It's in my best interest to let this kid come back to me a few times so that she or he can really forgive me. Same thing with the spouse. I'm going to let her come back to me if I've betrayed her a few times so that real forgiveness can happen in her. The reason it serves me even well is because I like to be intimate with her or him. Some of you need to forgive. Some of you need to confront your parents. Others of you maybe never should. A friend of mine, deeply loved, greatly respects, we'll call him Rick. It's not his name. I want to respect some just personal things here. Told me the story of how his 21-year-old son wanted to talk to him about some issues. That'd be great, come and talk. Chief among the issues was this, Dad, I feel like you don't listen to me. That was hard to hear, said Rick. Because one of the things that I've always thought I did best was listen. In fact, everybody that I meet outside my family tells me it's one of the things you do well, Rick. You really listen. I love that about you. But I was hearing now from my 21-year-old son that I didn't listen to him. Well, this time I did. And when my son was done, some things occurred to me. The first was this, that my son truly honored me by telling me the hard truth. With that in mind, could I just talk to your parents? If you ever have a son or a daughter come to you at whatever age they might do that, and need to share. My son came up to me after the service. Christopher comes up to me after the service and goes, Dad, I just want you to know that I forgive you for all the times you grounded me. You knew not what you did. So I'm not talking about that. But if you ever have a parent, a child come to you to bring to you this stuff that might even make you as a parent feel like, I've got to close up, I've got to protect myself. You need to know that when they're coming to you with this stuff, you know what they're wanting to do? Please hear this. They're wanting to reconnect. There is nothing more honorable that they could do than want to reconnect with you. So when they come with that stuff, be an adult. Oh, be an adult. And let him come. Let him come. First thing that occurred to him was this honored. My son is honoring me right now by bringing me. Second thing that occurred to him was this. I could have never done this with my dad. Third thing that occurred to him, it's time for me to do this with my dad. Here's a 47-year-old guy about to go have this talk with his dad. So he does have a five-and-a-half-hour talk. I'm thinking, wow, this is incredible. How did it go? Well, it was the good news, bad news thing. The bad news is my dad didn't get it. He didn't see the need for it. He heard me, and he listened to me, and that was good. That was really good. He did that. But he didn't change at all because of it. What's the good news? The good news is this, that while my dad didn't change, I did. He said, I may never be intimate with my dad, but I love my dad. And maybe a better way to say it is I've come to a place, and I'm coming to a place where I accept my dad because I began to understand my dad. A little bit of help here. If one of the things that you need to do in your process of coming to honor your parents is to confront them and speak with them, two things I want you to just be careful of. Number one, check your motives. Be careful of using a talk with them to hurt them the way they hurt you. It's just not going to do you any good. That talk is not going to do you any good. You may not be ready to have this talk if you're still full of nothing but venom. I think this talk needs to be gentle and kind and you have to, this is one of those steps that for many of you needs to be taken but it needs to be taken stage three maybe second thing, check not only your motives but check your expectations because you need to know, this is a hard truth you need to know that even if you come to your parents and are kind and gentle not full of venom, full of love but speaking the truth, what you say to them and offer to them as a precious jewel may not be received. You may not get an apology. You may not even get an acknowledgement. And one of the problems with these confrontations is that is generally what we want. And it's understandable that we do want an apology, some sort of acknowledgement, maybe even a change of behavior. Here's the hard truth. If that is what's necessary for you, and that is indeed your expectation, your kind of demanded expectation in the giving of this letter or the giving of this talk, you will often be disappointed and you may remain even stuck and may even get re-wounded in the whole thing. A friend of mine told me a story about himself, about this very thing, wrote a letter to his dad. loves his dad, but had some things and was wanting to reconnect in these arenas. Five pages, single space, took him six months to write. The reasons were two. First reason it took six months was because he wanted to make sure he did get all the venom out, but that he did still tell the truth and that it was laced with love. Second reason it took six months was because he was determined not to send this letter until he was ready for any response. Notice that I did not say that he didn't care about the response. He cared about the response. He wanted an apology. He wanted his dad to get on a plane, fly to Minneapolis and say, I got your letter. Let's talk. That's what he wanted. But he was ready for any response. It took him six months to get ready. For that, he sent a letter. Two days after the letter, he got a phone call from his, guess who? mother did dad get the letter yeah he got the letter what did he do he read the first page and threw the rest away oh man I heard him say that that had to hurt it was an odd way in which it helped me and one of the ways by the way he gave this this is not the first thing he did he had done some work here one of the things he said was his lack of interest in what I felt about our relationship confirmed something that I had always sensed but didn't know for sure. In fact, with the feelings I had, I kind of thought I was a little crazy. See, I always felt, ever since I was a little kid, that my dad really didn't care what I thought. And his response told me that that was not a sense. That was really true. Dave, you need to understand that I did not just write the letter for him. I wrote it for me. And while it didn't change him, it changed me. And it put me on a road of forgiveness. It wasn't a presto chango. It was a road of forgiveness, toward forgiveness. And it put me on a road to accept and to love him. And that letter I wrote to him that my dad threw away honored him, and he didn't even know it honored him. But that letter I wrote honored my dad. So I guess the rule is then, Dave, that you confront your parents. You write a five-page letter, single space, and if it takes six months, that's great. Not always do you write the letter. Not always do you go and make the confrontation. Let me tell you about Selena, a 37-year-old teacher whose schizophrenic mother raised her in a chaotic home. She hadn't seen her for years when Selena began to find her heart opening to her mother. It happened when Selena had a daughter of her own. She had a daughter, her husband abandoned her, and now Selena is in the same situation her mother was when she was raising her a single mom. Here's what she writes. Alone with my baby, I could see how hard it must have been for my mother to raise two kids. No husband, and frightening mood swings when people didn't know how to deal with mental health, didn't even talk about it. Selena found her mother in a homeless shelter in New York. Spent hours with her taking pictures, making tape recordings, staying up all night. Her mother sent her home with a bag of flyers warning her about UFOs. As I drove home, Selina writes, I felt rise up in me the warmth of love and forgiveness. I never did confront her. I just came to understand her. Which, by the way, is often among the keys of forgiving our parents. Coming to understand. You may have heard it said that if you're ever going to forgive an alcoholic, you're going to need to understand alcoholism. If you ever are going to come to a place where you forgive abusive behavior, you may need to understand abuse. Well, add to the list this. If you're ever going to forgive some of your parents, you're going to need to come to a place where you understand their story and maybe their journey. Two weeks ago, a woman shared with me her story of abandonment. Not the details of it, but the fact. If it didn't, told me then it was okay to share this if it fit. Her journey to recovery was long and involved in doing no small part to a living faith in Christ who introduced her to her real Abba, Father. And in the grip of her Abba, she began to walk down a path of forgiveness toward forgiveness. And part of that involved what she described as looking at her family tree. It was very liberating, she says. What I noticed in my family tree was generation after generation after generation after generation of what? Abandonment. Abandonment, abandonment, abandonment. Until that generation, those generations of abandonment got to a little boy who was my father. Who as he grew up and became my father, abandoned me. My father to this day has no tools, no resources, and unlike me, has no God and no experience of amazing grace. With which he could maybe deal with some of his stuff. That information of generational abandonment did not help her excuse her father, minimize her own pain, or even as if by magic, magic just immediately forgive him. Oh, he was abandoned? I guess it's okay then. It just helped her understand the father. And in understanding him, it helped her begin a journey of forgiveness toward forgiveness. And all of that agonizing work honored a father who abandoned a daughter. Close. Final word. My concern about this sermon is that in giving you all of these varying things, some of you need to forgive, got to be careful over here, some of you need to confront, maybe I shouldn't, that in all of that, I'll confuse you. My prayer is that in giving you all of these things, I will have not confused you, I will have invited you, maybe even pushed you into whatever process it might take for you. to authentically honor your parents. Why? That your days may be long and that your life may be full. What I believe about this, we've added some words come to us around this message this morning, and bigger than a message, just what God is wanting to do. Two pictures came real strong that for some of you, and this was real big for one particular woman. She came in and she was kind of embarrassed. I don't get pictures very often, and I've never spoken to you about this, and very hesitant. She said, the picture I see, and this is rather graphic and maybe even hard to hear, but it's like a festering sore that needs to be lanced. And there are some men and women in this room who can identify like that with this. And, in fact, it's so real to you that you've had a very hard time hearing the sermon. You probably couldn't even maybe say one thing I said back because you just cover that whole thing up but still there. And you need to know that the only one who's got the scalpel skillful and gentle enough to drain that stuff is your Abba, Father, God. And as that's drained, there will come to it amazing grace. The second word is that, and maybe it's a different way to say the same thing, that around this issue, some of you are in prison. And just like any prison, if you're in prison around this stuff, it is hindering you from living with freedom. And you just pick the arena of life. It's hindering you from experiencing everything God has for you, from being a husband, from being a wife, to the fullness of what God has for you. The prayer is that God, with skill and gentleness, would lance and drain and come with amazing grace and set us free. Father God, release the life-giving, healing power of your spirit. In Jesus' name.
