Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Hey everybody, my name is Steve. I'm one of the lead pastors here at Open Door. And before I dive into the talk this morning, I just want to say thank you. Last week, if you were here, we had an incredible service, I think, of prayer and hearing Steve Hansen share about his story from Haiti. And then we asked you to respond by writing notes. And I think there was four or five hundred notes that are going to be delivered to Pastor Dio and Madam Dio and the kids. And then you gave. And to date, we have over $100,000 in our fund to help our brothers and sisters. And that's just a really, really encouraging thing. Thank you so much for digging deep and giving. And it matters. We really are silos. So my Twitter update on my way home last weekend was, I'm so proud of the people of Open Door this weekend. So anyway, thank you for that. Let's dive in, but let's pray first. Jesus, this morning what I pray for in a pretty intense way is that we would become to know what the mystery of the gospel really is. That we would know it and live it and follow it. Amen. Well, on Wednesday mornings, I dropped my two-and-a-half-year-old son Isaac off at his papa and Nana's house for an entire day of getting spoiled and being the master of the universe, which he loves it. Who wouldn't, right? And for the last couple of months, every time that Isaac and I walk up to their front door, we would see their nativity scene set up on their porch. And so the polite thing to do, I think, is to say hello to Jesus. right? The baby Jesus. And so we would do that. There he is sitting there, you know, surrounded by Mary and Joseph and the wise men and all their plastic lit up glory. But this last Wednesday, as we walked up to their door, it was gone because it is January. And the nativity scene was packed away and probably put in the basement somewhere. And so Isaac and I had a question. And the question was, where's Jesus? Right? You're hearing that in his little voice, two and a half years old. Where's Jesus? What a great question. It's the same question that you and I have when something goes terribly wrong, when the earth groans, when creation groans because something is wrong. Like an earthquake in Haiti, or when you get a diagnosis of cancer. It's what you ask when you find yourself at that fork in the road where you don't know which way to go, or when a difficult relationship that you have gets even worse. You ask, where is God? And how can I find God? How can I get to God? How can I access God? This is the question you ask, I think, when you've run out of answers, or when the answers that used to work for you don't work anymore? It's the question you ask when you want to make sense of something that's happening either in here or out there that makes no sense. It's not an American question or a British question or even a Haitian question. It's not even just a Christian question. It's a human question. And we all get there at one point or another. Where is God? And how can I access God? Some of us have gone to church to find God. And maybe some of us, what we've gotten instead of finding God was a list of rules to follow, a set of promises that were broken, and a bunch of people that were pretending to have something that you could tell they really didn't have. And the God that you met there, maybe, His primary emotion was to be irritated with you and to expect more of you than you could give. Some of us, I think, have explored other religions to find God. And even if at first it felt maybe refreshing and different, after a while you discovered it to be the same flawed system with a different flavor, but the same result. A list of rules to follow and a God that you couldn't live up to. And some of us, I think, have even tried to find God by abandoning anything, even remotely smelling like organized religion, where we refuse to go to any kind of church, but instead we gather around a few friends. And we declare, sometimes arrogantly, that we've found the most pure, unadulterated version of spirituality and finding God until a couple years later that you're no longer friends with those people. I was like an amen right there. Man, that happened to me. And you find yourself back at square one again. And it's very frustrating. And on the cosmic mall map of life, you can see pretty clearly the dot that represents where you are. And you can even maybe see the dot that represents where God is or should be. But there's no one telling you how to get there. Well, during the time of Moses, the answer was simple. Where is God? How can I access God? It was straightforward. God was found in the tabernacle, which was a sort of portable tent that God instructed Moses to build so that the people of Israel would know that God was with them. A cloud would descend on this portable tent of meeting. And that way, the children of Israel would know that God was with them, even as they wondered. It was a nice system. I mean, that would be great that, you know, if the cloud would gather around this building, we would know, ah, God is with us, and we can access God. There was just one problem, at least in the time of Moses, that God, though God's presence was visible, God was not very approachable. We read this in Exodus chapter 40, starting in verse 34. Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord, the Shekinah glory, the indwelling presence of God, filled the tabernacle. But then it said, Moses could not enter the tent of meeting, at least when the cloud covered it, because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. You see, people in those days understood God to be separate and holy, And so any brush with God produced great fear because everyone knew that you couldn't be in the presence of God and stay alive. There's a story around the time of King David where one of the guys just touched the Ark of the Covenant, which housed the Ten Commandments, and he instantly died. People wouldn't even say the name Yahweh. They wouldn't even write it out in full. They would leave out the vows. Because of this reverence and belief that God was altogether separate and altogether holy. And that's why when an angel of the Lord appears to the people in the Bible, their first words are what? Don't freak out, the angel, saying to the people. Don't be afraid. You're not going to die. I just have a message for you. People didn't approach God and live. But around 960 B.C., Solomon decided that 500 years renting a high school auditorium for church services was long enough. Right? So he built a temple in Jerusalem where it was said that this was the one place that God was going to dwell and live, in the Holy of Holies inside the temple. But it was completely destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. and then it was rebuilt at least once, sustaining damages along the way. But the temple that existed during the time of Jesus had been refurbished by Herod the Great and had actually been doubled in size. Herod the Great was very aggressive and arrogant in what he wanted to get accomplished. And so the foundation was doubled. And I was reading in some of the commentaries that said that the foundation was so big that they had to actually change the topography of Jerusalem because of all the earth that had to get moved around. They had to fill valleys in, and so that says something about how Herod the Great viewed what this temple was gonna be, and it leads me to ask a question, and that is this. Why are we always compelled to improve on the plans that God has for us? Why do we always think God's plan is pretty good, but man, if we can get a few minds around the table, we can make it even better? Well, by the time of Jesus, far from being a place that existed to remind people that God was with them when they didn't know whether or not God was, the temple had become an elaborate religious system that actually was more designed to keep religious people in and non-religious people out. For Gentiles and anyone deemed unclean for any reason, as they stared at the cosmic mall map, the temple actually had become the chasm that existed between them and God that they could not cross. So I want to take you on kind of a walking tour of the temple to help you understand what this was like. So I want you to imagine, if you will, that you are a devout Jewish family making the annual trek to Jerusalem for the Day of Atonement. And as you're approaching the massive temple structure, the kids are screaming in the back seat, are we there yet? Right? Your wife is yelling at you because you didn't stop and ask for directions. And the sheep that you had to bring with you in order to make the sacrifice has done something terrible in the back of your SUV, right? But you make it there, and you find a place to park. Finally, it's kind of a long way away, but oh well, it's going to be a long day anyway. And picture yourself kind of filing into the Metrodome on a playoff game. There's thousands of other people. You're surrounded by people, and you enter a large plaza at first, and immediately to the right, you join a line that's going to form and go toward this ritual bathhouse because no one could enter the temple, no matter if you're a Jew or Gentile, without being ritually clean. So, you know, you get the kids, and you get them all through the bathhouse, and you walk up through the set of stairs and through a double gate, and you enter what's called the court of Gentiles, which surrounds the entire temple structure on all sides. And anyone could be in the court of the Gentiles, including Gentiles, obviously, as long as they'd gone through that original ritual cleansing. And in the court of the Gentiles, a kind of weird thing happens. Your kids break away from you. And they start surrounding this young-looking rabbi, and they join other kids in shouting this slogan that's sort of weird. And they're calling this rabbi the son of David. Hallelujah to the son of David. And you think that's kind of weird because that would mean that that person was the Messiah. And as you rush up to apologize to this rabbi, you see him stooping down and gathering up one of these kids on his lap, and he looks right at you, and he winks. Big smile on his face. And you kind of frown at such odd behavior for a rabbi, especially the Messiah, if this person is that, because certainly they have more important things to do, right? So you get your kids back under control, and you glance back at this rabbi as you're 30 or 40 yards ahead, heading into the next section of the temple. But as you glance back, you notice he isn't moving forward with the rest of the crowd. He has stayed behind. And he's reaching his hand out to a couple of people that you'd notice had been blind before. And you can't totally tell, but it looks like maybe he's healing them, And he has no plans of making it anywhere further into the temple that day than the court of the Gentiles. And so you and your family sit down. There's thousands of other people of all kinds. You see some Jews next to you, some Gentiles, and you feel weird about that, but you sit down for some lunch, and after that lunch, you are three steps up the stairs into the next courtyard, and you hear a loud sound of shouting, And there are the sound of coins falling off of tables and onto the cobblestone floor. And you even see tables getting turned over. And you think it's that same rabbi who now is incensed. He's angry. He's shouting. And you don't know what it's about. But things are getting crazy. So you're happy to be heading further into the temple. You go through another stairway leading upwards into the first inner court, which is called the court of women. And you knew that all Jews were allowed in there, but only Jews. Gentiles could not enter into this next inner court. In fact, if a Gentile was found this far into the temple, you knew they could be executed. And at this point, your wife leans over and whispers this into your ear, that she thinks it was in this courtyard that that woman, remember that woman that we heard about that was caught in adultery, was brought in to be stoned, the way our law suggests. But someone somehow let her off, and she wasn't stoned at all. It was in this courtyard that that happened. This is also the court of women where your family and you get separated because your wife and daughters can't go any further and your boys are too young. Only ritually pure Jewish men could continue on from there, heading closer and closer to the presence of God into the court of the Israelites. So you leave your family behind and you get in a long line of men who are entering a mikvah, which is a sort of six-foot-deep bath that you would walk down into and get completely submerged so that you would be ritually clean. Something you do before every Sabbath day and before every major Jewish holiday. And once you're in the court of Gentiles, you have your lamb with you. And you see the sacrificial altar there. And when it's your turn, you give the priest your lamb that is to be sacrificed in order to atone for the sins of you and your family. And you know the drill. The reason why you do this is because lifeblood of the sacrificial animal was required in exchange for the lifeblood of the worshiper. Innocent life had to be given for guilty life. And so once your animal was placed on the altar, you placed your hand on the animal. And then the thoughts and images that represented your sins of the past day and the past year would fill your mind and you would pray for forgiveness for those sins. After that, you knew only priests could enter the sanctuary. And you knew that sometime that day, the high priest would enter the Holy of Holies where God resided. And he'd do that what he did only once a year, entering into the Holy of Holies to make a sacrifice to atone for the sins of the people. And upon that lamb, all the sins of the nation of Israel would be put. And then that scapegoat would be sent away into the wilderness to die, bearing all the sins of the nation of Israel on him. It was Yom Kippur, the day that you and your family were redeemed. Innocent life had to be given for guilty life. And so you pray silently and you turn around as you're heading out of the court of the Gentiles back into the court of women to pick up your family. But before you leave, you see a man stooped down, beating his breast, and you hear a loud cry come out of his mouth over and over again. God, have mercy on me, a sinner. And you can tell by his clothes that he looks like he's a tax collector. And you see some religious leaders praying, but in a very different way, and questions, many questions, start to flow into your mind. Who is this God, and how is he accessed? Well, once you pick up your family and the court of the women, and you head back down the stairs through the court of the Gentiles, you're fingering the keys to your SUV in your pocket and your family is finally all back together. The smell of sacrifice is still fresh in your nostrils and two scenes flash before you in an instant. And one is you pass by this rabbi, the same rabbi that gathered your kids on his lap, the same rabbi that you think overturned those tables. And he is walking out of the temple with a kind of fire in his eyes of anger, walking toward Bethany, your hometown. And the second scene that flashes before you in an instant is two religious leaders, an even angrier look in their eyes as they gaze at this rabbi who's walking out. And they're so intent on this rabbi that they trip over two blind men that are huddled near the gate and they curse at them under their breath as they move into the inner court to atone for their sins and to meet God face to face, something that they are privileged to do. so once you're back in your SUV you don't even hear the kids screaming in the back seat because this question in your mind you cannot get out how do those two blind beggars who were cursed by the religious leaders how do they find God? how are they ever going to get to God? See, it was precisely those kinds of people that would populate the court of the Gentiles. Gentiles, people that were blind and lame that would make up the church at Colossae that we've been studying about these months. They would never make it past the court of the Gentiles. They couldn't by pain of death. It was to those people that Paul wrote these words found in Colossians chapter one, verse 21, words that which would have come to them as incredible, even impossible when they heard this read out when they were sitting in their little house church, it would have stunned them. These are the words, Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior, but now. Two of the most amazing words in all of Scripture. But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight without blemish and free from accusation. Once you were alienated. They would know how that felt. Once, the best translation for alienated here is belonging to someone else. Once you didn't belong in the presence of God. Once you couldn't get into the temple. But now you are reconciled. Your status as belonging to someone else has been exchanged. Now you belong to the one holy God. Not by a priestly sacrifice, not at the temple, but by Christ's physical body, you are presented holy without blemish and free from any accusation. Because the lifeblood of the sacrifice was required in exchange for the lifeblood of the worshiper. Innocent life had to be given for guilty life, but this sacrifice was different. It was once and for all. For all. And then something bizarre happened when Jesus died. We read this in Matthew 27, starting in verse 50. When Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. He died, and at that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. This curtain was about six inches thick, separating the Holy of Holies from the place where the high priest would go. And at the moment that Jesus died, at the moment that innocent life was given for guilty life, the thing that separated people from God was torn in two. And the Spirit of God flowed out of the temple and began to search for a new home. No longer was the Spirit of God going to reside only in the temple, accessible only to high priests on high holy days. So the question is, where did God find a new home in? Well, we read it. We found out in Colossians 1.25, where Paul writes, I've become the church's servant by the commission God gave me to present you the word of God in its fullness. Meaning here is the entire story coming to you. The mystery that's been kept hidden for ages and generations is now disclosed to the Lord's people. Here it is. To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles, the Gentile believers at Colossae, who you and I would be. The glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you. The hope of glory. the creator of the universe has left his home and made his home in you. Wow. The power and presence of God, the Shekinah glory of God, the indwelling presence was now gonna rest on people, not just in Jews, but in Gentiles too, all people. This message would have sounded crazy to the Colossian believers if not for an event that happened in Acts 2, because they saw it. Not necessarily the Colossian people, but they had heard about this story. Colossians 2 starting, or Acts 2 starting in verse 1, we read this, when the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place because God, Jesus told them to be waiting for this event, and suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. And they saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. When God first settled down onto the tabernacle in the time of Moses, he came in a tongue of fire, representing that's where he was gonna sit. And so now it was very appropriate that God would come down and sort of finish the bookends. Because if you remember in Genesis 1, when God created men and women, what did God do? God breathed his very breath of life. The ruach, the creative activity of God, came from God into human beings. So it just made sense that that is where God would eventually find his home. We are the house of God. God has found his home in us. In us. Now, maybe to make the understatement of all time, this was a major paradigm shift, especially for the Jewish people, not to mention the Colossian Gentiles because they together, together, Jew and Gentile side by side, had to look at each other and say that God is making equal access to him through us. It's incredible. So if you and I are the house of God, if we are where God chooses to dwell and fill, And there are some practical applications, I think, for us. One of my friends told me this week that her three-and-a-half-year-old daughter came up to her and said, Mom, I know that Jesus is in my heart. I just can't remember why. Isn't that awesome? I mean, that's a book right there. Because that's all of our story. you know what Jesus came to dwell you know in me I just remind me again what that was there for well the first implication is a realization and that is this for that to be true for God to find his home in us must mean that God must really trust us you think about that I know that sounds weird but for God to say I want to make my home in you a people God really must trust us because it seems as though the way that God wants to be known to the world is through a group of people a group of people on whom God rests so that God's ways are our ways and that's not a new thing in the New Testament people that's not an audible that God calls because something else got messed up To the children of Israel, he said, I am going to bless you in order for you to be a blessing. God said to the children of Israel in the Hebrew scriptures, in the Old Testament, that you are to be a light of the world. I want to gather all people to myself through a group of people that decide that there is no other God but God. And so when God chooses to indwell us, It's just the continuation of a story that God's ways would be our ways. So what are God's ways? Well, God lives as a community, Father, Son, and Spirit. It's a community, a friendship, who eagerly serve one another and sacrifice for one another. They suffer for one another. So a group of people that would live according to God's ways would also be eager to serve one another and suffer for one another, To move toward one another, thinking the best and hoping the best for each other. To be patient with one another. To be looking at each other as the most glorious creation that God made. And to be unified by the indwelling spirit of God would mean that we are unified in the way that we treat each other because we would treat each other the way that God treats each other. Jesus says it this way in his prayer in John 17, starting in verse 18, and then going to verse 22. He's praying to his Father, As you sent me into the world, I have sent them. That is us into the world. As you sent me, I send them. The mission of God becomes our mission. For them I sanctify myself, that they too may truly be sanctified. And then verse 22, this is crazy. I have given them the glory that you gave me. What? I have given them the glory that you gave me. The indwelling presence, the Shekinah glory of God is now in us. That they may be one as we are one. I in them and you in me. So that they may be brought to complete unity. No more chasm. Where is God? I in them and you in me. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. By the way that the people of God treat each other, that's how the world will know. God must really trust us. Because it seems as though we are his plan to reconcile the world. to God. A group of people choosing to suffer redemptively for others, drawing on the strength of the indwelling presence of God in us. The crucified Christ, alive and making it his home in us, is drawing us to complete unity. That work is happening in us so that our oneness with each other, despite the fact that one is a Jew and one is a Gentile and one is a Baptist and one is an alcoholic, would be the proof that God really does indwell us because there's no other way that a soccer mom and an addict would share the same table other than if the Spirit of God was indwelling them and there was something bigger than what they liked and didn't like unifying them or driving them apart. Jesus told us that we are the light of the world and the salt of the earth. We are God's chosen dwelling place. And that is great news. Now, sometimes people talk about how Open Door has changed over the last few years. And I think it has changed over the last few years. That's maybe no surprise. For some, this has been a disappointment, the changes that have happened. For others, it's felt like new life. And maybe for many of you, it's been both. Right? New life is great. Change is hard. Ah, what do I do? Some people leave, and that's maybe okay. Some people stay and engage, and that's okay. But the question that comes to us on January 31, 2010, is what will unify us? Will it be a great speaker? God help us if a great speaker unifies us, because a great speaker can't unify us. Will great worship unify us? God help us if we're relying on great worship to unify us. Will a common enemy unify us? Well, a lot of people go down that route, gang. We're gonna have to fight hard so that a common enemy does not unify us. We will not be a church that rallies around an enemy. we will not go there that's small that's a small story so we're left with this will a complex group of people from all different kinds of backgrounds soccer moms alongside addicts who might disagree on a lot of things will we come together because the spirit of Jesus has made his home in us and there is a world that needs reconciling with each other and to God. That is what the light of the world does. And if that happened, the people of Open Door would see our greatest calling as being sent to where Jesus was sent, to the court of the Gentiles. Now you think about this. The court of the Gentiles is the place where all different kinds of people rub shoulders. Jesus seemed to spend a lot of time, if you read the Gospels, and you read that when he was in the temples healing people, the only place that he could have healed the lame was the court of the Gentiles because they weren't allowed in any other place in the temple. Jesus, his favorite place was the court of the Gentiles. Maybe the place that he felt the most at home was the court of the Gentiles. Devout believers alongside those who had lost their way and didn't fit in. Heretics alongside fundamentalists. Addicts alongside CEOs. We think of the words that Jesus said early on in his life. He said, The Spirit of the Lord is on me, Jesus said, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor, to proclaim freedom for the prisoners, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set the oppressed free, to engage the court of the Gentiles. It's amazing. It's where Jesus wanted to be. And so the question comes to us, is it where we want to be? Now, the truth is that you find yourself in the court of the Gentiles all the time. It's your work. Lots of different people are gathered at your work. It's your school. Lots of different kinds of people with lots of different thoughts are gathered. And instinctively, when we're gathered around people or in the court of the Gentiles, where we're looking around, we're asking this question, do I belong here? And so we're looking for people that look like us and think like us. And so we huddle around those people as if, you know, just by their very presence, we will gain life. But Jesus had a totally different thought when he was in the court of the Gentiles, and that was, who needs to be healed? Who needs to be set free? Who is blind here? I'm moving toward those people, and you can do the same thing because you have the indwelling spirit of God in you, and they have a little flicker of the indwelling spirit of God in them. a little flicker that we have to be very gentle to not snuff out. Amen? So, one of my favorite stories from Open Door happened I think over 20 years ago. Dave tells it often. And it's a story when Dave preached a sermon and he invited people to come down for prayer. And so there's people coming down. but one of the guys that were coming down was kind of a big guy, long, greasy hair. But he was wearing a T-shirt that said, helping stamp out virginity in my lifetime. Yeah. You know, typical church guy, right? But tears were streaming down his face as he came forward. The reason why he came forward is because the chasm between him and God had been erased. Jesus, who loves him and who knows him, met him there. Through us, ragtag, you know, broken down ragamuffins. Why? Because God really trusts a group of people that says, our only hope is you. So the question that comes to us is this. As we gather now here in this much more comfortable room, is that guy still coming? Is that guy still welcome? As we look at even each other, you know there's people that you would kind of say oof I don't know that I mean I'll sit a few seats down is it okay to sit in the same room and be unified by something bigger than a common enemy or a point of theology is it okay for you to be in this room and not have it all together is it okay for you to be in this room and not be in the club and to those of you who are in the club whatever that is would you consider looking around and saying huh who's different from me and how can I pursue them that would be a great question to think about wouldn't it for us because we have the indwelling presence of God in us that moves toward each other and suffers for one another and sacrifices for each other. It's what God does. So it should be what we do. Amen? Second question is this. In just a few minutes, you're going to walk out those doors into the freezing cold Minnesota winter, cursing under your breath, and you're going to enter a whole different court of the Gentiles. Maybe it's even your home that you live. and the question is as open door heads out into the future as we move into our next leg of ministry the question that I have is what will mark us and the hope that I have the thing that keeps me up at night to be very honest is that we would be a people that once we leave those doors we are a bonfire around people, around which people can gather because they, when they meet us, they meet God. Which means that the question that we have for them is not how are you different from me? It's where are you oppressed? Where are you blind? Where are you lame? And how can I be careful to not snuff out the little flicker of the life of God in you? How can I suffer for you, for your joy? What if, people of open door, what if that's what we became known for? Wouldn't that be a great thing? Man, that would be a great thing. And you know what? That's what God is calling us to do. As you have sent me into the world, Jesus says, so I send you. Well, that's something to think about, isn't it? I'd like you to stand for the benediction. You know, my mentor is sitting over there. Dave. And one of the reasons why I know that this thing is true, can be true, is that's what he's lived for years and years. And he's sitting over there, I know, so proud of me right now. And gang, we have a gift that we need to celebrate because there's life here. So receive this. The benediction, again, is not what you do for God. It's what God does for you. We've got to get that clear. So here it is. I will sprinkle clean water on you. This comes from Ezekiel chapter 36. I will sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean. And I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you. I will remove from you your heart of stone. some of you need to hear that I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws that is what the sovereign Lord says and that is what the sovereign Lord does so receive that truth and go in peace friends go in peace have a great week you
