For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Last night we did this, as you know, we had a service last night, halfway through the worship I'm going, I gotta pace myself. We gotta do this four times. And then I thought, nah, I don't know how to do that. Now last week if you were here, you may recall, in the context of Palm Sunday, we saw and heard what amounted to the false praise, at least that's the way we looked at it, of an adoring crowd that would turn from singing Hosanna, He's the best, on Sunday, to shouting, crucify Him. He's a bum on Friday. So today, in the context not of Palm Sunday but of Easter, I want us to hear a different song, sung by a different choir for a completely different reason because they saw a different thing, Not a man riding into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey, but a lamb standing as if slain. And the song they sang was not Hosanna, though that's a great song. But they sang, Worthy is the lamb to take the book and break its seals. For this lamb was slain and did purchase for God with his own blood men and women from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. which is some really weird stuff, I know, that needs to be explained. So open your Bibles if you have them. And if you have them, I don't know if you can see them. To what may seem like an odd place of study on an Easter Sunday, to the book of the Revelation. End of the book, fifth chapter, beginning in the first verse, where the Apostle John, who we heard from a few weeks ago, actually, in the context of the Beatitudes, shares with us here in Revelation 5, a vision of heaven. actually, and the worship that goes on around the throne of God perpetually, and the reason for that worship standing as it does for us in contrast, in stark contrast to the false worship that we heard from the adoring crowd last week on Palm Sunday. Today, not a dissonant chord can be heard. Beginning in verse 1, it says this, that I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne of book, written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, asking a question, actually, who is worthy to open the book and break its seals? And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look in it. So I began to weep greatly because no one was found to open the book and to look into it. And one of the elders then said to me, Stop weeping, John. Behold, the lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, is overcome. So I so opened the book and break its seven seals. And I saw then standing between the throne with the four living creatures and the elders a lamb, standing as if slain. Verse 8, And when he had taken the book and the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the lamb, having each one a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sang a new song, not Hosanna. They sang a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book and break the seals, for thou wast slain and did purchase for God with thy blood men and women from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. Verse 11. And I looked and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, all of them, with a loud voice saying and singing, worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing in every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them. I heard them singing and saying, to him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever. And the four living creatures kept saying, Amen, and the elders fell down and worshiped. several weeks ago when we saw and heard John's vision of Jesus on the island of Patmos it stirred in me and in us a question that I want to revisit this morning the question is this do you ever wonder if it's worth it and lots in her book on the revelation wondered actually what it would be like to ask that question to people in the Bible, to people like Abraham. Abraham, was it worth it leaving your home, everything familiar, everything you love, to spend your one and only life wandering around as a stranger, all for a single child, and an unfulfilled dream, was it worth it? Or imagine being able to ask Moses the same question. Was it worth it, Moses, leaving the prestige, power, and wealth of Egypt? You had it in your hand. It was there for the taking to then carry a stiff-necked, complaining people on your back for 40 years through a wilderness, only to die before you made it to the promised land. Did you ever wonder, in the middle of that stuff, what's the use? Or maybe to ask Mary. Mary, who we talk about at Christmas, not so much at Easter. Mary, are you glad that your response to the angel that day was, be it done unto me just as you said, to then conceive that child out of wedlock, pour your heart out to him in love, only to have him grow up and publicly say, with you standing there, that the real members of his family are those who do his will, and then in the end to stand helplessly by and watch him die in agony on a cross, publicly humiliated and discredited, was it worth it? Or how about John, the writer of the Revelation that we're looking at this morning, was it worth it, John, spending your old age on an island called Patmos, when you should have been able, I mean, you should have been able to enter into your final years with some comfort, sit back and enjoy the fruit of your faithful life's work. Do you ever wonder, John, what's the use? and how about you? Do you ever wonder if it's worth it to pursue God and live to serve Him when you can't always see the benefit of it right here and right now? Is it worth it to obey God? To tell the truth when a lie right now would serve you much better or to persevere, to learn to love in a difficult marriage? when part of you just desperately wants to run? Is it worth it? To invest your one and only life in a dream for ministry when it feels like there's way more plowing of the field than harvesting of fruits, do you ever wonder, well, what's the use? Well, you may not be wondering that today, particularly in the context of these festive events, But I believe that in the course of life's journey, it's a fairly common question for all of us. So what I want to declare to you this Easter weekend is what I think Abraham, Moses, Mary, and John himself would declare to you if they were here. And it's this, that at the very center of the universe, there is a lamb standing as if slain. And one day you will and I will behold the lamb. not by means of a sermon like you hopefully will today, or a song, or a book, or a movie, but one day, face to face, and on that day, every doubt, question, and fear, every wondering if it's worth it will be blown clean away for you, and I will know what Abraham, Moses, Mary, and John already know and already see, that it really is worth it. Not because it was easy or fun, Not because it led to great accomplishment or recognition or any particular kind of wealth, but because at the very center of human history there stands a lamb who was slain. Indeed, Revelation 5, 6 says it particularly this way. It's standing as if slain. A strange way to say it. And it's because though he was dead and still bears in his body, does this lamb, the marks of death. Behold, he is alive forevermore. And he is worthy is the song that is being sung in Revelation 5. And all of that is why this Easter Sunday, by means of Revelation 5, I want to tell you the story of God. The story of God. I want to talk about the Lamb of God and why he is worthy. Because it'll get you singing. And it'll make you want to sing and we're going to be able to sing in response to this word. It begins with a book, Revelation 5, verse 1, sealed with seven seals, kind of weird kind of thing. Let me explain that because in John's day, it would have stirred some things. In John's day, one of the documents that might be sealed this way with seven seals is a personal will. We talk about someone's last will and testament. So this book, picture it this way with the seven seals, could be understood that way, as the revelation of God's last will and testament for the world, where everything God wants to get done is done. So this book John's looking at contains, among other things, all the plans and purposes of God, including his plan for redemption and the restoration of his creation to himself, him bringing back what he designed in the beginning to what he wanted in the beginning. The ancients had a name for this restoration. We've talked about it before. Tikkun Alam. Remember that? Or the fixing of the world. The prophets used to speak of it, dream for it, pray for it. Tikkun Alam, the restoration of all things. Which, by the way, and you know this is true, it's where all the workings of God's kingdom are ultimately headed to restoration of all things. It's what we're part of as a church. It's what we've given our life to. Nikunalam, the restoration of the world. In fact, it began in the garden. Get the story in your mind this way with God's great dream in the garden of bringing his creation to the fullness of his potential. And if I would bring you back to the garden and that creation story, of everything that he created, he said one thing. He said it was good. It's good. But it wasn't finished. And so it was. He said to Adam and Eve, I want you to rule and subdue and multiply because we're going to take this creation and bring it to the fullness of its potential. It was an ongoing story, but with sin came separation. What in kingdom language is referred to as exile, we've talked about that at length here as well. And that exile thing was a powerfully evocative word for first century Jews because it's precisely what first century Jews and Jesus, They felt, when Jesus came, they felt separated. In exile from God. In exile from the garden. From how things ought to be. So that now their only hope was that God would sometime, some way, move in such a way. To bring about Tikkun Alam. The restoration of all things. And John sees this book with seven seals that tells this story of God that reveals the plan and purposes of God to bring about all these things. But then in verse 4, he weeps. Why? Because there isn't anyone who has authority or the strengths. There isn't anyone who is worthy to take this book, this revelation of God, to break its seals. In other words, to reveal this plan and fulfill God's purpose. And so John weeps. Because what he's recognizing is something bigger than his own personal situation. He is recognizing the reality of the whole human race. For throughout human history, we have anointed kings, followed leaders, formed governments, made alliances, created initiatives, all with the hope that maybe this time we'll get it right. That maybe this time justice will triumph and peace will prevail, but it doesn't, at least not for long. See, there's a way in which John is weeping for the whole human race, for the beauty of the world that could be but isn't, for little children who are abandoned, afraid, exploited, and abused, for the relentless inhumanity of man to man, and John is weeping, quite frankly, for his own failure, too. Because even with his own best and most noble efforts, he couldn't, by himself, make things right. And the island of Patmos, on which he's living at the time of this revelation, is a daily reminder of that fact. There was no one who could take the book and break its seals. Indeed, beloved, if you have ever been awakened in the middle of the night and wept, Because things had suddenly gone wrong and you didn't know why. Because you wanted so badly to make things right, but you didn't know how. Then you have wept the tears of John. But then enters one of the elders. As the story continues to unfold, verse 5, saying to John in a voice I think rather firm, Stop weeping, John, for behold, the lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has overcome so as to open the book and break its seals. But when John turns in verse 6 to see this great lion that the elder is talking about, he sees instead a lamb standing as if slain because he was dead and bears in his body the marks of death. But behold, he is alive forevermore. And that's when the singing started. And they sang a new song, verse 9, and they sang it over and over again. Worthy is the Lamb to take the book and break its seals, to reveal the plant and begin this process of tikkun olam, the restoration of all things. A word about this song. So different from the hosannas of a week ago, from the fickle crowd that would so quickly turn on Palm Sunday because this time, verse 11, I looked and heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders and a number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands and all of them were saying and singing with a loud voice worthy as the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing. And then in verse 13, the whole choir was complete. They were all there as every created sing, which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and all things in them. I heard them singing in a loud voice to him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever. And the four living creatures, whatever they were, kept saying, amen. And the 24 elders fell down and worshiped because it wasn't just loud. I thought it was loud today. You don't like the loud? You're going to have a hard time with this. It was overwhelming. Not just loud. It's why they fell down. Fact is, they fell down a lot. Clumsy group, I suppose. Revelation 4.10. You just get the picture here. It says that the 24 elders will fall down before him who sits on the throne and will worship him who lives forever, casting their crowns before the throne, saying over and over, worthy art thou. Chapter 5, verse 8 says, the 24 elders fell down before the Lamb, and as they did, they sang this song, saying worthy art thou to take the book and break its seals. In chapter 5, 14, they go down again, and then again in chapter 11, 16, and 19, 4, they fell on their faces and worshiped God, saying, we give thee thanks, for you're the worthy one. Quick question. what makes him worthy? There's a long list of answers to that. But the answer that comes to us in this text, Revelation 5 verse 9, is this. For he was slain and did purchase for God with his blood. In other words, the essence of his life. He gave everything he had. He purchased people, men and women, from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. and that's what made him worthy and that's what got the angels singing in verse 11. Worthy is the Lamb. Think with me just for a minute or two about the purchase price of people because it happens most commonly in the context of slavery. A sad, very painful, frightening reality that many people in John's day were familiar with because many people in John's day were slaves, actually. So to them, this issue of a purchase price would hit them in a particularly visceral way. Indeed, in those days, Jesus' day, John's day, when someone became a slave, their freedom would be set at a price. And on the surface, that would kind of sound hopeful to a slave because what that means is if there's a purchase price, I could maybe somehow save enough money and then be free. But as a slave, you had absolutely no possible way to earn money. So the purchase price that would make freedom possible only mocks you because it's impossible. Now, every once in a while, just so you know, a benevolent owner would provide a way for a slave to be free. Maybe someday. And every now and then, actually, someone would purchase a slave for the sole purpose of setting them free. But that was rare. So it is that most slaves in John's day lived and died knowing that freedom was just a ransom price away, but knowing that they couldn't pay it and no one else would. So I wept greatly, says John in chapter 5, verse 4, because no one was found to open the book, to break its seals, to make things right, to set people free, to pay the purchase price. But then the story starts to turn, because one of the elders said to John, stop weeping. Behold the lion, who is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, for he has overcome, so as to open the book and break its seals in order to make things right, to pay the ransom price, which cost him everything he had, and to begin the process of tikkun alam, the restoration of all things. A mission, this restoration of all things that would ultimately come to its completion in a collaborative effort between God and his, what they call now his bride, the church, the body of Christ. Picture it. This is God's great dream. Now the body of Christ, men and women who have been purchased by the blood, out of slavery, having been set free, now being the hands and the feet of Jesus in the world, working with God to make things right, working collaboratively with God to bring tikkun olam, for he has made us, Revelation 5, verse 10, a kingdom of priests who will reign upon the earth. But when I looked to see this conquering lion, What I saw was a lamb standing as if slain, because though he was dead and bore in his body the marks of death, behold, he is alive forevermore, and that's when the singing started. But it wasn't like the fickle crowd on Palm Sunday singing Hosanna, for this was a different choir singing a different song for a completely different reason because they saw a different thing. Not a man riding into Jerusalem on the colt of a donkey, but a lamb standing as if slain. And the song they sang was not Hosanna, good as that song was, but worthy is the lamb. And that is why the 24 elders and four living creatures and myriads of angels and every living creature, day and night, right now, do not cease to say worthy is the lamb that was slain because he did purchase for God with his blood men and women from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. And all of that is why he's worthy. And all of that is why it's worth it. And all of that is why we worship. And that is why we're grateful. And that is why we serve. And that is why we sing. So let's.
