There's a cheering section up there. There is now, therefore, a Sabbath rest for the people of God. There is a kind of life where you no longer live like a slave, being driven by a slave master, where you actually have time to reflect and examine your life and how you're actually living it, there is a kind of life where your kids aren't growing up too quickly, and if they are, you're not missing it because you've chosen a different way of living, a different rhythm of life. And when I say those things, some of you are going, really? There is? Because my life is nuts. the fact is that we live in a culture and I'm including church culture that is frighteningly shallow and superficial that if we allow it will drive us like a slave master to invest in and spend the juice of our lives on things that if we have time to think about them don't matter to us that we don't care about at all and we have a God who says there's a different way, a better way. He doesn't force it on us, but he continually says there is a different way to live. Indeed, we have a rabbi who we've been coming to know these weeks and months who says, come. It's just an invitation. It isn't a forced thing. Come and follow me into a different kind of life, a different rhythm of life. All of you, this is particularly who this invitation is for, because they're usually the ones interested in a different rhythm of life. All you who are weary, whose life isn't working, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Follow me into a different kind of life, and I will give you rest. But to enter into that rest, that different rhythm, requires learning. a different rhythm. Taking on a different way. Matthew 11, 29, Jesus says, so take my yoke upon you. And we've been studying what a rabbi meant by a yoke. It meant his way of living and teaching and being. So take on for yourself my way, my rhythm of life, and learn from me. For I am gentle and humble in heart, and you shall find rest for your souls. But it's not a magic wand. You shall find rest for your souls in learning to follow my way. In learning to live with a different rhythm. It's a rhythm we began to talk about last week. If you were here, you probably remember in the context of what we were studying relative to Sabbath rest. The fourth commandment in the law, Exodus chapter 20 verse 8. And following, it's a rhythm we discovered is rooted in creation. Genesis 1.31, and God saw all that he had made. And behold, it was very good. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed and all their hosts. And by the seventh day God completed the work which he had done. So he rested on the seventh day from all his work and blessed the seventh day, what came to be known as Sabbath day, and sanctified it, saying, this is a very good day, this day of rest that builds into your life a rhythm of work and rest. And work and rest. So in Exodus chapter 20, when God was calling his people out of slavery, it's very important that we remember that Exodus 20 is the Ten Commandments and where we are in the story of the people of God when God gives the law because they were just coming out of slavery. And slavery was the only life they had known how to live. So in calling them out of slavery, He's calling them into a different kind of life. And when he does that in Exodus 20, he says, in effect, one of the first things I want you to learn is this rhythm that is rooted in creation, that is revealed now here in the law, because you're no longer slaves, driven by a taskmaster who doesn't care about you, only what you produce. I want you to learn, this is so important, at the very beginning. I want you to learn how to live a different way with an entirely different rhythm that starts by learning how to take a day. Let's just start with a day. Remember last week, I called it kindergarten. And it doesn't mean it's not important, but you've never known another way to live. So let's just start with a day, the seventh day, and use that day for rest physically. Very important. But not just that. It was a day to realign yourselves spiritually to this eternal truth that there's a God in heaven and it's not you. So quit living as if you're in control of everything. Let go of some stuff. Remembering redemptively so that you can, in fact, live abundantly and fully and freely. Even productively and fruitfully. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. But it's more than just a day. When fully integrated, it speaks to a rhythm. It produces a rhythm. And I want to remind you of that fully integrated thing again. When Jesus came, he said, do not think. I came to abolish the law. Whatever the law is, I came to fulfill it. So I came not to abolish Sabbath day rests or the observance of Sabbath day, but I did come to show you what it looks like when that one day is fully integrated into a life. And if you look at his life, you see a rhythm. Got a call last week from Bob McKenna Bob's on our staff here About a book by Mark Buchanan Dealing with this issue of Sabbath rest And the name of the book is called The Rest of God And as I was thumbing through it I'm just trying to get the lay of the land I happened on a statement that intrigued me Where he admitted to learning to keep Sabbath In the crucible of breaking it He said he learned to keep the Sabbath In the crucible of breaking it That intrigued me As I read further, I began to wonder how many of us would say that his story is actually our story. I mean, listen, and see if you don't identify with what he says. Here's what he says. I became a Sabbath keeper the hard way. I mean, I do everything the hard way, so I related to that right off the bat. Either learn this kingdom-oriented rhythm of life or die. Not die literally, at least I don't think so, but die in other ways, he said. It happened slowly, subtly, over time. But I noticed at some point that the harder I worked, the less I actually accomplished. I was often a whirligig of motion, but there was little joy and stunted fruit. To justify myself, I'd tell others that I was gripped by a magnificent obsession. I was purpose-driven, I said, or words to that effect. And it may, in fact, have begun that way. But it wasn't that way any longer. Often I was just obsessed, merely driven. No magnificence or purposefulness about it at all. I once went 40 days, an ominously biblical number of that, without taking a single day off. 40 days in a row off, without a day off, and very proud of it, quite frankly. But things weren't right. Though my work often consumed me, I was losing pleasure in it and my effectiveness as well. Indeed, here's a deep little dark secret that for all my busyness, I was actually becoming slothful. I could while away hours at a time in a masquerade of work, a pantomime of toil, fiddling around on my computer, leafing through old magazines, chatting up people in the hallways. I was squandering time, not redeeming it. And whenever I went on vacation, I did just that. I vacated. Evacuated. I spilled myself empty. The inmost places suffered most. Fissures in my character would work themselves here and there into cracks. Some widened into ruptures. I grew irritable, bitter, self-righteous and gloomy. Often argumentative, I preferred rightness to intimacy. And then I came to my senses. It wasn't a blinding light, more of a slow dawning. I didn't lose my marriage, family, ministry, or health. I didn't wallow in pig muck, scavenging for husks and rinds. It simply became clear to me that if I continued on in this way of living, I was going to do lasting damage. God made us from dust. And we're never too far from our origins. Apostle Paul says that we are all clay pots. Clay pots. Dust mixed with water passed through fire hard. Yes. But brittle too. Knowing this, he concludes, God gave us Sabbath. Not just a day. Starts with a day. Not just a day, but an orientation, a way of seeing and being and living. a rhythm of knowing when to be on and when to be off. Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 10, the wisdom writer Solomon says this, I have seen the task which God has given to the sons of men with which to occupy themselves. I understand the work of life. And what I've seen is this, that God has made everything in its time. In other words, I see a rhythm to life when it's rightly lived. Indeed, verse 1, he says, there's an appointed time for everything. There's a rhythm for everything. There is a time for every purpose under heaven. There's a time to be born. There's a time to die. That speaks of rhythm. There's a time to plant. There's a time then to uproot what has been planted. But here's the question, and it's the question I invite you into today to do your own work around, and it's a Sabbath day question. The question is this, do you know what time it is? Do you have any rhythm? Do you know when it's time to be on and when it's time to be off? Well, there's a number of reasons why some of us don't. No. What time it is. Matthew 13, Jesus tells a parable, which he often did. It was the rabbi's way. Indeed, it was his primary way of teaching because parables would force the hearers to engage in the story if they hoped to understand it or be changed by it. And if you did engage in the story, parables actually could be quite transformational. Far more than just giving you information that you wrote down and made sure you had the... Parables, if you engage, could be transformational. See, Jesus, like most rabbis, didn't spoon-feed people. It's kind of what we're used to, being spoon-fed, and it's actually what we expect and even like. He didn't go over, bend over backwards, trying to help people connect the dots. He didn't do that for them, saying, this means this and that means that, so now do this. No, parables were designed to make people think and make people wonder, Not only what the parable means, but where they were in the parable, where they were in the story. Now, the parable in Matthew 13, like most parables, was actually a very simple story, involving four kinds of soil, a farmer and some seed designed to make the hearers wonder, what kind of soil am I? What kind of soil is in my heart? When in verse 22, Jesus says that some of the seed was thrown among the thorns. So he's talking now about thorny soil. There were four kinds of soil, but this particular kind in verse 22 was thorny soil. And then he explains, still in verse 22, that this thorny soil is the kind of person who hears the word. The word here is not just a sermon, though hopefully the word would be contained in a sermon. The word is identified in Matthew 13, verse 19, when it's identified as the word of the kingdom. So the word is this invitation, who hears this invitation into a different kind of life. This is the person who hears the invitation into a different rhythm of life, and at some level really likes what they hear. There's something in them that, right, I would like a kind of life like you're talking about today. They really enjoy hearing it. They come to church every week expecting it, desiring to hear more about it, but it never becomes the dominant reality of their life. it never becomes the actual rhythm of their life because two things consistently frustrate this invitation into a new kind of rhythm causing the invitation to choke. The first is the worries of the world. It's right in the text. And the deceitfulness of riches. Worries of the world. Now, I think we know about worry. I mean, a lot of you can get up there and teach us about worry. I can tell you what it's like, exactly. But it's a fascinating word, actually, in the Greek. It comes from the Greek word, meris, which literally means to be split, to be divided. To have worry is to have a division in your spirit. So worry is kind of like when I'm here thinking about this, but I'm there thinking about that. You're divided. You're split, and if you're split, you won't have any rhythm. If you're divided in your spirit, not really present to anything, you won't have any rest, and you'll choke. And the picture of choking here is, to me, like an athlete who can't come through in critical situations. They choke, and part of the reason they choke is that they're not focused. Indeed, even the invitation into this different rhythm itself gets choked because you just have to make sure if you're divided, if you're split, if you're affected by this worry thing, you just have to make sure that this will be okay and that that will be okay and that the people over there will be okay primarily with you. You know, my wife can spot this in me in a heartbeat because I'm here thinking about this. I don't know how they do it, but she can tell I'm there thinking about that. I'm split, divided. It's worse for me in the middle of the night when those things I want to control but can't come visit me, they gang up on me. Usually around 2.30 in the morning. We should call each other. But here's the deal. you can do this worry thing this split off thing anytime you don't have to wait till 2.30 in the morning you can do it anywhere some of you are doing it right now because you're here thinking about this but you're there thinking about that you're split you're divided by worry and the constant need dare I say the constant drive to fix, control, make sure you got no rhythm no rest and no awareness that sometimes you can't fix it you can't control it you're a slave to worry and the deceitfulness of riches now deceitfulness of riches is similar to worry in this regard that it drives you and the way it drives you is with this lie you know the lie the deceitfulness of riches the lie is this that if you just have more of this or more of that, then when you get that, you'll be okay. You'll find maybe even some rest in that, which simply means, and you know it's true if you're kind of living this way, that you can't stop. It, meaning your rest or your sense of being okay or being full and satisfied, it's always out there somewhere. So you have to keep going to find it. You have to keep acquiring, accumulating, striving, fixing, controlling, making sure you're a slave. No rhythm. No rest. Now, into all of that, the writer of Ecclesiastes, let's bring him up again, says this, I see a different thing. I mean, I do see people living their lives out of balance horribly, but I see a different thing we're missing something very significant. Ecclesiastes verse 10.4. I have seen the task. I know what it is. That God has given to the sons of men with which to occupy themselves. And it's a big task. There's lots of work to do. But here's what I've noticed. Here's what I've seen as well. That he's made everything and it's time. There's a rhythm to this. And you have some responsibility, says the wise one in Ecclesiastes, to figure that rhythm out. Indeed, there's an appointed time for everything. There's a time for every purpose under heaven. There's a time to be born, a time to die, a time to plant, a time to uproot. You know what? There is a time to fix things. And there is a time to take control. And then to realize there's times you can't fix it. You can't control it or control them. so here's the question and it's a really important Sabbath question do you know what time it is do you have any rhythm in your life and are the rhythms of your life consistent with the rhythms of the kingdom with the way of the rabbi now this is where the way of the rabbi which is what this whole series that we're in is entitled, it's what it's all about. This is where the way of the rabbi becomes a quite fascinating thing, because his way, Jesus' way, our rabbi's rhythm, quite often drove people crazy. Sometimes made them angry. Often made them feel, he doesn't care about us. Because his rhythm was very, very different than other people's. Let me give you an example. Mark chapter 1, verse 32. It was in the evening after the setting of the sun that they began to bring to him all who were ill, those who were demon-possessed. So it's in the evening. It has already been a long day. And he brings to them demon-possessed people. Think about that. Demon-possessed everybody who's sick. It's quite a group. Not the most life-giving group of people you're ever going to meet. This could require some energy. Verse 33, not only the demon possessed and the ill, but the whole city gathered at the door. Take these things literally. The whole city gathered at the door, which means it was either a really big door or a really small city. Thank you. You know, you did better last night. Or maybe I didn't. Pathetic. So the picture is this. that the most draining, troubled, needy people in the whole town, including the whole town, have gathered to essentially plug into Jesus, to draw from him whatever juice it is he has for them, to fix them, heal them, deliver them. I literally see people plugging into him. It's like, and he does it. He gives them what he has because there's what? A time for that. to give everything you have, to take all the juice of your life and give it away for free. Verse 34, and he healed many who were ill and cast out many demons that day. But the next day, he didn't go out and do the same thing again, which is what everybody expected, indeed, wanted him to do. How do you know that? Verse 35, and early in the morning, And while it was still dark, Jesus arose, went out to a lonely, a solitary place to be alone with the Father praying there. Because the discipline of solitude and silence and being with the Father in prayer was a restoring thing to him. It was one of his rhythms. But Simon and his companions were freaking out. That's actually the Greek word for what they were doing. No, look at the text. It's on the screen. They were hunting for him. And you can see the look on their face. And when they found him, they said, everyone is looking for you. And I do. I said, their eyes are back on. And their friend, everyone's looking for you. Which tells you what about the disciples, at least at this particular time? It tells you that they didn't know what time it was. Because to them, at least at this place in their life, it was always time to be on. To give and to go and to just make sure that everyone and everything is fixed now. Now, by the way, if that's your rhythm, if that's your way, I don't have the energy to wrestle that away from you, but just know this, that it's not the rabbi's way. he had an entirely different rhythm I mean I just don't see Jesus frantically doing I see him doing a lot in the context of a rhythm that had integrated into every aspect of his life this reality of Sabbath rest that started with the day it integrates into your life with a rhythm everyone is looking for you they said to which Jesus said in verse 38 I love this okay let's go somewhere else which is so weird I mean it sounds like he doesn't care let me tell you here's the deal here's the deal with him he wasn't driven by what everybody else wanted and I'm telling you if you're everybody else that will tick you off it will because we like plugging in, and you better be there at my beck and call, whether it's a mother or a father or a child or whatever. And people who are able to walk away from that and go, let's go somewhere else, drive us nuts, partly because none of us are near that free. Ironic, isn't it? I mean, this just cracks me up. of all the people that you know and I know who have a Messiah complex. The actual Messiah didn't. Something to learn there if we pay attention. Isn't there something to learn there? Jesus doesn't overwhelm you. You want to live like that? Live. I'm not going to talk you out of it. I'm not living that way, says Jesus. Want to learn a different way? take up my yoke. A couple things to notice. One is the rhythm. And I've been talking about this. Rhythm of heavy engagement, accessibility, and output at a very high level. I mean, this is in terms of ministry. This guy's a world-class, you know, ministry guy, Jesus. Followed by, however, withdrawal. In order that he could continue. Verse 39. Verse 39, he's back at it. Throughout all of Galilee, preaching and casting out demons, full of compassion, full of juice. He had stuff to give because he had restored and lived a life with this Sabbath rhythm. Here's the question. Here's the work. Do you know your rhythms? You need to. And do you know, in the course of a day, for instance, do you know the best part of the day for you to be with God, for instance? you know the text says that Jesus early in the morning before the sun while it was still dark before the sun came up Jesus went to be with the father to do this solitary thing and I've heard people preach this that's the time you're supposed to do it no it's not maybe it is what's your rhythm you know some of you you hear that and you go I'm going to get up early even though that's not your rhythm you get up early and you're thinking I have to do it this way and you get up early and you go you just can't do it what's yours this is your work in the course of a week? In the course of a month? In the course of a year? Are you aware of the rhythms of your life? Are you aware of the rhythms of life? Because here's the deal there is a time for every purpose under heaven. There's a time to tear down. There's a time to build up again. Do you know what time it is? There's a time to weep and a time to laugh. There's a time to mourn. There's a time to dance. There's a time to turn your cell phone off. and not just during church. I mean like for a day. And then there is a time to turn it back on again. There's a time to look at your calendar and notice that, you know what? I could be a lot more generous with my time. The rhythm of my life is that I've become so self-absorbed that I don't give any of my time away. I'm not doing nearly what I could do. And then there's a time to look at your calendar and go, I have to learn to say no. There is a time to go to the video store and rent that stupid movie and call your stupid friends and laugh at the same stupid place in the movie that you've laughed at every time you've laughed at it before because there's a time to laugh. Do you know what restores you? Do you know what restores you? What recharges your batteries. Now, as you're thinking about that, don't assume that if what restores you is the stupid movie, laughing with your friends, don't assume that if it's just plain fun, that somehow doesn't count that it isn't sacred. Because there is a time for that. Now, it's not always time for that, but sometimes it is. Remember this in the story when God is giving the law, particularly the Ten Commandments, but the whole Pentateuch, the whole Torah, the five first books of the law. The people were just coming out of slavery. They knew no other way to live but as slaves. And so God says, you know, you need to learn some other rhythms. And so in places like Leviticus 23 and Deuteronomy 14, there were places where God would command them to have a feast, to have a party. Some of you don't need that command. But if you've been living as a slave, you do. Deuteronomy 14, it was the best food and the best wine. invite your best friends, and it was called holy unto the Lord this time you laughed and danced and sang for joy because there's a time for that. Here's the Sabbath question. Do you know what time it is? Do you know your own rhythms? Second noticing in that story in Mark's gospel is the disciples didn't get it. But they would because they would learn. Maybe they would learn like you and me. Sometimes by doing it wrong, by going too far, and in the depletion of the soul, having gone too far, you know what happens? You often come up hungry for a different kind of life, for a different rhythm of life. like the Buchanan guy who wrote the book I read from who learned how to do Sabbath in the crucible of breaking it. I learned Sabbath the hard way by thinking I didn't need a rhythm. And sometimes their rabbi, Jesus, would teach them simply by being who he was. I wasn't always sitting down and, here, fill in the blank here. Anyway, that's a whole other talk. Fill in the blank discipleship. Jesus died on a... You're formed. Anyway, the rabbi would teach them simply by being who he was with them. By getting up and not... I'm getting up now to have devotions. He would get up. I don't care if you come or not. I'm going to go over here. And then they would begin to notice. The disciples would... There's something about that being alone with the Father thing that seems to restore you. And one day the disciples came and said, Jesus, would you teach us how to do that? Would you teach us that rhythm? of being quiet and being alone and being with the Father and learning how to pray. And so Jesus taught him how to pray. But a lot of how he taught him how to pray was just say, come watch how I do it. Listen to this rhythm. Follow this rhythm. Mark chapter 6, verse 30. The disciples had been at it for a while. Jesus wasn't with them, so they came in from this expenditure of ministry energy. When the disciples gathered together, verse 30, with Jesus, and they reported all that they had done and all that they had taught, and then Jesus said to them, I'm going to just teach you something about rhythm here. Come away. Come on, let's do it now. Let's do it now. Come away by yourselves to a solitary place and rest. For there were many people coming and going, and they hadn't had time to eat, so they went away into a boat to a solitary place by themselves. Because there's a time to engage, and there's a time to disengage, Do you know what time it is? Third noticing is this, that what restored Jesus in Mark 1.35 was silence and solitude with the Father in prayer. In your mind, just kind of watch him there. Praying, being quiet, being alone. Here's my question. Do you know how to do that? How to be, just be with the Father with no noise, with no talking, with no... Do you know how to be with the Father that way? Would you like to learn? Does the fact that Jesus did that, the Son of God, does the fact that Jesus did that and needed to do that say anything to you about our need? To learn how to move into solitude and silence and being with the Father that way in prayer. Because it's a pretty significant part of the rabbi's way. See, there is now, therefore, a Sabbath rest for the people of God. It begins with a day. Genesis 2, Exodus 20. A Sabbath day that you put a boundary around. But when that day is fully integrated into life, it becomes a rhythm. A rhythm made visible in the actual life of our Rabbi Jesus, who said, Come, you guys, follow me, all of you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you a real rest. But it won't be because you're taking naps all day long. It will be about a rhythm. And it won't be a magic wand, this rhythm of life. There's actually some work involved in learning how to rest. And the work is this. Take my yoke upon you. Take my way, my rhythm, and learn this way from me. For I'm gentle and humble in heart. And in this way of living, you will find rest for your souls. Lord, teach us your ways. If I were to give you an assignment today, it would be simply this, to engage yourself in these questions. What's the rhythm of your life? Some of you haven't thought of it. You know, it occurred to me, we were talking about this before the service, that there's a number of you, and I hope you let this in as well, there's a number of you who have this rhythm. You have rhythm, and you just have it. You do it instinctively. You need to let that in too. You know what? I kind of have this, and I didn't know it was this. I didn't know it was this holy. Because I kind of know when it's time to laugh and when to stop. And when to really pour it on and when to back off. But do you know what time it is? Because it's time for some of you actually to do something and quit resting. To serve someone. Of course, to me, in the context even of this talk on rest and inviting you into that rhythm, and many are out of control because they never rest, that some can do a lot more than they think. You're not even near your limits. But it's time for others to cease striving and know that you're not God. And to wonder why you can't cease striving, and that's the work you have. It's a weird thing. Have you noticed that I'm sitting on a stool? Probably not. It really is a weird thing, you guys. I felt like sitting down kind of fit the rhythm. I'm never going to, I'm not going to promise not to use that word again for like six months, okay? I'm wearing it out today. But sitting down fit the rhythm. But it also is a symbol of something that really is significant and really part of integrated Sabbath. And that is this, that it is possible to live our lives from a place of rest while we're doing work. And there you are. I don't know if you've arrived. And doing this today was in some ways a discipline for me. I have to work today. I'm working right now. This is preaching. And sitting is a way to say, do it today from a place of rest. Which doesn't mean, by the way, when I'm running back and forth, that I'm not. I can tell. I told you last week. I can tell the difference in my own spirit when I'm working from a place of rest and confidence in God that I don't have to make anything happen. And God, bring us there because that's where we want to live. Would you stand with me as we close? Holy Spirit, we invite you into our restless places. And I pray that you'd give us courage to go there and wonder what that's about. And to get our heads around and our arms around these paradoxes that entering into rest is actually a lot of work because we have to do some thinking. And we have to start wondering why we're so incapable of having rhythm and how we're out of balance. And we have to tell the truth about the soil of our own heart and the places where we're divided and split for worry and pursuit of things that don't matter once we think about them. Lord, this is on one hand, it's so simple. On the other, it'll just change our lives forever. Or as we consider these weeks, what it means to follow you as our rabbi, you know, I didn't expect this one. But here we are, and so we, our people, want to follow you here into a rhythm of life that knows what time it is so we can live this life fully and freely and productively our whole life long in the context of your kingdom. And all God's people said, amen.
