Come have your way among us. We welcome you here, Lord Jesus. And if we could meet with you this morning, Lord, that would be enough for our souls, and it would sustain us, and it would thrill us. And so we ask you to come, as you have in worship, through your word. In your name, amen. Well, like probably many of you, I come to the end of a new year with some mixed emotions. I've had some ups and some downs, like most of you, I guess. For me, this hasn't been a year of tremendous highs or devastating lows. It's been a pretty even year. For some of you, it may have been a year of real highs or real lows. But there's something about coming to the end of a new year, or the end of a year and the start of a new year, that makes me reflect. It stirs something in me. I don't quite understand it. Birthdays do the same thing to me. Another year has passed. And I think it has to do with how quickly it's gone by. I mean, I can get the highs and lows. I understand that. But how fast it goes by. It just seems crazy to me how quick it goes by. I heard a speaker once say that life is like a roller coaster. And, you know, I think they're right. I'm a roller coaster guy, okay? I worked down at Camp Snoopy before I came to Open Door. It's a good qualification for being a pastor. and I helped oversee the rides down there and that was back when we just had one roller coaster and for this illustration, that roller coaster doesn't work. That's way too tame of a roller coaster. There's no high drops or killer turns or anything like that. But if you've been out to Valley Fair and you've ridden the wild thing, I think that is a little like life. You know how it goes. You get in the thing and you're sitting there and all of a sudden this big old harness comes over your head and air locks you in. And you're strapped there. And you're usually riding with someone else, typically someone you're willing to die with. And the ride starts out, and you start climbing up this hill, and it's going so slow, isn't it? It's like barely moving. It's just up this hill. It's this long hill. You can see it. And it's like you look around, you can see everything, and everything is so small, and it's moving so slow. and you think, this is going to last forever. This ride is going to last forever. It's like, I'll be on here. This is wonderful. And that's how it felt when I was younger. Life is great. It's going to last forever. But you know what happens as you're going up that hill? All of a sudden, you get this feeling something is about to change, right? And you look and you see the people who you used to be able to see in front of you we're slowly like disappearing over what appears to be some type of a drop off. And then it happens to you. And it's over. Just that quick. The whole thing's done. And before you knew what happened, you're like, what happened? Just a second ago, I was like climbing this thing, and it was going to last forever. And it's done? it's over? And that's how it feels at the end of another year. Just that quick. Another year has gone by. I can handle the highs and the lows. The ups and the downs. The good and the bad. It's part of life. But I can't seem to grasp how quickly it goes by. And so I reflect. I reflect on another year. Because there's something in me and I think something in you that says if I could just get this ride to slow down a little bit. You see I love the ride. I love life. I love being engaged in life. And I'm not just talking about love and life like my heart pumping blood and my lungs breathing air. Although that is a plus, I think, to the whole thing. I'm talking about really being engaged in life, being present in life. I love being present to what's going on. I love the moments in life where you connect with someone or something in such a way that it's almost as if time stands still. And there's something in you that goes, this is what life is about. This is what life was supposed to be. This is who I am supposed to be. I'm grateful for moments like that in 2006. I'm grateful for people. I'm grateful for all the moments that seem to be as they're supposed to be. But let's be honest. When we reflect, what else do we get? We get disappointment, don't we? We get disappointment. I'm disappointed that I didn't exercise very much this year. I'm disappointed the Vikings aren't going to the Super Bowl this year. I'm disappointed that some unforeseen expenses came up and ruined my financial plan. I'm disappointed that I still struggle with being organized and managing my time. I'm disappointed I didn't eat healthier foods. When I reflect back, I'm disappointed this year that sometimes I wasn't more disappointed. And I'm also disappointed that at other times I was too disappointed. It's a little confusing. Some of it's a little more serious. I'm disappointed that it took me so long to realize that a friend was hurting. I'm disappointed at the amount of time I spent returning emails or watching TV instead of talking with my wife or playing with my kid. Knowing that this ride is going to go so fast, I'm disappointed at how much of it I waste on things that don't really matter. I'm disappointed that I choose to give my time and my attention, my passion and my energy to things that aren't really meaningful, sometimes are sinful. I'm disappointed. And you know, there's a really good thing about disappointment. There's a good part of it. It can help you want something different. and that's why we can't stop at just reflecting. Sometimes you have to sit in the reflecting. You really do. And you have to feel the weight of the disappointment and the pain if you're ever gonna change, if you're ever gonna want something different. But the point of reflecting is to want more, is to want something different. And so this weekend and next weekend as well, I wanna invite you to wonder, to wonder with me, to think about this. I wanna invite you to reflect, but also to dream, to hope, to get a vision, to get a picture of how things could be different in your life. You see, I've come to believe we can slow the ride down. We can. Now, it's still going to go fast. Don't get me wrong. We are eternal beings, so it shouldn't surprise us that a mere 70, 80, 90 years flies by. For eternal beings, it's a pretty short period of time. So it is going to go fast, but we can slow it down because I think that the way we spend our days, and if we spend those days, the way we spend our days affects the speed of the days. And if we spend those days on meaningful things, our days will be slower and far sweeter than they are. So what would it mean for things to change? Well, Jesus illustrates this in the book of Matthew, chapter 7. Now, Jesus doesn't talk about roller coasters, probably because the people would have went, huh? He talks about building a house. All right, Matthew chapter 7. Jesus talks about building a house, and here's what he says. Jesus is talking to the crowd about a wise man who built his house on the rock. Verse 25 says, The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against the house, yet it did not fall because it had a foundation on the rock. It was a well-built house. Jesus then says there was another man he was a foolish man and he built his house on the sand verse 27 the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against the house and it fell with a great crash that house wasn't built so well I remember as a little kid in Sunday school singing the song do you remember the song? anybody? the rains came down and the floods came up come on, come on The rains came down and the floods came up. The rains came down and the floods came up. And the house on the rock stood firm. Right? And then they did the whole thing. The rains came down, floods came up. And the house on the sand went flat. Right. Then, Joel, where's Joel? Leading worship is not hard. I don't know what that's about. That's pretty simple. Wow. Wow. Anyway. Okay, Mrs. Olson then did something that just, she always said the same thing. So I said, now children, let me ask you a question. Where would you want your house to be built? On the rock or on the sand? And we all thought she was a little loopy because who in their right mind would want their house built on the sand when it was going to go splat? I mean, nobody would. I mean, that's just crazy. Never seemed to get the point of the story, okay? Never seemed to get that Jesus wasn't talking about building a house. He was talking about building a life. But I never seemed to get that part. I seemed to miss it, which makes perfectly good sense then why the first time my wife and I ever went to buy a house, I asked the realtor on three different occasions, do you think this house is more built on rock or built on sand? To which he said, why are you asking? And I said, well, it's like this. the rains will come down and the floods and he he thought I was loopy so I never I never seem to get the point Jesus is talking about building a life you see he's talking about you and he's talking about me I'm in the process of building a house but it's not a house it's a life and the ultimate question for you and for me is what kind of house are we building? What kind of life are we building? What kind of people are we becoming? And I'm not talking about, and I'm not making fun of the typical New Year's resolutions, you know, lose weight, quit smoking, get organized. The quit smoking one, I did that this last year. I never have smoked, but that's the way you do it, by the way, is you pick something you never do. Okay, it works every time then, okay. I saw a couple of you out there going, oh my gosh, our pastor smokes. No. Anyway, I'm not talking about the typical New Year's resolutions. When the Bible talks about change, when the Bible talks about becoming a different person, it's talking about our heart. It's talking about the deepest part of us, The truest you. Your spirit. Your heart. Who are you becoming in the deepest part? Because make no mistake about it, you are building a life. I'm building a life. You and I are becoming certain kinds of people deep within our hearts. We are being built. It says in Romans chapter 12, verse 2, it says this. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Both the word conform and transform speak of being formed, being shaped. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world. Don't just go along with it. Don't comply with the established way. Instead, be transformed. Be truly changed in your character and nature. So in regard to what we're talking about today, what would it mean to conform to the way of this world? Well, among other things, I think it would mean just going along with the way most people think about life. False beliefs. Things like, I can't really change. They can't really change. There's nothing I can really do about it. It's not that big a deal. It's just who I am. Life just happens. You know, for much of my life, even though I was a follower of Jesus, I thought that way. I thought the same way. And I kind of got caught in these two extremes. And try these on for yourself once. I got caught in these two extremes. And neither one of them led to a life that was full of love and joy. The first extreme was this. I grew up being taught that there was absolutely nothing I could do to earn God's love. There's nothing I could do to earn salvation. Absolutely true. But somewhere in there I also caught a message that said, if I'm going to become a different kind of person, it was up to me. If I was going to really change, it was up to me. Well, what that did was that created all kinds of pressure that God never intended. It led to me striving and trying hard. It led to all kinds of guilt for not making it, not cutting it. It was an extreme that I couldn't make it. But there's another extreme that also didn't lead to life for me. The other extreme was this. It said this. It said, it's not up to me. True. And it's all about God's grace. True. And I can't earn God's love through my performance. True. Good. Someone's catching on, Frank. You're catching on. Good. Everyone else is going to join you. I can't make myself into a better person. True. So really I have no role in who I'm becoming. False. Very good. I wanted to see if you were awake this morning. False. I absolutely have a role. But the other extreme, one extreme was it's all up to me. The other extreme was I don't have a role in it. And so I just sat back and felt like it's all up to God. I absolutely have a role in this. You see, there's a third way. it's not up to you and it's not like you're a passive person there's a third way it's called partnership and it's what the scripture teaches it's about a partnership it's what Pastor Dave was talking about a few weeks ago when he used the windsurfing illustration it's what Paul is talking about in Colossians when he says this Paul says do not lie to each other since you have taken off your old self with its practices and have put on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its creator. Here's a question. Who does Paul say is taking off the old self? You. We. We're doing that. Who is putting on the new self? We're doing that. We have to do that. He doesn't do that for us. We do it. Now, does that mean that God doesn't have a role in it? Absolutely not. You see, there would be no new self without God. He creates the new self. but we're partners in this thing and he asks us to take off the old self and to put on the new self. We are not passive observers. We are partners. It's what Jesus says in Luke chapter 6. A student is not above his teacher but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher. Who are the students? We are. Who's the teacher? He is. We cannot be trained without our teacher but he can't train someone who doesn't want to be trained or who doesn't show up for the lesson. It's a partnership. We do it together. This is something I think we as a church need to just make really clear. There is absolutely nothing you or I can do to earn our salvation, to earn God's love, to keep God's love. It's absolutely a gift and it's for free. But we are not passive observers in our transformation. Instead, we are dependent partners who enter into this life, who are called to walk a path of life where our spirit, our inner life, is being changed. It's being formed in a way that's genuinely right and good, that looks like Jesus, that's aligned with God and directed by God. That would be the best life. And I taste that from time to time. And it's really, really good. And I hope and pray that as you get a vision for this next year, you could wonder about how could your life be different? Can you see it? Can you taste it? Before we move on, I want to say there's probably many reasons why people fail at resolutions or desiring to change. For me personally, I've come up with two main ones. I think I overestimate and I think I underestimate. I overestimate at how much I can change in two weeks. You know what it's like? I hear a sermon. I hear a song. I read the first two chapters of a book, and I think, that's it. There it is. That's the missing. That's what I've been looking for. I am a different person now that I know that. And I think I've changed. I'm fired up. And what do I do? I start telling everybody how I've changed. I start telling everyone, boy, if you just read this chapter of this book, it'll change your life. It did. It changed my life last week. I'm a different person now. just a little piece of advice. If you do experience something profound, I'm just learning this. I'm figuring this out slowly but surely. If you experience something really profound with God, it might be wise to just hold on to it for a while and not tell anybody. You might share it with a dear friend, but sometimes I wonder when I look at my life, if God wouldn't say, Al, you ask for intimacy with me. And so what do I do? I draw you close, and I do something intimate with you. And what do you do? You blab it all over. You tell everybody about it. Why don't you let you and me grow a little bit? It's called the discipline of secrecy, and I'm learning, and I'd encourage you as well. So I tend to overestimate how much I can change in a week or two, but on the other hand, I underestimate how much I could change in a year or two. how different things could be. And so when I don't see change in that first week or two, I give up. I quit. I'm not in it for the long haul. You have a short fuse, get angry really quick, it's probably not going to change in a week. It's probably going to take some time. But if you walk with Jesus, you enter into this, a year from now, I think you could be a different person. You have all kinds of deep-seated judgmentalism stuff inside you. Probably not going to change from here in one message. But a year or two from now, walking with Jesus, I think you could be a different person. I know you could. You find it hard to trust God with your finances and become a generous giver? Well, hang out with Jesus. He'll show you eventually that life is in giving. That's where the joy comes from. It's a partnership, and we're in it for the long haul. Don't overestimate. Don't underestimate. Just be a dependent partner. So how's this going to happen? Well, first things first. It starts by entering through a door. But the door isn't a door. The door is a person. And it's the person of Jesus Christ. He says in John chapter 10, I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. Life is found in Jesus. And the place to start is by putting your trust in Jesus Christ and going, I can't do this. I've got to go a different way. My only hope is you. And that's where life starts. It's in Jesus. Once you've entered through that door, then you've got to get a vision. You've got to get a picture of what he could make your life into, of who you could become. You've got to get a picture. I'm not talking about life like easy street or lap of luxury. In fact, most of the time Jesus seems to indicate that that isn't high on his priority list. Instead, it's about your inside life. It's about love, joy, peace, even in the midst of stuff that you shouldn't have love, joy, and peace, most people would think. But you can. You can be a different person. Back to Jesus building the house. The promise is not that if you follow Jesus, the tornado won't hit your house or the storm won't hit your house. That's not the promise. The promise is that you can become the kind of person who can face that storm and have a solid foundation. Okay, let's get really practical. Here's the first thing I want you to wonder about this week. Next week, as we come to the communion table, we're going to have an experiential opportunity for you to really think through this stuff. but I want you to wonder about it. It starts this week. Wonder about this. Take some time this week to wonder about your life, specifically to wonder about how could it be different? How could it change? Wonder with God about it. Ask God to give you a picture, a mental picture of how something in your life that isn't like his character could become like his character, how it could change. Ask God to give you a picture of what needs to change, how you'd get from here to there. What would be the difference in those two things? The first time I think I ever did this, I love this story because in my life, it was extremely concrete. It was like, duh, okay? I was standing in a gas station, and I was the third person in line, and there was a woman with three little kids trying to pay her bill, and she was one of these people who was paying with like nickels and dimes and quarters, right? And she's trying to count them out, and it's driving me crazy because I'm in a hurry. And I can just feel it welling up in me. Have you ever been in that kind of a deal? And the kids are grabbing candy from the shelf and putting it up on the counter. And she's trying to gain control of the situation. She looks really tired, really frustrated. She's trying to explain to the cash register person that, you know, I'm not buying all this. And she's telling this kid, you know, put that back. but as that kid puts it back, this kid's putting stuff up, and she's trying to gain control of it. The whole time, I just get more and more frustrated. And I'm just like, oh, this parent, she needs to know. All of you that are parents, you know, you've got to be decisive in these situations. I mean, you've got to say, no candy, period. I mean, you've got to just really put the hammer down. If you waffle, if you waffle even a little bit, they'll nail you, you know, and she was kind of waffling. I'll be honest with you, she was waffling. She was doing the old, okay, one piece. No, no, one piece. I'm like, it doesn't work. So she's waffling, and it's getting crazy. And I can just feel it in me. I'm like, get control. Get your life together. And I'm judging her, and I'm just, it's just welling up in me. Well, the guy in between us, who's right in front of me in line, in the middle of all that chaos, he makes eye contact with the cash register person. And he does one of these. He does one of these. he lets him know I'll take care of it the whole thing I'll pay it well the mom was trying to say thank you was trying to gather up her nickels and quarters the kids were throwing more and more candy up on the counter okay and with every candy bar that went up there this guy's smile got bigger and bigger and a few days after that one of the first times I ever did this I said God give me a picture something in my life that maybe isn't like you and maybe what could it be like boom it came right into my mind who do I want to be do I want to be that angry mean stressed out judgmental discontent I would love to be someone who's full of joy and life and has eyes to see things and reacts the way Jesus would react and makes dreams come true for little kids where they get all kinds of candy and puts a smile on a kid's face and makes a mom take the pressure off of her. I'd love to be a blesser of people. And I said, God, I want to be different. I don't want to live that kind of life. I could have rationalized it. It would have been easy to rationalize it. It would have been easy to go, yeah, that guy, he's probably a dentist. He's going to get all that money back. But I didn't. I didn't rationalize it. I didn't ignore it. I sat in it. I noticed it. I saw it. I wondered about it. And I wanted to change. I wanted to become different. Once you have a picture, see, you've got to be able to see it. You've got to be able to see it. and when you can see it, you can want it. And when you want it, you can choose it. You've got to see it, you've got to want it, you've got to choose it. What do you want to be? Who do you want to become? You have to be intentional. But what you're intentional about is very important. Let's go back to the story. Matthew chapter 7. I left two verses out, and I did that intentionally. Look at verse 24. Therefore, anyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. Look at verse 26. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. See, there's a difference. One of them heard the words. Maybe even got a picture. Maybe he saw it. But he didn't practice them. He didn't do anything with them. He might have even seen the picture, there's no indication that he wanted it or chose it or did it. He heard it. It got me thinking. Over the last six months, we as a body have heard some amazing teaching on the fruit of the Spirit. We've heard the Word. So I'm guessing, since we've heard it, there's probably no issues anymore in this church with the fruit of the Spirit. I'm assuming all that comes out of us now is love and joy and peace and self-control. No. Because it isn't just about hearing it. It's putting it into practice. The first step is hearing it. You've got to hear it. You've got to see it. That's just the first step. You have to do something about it. Not perfectly. That's why it says practice. Whoever puts these words into practice. If you've ever been on a team or music or anything, practice means you make mistakes. You're going to make mistakes in practice. It's not about that. God will do his part, but we are partners in this. Don't try to do his part. The beauty of it is this. When you actually say yes to this, he will do his part. The amazing grace that we talk about really will be there for you when you fall on your face. And the unconditional love really will be there for you. In fact, I think you experience it more. As Dallas Willard says, if you're really going to walk with Jesus, you are going to burn up grace like a 747 burns up jet fuel. You need grace if you're really going to take this serious. And he is faithful. He will provide the grace, the unconditional love. It's awesome. It doesn't change. He really does do it. So what do you do? Well, I don't know specifically what you're supposed to do with this. But what I do know is typically what I've seen and what others have seen is it has to do with three things when it comes to what do you do. There's a bridge to get from where you are now to where you want to be. From here to there. What is the bridge? Typically it has to do with these three things. Relationships, experiences, and some type of practices. Relationships, experiences, and practices. These are three areas that are means to an end. And I want you to take this, really think this through this week and wonder about this. Are there some relationships, experiences, or practices as you start a new year that it's like, you know what, I want, I got the picture. I want to get from here to there. Now what's it going to take? It probably has to do with one of these three things. Relationships. Who knows you? I mean, who really knows you? Who is involved in your life in such a way that you can say to them, you know what, I've got a picture. See, there's this part of me that isn't anything like the character of Jesus And it's killing me I hate it I don't want to be this kind of person But I've got a vision of who I can be But I'm going to need someone In my life who I can talk to about this Who will be in it with me Better yet, do you have anybody you can say I need you to speak into my life I need you to tell me When you see me Bragging gossiping, slandering, having a pity party. I don't want to be this kind of person. And it means I need a relationship with someone who I know loves me, but who will say it to me straight. And will do it with grace, but you'll tell me the truth about what you see in me. Relationships, we can't do life without them. Just so you know, sometimes, I don't know if any of you ever wonder this, but as a church, do you ever wonder why do we do what we do? Like why do we pick the things we pick? What is it about, why do we have the things that we have around here, activities and stuff? Well, it's about these three things. See, we can't change anybody's life, but the reason me or someone else gets up here every week and says we're gonna let you know about three things that are happening in our body this week, you know, coming up. The announcements that you're all excited about every week to hear. Well, it isn't just because as a church we want to be busy. Or all churches need to be doing stuff. It's about relationships, experiences, practices. Why would we say, guys, consider coming out on a Tuesday night and being a part of a thing with some other men. Ladies, consider joining some other ladies throughout the week. Why would we do? It's about relationships. You've got to have people in your life. Why do we have community gatherings? So you could meet some other people. Start to do relationships. same with experiences experiences get out of your comfort zone take a risk try something new God uses experiences as a bridge to get from here to there again why do we as a church do this do the stuff we do well we do it because we think experiences are huge why would we have a group of guys a ministry called Hearts in Action that goes out once a month to help the needy well because we care that's true, but also we know that an experience like that can change your life. You hear me get up here and talk about we have three classes coming up. We have praying the Psalms and life in the spirit and transformed into fire. Is that because we have good teachers who just love to teach? No. It's because we know that joining a class, being in a class, may be the experience that helps you move from here to here, that helps you become a different kind of person. If it doesn't, please don't waste your time. But you need to take action. You need to step into some experiences or practices or relationships. Missions trips. Talk about an experience. If I had to list out top three experiences in my life that have helped transform me, that have been instrumental in me becoming a different kind of person, right at the top there is Haiti. is the years that I went to Haiti. Is this your year? Maybe this year you'd go on a missions trip. Do you want to get from here to there? You're going to need to do something. Is there a relationship? Is there an experience? For some of you, an experience this year might be seeing a counselor. That'd be an experience. What are you going to put yourself in the middle of? Serving in the kids' ministry, tutoring in North Minneapolis, being a part of a meal team that takes meals to others in need. serving in a soup kitchen. It doesn't need to be here, but what are the experiences in your life that are giving God a chance at your heart? Finally, practices. These are simply consistent habits you develop that, again, God uses to partner with you in becoming more like Him. Now, as I was putting this message together, I realized some of you here this morning don't need this message about reflecting and about dreaming and then putting things into action. You don't need this message because you've developed a practice of reflecting. Personally, I don't do New Year's resolutions anymore. And the reason is, is because all throughout my year, I am reflecting. I still reflect at New Year's. But I'm making resolutions. I'm making decisions all throughout my year of becoming a different kind of person. So New Year's isn't this big, you know, my one shot to get it right. Okay? Well, for some of you, establishing a practice of reflecting this year. Taking a little bit of time each week to get alone with God. And just, I want to look at my life. How did this last week go? God, what needs to be different? Give me a picture. Give me a vision. Establishing that kind of a practice would be huge for you this year. Maybe for you, the whole thing of developing a practice of quiet. and just getting still. In a few weeks, we're going to begin an exciting time together and a new journey that Pastor Dave is going to lead us on, a journey that we're going to call Following the Rabbi. Maybe for some of you, a really good thing to wonder would be, what might God want to do with me during this time in the Word? And maybe for some of you, your practice would be one of being more present to what the rabbi would be teaching you along the way. Of course, that would mean more than just showing up on the weekend. and hearing what Dave's rabbi has said to him. It would mean you saying, I want to hear the voice of the rabbi. And a practice for you might be, I'm going to read through a gospel as Dave's going through this. And each week I'm going to sit and go, I want to hear the voice of God myself. Maybe it would be taking a note each week of a verse that Dave shares with us and saying, I'm going to sit in that verse this week. I'm going to sit with it and wonder about it and pray about it. I don't know what your action would be, but to partner with God and his great plan for changing your heart is the adventure that he calls us to. You see, every one of us, every single one of us, one day is gonna have a storm hit us. And every one of us, one day, is gonna step off of the ride. The ride will come to an end. The storm will hit. The question is, what kind of person will you be when the storm hits? What kind of person will you be when the ride comes to an end? I love roller coasters. I love life. But my ride will come to an end, and so will yours. I'll tell you what. I know who I want to be when the ride comes to an end. I know who I want to be. I want to be the kind of person who, when my ride comes to an end, I'm not shocked that it's over. I'm not startled that the storm has hit my house for I haven't just heard his words I've put them into practice and I've become a different kind of person I'm not full of regret that it's come to an end instead I'm a man who's well aware of how quickly the ride goes I knew it would be quick but I wrote it to the fullest and I want to be a man who one day when that time comes I'm going to step off of the ride and I'm going to look at the people who are close to me who rode the ride with me my wife my kid my dear friends and I'm going to look at them and I'm going to say wow what a ride what a ride I'm going to invite our friend Dave Pegtall to come. And he's going to sing a song with you that he wrote. And I just invite you to wonder as he sings. Let's pray. What would I give to be pure in heart and pure in flesh and bone? What would I give to be pure in heart? I'd give everything I own. I'd rid my whole house of its demons of lust And open the windows of trust And out of those windows all fear will have flown And I'd give everything I own And what would I give for the words of God To come tumbling from the throne What would I give for the words of God I'd give everything I own I'd open my head and they'd roll right in When I opened my mouth they'd roll out again They'd uproot the weeds of the deeds I have sown And I'd give everything I own And what would I give for my children's strength On the day they stand alone I mean, what would I give for their strength to stand firm I'd give everything I own I've wasted my life in accomplishing things Ignoring the giver of wings Lord, teach them to fly to the foot of your throne And I'd give everything I own All I've accomplished in the titles I hold My passions, possessions, possessions and gold To God they must look like a thimble of foam And it's everything I own Dirty rags is all I own So I stand before God With my truckload of hay He just laughs but says There is still a way Because Father, forgive Are the words Jesus moaned When he gave everything he owned When he gave everything he owned So what would I give to be pure in heart For the known to be unknown I mean, what would I give to be born again? Let's pray. God, I pray that you would give us a vision, that you'd help us to see the life that you make available to us. I pray you'd help us to see it, to want it, to choose it, and to do it. God, for some here who may be sensing that what you would be calling them to would be impossible. I pray you would not let them be content with staying the same. God, you are the way, the truth, and the life. And you will give us what it takes to live this life to the fullest. Amen. Amen.
