We have too often assumed that you have to plow around non-Christian leadership when our assumption should be that Christ can win the hearts of everyone. He did when he came. He has done it through the ages. And he's still by far the best thing going today. When Peter said, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. he was stating the dilemma for anyone who faces Christ. So we need to understand that the way forward is through the transformation of leaders and that sin and unfaith are luxuries which we simply cannot afford, never have been able to afford it. I mean, think of what terrible things leaders have done to humanity. And compare it to the class of those who have truly been blessings to humanity. Leaders are lost too. They're lost too. And they need to hear a saving gospel. And just the fact that they ride around in chauffeured cars and get on the news and all that stuff is totally meaningless. Because in their heart, they have the same vacuum as everyone else. And in fact, many times the person who winds up on the street is the one who has found the burdens of leadership intolerable. And frankly, it's a relief to sleep in a cardboard box and eat out of the dumpster if you've had to carry the world on your own shoulders long enough. But we need to understand that when we approach people with the gospel of the kingdom of God, we are approaching them with good news for everyone, especially those at the human top. so I just wanted to tack that on to that prayer. Hallowed be thy name at my desk. Now then, I've talked about our purpose in ministry. We've talked about our resources. Now I want to go more directly at what Jesus is dealing with, and we can... This is a new machine. Finally soaks in. Jesus wants to give us a different heart and a different inside. Now the heart is the center of our being. It is the executive center of the self. It's the will. It's also the spirit. Heart, will, and spirit are three names that refer to the same thing with a different meaning. Heart, will, and spirit. They refer to the same part of you. And what Jesus wishes to do is to give us a heart that is different, and spiritual formation is the process that we go through to get there. And I am going to come to disciplines now, okay? But there's little point in just approaching disciplines directly. You have to understand how they fit into the picture. Otherwise, it will just be another new trick has come to town, and pretty soon that trick will be over, and we'll be back to life as usual. And the disciplines can transform the heart. And in transforming the heart, they transform the whole character. So now I want to just take you on a little tour of Matthew 5, very quickly, Matthew 5, 20, and following. If you would look at Matthew 5.20, what does 5.20 say? This is important enough for us to just take time now and mark the verse, okay? This is one of the verses where Jesus says something of stunning importance about entering the kingdom. What does it say? Unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you have not entered the kingdom of God. Now remember, the kingdom of the heavens is not heaven when you die. It's not talking about going to heaven when you die. It's talking about something that will take care of that. It'll take care of that. It'll take care of issues like forgiveness of sins. which is fundamental you can't bypass that and so all of the things that are often preached as the gospel in conservative churches or evangelical churches it takes care of that, it includes that the great strength of the conservative evangelical message over against the liberal or left wing message was it held on to something that was absolutely essential but it omitted other things that were absolutely essential so that in theological terms our doctrine of salvation is often treated as entirely a matter of justification regeneration is omitted and sanctification becomes a puzzle and glorification a kind of distant blur out there somewhere. I really don't know if I could. But I will try. I'll say something close to it. See, our doctrine of salvation has been reduced to justification which deals with the issue of forgiveness. But what is omitted is regeneration, which is new life, not just forgiveness, but new life. And sanctification appears then as a kind of disconnected puzzle. There's no continuity between justification and sanctification when you omit regeneration. And glorification is a kind of distant blur. What it means has no real sense to it. That's why the whole idea of heaven is very troublesome to many people. I had two conferences some years back running in which these were for Methodist, retired Methodist ministers and their wives. two conferences in which a woman, different woman, stood up and said, I don't want to go to heaven. And as I spoke with them about it, it became clear they thought they were going to have to be pastors' wives for eternity. And I said to them, there aren't even going to be any pastors in heaven. There will be ex-pastors in heaven, but there won't be any pastors. So even pastors are going to have to find out something different to do. So, you know, that justification, regeneration, sanctification, glorification, those are big theological terms, but they have real-life meaning. And if we don't start with regeneration, which lays the foundation for forgiveness of sins. Now, that may get us, I'm not going to follow that off into the theological distance, but try thinking about it that way. That regeneration lays the foundation for forgiveness of sins. It's because we have new life that God says sins are forgiven. Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness. See, if you understand that faith is actually a matter of taking on a new life. That's what faith is. Faith in Jesus Christ reestablishes our connection with God through which new life flows. And on the basis of that, forgiveness of sins follows. Because God says, as he did with Abraham, I accept this as something better than never having done anything wrong. This is better. Having confidence in me, God looked at Abraham and said, This is better. I will accept this. I would rather have someone who believes in me and did something wrong than someone who never did anything wrong and didn't believe in me. Well, these are challenging ideas, I know. But what I'm talking about here is Matthew 5, 20. It says, if you don't go beyond the... Now, what's the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees? The righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees is, I never did anything wrong. So it's a righteousness of action. Never did anything wrong. Beyond the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees is not more of the same. It's not you do more of the same. It's that you move into something different. So you're not just a better scribe and Pharisee. You have moved to a different basis. And the basis now is what you are inwardly, not what you do. Because Jesus knew that if you took care of what you are inwardly, what you are outwardly would take care of itself. And that's why he uses metaphors like the good tree and the bad tree about washing the cup on the inside and the outside comes clean automatically. If you wash it on the outside, the inside doesn't come clean automatically, does it? A lesson from the dishwasher. So take care of the inside. So when he says, unless you go beyond the righteous and scribes and the Pharisees, he's saying, unless you move your concern to the level of your heart, you cannot come in contact, enter the kingdom of God, the effective range of God's will. That's where God does business, is at the heart. Now that's the lesson of John 4, isn't it? God is spirit, and he's looking for people who will worship him in spirit and in truth. At the level of the spirit, you cannot lie. Did you know that? You can only lie by using your body. At the level of the spirit, you cannot lie. You have to be truthful. There's no way you can mislead. That's why a little child can't lie. It's because they don't have enough mastery of their face and their body to pull it off. Isn't that right? A little child cannot lie. They learn fairly early. But when they're quite small, they've learned to talk. They can't lie because they can't hide their little souls. See, that's the nature of the child. Old people, when they get to their second childhood, they don't care anyway. Because they've seen it all. They've been there. They've done that. So they're apt to just tell you the truth anyway. But little children cannot because their spirit or their soul is open. So Jesus is saying you have to move to the level of the spirit. Whether you go to worship God in Jerusalem or this mountain or this place or that place, the other doesn't matter in the least. That's on the outside. What matters is who you are inside. And so in John 4, he's reading the woman's inside. And that's what makes her say, when she goes back to town, she says, that man told me everything I did. He didn't tell her everything she did. He just read her soul. And she knew it. And she knew that he knew her. And that she was an open book before God. so now what Jesus says is for example the old law says thou shalt not kill what is killing? Killing is an external action thou shalt not commit adultery if you divorce you must give a woman a pink slip if you swear you must keep your oath and on down the line love those who love you hate those who hate you those are external activities pay back the lex talionis of revenge see all that's in the realm with the external. Now Jesus says, no, you move to the internal. And he starts out by talking about being angry without a cause. No. Why'd he start there? He talks about contempt, using words of contempt, raka. Scholars think that that word comes from the sound you make when you clear your throat to spit. it's pretty close it's an Aramaic word it's a term of contempt anger and contempt it starts there and he's saying you have to deal with that calling people fool fool is a strong word it isn't what we think of it today fool is really a very terrible term of reproach beyond contempt Jesus says don't do that now you see if you are still thinking in terms of scribes and Pharisees you say okay I'll eliminate that so my grandmother would never allow me to call my playmates fools so I said well I'll just think it but I didn't say now you think I would impress God if I just thought it no, wouldn't impress God but see that's the little legalist coming out well okay, I'll arrange that because I'm going to engineer my way and I'm going to get where I want to do and I'm going to do what I want to do I'm the king of my world or I'd like to be and so there I go the whole point of Jesus' teaching is to get you beyond that thinking he gives you a series of things to help you see what kind of heart you need he moves on to going to law with people at the end before that he deals with there being a difficulty and you're doing your religious rituals he says if you realize there's a problem there leave your gift at the altar you may not know that would be utterly radical to do that, that isn't like forgetting you left your car lights on and walking out in the middle of the song and turning them off and coming back this was a very serious matter and the rule was that only a ritual problem could justify the interruption of a ritual it shows you where people tend to get because ritual does get substituted for holiness and Jesus is indicating in this context that that has to be reversed that if you come to give your gift and you realize that there is a problem, you should interrupt the ritual and go take care of the moral. And then come back and give your ritual, give your offering. Now that, see, do you see how he's moving away from I didn't kill them? Now not only am I not angry at them without cause, not only do I not have contempt for them not only do I not call them fools I'm now to the point to where I'm so tender about them that I will interrupt my religious activities to deal with the problem you see how he's distancing himself from I didn't kill and the final move is how to go to law. By the way, that passage doesn't say you shouldn't go to law. It tells you how to go to law. It says you go to law in a loving, tender spirit. You make peace. Possibly you give in. It's a teaching about a heart. And see, this is a case where it isn't your brother that you have some problem with. This is maybe your enemy. And he's teaching you how you go to law with your enemy. Now, the point is not to make sure that you do those little things he's listed. Never get angry with that cause. Never say raka. Or our language probably is something like twit or twerp. You twerp. never call people fools always if you have a problem with your brother and you're in religious ritual be sure to interrupt it and go take care of it and make sure if you go to law that when you go to law you try to solve the problem before you get to court see if you read that legalistically you miss the whole point Those are illustrations of the kingdom heart. Those are illustrations of the kingdom heart. And all of Jesus' teachings, until he gets down to the end of Matthew 5, are illustrations of the heart of love, where he says, be ye teleoi, be ye perfect, be completely functional as your heavenly Father is perfect. That's not an illustration. that's a statement about how we're to be everything else leading up to that are illustrations of what a heart of this type will do it's the heart that Jesus wants to give us oh you didn't commit adultery well but you looked on someone in a way which means you would if you could alright Jesus says same thing you still have the problem and that's an especially important one because of course sexuality and sexual temptation play such a large role in our lives as ministers because we're constantly having to deal with it in people and failures in these areas and it's important to understand what he's saying there he's not laying down another law. He's not saying, now don't look at a woman to lust after her. If you take it that way, then you get, for example, there are periods in the history of the church where people bragged about how long it had been since they had seen a woman, even their mother or their sister. Now you see, that would solve the problem, wouldn't it? Right? I mean, if you can't see them, you can't look at them to lust after them. right and in order to help us understand what he's doing Jesus then gives the teaching if your right hand offends you cut it off if your eye offends you punch it out now do you believe he was advising people to do that you see that was just the opposite of what he was teaching what he was teaching was it didn't matter if you had your eye punched out what you have is in your heart and he was talking to people with a theory of righteousness the Pharisees that said if you can't do the deed you can't sin so cut off everything and punch out everything and you roll into heaven a mutilated stump now I ask you do you think Jesus was suggesting that no you see this is where we this is back to the jackass looking into the mirror right I mean we have to be very careful here we have to understand that Jesus is a teacher and he's doing in this passage what all teachers do he's using a technique called reductio ad absurdum you take a position and you draw its implications if your position is that sin lies in the action what's the logical conclusion make yourself incapable of action and you make yourself incapable of sin right but that is the absurdum which shows the principle to be wrong see his whole teaching is just the opposite you have to change the heart it won't help to mutilate yourself and yet we have had recurrently through the history of Christianity groups we've had one in California I don't know whether you want to include them in the history of Christianity but they would include themselves groups who utilized self-castration as a way of pleasing God now you see how dark the world is where people can take the radiant teachings of Jesus and turn them into something like that miss the whole point okay now in order to get us a little closer to this I want to just use this diagram of the self this is the human being and you won't see that when you look in the mirror either but it's a picture of the essential parts of the self and the center is the spirit or the heart or will I suggest you think of these are the same thing they have different meanings but they refer to the same thing and outside of that is the mind or thought and feelings go together to make up the mind, and then the body beyond that, and beyond that the social realm, and this is essential to every human being. You have all of these, I have all of them, you can't avoid it. And then the soul is the most encompassing element of the self. The soul is that part of the self that makes all of the other parts work together to produce one life. And in many ways, it is the most fundamental. But in other ways, it is the heart that is most fundamental. The heart is, as I say, the executive center of the self. The soul is more like a computer that runs a whole operation. And, you know, the computer that runs a business or something of that sort is, you don't want to hear about it. You just want it to work. You pay attention to it. if it doesn't work or if you want to modify it in some way, then you go through the executive center and you modify the larger operation through modifying the computer. Now, when we speak of spiritual formation, we are, of course, primarily referring to the center. But we have to understand that the center does not work on its own. The center works in conjunction with the whole picture. And the soul, as I've said, is in many ways the deepest part of the self. That's why, for example, in the scriptures, the psalmist, for example, or others, will speak to the soul as if it were another person. Why art thou cast down, O my soul? second person why art thou cast down on my soul why art thou disquieted within me see the psalmist recognizes there's something going on down here at a level that isn't really under his direct control and so instead of just trying to do something with it he exhorts it, he talks to it hope thou in God for thou shalt yet praise him for the health of his countenance or the rich farmer in Luke that Jesus talks about thou hast much goods laid up for thee for many years so will take thy rest so forth because that's there's much more to you and me than we can bring before our mind that we can feel much more and this I picture it as the outer circle because it takes in all the rest of this. Also, it interfaces with what is beyond us. I just put here infinite environment. But the keeping of the soul is in the hands of God, and your soul needs to be well put together because there are all sorts of other things that would like to inhabit you. And we live in an environment, a spiritual environment, where we need to be kept by God. And I believe that every human soul, as Ezekiel says, for God, all souls are mine. And that is God's intention, is that every soul should live in his hand. And yet because of evil there are many broken souls. There are many souls that are permeable to things that are terrible. And I think, for example, abuse of a child often breaks their soul and makes them vulnerable to things that may indeed be irrecoverable. Certainly would be from any point of view except God's point of view and redemption. So, now, when we think of spiritual formation, it all begins with the Word and Spirit of Christ coming in through the mind to the Spirit. And the natural response would be to evoke faith in Christ, which reestablishes communion with God. Now, that is something that is far beyond our ability to do. That is the new birth. They're born from above at that point. That's regeneration. That means now there is a new life in the center of the soul. In the spirit. There's a new life. Once that new life is established there, then it begins to work. And unless it begins to work with God, the remaining territory of the self will not be taken. It will not be taken back from Satan. It will not be reformed and transformed. So, for example, the mind will be filled full of all sorts of ungodly stuff. The feelings will be wicked and running rampant. The body will be following its own life out. What's going on in the soul and in the social relations and all that. See, there'll be all sorts of things that are still wrong there. Now, see, I need to say to you that being born again does not solve all these problems. And it does not put you on an automatic path to spiritual transformation. And I want to just pause on that because that is really fundamental. It does not automatically put you. I'll give you this analogy to think of. The first city that was taken by Joshua was what? Jericho. What happened to the walls of Jericho? They fell down. Was there any other city whose walls fell down after that? No. What did they have to do for the other cities? They had to take them, didn't they? Did they take them by themselves? No. They took them. If God didn't go with them, they had taken them. They found out to their sorrow. But on the other hand, God didn't take them and say, now come on in, guys. See? The walls of Jericho fell down flat. No more. The rest of them, you take them. Jesus said, without me you can do nothing. And I will guarantee you that if you do nothing, it will be without him. It's just that simple. Now, it's not a matter of earning, but it is a matter of acting. We have to act. Ask yourself how many of the miracles of Jesus required that the person assisted do what they could not do. Here's a man with a withered hand. Stretch forth thy hand. Well, it's withered, you see. Here's a man born of four. Take up thy bed and walk. Well, why do you think they carried me in here? I can't do it what do you think if that guy had just said no I can't I'll just lie here he'd still be lying there the man is blind puts mud on his eyes tells him to go wash in the pool of Siloam now I don't know if you know this but the pool of Siloam was a good distance from where he got the mud on his eyes. Most tourists ride down there in a bus. Isn't there someplace closer he could have washed the stuff off? So now, you have to understand this about spiritual disciplines and about the transformation of the self. See, all of this has to be transformed. The function of the spirit is to take the initiative having been brought to life and begin to work with the mind and the feelings and the body and the social relations and the soul to transform them so that they all function well. See, a person who is mentally disturbed, shall we say, always the manifestation is in affect or thought or action. Basically, modern psychology, as we've come to know it, originated out of studies of the hysterical reactions that involved the body. And then dreams. Those are all in those areas. And then dreams and hysterical reactions were taken as reflecting deeper issues in the soul or whatever you want to. It isn't clear what you want to refer to if you're a psychologist here. but in the deeper nature of the self. Non-functionality. Now, the difference between that, what's the difference between that and Peter? Jesus said, Peter, you're going to deny me. You're going to deny me three times before the cock crows. Peter said, no way, Lord. No way. Jesus said, you will. See, Jesus knew this picture. He knew what was in Peter. When Peter thought about himself, he just thought of this part right here. He says, I don't intend to do it. I intend not to do it. So when the moment came, he did it before he could think about it. See? Where was that stuff that made him say, I don't know him? It was out here. It's out there. And he wasn't willing or able to pay any attention to that. So, Jesus in his mercy told him what was going to happen. It was Jesus' mercy that told him. Jesus was teaching him. You remember in that lovely scene by the Sea of Galilee. Jesus asked him three times, do you love me, Peter? Three times. Why three times? In both cases, to deepen Peter's understanding of that whole self out of which he was going to act. And Peter had made a lot of progress. You know the story. You know how Jesus was using one word, agapao. And Peter couldn't quite do it. He couldn't bring himself to use that word. You see, our actions, they all come out of our will, but under the imprint of our thoughts, our social context, our body, our emotions, our soul connects these all together, and our actions come out of that. Our will is the ultimate point of responsibility, but we can't live from our will. We have to live from our whole self. Indeed, we live primarily from our body and our social context. That's what we primarily live from. And that's why Jesus knew that Peter would deny. And, you know, this is so well set up. It wasn't like some big gruff soldier said, are you a follower of Jesus? If you are, I'm going to kill you on the spot. It's a little girl. Little girl. So now this is teaching about what we have to do. We have to change this whole setup. So that's where spiritual disciplines come in. See, spiritual disciplines come in at the point where I have now realized I have to rework this with God. God comes to me in his grace he lives with me but he will not do something unless I do something and so now is the time for me to act I like to represent this with a triangle design that I think nicely summarizes it I call this the golden triangle of spiritual formation because it's worth more than gold if you get the idea and it has of course at the top the actions of the Holy Spirit and these are the new birth of course that's like the walls of Jericho falling down if you wish then places like Romans 8 and Galatians 5 give expression to a process of growth and the fruit of the spirit that comes out of that This is all. I didn't include gifts of the spirit, but that's just a concession to the limitations of space here. All of the activities, the anointings of the spirit and all of those kinds of things go in to the top triangle. And so we need to say that once and for all, this is essential. You can't go anywhere without this. This is the gifts of grace that not only come to us in regeneration, but continue to flow into us. Then if you look at the left-hand bottom angle here, ordinary events of life, that's where I was talking about the place of discipleship. These are the, this is where we live. This is ordinary life. And James, you'll remember, says, Count it all joy when you fall into all kinds of troubles or temptations. why? because they are the occasions on which we can routinely know the presence of the kingdom of God the temptations are the trials of ordinary life which are the occasions where we can know the presence of the kingdom now once again there's no growth apart from these you cannot take a vacation here and run this on your own and grow spiritually because if you do that you will say essentially this is my kingdom over here this is my kingdom and you'll be left to your own and you won't know the reality of the presence of the kingdom and then finally plan disciplines to put on new bowels here you're going to put on bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness and long-suffering disciplines are planned activities that enable you to do what you cannot do by direct effort and I'll put that up in so many words here in a moment let's put it up now and I'll flip this back over there but here's what a discipline is discipline is an activity in my power which enables me to do what I cannot do by direct effort that's the general nature of a discipline that's true if you're lifting weights or learning Spanish or how to play the flute and it is not set aside when we come to the area of grace grace does not set discipline aside. And now you need to go back and think about those cases I gave you where Jesus healed and what he asked people to do, to do what they cannot do. See, we'd like him to do it first and then we'll do it. So Jesus says in John 14, keep my commandments and I'll send another strengthener. And my response is, why don't you send the strengthener first and then I'll keep your commandments. Wouldn't that be a better arrangement? It sounds like a better arrangement to me. But God is interested in what I am prepared to do in turning my kingdom over to him. If I am prepared to do that, then he is going to be there. And being there, he is going to make it possible for me to do what I cannot do by direct effort. So now go back to this one for just a moment. so you have the initiative of god you have your kingdom taken into his kingdom and then you have to the disciplines are ways if you wish you can think about those as ways of getting your kingdom out of yourself getting your kingdom out and so why did peter why did peter deny the lord I want to stop on that and ask you can you translate that into kingdom language why did Peter deny the Lord in kingdom language who did he think was king at the moment that he denied Peter right he had to take charge now in that setting his body didn't send up a message to his spirit saying shall we deny see that's that's why the always fails the fair theical system always fails because we act from our bodies we don't act from our minds we act from our bodies that's a good thing by the way that's one of the reasons why we have a body is so that we can farm out most of the stuff we do to our body think about the person who's driving and they have to think about everything they do when they drive. That person is dangerous. Right? And so they have to practice until they don't have to think about everything they do. We still hope they're thinking about some of the things they're doing. And there may be a problem with that. But still, in any action of any complication at all, like writing, you remember when you were learning to write the alphabet? Remember how you had to try to make an A? And your little grubby fingers would grip that pencil and you would just... No. You see, isn't it wonderful that your body can take over things? Like speaking a language? You don't have to think about it, you just do it. The bad side of that is your body has also learned a lot of bad stuff. And that's why Paul in Romans 7 talks about the sin that is in my members. He says, it is not I, but the sin that dwells in me. You see, we have to understand that he's not begging off. He's explaining something very important. That is that our life runs fundamentally from our body in its social context. So now he has sided with God. Paul has sided with God. His will is on God's side. That's why he says, it's not I, but sin that dwells in me. So now where is sin in that diagram? Where is sin in that one? and the answer is all over the place it's all over the place that's you understand ordinary human relationships you have to understand that a person is not just this little atom but is spread out in all of these dimensions and what is wrong is embedded in there the social situation for example by the very language we use the way we set up our organizations and everything has a lot of wrong and evil that's embedded in it. And if you're going to do what is right and you're in that situation, you have to be prepared to stand like Daniel. And you have to bring the kingdom of God with you. See, we tell the story about Daniel and the lions wrongly. The real story is about the lions in Daniel's den. when Daniel walked into the den it was his and the lions were spectators and when he left I said Oy vey I'm glad that guy's out of here now it's our place again we have to take the kingdom of God into our businesses into our churches, into our communities into our families into our secret life we take it in and there's a process of change and we've begun to really see difference when instead of automatically acting on the side of evil now our body begins to automatically act on the side of what is right. Now that was Jesus on the cross, to go back to the earlier illustration. Why did Jesus say, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do? Because that was him through and through. And you and I are given the privilege of taking the kingdom in our bodies wherever we go. And I will tell you a fact. when you do that you will change the environment around you people will know that something different is in the room your body language the tones of expression and they will find that they do not do certain things when you are there because the kingdom is present in their midst see so now I'm hoping that that sort of ties the vision together. So as ministers, we are living in the kingdom. We have brought or are bringing our whole self increasingly into the kingdom of God. That's what we're doing. And we don't apologize for it. That's our business. That's our business. It is the old song, "'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, just to take him at his word, just to rest upon his promise, just to know, thus saith the Lord, Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him.'" See, now that's in your body. And when temptation comes, you say, why should I be interested in that? Whatever the temptation may be. But you see, you have to have it worked through to the point that you are now, your whole body assumes that what Jesus said is the way things are. And that it's wonderful that it should be that way. And until that point comes, then we're in the position of Paul, as he expresses it in Romans 7, the things that I would that I do not, and the things that I would not that I do. Now, how does that work? Can you see how that works given this diagram and this talk? The things that I would, that's my spirit, right? And it's real, and it's not bad, it's good. Don't say bad things about good intentions. Don't say bad things. Good intentions are much better than bad intentions. If you think the road to hell is paved with good intentions, You ought to see the one that's paved by bad intentions. So let's praise good intentions. Jesus was not condemning good intentions. What he was doing in his teaching over and over, his teaching was to recognize that's not enough. That's like the person who says, well, the walls of Jericho fell down, so we'll just sit here. The person has good intentions. They've been given a vision of Christ. of the love of God in Christ of the forgiveness of sins and they just sit there so Paul when he says the good I would do that I do not and the thing is I would not that I do he's expressing the stage of the person who is still good in spirit but weak in flesh now don't tell me that Paul stayed there all of his life see there's a thing called miserable sinner Christianity we used to call it that that says Mother Teresa and Hitler are just alike inside people never change and that Mother Teresa if you could just know her heart you'd know she was a wicked sinner and Hitler was just he's wicked too but everyone's like that there's a view that people never change inside. And I hope that you will identify that view and think about it. I want to tell you Paul did not stay in that position. If he had, he would never have said, like to the Philippians, the things you've seen and heard in me that do and the peace of God be with you. You would have never talked about, I have fought a good fight. I've finished the course. I've kept the faith. He's referring to the point where ordinary human beings are incapable of doing the good that they know to do, which is pretty well human life, standard human life. Everything from not eating that Twinkie to not being kind when they wanted to be. See, there's the problem with the human will. Jesus comes now and he says follow me follow me into my practices do the things that I did not just what I say and learn from me come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me my yoke is easy my burden is light and you will find rest see that's not the position of someone who has to say the things I would that I do not and the things I would not that I do.
