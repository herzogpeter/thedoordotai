Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Well, how are you? You know, it's the end of July, and most Minnesotans right now are whispering words like this. You know, I'm actually looking forward to the time that I can put on jeans and a sweatshirt. You know, I'm really kind of... And just a month ago, we were saying, oh, we can't wait till it gets warm. So we are a mess, right? And many of you came through these doors with huge pain and huge concerns. And we want you to know that if that's you and you're sitting here and you don't quite know what even noon is going to look like, that God is here and that's why we meet together. That God is a God who just wants to run to you. And so we gather because we don't know what else to do, you know? We sing songs and we sing them out of tune and we preach messages and we hope that they land somewhere. But in the end, if God doesn't come, and if God doesn't move, we just have nowhere to go. Amen? So let's pray as we dive in. Let's pray that I can hold it together, right? Woo! Okay. God, here we are, and here you are. And we're so thankful that we have a God that we can run to. No matter what state of disrepair we're in. no matter what state of losing it or no matter how much in shambles our life is, we have you that we can run to. Past our pretenses and throwing down our masks, we say to you, here I am, messed up, broken, and in need. And you come. So God, come. come with your spirit into this place give us the courage to give you access to our hearts so that you can come in and make yourself home in us and change our lives amen okay if you haven't been around here the last couple of weeks if you've been at the cabin or just gone I really encourage you to get online or buy the CDs. Our senior pastor, Dave Johnson, did what he does so well, and that is stir up all kinds of passion for why we do what we do around here. The last two weeks, he's talked about why we preach and teach and why we worship. And I'm telling you, I wasn't here. I've been gone doing various things, but I listened to them, and I watched one of them when I was running on the treadmill. And I mean, I was just like, I mean, it was like, yes, this is why I'm here. So please, please, please, please listen to those last two talks. You will be glad that you did. Meanwhile, we are in Colossians chapter 3, verse 16. So open your Bibles to that reference if you have them. And again, as I always say, if you have an iPhone or Android, you want to, you know, turn there as well, that's cool. That's fine. If it rings, I might embarrass you. but that's the risk that you take if you don't put it on airplane mode so do that now Colossians 3 16 let's read it together well I can read it to you if you want to read it out loud that's that's fine otherwise I'll just read it to you let the message of Christ or the words of Christ dwell among you or in you richly and again just the first word let interesting okay as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through songs hymns and songs from the spirit singing to God with gratitude in your hearts and there's a couple words I want to note Dave has done this as well but the word dwell is the root word in the Greek oikos. It means house. But the word that he uses here is anoikeo, and it means to live or dwell within. But then the word richly is the word plousios, which means to fill to overflowing. And so my paraphrase of this verse would be, let the message of Jesus and Jesus himself make his home in you so much so that he spills out of you. Let Jesus himself make his home in you, so much so that he spills out of you. Let the words and message of Christ dwell in you richly. And that phrase and that concept, if we're honest, Sounds like something that's maybe saved for full-time pastors or people who devote their entire lives to cloistering themselves off to hearing the word of God so that it can dwell in them richly because the rest of us are filled with our own lives and our own struggles and our own temptations so that that seems impossible, right? It seems impossible. It seems literally not possible that Jesus himself would dwell in you so richly that you would be overflowing with him, right? I mean, if we're honest. So let's break this down in terms that we can all understand. Question, have you ever had a house guest? Do you have one right now? And even as I say that term house guest, you do. Awesome, that is great. You may think of the old 90s movie with Sinbad and Phil Hartman. Okay, that's fine. Though apparently none of you did. I was the only person that saw that movie. Adam, you did, right? Yes, my brother-in-law. But house guests can be really, really, really, really, really good or really, really bad, right? In 1997, my wife Mary and I had been married for two years, and one of Mary's best friends was engaged to be married, and the wedding was about a week away. And then one day, Mary got a phone call from this young woman, and she was in tears, and she said, Mary, I don't even know how to explain it, but my fianc√© just called off the wedding. It was a week away. And I don't know what to do. Obviously, all my plans were headed in this direction. I moved out of my apartment, have no job. I don't know what to do. Could I stay with you for a while? And we love this person. We still do. We've known her for a long time. And so, you know, our immediate response was, well, of course, of course you can stay with us. And so we created a little room for her, which was about three steps away from our bedroom in our little house in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. And so, I mean, there was a little bit of nervousness for me. I was like, you know, there's going to be another woman living in our house and that could be weird. And we have one bathroom and that could be weird. And how's this going to go? And I mean, is my wife going to spend all her time with her now? and, but what happened was she moved into our house with all of her pain and all of her grief. And over the course of the next 30 days, she brought love and grace into our house. She created space in us to love each other better. And it was amazing. I mean, it was unbelievable. This unexpected gift dropped into our laps for 30 days to the point of when, where she left, remember this, honey? We, like, it felt like the day that camp was over, you know? And you gotta go back to your real life. And we looked at each other and said, well, now what? I mean, what are we gonna do now? But not all house guests are like that. Amen? Not all house guests are perfect. I know you've seen that movie. Some of them show up unannounced. And they bring everything with them. They're a huge dog. And I'm speaking both literally and metaphorically right now. And they show up and they take up all kinds of space inside of you and your house. And they wreck your life. And they mess you up. And they don't take you where you want to go. and they don't create space in your heart, and they don't help you love more and better, or at least you don't take that opportunity to do that. Well, I want to suggest to you that inside of us, at the place that is most core in us, the place that is most central to who we are, there is a house, an oikos, a place that is designed for God to be, a place that many of us, like the door is shut to it, and we don't even know how to access this room, this space inside of us. We don't know how to get there. But inside of that place come our deepest longings, the longings that have been put there by God that express to us and to the world who we are. This is the place that is very intimate and very secret and very sacred. This is the place that God longs to dwell within you. This is the place that Paul writes about when he says, let the message of Christ dwell in you richly. And we all have this place inside of us. And so if Paul instructs us to let Christ dwell there, it speaks to the reality that we can open ourselves up so that things move in. And so the question to all of us in part is this, what have you let come in to that place? what house guests have you invited into that place in your heart? Chances are there are some places and some house guests that are living in there right now that you've invited in that it would probably do good to name. Another way to ask that is, what are you filled to overflowing with? What is inside of you? So that if you were super stressed out and someone kind of metaphorically bumped you, that thing would come out. Whether it's joy or grief or anger, rage, contentment. What are you overflowing with if you were honest? And if the friends and family around you would be honest with you, that would be an interesting question to ask, wouldn't it? And you'd be courageous. hey what am I overflowing with what do you get when I'm stressed out what do you get from me what spills over from me onto you when I'm at my max that's how you know what you're overflowing with and then what is the process for letting something dwell in you richly whether it be good or bad what's the process because I want to suggest to you that it's a process that we're not familiar with in terms of we probably couldn't name it, but I'm going to walk through it, and it's a process we go through every single day, every single week, every single month, every single year of our lives. It's a process that actually, when I spell it out for you, I think it's going to look and seem very familiar. The first step in this process is to experience a threshold experience. The threshold is that place in your doorway. It's the threshold to your home in your actual house. It's your front door. And when you cross over the threshold, you have entered from the outside into your home. And so picture yourself at the threshold experience at the door, and someone or something is knocking at the door, and you come to it, and you answer the door, and you open it up, and there that person or there that thing is. Now, what might meet you at the threshold experience is stuff or things and when you meet those things, if they have any temptation, if there's any possibility of them getting inside of you, your reaction to that thing is at first gonna be, wow, I want that thing. I need that thing. In fact, I need that to move into my house. Now for me, for me every time Steve Jobs gets on that wonderfully empty black stage with a big screen behind him and rolls out the next Apple product it is like someone is presenting me with a newborn baby and I just oh and then someone might ask me isn't that exactly like the one you already have and I would say oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no this one I can talk on the phone I can surf the internet I can text I can check my facebook and twitter all while I'm driving and watching mad men on Netflix I can do it all at the same time and I'm telling you, no other device on planet Earth can let me do this. And if I don't get that, I'm going to be an incomplete person. So what can I sell in order to buy that? And I can usually sell the device that I'm currently using for exorbitant fees on eBay and then buy that new device, and it's a trap. But every time that keynote happens, it's a threshold experience for me. Now, it's not always stuff. Sometimes it's relationships, and you know what I mean, where you meet someone, and it's like right away, it's like, woo, woo. I mean, it's sparking, and it's happening, and I remember in ninth grade, this was my first silly little high school crush. But I remember the first time I saw this person, I mean, it was from minute one. I was like gone. I mean, it was just, she was walking down the stairs. I was walking up. Our eyes met, and it was like Disney music started playing. I mean, it was silly. And so here's a picture of us in about 1985, 1986. Now, there's a lot of things you could say about that picture. Yeah, I just heard which one was you. Yes. Yes. I was influenced by The Cure and maybe Corey Haim. I don't know. And so this silly little trifling little relationship cost me two years of my life. Because we would date and we would break up and we would date and we would break up and we would date and we would break up and all kinds of angst on my part, especially because I liked her more than she liked me. And I didn't know that then. You never know that then. but it was this threshold experience that I invited that person in and I gave that person access. Now it's not just stuff or just relationships. It can be a lot of things. It can be an opportunity that you're presented with, maybe a new job opportunity or an opportunity to earn $1,500 at home working 10 hours a week. It could be a conversation you have that sends you spinning off into a direction you didn't expect, either good or bad. It could be a click. Late at night, you're on your computer, you're tired, and you're worn out, and you're disappointed, and it didn't go well, and by it, I mean not just your day, but your week and your year, and then a window pops up, and when it pops up, two messages come to you immediately. Do not go there, and I want to go there. and it's a threshold experience right there with just a click of the mouse. Could be a job loss. Could be a promotion. These threshold experiences that send you into different directions. Could be a glance at someone that is not your spouse that leads to a lunch, that leads to text messaging, that leads to a train wreck. But it all starts with a threshold experience. And at the moment of the threshold experience, they're not in yet. It's not in yet. The idea hasn't implanted itself in you yet. And so, in those moments, and we all have been there, and we all know what I'm talking about, We have the choice to invite that thing, person, idea, circumstance in or to send it on its way. So when something dwells in you richly, we have these threshold experiences, but then we have the opportunity to give that thing or person access to us. And that happens when you take that next step. and again this could be good or bad these could be amazing incredible experiences that you give yourself access to or it could be incredibly harmful experiences whatever it is that you allow to come into your space your oikos and whatever it is that you give access to will begin to move in more and more and make itself home in you you just need to know that that's the process and what happens when you give something access. And that's just a tiny thing. Again, it's a, once you've clicked, it's a, it's, I'm staying here for longer than I thought I would even. I am letting my arm touch that person for in a meeting, which is, you know, shouldn't happen, but there it is. I'm allowing that idea or thought that someone said that's not true about me, but I'm letting it into me so that it's making itself home in me so that I begin to think that that really is true about me. Whatever that is that you've given yourself access to will begin to make itself home in you. And it's like you're giving that person, thing, idea, opportunity, a key to that place inside of you. And you're saying, come on in. And there's a difference between opening the door and saying, come in, to saying, here's a copy of the key to my room. So you can come in anytime you want. And so many of us, in so many ways, have given keys out to our heart, to people, things, experiences, ideas, conversations, so that they have immediate and anytime access into our hearts. Have you ever been late at night? You're just reading, and you're about to go to bed, and all of a sudden, bang, you're hit with a thought that came from someone else about who you are. And that thought all of a sudden is still with you at three o'clock in the morning. Because you've, somewhere along the way, you've given that person, that thing, that idea, that opportunity, a key to that place in your heart. And that place in your heart was never meant to be occupied by that person, place, thing, or idea. That place inside of you is not made for that person, place, thing, or idea. So you begin to spin out of control. Because that thing that you've let in and given a key to now begins to take control of you. You've now signed over your mortgage to that thing. And that thing is making decisions for you. That idea is controlling how you act and interact with the world and with people and with yourself and with God. And you know what I'm talking about. Because this is the human condition. We were not meant to be controlled by anything other than our creator who loves us. And when we give the key to our heart away to things, people, ideas, concepts, conversations, something dreadful happens to us. And we see what happens to us in James chapter 1. I want to read this to you. It's found in James 1 verses 13 through 16. And it starts off kind of interesting. When tempted, which you can infer, what? You will be what? Tempted. You will be. There are constant knockings at your door. Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Opportunities, thoughts, ideas, clicks, people, job losses, promotions. When the temptation comes, no one should say, God is tempting me. For God can't be tempted by evil. And when I read that at first, I thought, well, who would say that, right? I mean, like, does God, everyone knows God doesn't tempt you. But then I thought I have the amazing capacity when I am at my worst to spiritualize something and make something seem like it's from God. This is not something that's bad for me. This is a gift from God right now. When you are tempted, no one should say God has tempted me for God can't be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone, which is that God does not play that game of shifting shadows and, you know, if you open this door, you're really gonna go in that door. God is very sincere with us and gentle and gracious and straightforward with us. God doesn't play the tempting game, which is so slick and weird. No, each of you is tempted when you are dragged away by your own evil desire and enticed. And then here comes the process. After desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin. And sin, when it's full grown, gives birth to death. And that is a scary picture, right? And it all starts with a threshold experience, doesn't it? When your own evil desire, the word for that in the Greek is, epithumia, it means the act of an individual desire resulting from, and the word pathos is where we get a word pathology, the soul's wounded condition. You are tempted to let something into what's truest in you, your soul, because your soul has been wounded and it's vulnerable to letting things in. But then the word that just jumped off the page to me when I was studying this was these words dragged away. Because what happens, I think, is when you're standing at the threshold and you let something or someone in that was never made to occupy your space and you give it access, what happens is very interesting. I think they actually do not create a home in you because I think that place inside of you can only be occupied by God, what that person, place, thing, idea does with you is drag you away from who you are and whose you are. It kidnaps you and holds you for ransom, and you end up lost, far from home, far from the ability even to access who you are and whose you are. You are dragged away because of your soul's wounded condition. Whatever are we to do? Well, King David was in a desperate place when he wrote this psalm that you see up on the screen. he had a threshold experience where he saw a woman that was not his wife and he invited her because he was king and he had the power to do it to come into his house and what that meant was that they slept together and that was his will not hers and she became pregnant and so he had her husband killed and then he took her as his own wife. Now all this was happening and because he was king and because he had been dragged away from who he was. He was really okay with it. Until this prophet named Nathan came and nailed him to the wall and said, what you are doing is not right. You've been dragged away and you are not acting kingly right now and you are not doing what is right. And so David wrote this hymn and we have the privilege of reading it. This psalm. And it's desperate. I mean it is it is desperate read these words create in me a pure heart oh God and renew a steadfast spirit within me create in me a pure heart because my heart is filthy it's messed up and I have no ability to create a new heart on my own do not cast me from your presence because and I love that phrase you know in one level we read well God would never do that and then we get all theological right but when you're desperate and knocked down you think God wants nothing to do with you. Don't cast me from your presence. God, don't take your Holy Spirit from me. In fact, I need to be restored. Restore to me the joy of the day that I knew I was helpless and I came and was saved and you created space in me and moved right into my heart. You moved in and created space in me and I felt spacious and joyful. Renew unto me that and restore to me that space. And even God, grant me a willing spirit because I don't even have it on my own to want this. Only you can sustain me. This is the prayer of a desperate person who is saying, God, without you, creating in me a new heart, restoring to me what's been lost, renewing me, sustaining me, I will remain lost. And I wonder if there's anyone, I really wonder if there's anyone here that is in that place. Oh God, I have let someone in that is not you. And if you don't restore me, I will remain lost. You need to grant within me even a spirit that's willing to do this work. You need to sustain me because I feel like every step of the way, I'm so raw and vulnerable that one little flick from someone else would knock me down. So God, you and you alone need to sustain me because I am utterly and completely lost. Well, what would it look like to let Jesus dwell within that place? Do you want that? Do you even think that's possible? Read these amazing words of good news found in Revelation 3. Some of the greatest words in all the scriptures is the Lord standing at your door saying, guess what? Here I am. Here I am. I stand at your door and I'm knocking. And if anyone, I love that word too, hears my voice and opens the door at this threshold experience. Guess what? I will come in to the home that I made. So I feel very at home there. And then this funny phrase, I will eat with you and you with me. That sounds so weird. Like now we're going to have a Big Mac together. What that speaks to for me in the time that it was written, eating together was the greatest sign of fellowship with one another. It was the greatest sign of you're okay with me and I'm okay with you. And what that means is I will come and make my home in you so that I will be what is overflowing in you. And this comes to anyone, anyone who is desperate enough to ask for it. You do not have to have a track record of going to church for a long time, or praying for a long time, or making sure you've had your quiet times for four days in a row, or making sure you've made all kinds of good decisions, or making sure that you have the right pedigree or the right religious background. This comes to anyone who has the courage to say to Jesus, I'm so messed up. I'm so lost. To that person, Jesus says, here I am. And he's saying that right now. Right now is a threshold experience for some of you. And I'm not talking Christians. I'm not talking just to non-Christians here. I'm talking to anyone who feels lost, that they've been dragged away and kidnapped by anyone other than God. Jesus stands at your door at this threshold experience and says, here I am. and at this moment you need to hear his voice and open the door so let's pray together Holy Spirit come Holy Spirit come and do your work in us. Give us access. We give you access to our hearts and we say to you, God, our hearts, we've invited things in that are just, they don't, doesn't belong there, God. We've had threshold experiences with things, people, ideas, conversations and we've given them access. We've given them keys to our hearts and they've dragged us away. They've kidnapped us. So God, please come now. images and pictures and things are in our minds right now that are sending us down huge spirals of shame and God I pray Jesus that you would come and you would give us a picture of what it looks like for you to be standing at the door saying here I am and in me is life and in me is forgiveness of all of your sin in me Jesus says you can be made new you can be restored you can be renewed you can be sustained so in this moment in your own words you just cry out to God you just cry out to Jesus whatever plea that you need to asking him for forgiveness from your sin from letting others in and asking him to renew your heart. I'll give you some silence to do that now. You just cry out to Jesus. Holy Spirit come. Holy Spirit come into this place and move past the masks move past the pretense we are so good at pretending that we're okay break through all that God we are a mess and we desperately need you send your Holy Spirit to bring us back home so that you can create a home in us, God. Jesus, I'm lost. Come and save me. That would be a great prayer to pray. Jesus, I've invited all kinds of people and things in. Please clean out my house. That would be a great prayer to pray. Jesus, give me the desire to let you in. I'm so scared. That would be a great prayer to pray. Jesus, I need you. Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy on me. That would be a great prayer to pray. Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy on me. and now I want you to picture Jesus son of the living God actually walking right in you've invited him in now see him coming in to create space inside of you that's only for him so that what you will be is filled to overflowing with him. Picture him coming in. Picture him sitting down at the table. Picture the two of you eating together. Picture his eyes looking on you with love and grace and mercy. Here I am. Here I am. oh God thank you so much for being a God who rescues us from our kidnappers who came to earth to show who you are in the form of a human being thank you for the forgiveness of sins and for raising us from the dead for giving us new life in you Jesus give us the courage to give you access and do our work in your name amen so now would be the time for a big deep breath in deep breath out I want to leave you with a prayer so I invite you to go ahead and stand up this prayer is going to be on the message tool this week and how you get to the message tool is just go on the door.org and then click on message tool it's pretty complicated but I want to pray this prayer over you it's by Ted Loader it's a poem oh God let something essential happen to me, to us. Something more than interesting or entertaining or thoughtful. Oh God, let something essential happen to me. Something awesome. Something real. Speak to my condition, Lord, and change me somewhere inside where it matters. let something happen in me which is my real self oh God some of you need to pray that prayer every day for the rest of your lives amen amen well go with the mighty and gracious spirit of God behind you and before you and on your right and on your left and above you and beneath you and in you and in between you and all people. Amen? Amen.
