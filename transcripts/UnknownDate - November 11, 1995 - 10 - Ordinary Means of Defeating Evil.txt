We thought that we'd like to not just talk about abuse, but actually model it for you. This is the fourth or fifth time I've spoken today, so that's abusive to me, but more importantly, it's abusive to you too. So, we can't throw stones, we're actually guilty of abusing the ordinary means of defeating evil, a singularly unsexy topic, which is exactly the point. what I'm going to tell you is by far and away the most profound approach the most helpful approach to spiritual warfare and inner healing and everything else that there could possibly be it's not nearly as interesting and you can't make money teaching this but it will work and it is God which is at least some consolation it is the truth first point to make is that because we are Christians we are inherently powerful. We are a powerful package simply because we are made in the image of God and we are engulfed by Christ and we are connected to the Father. When you think about it, a lot of people think that the quality of their relationship with God depends on how their quiet time is to how their prayer time is, to how their morality is, how their moral life is doing and all that kind of stuff. I have to tell you the truth. The quality of relationship is determined by the whole and complete Jesus Christ who lives in you, who is in perfect communion with the Father all the time. Jesus is whole, the Father is whole. That relationship is total and complete. Now, the quality of your experience of that might be shabby or great, depending on your performance. but the essence of it is not up to you. The relationship with God has been secured by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, period, and of sin. But the quality of life is something that has everything to do with our behavior and what we do. And what I want to say in the next few minutes is that it's not all that tricky or mysterious as to how to conduct those things. It's all clearly, most of it, most of our life is clearly told to us in the pages of the New Testament. How to participate in the relationship with God in such a way that the quality of our life was raised, and in addition to that, we as a matter of course achieve evil, right, left, and center to go on. Now, to put a large backdrop to this, in the beginning, God created man and woman to rule over the earth. God gave the earth. He said, be fruitful and multiply, and gave us the gift of sex, not just to have fun with, but to multiply, be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. Woman was given to man and man to woman as mutual helpers to rule the earth. And so God gave us authority, dominion, and smallest sovereignty over the world, over its inhabitants, and over its history. That's what was given to us as a dequest right at the very beginning. Big authority, big power. Can't get any bigger. Now Satan, who didn't like this arrangement, decided that he would come and try to wrest that authority and power from us. How was he going to do that? He couldn't come in and hold a gun to our heads and say, or whatever. Bear in mind, we're talking about an archangel. Very much more powerful than two little naked people. And yet, he was helpless in the face of their authority and the power that backed up their authority. Even as powerful as he was and as weak as they were in their own inherent being, he was no match for them or for any one of them. So what does he do? He had to trick them. He couldn't pull any rough stuff because he was outdone. Because God stood behind Adam and him as long as they stood under him. God stood behind them in their words and their rulership so long as they stayed under him. Now, as an expression, so anyway, what he did was he tricked them. He tricked them. And today, I submit to you that tricking us into believing a lie or tricking us into doing something that is self-destructive is how Satan can do it. He does not have the ability to coerce or overpower a Christian. We are simply to be powerful for them. And so it is getting us to believe a lie and getting us to act in self-destructive ways. Same as, I mean, these tricks are shop one. The only way we keep doing them is we keep working. But hopefully what I say to us today will prevent much of it in the future in your life. One of the expressions or the tokens of man and woman's authority was when God brought the animals before him to name. Now in ancient Near East, naming something was very significant. It was a demonstration of ownership or sovereignty or rulership. When a king went out to do battle with another king and defeated him, he would also take over his city and rename it. And so throughout Babylonia, now Iraq and Palestine, and the southern part of Turkey, there are digs where archaeologists have discovered building sites, city sites, that have gone through a progression of names. They've been renamed. They find the names chiseled into doorposts and into city gates and that sort of thing. And they're renamed because when you take something over, you name it to declare your rulership over. Naming it doesn't bring it under your subjection. It's under your subjection. You name it as a token of the fact that it's already under your subjection. So, it says, the text actually says, and God brought all the animals to Adam to see what he would name them. That is, he could name them anything he wanted. You often wonder, what if he got it wrong? What if he misnamed them? That's their name. Whatever he named them, that was their name. Lions, tigers, and bears, they were big and powerful even in those days. But they were not sure because they were under his dominion. And there was an animal that was brought before the man to name him. And as he named him, it symbolized him being under his subjection, under the authority. Anybody going to guess? The snake. The snake was brought along with the animals for Adam to name. He named him. And God, from the very beginning, the evil, under heart and soul, the evil, under heart and soul. So, the devil cannot come in and pull any rough stuff and take over the world, although that is what he wants to do. What he has to do is to trick them, which he does. He lied. He believed the lie. He knows what he does. And when they took their loyalty from God, standing underneath God, standing in the light of his, of submitting to his authority, and his authority flowing through them and ordering the world, they stood out from underneath his authority and gave their authority to the snake. And wherever you give your authority, whatever you worship becomes your God. And so the snake said, God really didn't say, and if he did, he was just jealous. And the woman and the man in that order believed, and they became subject to the evil one. But the important thing for Satan is that when they subjected their persons to the evil one, that brought to him everything that was under their control, the world. And that is why the New Testament describes Satan as the principality and power of the air, the God of this world. So there's the problem. Now Satan's idea of order is quite a bit different than God's. Satan immediately begins to disintegrate relationships, first of all. First relationship to go, man, woman, and God. They'd walk, they'd talk, they'd converse. In the cool of the evening, now God comes for his appointment, and they're gone. They're hiding. So the relationship between them and God is sundered. The next relationship that is sundered is the relationship between man and woman. Adam, why have you done it? I didn't do it. It's her fault. She said, it's not my fault. It's snake meat. So everybody was together, and now it's all tearing apart. And in addition to that, there goes creation. You used to be able to just get up, stretch, go and pick something to eat, and eat it. And the garden was this wonderful place, and now there's weeds. And now the only thing that grows on its own is weeds. And if you want to eat, you have to talk to me. It's by the sweat of your brow that you're in there. Bad doing. So the creation has now rebelled against man. So everything is disengaged. Relationship between us and God. Relationship between each other. A relationship of sovereignty over creation destroyed. Everything has gone to hell. Now, have all of this biblical history, finding some way to bring humanity back under the authority of God. The old covenant was tried. The law of God was tried. The law of God is wonderful. It's great. It has a glory all its own. It just can't do what needs to be done. It's just to bring us under God's authority. Because how we lost authority was by disobedience. What needs to be regained, the only way that authority can be regained is by obedience. And for years and years and years, he tried this, he tried that, he tried the other. And finally, in his latter days, God sent his only son, the perfect representation of God. Not only that, but the perfect representation of man. And Jesus lived under the law, fulfilling the law perfectly, totally, completely. obeyed God and loved God and loved man to the bitter end, and died so that the penalty of all of our disobedience could be paid for, and now authority has been redeemed for humanity. So now, something like what was going on initially is given back. There's the now and the not yet of the coming of the kingdom of God for sure. We see a little bit of it now, and the rest is on its way, And one day we're going to judge angels, but we're on a continuum heading in that direction. The first hint that things were coming back under proper order was when Jesus walked around and said to the seas, Be still, and they were still. Here's creation, obeying him, wind and waves, stop. It's ceasing, demonstrating mastery over the deep dark water, the symbol of chaos, evil, and hell for a Hebrew mind. He just wants that. He sees sick people, a violation of nature, not God's will for people to be sick. He says, stop it. Be healed. He sees blindness. It's wrong. It's wrong. Got to fix that. He fixes it. He sees people who are demonized. That's wrong, too. He fixes that. He begins to exercise authority. His right to authority. man's rightful authority over the world again. These people who are dead did not want to get up and they rise up. So Jesus is returning authority to humanity. And when we believe into him, we participate in that authority and we can access, with some practice, that power as well. Matthew 28, all authority in heaven and earth has been given to me. Therefore, go into all the world, and I will be with you always. All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me. Therefore, you go, and I will back you up. John 20, after his resurrection, he's in the upper room. He's in an upper room somewhere with the disciples. And he talks to them for a while. One of the things that he says is, just as I have been sent, so send I you. And then he breathes on them and sees the Holy Spirit. Well, the question is, how was Jesus sent? However Jesus was sent, that's exactly how he's sending us. How was he sent? He was sent in the authority and the power of God to make right what was wrong, to bring creation, the demonic forces, and life itself back under human control, under human governorship. That's what he was about, and he did that. And he says, now, he breathes on them and they receive the Holy Spirit. How was he sent? In authority and power, the power of the Holy Spirit. He breathes on them and they receive the Holy Spirit, and they go out. He says, now, go out, they're going to come through me. I'm sending you out like me. Now, it's very messy because there's the now and the not yet. The final glorification of humanity in and through the work of Jesus Christ won't happen until Jesus returns again. But that's the way we're headed. And the church now can participate in a whole lot more of that than it is, simply by believing it and acting it. Now let me just give you some ordinary means. Now if we are so powerful, if the devil cannot just whip us around, and if 90% of what you hear about spiritual warfare is basically nonsense, which it is. This whole business is about praying over communities and tearing down strongholds. That's not what strongholds are, and there's no reason to do that. The way Jesus changed society is one person to do things. Converting them, healing them, casting out demons and disciples. That's how you change society. You don't do it by yelling at the staff. That could be quite good. Just a whole lot of silliness regarding spiritual warfare would be cleared up in a minute if you just believe that we are already this powerful package. Now, there's just some very ordinary ways. Now, of course, we cast our king. Of course we do. I mean, that's part of what we do. That's part of exercising authority. But in terms of living our own lives relatively free of the power of evil, all we have to do is read the Bible. Now, I found six or seven references here, but these are just the first of about 15 I found, one of the first ones through it. The first one is illustrated, 1 Peter 5.8. Peter says, Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. Resist him and stand firm in faith, because you know. Et cetera, et cetera. Satan is like a lion, so stay alert. Now, I assumed, up until a couple of years ago, that lions being the king of the beast, you know, when they got hungry, they just went out and ate something. But then my kids started watching PBS and watching the nature programs, and I watched them with them, and I discovered, gee, that's not the case at all. Lions have to depend on the stupidity of their food in order to eat. The weakness and stupidity of their food in order to eat. The reason is because lions can't run as fast as their food. Their food cannot run them. So what needs to be done is that the food needs to stay alert and be self-controlled, and they have nothing to fear from the lion. And this is the picture that Peter wants you to get. The lion, Satan, formidable, powerful, all you have to do is stay alert. You need to stay alert. A couple of years ago, I was doing a series of conferences in South Africa, And our hosts gave me and the ministry team a tour of Kruger National Park. We went on safari for a few days. And one of the things we did one morning is we drove out to a waterhole where some lions were crouching. You could see them. I don't know if they were there. But the lions were crouching behind a mound of dirt, looking up over it, at a group of seabirds that had come down to drink. and the zebras knew that the lions were there and there was us and National Geographic everybody knew everybody was there but the lions were waiting for the zebras to make a mistake and they were very careful their tails would be swishing and they'd look up over the thing and they'd get down and they'd look up over the thing and what the zebras were doing they were taking turns drinking one would go down and the other one would look and put down their own look. And the lions were waiting for one zebra to put his head down and keep it there. Waiting for the alert, just staying there, desensitizing Satan, the lion, just staying there and do long enough to desensitize him, and then he'd come. Well, we stayed there about an hour, and it was just a standoff. The nervous geobers, crancing around the water, a sneaking drink, and the lion just was waiting for somebody to get there. Well, that's the picture. Satan cannot outrun us, cannot overpower us. He has to wait for us to self-destruct. So there's lots and lots of ways. You could do a whole teaching on what are some ways of keeping the Lord. What are some ways of keeping the Lord? Pay attention. Watch what's happening in your marriage. Watch what's happening between you and your two. Watch what's happening between you and your two times. Watch what you're saying. Watch your thoughts. What's going on? Pay attention. Stay alert. Be alive. Be fully human. Be fully alive. Be engaged. Pay attention. Pay attention. Pay attention. Stay alive. Stay alert. If you do that, and you're referring everything in your life to Jesus, you're not going to have anything to worry about from the devil by and by. Okay, Ephesians 4, 25, 27. Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor. For we are all members of one body. In your anger, do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry. And do not give the devil a foothold. The devil cannot take a foothold. You have to give him a foothold. Again, the same point. The devil cannot come in, and a lot of people are scared of demons and scared of the devil and all that kind of stuff. I'm just telling you, you don't get that out of the New Testament. You get that out of medieval art, and you get that out of the exorcist, and you get it out of a lot of non-biblical untrue sources, but you don't get it out of the New Testament. It's not that the devil is some insignificant wimp. He's a formidable enemy. but you're just so much more powerful. You just are. You just are inherently, because Christ is in you, because Christ is in you, is eternally the Son related to the Eternal Father. Because that's you, because you're such a powerful package, all things being equal, you don't have anything to worry about. All you have to do is stay alert and avoid giving the devil a foothold. Just avoid giving him a foothold. and you're going to be all right. Just unpack this a little bit. How do we avoid giving the devil a cripple in this context? Well, we do it by not being angry for any length of time. Notice Paul says, be angry and do not sin. Speak truthfully. In your anger, do not sin. Everybody's going to get angry. If you don't get angry from time to time, You're either stunned or repressed or you're not really fully human. Anger is an important emotion in this case. It's telling us something. What you get angry about is what you care about. Notice how curiously angry Jesus got with the Pharisees in Matthew 23, our subject. Matthew 23, the famous spiritual abuse book. the spiritual of your sex. Jesus goes to the spirit of anger. Anger is an important aspect of our humanity. However, Paul says, you can be angry with each other, but don't let the sun go down on your anger. Don't allow anger to test it. Don't allow it to harden and to bitterness. Don't allow it to get rooted down into your personality. because that gives the devil a foothold in your life. Don't do it. So again, it's under our control. We can do it or not. We have the choice. And Paul says, just don't do it. One of the rules that we have at our house, we've got eight children, and they're all very strong personalities. My wife and I are very strong personalities. She's not a good one. I hold my own some of the time. And there is lots and lots of opportunities for friction. And one of the rules that we have at our house is that you can be angry, but you have to process it within 24 hours. And if you don't, you lose the right to process it. So if you're angry, it's fine. But you have to deal with it up front. You have to deal with it straight up. And if you fail to do it, then you miss a chance. I have the same sort of rule in the church. with staff, people, and whatnot, and I say, except I've extended it for two days, because people's days off sometimes don't allow us to process it. You can be angry with me or with anybody else, but you've got to go talk to the person you're angry with privately, and you've got to process it within a reasonable amount of time. In this case, 30 a while. And if you don't, you miss your chance, huh? I mean, that's not a rule. or a regulation or a law. That's just to say, anger is okay. Holding on to anger, anger, letting it turn into bitterness isn't okay. James 4, 7, 8, Resist the devil, draw near to God. Drawing near to God, there's so many ways, even James, you can look and see what James says about what constitutes drawing near to God. And it's just really basic stuff. You know, don't lie anymore. You know, don't do the stuff that, don't do the stuff that, that violates the church, that violates your relationship, go on air to God. Go on air to God. Submit yourselves then to God. Resist the devil and you will please him. Come near to God and you will come near to Jesus. Submit yourselves then to God. Whatever submitting yourself is to God, we could make a long, long list of what it means to submit to God. But do that. Don't worry about spiritual warfare. Don't be screaming at the principalities and powers. Just submit yourself to God. And in submitting yourself to God, which is the best most helpful giving thing you can do in the first place. Submit yourself to God in your behavior, in your prayer, in your words, in your work. Submit to God. And in doing that, you won't have to worry about your religious spiritual work there. You will be delivered from the devil automatically, as a matter of fact, by submitting to God. This kind of follows on with what I was saying earlier. 2 Corinthians 2, 5-11. redemptive church discipline is another way of defeating Satan. If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent. Not to put it too severely. The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him. Now, instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. The reason I wrote you was to see that he would stand the test and be obedient in everything. If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven, if there is anything to forgive, I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, in order that Satan might not outwit us, for we are not unaware of his scheme. Just take everything that I said in the last hour and understand that redemptive church discipline is one of the ways to keep the devil. We are not unaware of his schemes. There's lots of ways of explaining how that can work. 1 Corinthians 7, 1-5 is kind of a fun one. Interesting slant on spiritual warfare. Now for matters you wrote about, It is good for a man not to marry, but since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife. It's like we're saying he should not withhold sex from him. The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife. And likewise, the wife to her husband. The wife's body, in case there's any doubt we're getting at, the wife's body does not belong to her alone, but also to her husband. And in the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him, but also to his wife. do not defy each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. The obvious meaning here, I suppose, is that a primitive one, that if you have a good relationship, a good sexual relationship with your husband or wife, you're much less likely to be tempted to sexual sin outside of me. That's pretty much what he's saying. However, not giving the devil a foothold by maintaining a good sexual relationship within marriage. Anybody who's been married, and if you have a good marriage or you have a bad marriage, you know exactly what I'm saying. A good, free, vulnerable, open sexual relationship between husband and wife is a wonderful time. So keeping the lines of communication open is very difficult. I know some people can tell you that, but it really is very difficult to maintain bitterness and at the same time open yourself up. It's a challenge. I don't know, in our marriage, it's kind of a processing of our relationship. A good sexual relationship doesn't heal our marriage, but it goes a long way to discerning where our marriage is at. And I think that that's true. A lot of people, I think that if you thought about it, you would probably agree. That it's a very difficult community. It's very difficult to maintain, and it's just keeping this, that, and everything, without it's very difficult to maintain when you have regular, open, warm, loving, vulnerable, sexual marriage. And so just a lot of things that could go wrong in the marriage are prevented from going wrong by keeping this aspect of the marriage in health. Galatians 4, 8-11. Again, we're going to do a serious stuff now. But again, please note, these are the ordinary means. We're getting now to our topic specifically of spiritual abuse. Galatians 4, 8-11. Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not God. He's talking about spiritual power. You were slaves to those who by nature are not God. But now that you know God, or rather are known by Him, how is it that you are now turning back to those weak and miserable principles, demonic forces? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again? You are observing special days and months and seasons and years. I fear for you that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you. I plead with you, brothers, become like me, for I become like you. You have done me no wrong. As you know, it was because of an illness. And then he goes on to explain why he's there. But the first part of that is, do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again? You are observing special days, laws, months, seasons, laws. I fear for you the similar days and no time on you. Put this in contact with Galatians 3, 1-5. You stupid Galatians who have bewitched you. What is bewitching? Technically, the word bewitch there is the technical term for the evil eye in Mediterranean culture of this time. So bewitching was literally a cult mystery. It meant that we're talking about the devils, we're talking about spells, we're talking about witchcraft, we're talking about demonism. Who has bewitched you? And then in our passage down here in 4, Paul is saying, are you coming back under principalities and powers? Are you returning to slavery for those elemental principles? Here's the picture. The so-called Judaizers, the religious people, followed Paul and said, well, Paul was right in that it is right for Jesus to be your salvation. However, if you want to go on to maturity, if you want to walk with God, what you need to do is obey the law. Be circumcised, be kosher, have your quiet time, tithes, etc., etc., etc. In other words, Jesus is enough to get you saved in a technical sense, but if you want to go on to maturity, if you want to walk, then you have to do it by the law. And Paul says, now folks, you have to understand that this is almost the whole church that teaches that we're saved by grace, but we organize our lives according to the law. In light, it may not be that blatant, and it is that blatant in lots of communities, but that is basically where the church has been since we were. The Western evangelical church anymore does not believe in classic works righteousness anymore. You've got to do enough right things in order to be right with God. No, we don't believe it. We believe that Jesus has paid the price to get us in, but now it's up to us and the keeping of the laws to get us on. Or as one guy, he actually said this, one pastor said, the Christian life is like this. It's like you're joining a country club, Jesus pays your initiation fee, and you have to keep up the dues. The virtue of that is that it's honest, and it's a precise description of where evangelical theology has been for 500 years. Yes, save clearly. We're not going to be like those Catholics who say you've got to pay indulgence and save on merit. Oh no, they are. They're in the works of life. We believe that the South is saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. and now the law of God is a rule of life. Wrong-o. Wrong-o. Paul confronted this. Paul confronted this right in the early church, and he said, that is demonic. So here we have a basic work sanctification. Come under the law, keep the law, and you're going to be okay. It's the rule of life. And Paul refers to that as not just bad, not just said Christian, but didn't. So one of the ways that we do real, powerful, spiritual work is just to believe Jesus is our righteousness yesterday, today, and tomorrow. And that the way we walk in relationship to him is to walk in relationship with him. To do everything in relationship with him. To develop a love relationship with him that in a matter of course, we keep the law. We keep the law in the same way I don't cheat on my wife, not because there's a commandment that says, Thou shalt not commit adultery, but because I love her. The law of love is much higher and subsumes everything else in it. But what it does is it keeps me loving her instead of looking for a lot. Does anybody follow this? Loving God is the way you live life. Not relating to a list of rules, even though God is the one who gave us those rules. Now, it's not a difference without a distinction, or a distinction without a difference. Big distinction, big difference. Relate to a list of do's and don'ts, but walk in love with God. Those are your choices. The church has said, obey the rules. Obey our church rules. Obey the spiritual rules. Obey God's rules. And that is how you stay a good citizen and stay pleasing to God. And God says, Paul says to God, no, that's not how it works. That's actually demonic. Let me very quickly go through this last bit, which I would have loved to spend the whole time on. Revelation 12, 10-11. You want to know how to overcome the accuser? How to overcome the devil? Well, let me show you. by the blood of the Lamb. What does the blood of the Lamb have to do with shutting up the effusor, overcoming the effusor, getting him off his main plan? How does that work? This is how it works. Folks, you are righteous, you are perfect, you are holy, you are absolutely acceptable to God because Jesus made you that way, period. Your performance is irrelevant to that question. Absolutely irrelevant. It's Christ's performance that determines you're standing before God, not your performance. if it was your performance, you all get in. Now, what does the accuser do? He tries to get you to think otherwise. Just very simple. Well, yeah, I'm right, and I'm whole. I mean, right to see for Christ, but I mean, I've done this sin, and that's not right. And so your conscience is the part of you that never gets converted. The accuser comes and accuses you through your conscience. You're bad. You know, you've done bad things, and because you've done bad things, you ought to feel bad. Now, if the accuser can accuse you, it can do a lot of things. First of all, if you're a leader, it can get you to be a big-time spiritual abuser. Because if you feel bad about yourself, then the only way to feel good about yourself is to perform. And in order to perform, we've got to get you to perform because you determine my status, and so I have to direct my energy to getting you to perform in order to stage my guilt and make me feel like I'm okay. You know how that works? That's how it works. Now, if you can simply overcome the accuser by the blood of the Lamb, then you don't have to manipulate anybody. Number two, if you can overcome the accuser by the blood of the Lamb, whatever that is, I'll explain it in a minute, but if you can overcome the accuser by the blood of the Lamb, then you won't let anybody else accuse you because the only way a spiritual abuser can manipulate you is if you already feel bad about yourself. You already feel defective. You already feel that you're not okay. If you already feel accused, then a spiritual dealer can come along and say, I know what you can do to make yourself feel okay. And here are the things. You have to die, get to the new day, to the new day, to the new day, to the new day. Clean up the bathroom, church, and if you do all this stuff, and it's never said this in a word, but if you do all this stuff, then you'll be okay and you'll feel okay. In a sense of accusation, you'll be secure. Doesn't that sound like a good deal? That's a good deal. between Christians. If everybody, leaders and followers, overcame the accuser, attacking our self-image and making us feel bad about ourselves, if we overcame the accuser by the blood of the Lamb, then we could bypass all that stuff. So how do we overcome the accuser by the blood of the Lamb? A further comment in Hebrews 10. Verse 19. Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of Jesus. Since we have confidence to enter the most holy place, not by our performance, not because I've been played up today, not because my giving record is spotless, not even because I'm a good citizen and I've left off masturbation and I've left off eating my life, not because of any of that stuff. I come because of the blood of the Lamb. To the most holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, open, it's not an old way, it's not an old covenant way, they didn't know about this before, by a new and living way, opened up through the curtain, that is his body, and since we have a great priest over the household of God, let us draw near to God with a sincere heart, and full assurance, full assurance, no lacking in assurance, full assurance, having our hearts, having our hearts sprinkled To cleanse us from a guilty conscience, having our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess. For he who promised is faithful. Enter by the blood of the Lamb, having your conscience sprinkled by that blood. To cleanse you from a guilty conscience. So here's how it works. The devil comes as the accuser, and accuses you. His job is sprinkling. Thankless job, but it's his work. He comes and accuses you. Your conscience says, I really have done something bad. See, modern psychology, some aspects of pop psychology will say, you're beautiful, you're wonderful, you're perfect, what you do is fine. Don't feel guilty about anything. Guilty is being a bit. Shame is bad. Just reject all of these things. You're getting bigger and better in every way. Don't take responsibility for your behavior. It's not your fault. It's your parents' fault. It's your pastor's fault. Everybody's a victim. You're a victim. You have a perfect right. to do and to feel anything that you want to have an excuse. No, you don't do that. You just say, I'm busted. Your conscience accuses you to say, yeah, I'm wrong. I did it wrong. I said the wrong thing. I gossiped. I lied. I stole. I was uncharitable. I hated. I undermined. I was jealous. Yeah, I am wrong. Now, the old way was like this. Okay, I'm wrong, so I can pay penance. There are some religious groups that say you can pay penance. They panic, make restitution somehow. There's another way. If nobody's around to enforce that, then your conscience will take over. If your conscience is a hard-working organ, and your conscience will punish you. If you do something really bad, you have to suffer with guilt and shame for about a week. If it's not so bad, then you have to suffer for a day or two. And if it's relatively trivial, a couple of hours will be enough pain. But if it's something really bad, like abortion, then you may have to suffer for the rest of your life. of the guilty country. That may be what we have to do. That is the old way. That's the old, old way. There's a new way, and that is having our hearts sprinkled by the blood of the Lamb. You don't need to plead the blood over the sanctuary or plead the blood over the city. You need to apply it to your heart. That's what it's for. The blood of the Lamb is for the heart. Jesus has already made you right. The devil in your conscience will conspire to make you feel that that's not the case. So what do you do? You can't deny it. Your conscience accuses you. You can't say, hey, I'm okay. I'm okay. You're okay. You can't do that. Pop psychology answer won't work. That's not going to work. The second thing is, we can't let our consciences have the ministry of punishment in us because that's not right either. So what's the third option? The right option. You do it. You say, I'm busted. And then you show your conscience the blood of Christ. The violent death of Christ, which is punishment for the sin you just made. And so now you stand with God and say, Father, I am on the same side of this issue with you. I see the behavior that I just did, and I agree with you, it's wrong and it's bad. And I thank you that Christ, your son, has died as full punishment for that sin I just committed. I thank you for that. Now, I don't want to beat this place ever again. I ask by your Holy Spirit that you enable me to perform better. Not because I'm going to get in better with you with a better performance, but because the quality of my life and the way that I relate to people and my health and the sort of people have everything to do with them. My relationship to God is not undermined by sin. My fellowship with God is not interrupted by sin. But on this level, there's everything in the soul. So I don't want to do that anymore. I ask you for your help, not to do it. But I'm not going to punish and beat myself up in the middle of it. Because Jesus is already punished and beat us. See, anybody who says, oh, gee, you know, I've really sinned God. And God committed to giving me. It's just, it is different in this kind of way. My sin is too great for the blood of Christ. It's just sin. I mean, people think themselves really seriously. Oh, I feel bad. I'm a worthless worm. and death is too good for me, and they feel like they're being spiritual, and they're just being melodramatic and proud, and stupid and sick. Once you've seen the gospel, that kind of behavior is done. Yeah, I agree with you, Father. Man, did I sin. I'm not talking straw. I'm not talking about oops, mistake. I'm talking about sin, worthy of punishment. I accept that judgment on my behavior. And I thank you that the Lord Jesus died and was punished for that. Now, I'm not going to waste any time feeling shame or guilty, but rather I'm going to go about living my life more productive and healthy and inclusive. Now, you know, the interesting and profound psychological thing is that guilt and shame is supposed to modify behavior. It doesn't. It reinforces it. Guilt and shame freezes into an endless cycle, the very bad behavior that you're being punished for. It's weird the way it works, but that's the way it works. If I could give you a whole summary on that one, it's literally the way it works. It's only forgiveness and showing your conscience that you are already free that delivers you from the bad people. So the gospel is good news for your emotions, and then it's good news for your behavior. The blood of the land is just that part. Okay. Two or three minutes of questions, if you have questions, you've got it. this is something that was happening to your daughter and therefore happening to you which was basically happening to your daughter and intercession and praying against evil is entirely appropriate and there's a whole body of teaching that is for that what I want to come down against is that extraordinary activity of prayer and deliverance and everything else rests on this powerful base of who you are in Christ probably takes care of 90% of it. You don't have to look, you don't have to go into the arena with the devil saying, Jesus, I'm a fighter, maybe I'm not mad. It's not even close. The fight isn't even close. Once you know your authority and your power, once you know how you can just be understated about it. I mean, the whole thing about spiritual warfare and the intention that he's understated, not this frantic, who demons are beautiful and evil and ugly, Oh, they're in the water, and they're in the telephone lines, and they're in the school system. Sure, they're all those places, and they're behind every bush, too. I believe all that. And they're relatively unaffected if we are in the truth. If we're walking in the liberty, if we raise our kids in grace, forgiveness, personal responsibility, And all the information about what's going on in the world, we're very likely to have to deal with them in those extraordinary ways. But when we have to, we are ready to fight with this kind of, yeah, we have a big deliverance ministry. We have leaders out right, left, and center. I'm big on that. I'm just saying that that extraordinary deliverance ministry and intersection ministry rests on something that's big and powerful and is so powerful it can simply be understated. And the rest of these are details. We do deal with this in any kind of detail. Yes. I haven't read everything that you've written, but as far as I can tell from what I can remember, yeah, I think that I would be a support. I'm just saying that this whole business of streaming at principalities and powers and all that kind of stuff, there's lots of anecdotal evidence that there's something there. There's just no Bible. There's no Bible to support that. And I've watched person after person get sucked away and get seduced and get securely beat up by hopelessly men and he wagged the criminal. And I have a lot of respect for John Dawson. I just think, and I wouldn't have any problem with them doing it, I have a problem with teaching him to the whole church and expecting everybody to be mature enough and responsible. Because what I watch people actually do is forget about the ordinary needs and think, my whole life, I mean, you're totally irresponsible, a complete jerk, a complete and total waste of life, and he says, my problem is demons. Now your problem is that you're a total jerk. Fix yourself up with the ordinary means and your life is going to work 90%. No, there's principalities and values that are screwing up. No, you're irresponsible. That's your problem. And that's what I run into almost all the time. I just have to say that that whole movement doesn't have any biblical basis. And that makes me nervous. I'm not condemning it. I'm just saying it doesn't have any biblical basis. And there's no model for it. There's no teaching on it, and there's no model in the New Testament. And in fact, the opposite is true. When Jesus went out to take over society, he went after people and converted them. And then he healed them. And then he delivered them of demons. And then he taught people to do that. That goes through the biblical way too. Evil does not have to create fear if it has the power of the back of the church. It doesn't. It's got to get you fearful and get you to self-respect or get you focused on it. C.S. Lewis said, there are one of two mistakes that we make regarding the devil. We either pretend that they aren't there at all, which is a fine with them, or we become fascinated with it, and so thereby being subdued in the argument and come under their strength. We cannot figure out how to be spiritual workers by looking at demons. that's not the direction you look the demonic is not just that it lies to us it is the definition of lie you can't get accurate information you live your life in obedience to Christ and they are subject to you as a matter of course and then when you have to deal dealing with demons is like cleaning up after a backup call there's nothing very romantic or scary about it it's messy but somebody's got to do it and that's the ministry of intercession and deliverance. That's that aspect of spiritualism. Thanks very much.
