For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. My story of peace, where there should be no peace, starts on a warm Tuesday in mid-June 2008. I found myself standing in a clinic lobby, staring out the window into a parking lot, waiting for my wife's breast cancer biopsy to be done. We had decided to tell no one of her situation until we knew the outcome, which wouldn't be for at least three more days. I was scared to death and thinking nothing could be worse than this. Two days later My marketing director position of 20 years At a building supply company was eliminated Two things that you need to know about that I was the only breadwinner And I've never been fired before in my life So when my boss came in and said It's just a numbers game, Tom Nothing personal Nothing personal? Could you put two words together to create less belief? As I shook my head, two words came out of my mouth. No value. The assault on my self-worth felt like an unsuccessful attempt to stop a rocket-propelled grenade with my library card. Later that day, I remember sitting in the car in my garage, engine off, trying to figure out what I was going to tell Carol. How was I going to survive the medical bills I now expected, with or without Cobra, or even worse, what would life be like without my wife, Carol? Then I realized that the company owned pretty much everything I needed to find new work. The car I was sitting in, my BlackBerry in my pocket, the laptop in the seat next to me. The wheels were coming off my entire world in a blink of an eye. And I started thinking again that nothing could be worse than this. The next day, my daughter, away at college on a whim, knowing nothing about our medical or unemployment situation, sent an audio file of herself playing a hymn on her cello. The hymn was Horatio Spafford's famous, It Is Well With My Soul. My wife opened the email and played the audio attachment, and we both lost it. There was no doubt that this was comfort and peace from a place beyond where we lived our lives. Shortly thereafter, Carol's test results came back negative And I thought, it doesn't get any better than this Within a few months, it became evident that we could no longer afford to send our daughter to college And prepare to bring her back home For me, the sense of failure was heavy and unshakable And I thought, man, it doesn't get any worse than this A few days later, in a phone conversation with a friend I hadn't seen or really even talked to in years I mentioned my sadness in not being able to get my daughter through her final quarter to graduate There was a pause on the line, and then he said Tom, we'll pay for the rest of it Unknown to me, his wife had set aside an inheritance And was looking for someone she could help who would pay it forward I hung up and steadied myself against the kitchen counter and said to the ceiling, you are actually going to catch me before I hit the ground, aren't you? And I thought, you know, it really doesn't get any better than this. As the next year unfolded, my job search proved flatter than a calm day on Mille Lacs. My old wife landed a nine-month contract job as a social worker for Head Start and then promptly lost it when the contract ran out. Year one ended, and we were both unemployed, selling our furniture on Craigslist and waking up each morning scared to death. And I thought, it just doesn't get any worse than this. Year two began, dragged on, and nothing happened, and I mean nothing happened, except, of course, that we were going to the door and hanging on every note of music and every spoken word. Here I discovered a worship that I never knew. I had never shed tears in church before but now I found I couldn't get through a single service without getting choked up so strong was the presence and the peace of God we found enough hope and peace each Sunday to counteract the weekly rejection letters and the unreturned phone calls and the isolation we were plowing through wave after wave of desperation and inexplicable peace but we were no longer scared to death it was more like we were scared to life and I thought it couldn't get any better or any worse than this during those days Carol and I would often encourage each other with our own little motto that we figured out all we can do is what we can do but no matter what we don't give up because God doesn't give up on us Sometimes that even worked This past month my wife landed a part-time graveyard shift job Unpacking boxes of clothing at a local department store When she left at 10 p.m. for her first night of work I followed her taillights into the darkness And felt totally worthless as a provider A few weeks later I interviewed for a copywriting job At one-third my former salary The 22-year-old recruiter asked what I'd been doing for the past two years I thought to myself well Stephanie I've been mostly waiting I drove home the gas gauge near empty and I thought it really doesn't get any worse than this two years four months and nothing that's what I was thinking on that Sunday back in October when Dave preached on how God looks for the desperate people well you know if anyone fit that description that would be me he talked about the nature of being desperate for God like a gateway and a gift I swear I swear to you I could hear a rushing wind can't explain it but I heard it I held on to that promise like a rope with a big knot at the end hanging over a thousand foot cliff the presence of God was unavoidable and glorious yet I couldn't shake the sadness and the despair I could not imagine enduring another week of we selected other candidates who more closely matched our needs the circumstances finally overwhelmed my belief that things would ever change I tried to conjure up the memories of those times when God rescued me and Carol through my friends and my family I thought about that audio file my daughter sent to us two years back, when peace like a river. I thought about Gideon and his battle, outnumbered but not outgunned. And the battle was on. The lies began to fight back. You'll never work again. You'll lose everything. You don't matter. You have nothing to offer anyone. Many of you sitting out there right now know exactly what I'm talking about, but I'm here to tell you it's not true. It's not true. Sometimes the lies are really loud, though. While the service ended, everyone left. I remained in my seat near the front, not wanting to leave this sanctuary, and yet needing to find a way out. I saw a couple of prayer team members, husband and wife, and it seemed right for me to go to them. having nothing to lose, I introduced myself and choked out a couple of sentences to the point that I just, I couldn't take it anymore. They put their hands on me and on my heart and prayed for me, for my career, my relationship with my wife, her job, and that Jesus would bring me relief and peace. I literally shook as I stood there, like someone suffering from hypothermia. The peace I felt grew with every step that I took as I left the door. Well, it's been months now, and the place where they touched me over my heart still resonating with the liberty and the liberating feeling that my creator has me in his hand. The peace I've known has been nothing short of palpable and remarkable and is at its strongest when I grab on and hold the tightest. For me, it is as real as this podium that I'm standing next to. Has anything else changed? Do I have a job? No. Have I had another interview with an insufferable 20-year-old? Yeah. Plenty of those. No actual results. So what's really changed? Nothing. And everything. and I'm thinking being desperate for God really is the way to the gift of peace and of course it doesn't get any better than this when peace like a river attendeth my way when sorrows like sea billows roll Whatever my lot thou has taught me to say it is well it is well with my soul it is well with my soul it is well it is well with my soul it is well with my soul It is well, it is well with my soul. Thanks, Joel and Tom. And so we light a candle. Two weeks ago, we lit the first Advent candle of love, And then last week, hope, and this week, peace. And I'm not sure of all the significance of the candle thing. I'm sure there's lots. But actually, when we started a couple weeks ago and lit that candle of love and then hope last week, now peace, first thing that comes to me is, boy, it wouldn't take much to blow those candles out. In fact, when you think of hope and love and peace, they kind of don't stand a chance. when the gale force winds of life begin to blow. But we light a candle anyway, almost as an act of defiant faith and belief that even when the gale force winds begin to blow and threaten to snuff out any hope of love or peace, we still believe that love wins. And hope is real. And peace is possible because he came preaching peace. And the fruit of the Spirit, Paul says, is peace. And then the message that the angel brought that very first Christmas morn was peace on earth, goodwill to men. And when that message was heard and grasped, hope began to rise and joy as well, right in the middle of circumstances, going back to that first Christmas event and all the things that were swirling that would convince any sane person that there is no hope or joy for peace. Because something had, in Jesus' day, and has today, disturbed the peace. And most of us, however, to kind of dial into the disturbance of the peace, don't have to even think of global things, though we could go there easily to find proof for no peace. Most of us don't have to go any further than our own hearts to find and to know that it's true, because it's all right here. No peace. But Jesus is called in the middle of that, the Prince of Peace. Peace I leave with you. My peace I give unto you, not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled. neither let it be afraid. Peace. It's actually an interesting word, peace. It appears over 300 times throughout the scriptures in both the Hebrew and the Greek but among the most common is the Hebrew word shalom. Even today the word shalom is commonly used as a greeting or a blessing to say shalom is to indicate a desire for peace. It is to say peace be with you. I want to confer that blessing upon you. That peace would be in your life defined. Shalom speaks predictably to a sense of well-being. So for me to say shalom to you, I'm wishing you, I'm desiring for you a sense of well-being. But beyond that, it speaks to and encompasses a sense of wholeness, a sense of order in the world, in our lives, a sense of completeness, that things are right, that they are right now as they should be. And as you reflect on your life, every once in a while, you kind of move into a season of shalom. And it just feels like in your marriage and in your relationships and in your career, they're just, things are right. They're as they should be, that's shalom. So shalom is, in fact, the desired experience of every human heart. Wherever they live, whenever they've lived, it's the desired experience of every marriage, of every family, of every church, community, nation. when the psalmist says to pray for the peace of Jerusalem. He's not just saying pray for no war, though that would certainly be included. He's saying to pray for her wholeness, her completeness, to pray for shalom. The Old Testament prophets had a dream about shalom and it got articulated in a variety of ways. They spoke of it as a time when God would make everything right, the way they were supposed to be, the way things were supposed to be. A new age they would speak of where human crookedness was made straight where rough places were made plain the foolish would be made wise and the wise would be made humble and they dreamed of a time when the deserts would flower and the mountains would run with wine weeping would cease and people would go to sleep without weapons in their laps and young ladies would walk through parks late at night without any fear. That's Shalom. Cornelius Plantinga defines shalom this way in a book that he wrote entitled The Way Things Ought to Be. He says this, this is shalom, where marriages are strong and children are secure, where nations and races treasure the differences in other nations and races and see them as attractive, important, and even necessary. Government officials would still take office, but to no one's surprise, they would tell the truth. And freely praise the virtues of other public officials. Business associates would rejoice in one another's promotion. Intercontinental ballistic missile silos would be converted into training tanks or scuba divers. And newspapers would be filled with well-written accounts of acts of great moral beauty. And at the end of the day, people on their porches would read them and savor them and call to each other about them. And at the end of that, you just kind of get this sense that that's just this pie-in-the-sky fantasy. It's almost silly to read those things because every one of us know that something has disturbed the peace, has destroyed Shalom. And if you were to think of all the things that do, in fact, destroy Shalom, the way things ought to be, disturbed the peace, the list will go on and on, but I kind of boil it down to two things, which I'm not sure you can do, but the first is quite simply sin. And it's why Paul in Colossians 3, Colossians that we've been studying for a long, long time now, and we'll get back to in just a few weeks. Colossians 3, Paul says what he says. The reason he says what he says when he says, put to death, therefore, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed. The reason he says that, among others, is this. Those things destroy your own. They destroy the peace in a marriage, in relationships, in your own soul. And lay aside, therefore, he says, anger, malice, slander, wrath. Why? Because they're naughty. No. Because these things destroy shalom. They destroy, they disturb the peace. But the one I want to talk about this morning isn't sin. We'll get back to that when we get back to Colossians. Because what I want to talk about this morning, consistent with the theme we have, is something that I actually have less control over than sin. Because if you think about it, I mean, I have some control over the shalom that's destroyed because of my sin. Because I can stop sinning. I may not do it, but I can. And so can you. We can repent. And we can ask forgiveness. And we can experience grace and mercy. And the truth is, shalom can then be restored. But I have no control. And this is where it's even scarier than the sin that sometimes can destroy shalom. I have no control when the gale force winds of life begin to blow in such a way that the peace is disturbed, that shalom is destroyed, and it could be anything. it could be Tom's story when the gale force winds blew into his life it could be a call from a doctor who says it doesn't look good and shalom is destroyed or the loss of a job or a spouse or trouble with your kids or just the death of a dream such that suddenly in a variety of ways things just aren't as they're supposed to be which raises this question and it's kind of the question of this Advent Sunday, is it possible to experience peace when there is no peace? To experience shalom in the middle of shalom destroying experiences. Well, as it turns out, there's at least one person who seems to think it is. His name is Paul, the Apostle Paul, who in Philippians 4 verse 7 speaks of a peace that surpasses all comprehension, having learned himself, he says, the secret of shalom. In any and every circumstance, he says, to be at peace. First Philippians. Second Philippians, Philippians 4, some of you are going, why is that funny? Anyway, Philippians 4 verse 12, he says it this way, I know how to get along with humble means. I also know how to live in prosperity. In any and every circumstance, I've learned the secret, he says, of being filled and going hungry, of having abundance and suffering need. And if you asked him, which he preferred, however, I'm pretty sure he'd say, I prefer prosperity. I really like being filled and having abundance. But here's the deal. Here's the interesting thing about him. Humble means going hungry and suffering need, for some reason, didn't have the power to destroy in him shalom. He had learned, he says, the secret, which is an incredible thing to say. I mean, honestly, who can say, I've learned the secret? Who can say that? And by the way, it matters who says that. Because if someone's talking to you or to me about peace in the middle of a storm, but they've never had a storm, what they're saying about peace in the storm might actually be true. But if they've never been through a storm, it doesn't carry much weight. But this is Paul who is saying these words. Not a helmet-haired TV evangelist on late-night Christmas or Christian TV trying to sell us a miracle cure-off. Learn the secret. That's not Paul. This is Paul, who in 2 Corinthians chapter 11 says this, I was beaten times without number. Often in danger of death, five times I received 39 lashes, three times beaten with rods. Once I was stoned, three times shipwrecked. A full day and a night I spent in the deep, bobbing like a cork in the water, just waiting for someone to pick me up or not. So when Paul says, when this guy says, I've learned the secret, I've learned a little something about experiencing shalom, experiencing peace. When there is no peace, I kind of want to listen to what he has to say. So what do you hear when you listen to what the apostle Paul has to say? What do you see? What do you notice that might give us a clue as to Paul's secrets, having learned the secret of being content, of experiencing peace when there is no peace. I don't know about you, but I look at people like Paul, and I hear these words, and sometimes when we read the text, these words sound so dry and stale and distant, but when they come alive, I would just love to spend some time with a guy like that, to spend an afternoon and just sit down with him and ask him questions about life and how he lived it. But we can't do that because he's gone. All we have is the text. But as it turns out, there are some clues as to how Paul did it, even in the text. He is speaking to us, actually, through the text. And the first thing I noticed about what he had to say here, relative to this secret of experiencing peace in the middle of a storm, was this, that he had to learn it. I have learned, he says, the secrets. What I like about that, and this is something that I like, and it's, I think, very important. I like it that it didn't come naturally to him. I mean, I don't know if you have these impressions, and maybe you don't even think about these kinds of things, but when I think of writers of the Bible, I think their spirituality was somehow automatic. Don't you think like that sometimes? They had some secret way of knowing things that we don't know, but the fact that he had to learn these things tells me it didn't come automatically to him. There were no magic wands. There were no quick fixes. There were no sermons during Advent that kind of instantly produced in him the capacity for internal peace in the middle of an external storm. And the reason I like that, and I'm glad that's true of Paul, is because those things don't come naturally to me either. He had to learn these things, just like me and just like you but if he had to learn them the good news in that is that maybe I can too and maybe you can too so the first thing I want to say about this peace or lack of peace that some of you may even be experiencing right now maybe in the middle of a storm the first thing I want to say to you is this and this might sound weird I want you to give yourself a break about your lack of peace and be a little more peaceful this is weird be a little more peaceful about your lack of peace because you need to learn these things there are no magic wands for these things you and I and Tom these are things you have to learn over time just like everybody else and I know when that storm blew into your life last week I know you wanted to be different I know you wanted to get it right but again here's the deal there are no magic wands there are no quick fixes There's no Advent sermons on this particular weekend that can download into you this capacity for peace in the middle of the storm. We need to learn these things just like Paul. Indeed, I would be careful not to assume that because Paul says, I have learned these things, that he wasn't still needing to learn these things, maybe like you and me, learning them over and over and over again. It raises a couple more questions. At least it does for me. What kind of things did Paul need to learn and how did he learn them? Second question first. How did he learn these things? Because I believe that the primary way that the apostle Paul learned to experience peace in the middle of the storm is the way all of us do. And this is not gonna be good news. We're not gonna like this. The way he learned peace, at least the front end, is the way all of us do. He learned it through the storm itself. Because what the storm does, among other things, is this. To force us in ways that nothing else I know of can. To find a source of peace other than the good weather. When the weather is good, I'm not confused as to why I feel peaceful. Because everything is at peace. But when the storm begins to come, I am forced. It's against my will. I don't go here willingly at all. But when it comes, I am forced to find another source of peace other than the good weather. Let me explain it this way. Paul was beaten times without number, says the text in 2 Corinthians 11, often in danger of death. So here's my question, Paul. How do you experience internal peace when you're in danger of death? I don't know for sure. I don't know. He's not answering that question directly even in the text. But here's what I think. At some point, I think what you'd have to do to experience peace in the middle of the danger of death is someplace you'd have to actually let go of life. To let go of what you thought you had to have to have peace. I want you to note something here. As I'm connecting in a capacity to experience peace in the middle of a storm, you've got to have a storm. So the storm is almost one of the teachers, not almost, it is one of the teachers. I also want to just kind of qualify that. Not everybody who goes through a storm learns peace. You know that's true. because some, instead of letting go, when they get into the storm, they're just going, you know what? I can't control this. And I'm just, I have to let go of some of this. Instead of letting go, a lot of us hang on a little tighter, in fact, a lot more tight and build a bigger boat so we don't sink next time. And we've come up with more and more and more need to control. And the more you need to control and the bigger the storm gets that you can't control, the less peace you have. he was beaten three times with rods. And it occurs to me, again, I don't know if this is how it went, but I wonder, I wonder if halfway through, I honestly try to, how would I do that? You're in agony. I wonder if halfway through that second beating maybe, he began to think, okay, okay, this hurts. But if I'm going to have any joy or peace at all, even not just today, but in my life, for the rest of my life, because this isn't fair, and I could grab onto that really quick. If I'm gonna have any joy or any peace ever again, it's gonna have to come from a different source than what these guys are doing to me, what they think about me, or even how my body feels right now. I desperately have to find a different source. So if I'm going to have any peace at all, I have to find another source for joy and peace, because if I don't, no peace. And this is not a guarantee that people find it, But those kinds of desperate desires are generally what drives people to a deeper place with God. God, I have to have you. A couple weeks ago, I was up on the stage with Steve Wiens, and he was interviewing me. And if you were here, you may remember it was in the context of the 30th anniversary of my ministry here and Bonnie and I being here at Open Door for that time. and each service was a little bit different. Different stories emerged. I'm not sure if this was in all three services or not, but one of the stories that did emerge was about a time early in our ministry here at Open Doors, three years into our time, involving this thing I remember about a group of people, pretty powerful group of people at the time who I know this is hard to believe, but they didn't like me. It's bizarre. And then a conspiracy. They had kind of gathered together to do this conspiracy that was designed to humiliate me and embarrass me, but ultimately, actually, to get rid of me. And they literally quit giving money to the general fund, started giving it to missions, and it was going to kind of starve us out. And I remember finding out about that. But the kicker of the story, and I told this a couple weeks ago, was that the day I found out about this group of people who were pretty central to the church's life at the time, were doing this, I was, the week I found out about that, I was going through the book of Galatians, and we were in Galatians 5, and the text the following week, that very week that I found this thing out, was talking about the fruit of the Spirit being peace. And I remember thinking, as anyone would, how on earth do I preach about peace in the middle of a storm like this? A storm that when they described the conspiracy, I was pretty sure at the time was going to sink my boat. And I remember thinking as a 30-year-old young guy, not at the church long enough to think I would be able to survive this storm, well, you know what? because my initial thing was, how can I get them to like me? You know, like that. But then I realized I couldn't and that was a horrifying, you ever done it? Maybe I could get them to like me and then it realizes it's like the worst thing you can think of becomes the liberating thing because I realized I'll never be able to get them to like me so I quit trying to get them to like me because that's what happened. I began to realize if I'm going to have any peace at all, I'm going to have to find it in something other than what they think and whether they like me or even if I have this job and I'll never forget it. I mean, this is pretty young in my life, and it's not like I learned it, and I've never had to learn that again. I've had to relearn this, just as you have over and over again, but I will never forget it, because when I let go of my need to win that war, to get them to like me, to keep my job, the strangest thing, unexpected thing, a strange kind of peace came over me that actually gave birth to a different kind of trust and confidence in God, and the confidence in God, please hear me, this is very important, the confidence was not that God would make sure the plot failed. That was, I didn't have any confidence in that. The confidence was that even if the plot succeeded, and we had to move back to Chicago, we would still have, you know, the Bears and the Cubs are there, so that would be okay. So, no. No, we would move back to Chicago, and we would still be okay. I was learning, what was I learning? What was I learning there? I was learning the secret of peace in the middle of the storm. And you know what taught it to me? And I've had to learn it over and over again. You know what taught it to me? The storm. That's what teachers did to you. There was something else I think Paul learned. It was crucial to his coming to a place of authentic peace when there is no peace. And I think it was this. I think Paul learned to pray. Now, I don't know what you think of when you think of prayer, and when I say Paul learned to pray, again, the apostle picture maybe comes into your mind and he's folding his arms and he's folding his hands and he's praying all day long in some way you never could and probably never would and maybe never should like that. When I think of Paul learning to pray or you and I learning how to pray, I really, what I actually mean by that is learning to practice the presence of God, to be aware in ways that bring it into more and more parts of my day to literally be with God. And in his praying, I believe, among the things I think Paul learned was this. He learned to be with God who over time he had come to know was with him. See, if you practice the presence of God, you learn how to do that. You begin to believe and know, I'm not alone. He's with me, even in this, not just in my little prayer closet where I pray, but when I go to work and when I'm in this storm and when all sorts of things, he's with me and I am not alone. He's with me in the minister, in the middle of the storm, which minister to him peace. Indeed, it was the kind of peace that passes understanding precisely because the storm hadn't passed. See, I understand peace and so do you, particularly the kind of peace that comes when the storm subsides. I get that kind of peace. The reason you feel peace is because it's peaceful. But this is a different kind of peace. This is like a foreign thing to us. That you could actually be experiencing an internal kind of peace when there isn't anything peaceful going on around us. We can see this prayer life of Paul in Philippians 4, verses 6 and 7. But actually, it starts. The little tips of what's going on here and what Paul learned about peace in the middle of a storm actually begins in the last phrase of verse 5. Four words. He says this, the Lord is near. The Lord is near. How did he know that? I think he learned it over time by continually going to God in prayer. And he would go to God in prayer right in the middle of the storm at the worst moment. Not just in some prayer closet thing again. Not just in church. In the worst moment, he had learned to go to God. I want to invite you into my fear. I am so afraid right now. Come into that. He had learned, I think, to do that. And the more he did it, this is something we learn. The more he did it, the more he came to know, the Lord is near. So you see, when Paul writes these verses, it's like, what should I say that would sound like it's the Bible? He said, the Lord is near. You know why he said that? Because he knew. The Lord is near, you guys. You're never alone. He's with me in this storm. So let's listen to the advice he gives. Given that, okay, listen now to the advice he gives in Philippians 4, verse 6. He says, be anxious for nothing. The Lord is near, so be anxious for nothing. I love that. You've heard me turn that because I have that one down. I'm never anxious for nothing. It's always something. Anyway, sorry. Be anxious for nothing, verse 6 continues, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. In other words, invite God into your storm. Invite God, let your requests be made known. Invite God, tell him what you want. Invite him into your storm, right into the middle of your fear and your dread, right into the middle of the fact that you feel like you're losing your grip. Don't pretend you're doing better than you are. Remember the story of Jesus in the boat with the disciples and Jesus was asleep. Remember this? And a big storm came and they were freaking out because he was asleep and like, Jesus, wake up. And so if that's the disciple you are right now, you're the panicky one, don't pretend you're not the panicky one. Be the panicky one and invite God right into that panic. but now as you invite him into your fear and the fact that you're losing your grip now remember this now dial into this right in the middle of your fear and right in the middle of your panic the Lord is near he's with you in the boat so tell him what you want really don't get spiritual even tell him what you want let your requests be made known change my circumstance Go ahead, pray that. Pour it out, tell the truth, be yourself. One of the things we say around here a lot relative to prayer is this. You have to, you have to come to God the way you are. Not the way you ought to be and not the way you wish you were. And the reason you can come the way you are is because the Lord is near. He knows anyway. Sometimes the storm is calmed. You know that's true. In Mark chapter four, the story of the boat with Jesus sleeping and the disciples panicking. He stood up and said, peace, be still. The storm was calmed. And so sometimes the storm is calmed. And when it is, we always do this. You go through this season and all of a sudden the sun comes out again and everything lifts. And you wonder why you were so worried in the first place. I should have known. You kind of beat yourself up. I should have known he would calm the storm. Oh me of little faith. And we have peace. But it isn't peace that passes understanding. It's peace that I do understand. I understand peace because there's peace. But sometimes the storm isn't calmed. So one of the things that's just so moving about Tom's story because there have been things that have been calmed and God has met him in certain places, but some of the storm is still going on. He's still in the middle of it. some of the storm isn't calmed. Indeed, one day the apostle Paul, who weathered many, many storms and ultimately would be coming out of those storms, one day he was beheaded. Boat sank that day. Stephen, in the context of really being obedient to God, was stoned to death. Peter was crucified upside down, so those storms didn't go away. So it's very important that you notice carefully the promise in Ephesians or Philippians 4 that Paul is giving relative to peace in the storm and the storm. The promise Paul claims here in Philippians 4, he doesn't say, and if you let your requests be made known to God, the power of God will calm your storm. Though he can and he does sometimes. So go ahead and ask. The promise he makes is this. You let your requests be made known to God. You bring God into all of that stuff, and the peace of God will guard your heart, is what he promises. And how did Paul know that? That the peace of God could guard his heart? Because he'd learned these things. Because he'd practiced these things of inviting God into the darkest and scariest places of his heart. Beloved, Paul learned these things like you and I learned them. over time. You don't get it right all the time. Maybe most of the time. You learn it. He learned it over time by taking his fear and anxiety to God and the more he did it and the more you do it, the more he came to know that all my problems go away. No. What he came to know was that the Lord is near. He's with me in the boat. and if he is, ultimately, I have nothing to fear. Even if this boat goes down. So here's my request. I will let it be known. Lord, calm the storm. Change my circumstance, I pray. Heal this disease. Restore my marriage. Bring our kids back home. Provide the money that we don't have. Help us keep the house. But more calm the storm in here. And so we light a candle. The third Sunday of Advent is the candle of peace. That doesn't seem to stand a chance when the gale force winds of life begin to blow. but maybe it does stand a chance peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world gives give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid so go in peace my name is Steve Weans and I'm one of the lead pastors here at Open Door and I hope that you've had a chance to come over the last couple weeks as we've explored the message of Advent last weekend if you were here you remember that we partnered with an organization called Trade as One and we brought a global marketplace out to the gathering place. And we showcased a bunch of products that were made by people living in extreme poverty. And all these products were fair trade, which means that they were made by people that got a fair wage for them in good conditions, no slavery. And we are thrilled to announce to you that over 400 forms were filled out by you, totaling over $24,000 that's going to go toward these people. Great job. thank you so much for your amazing yes and being intentional about how you love. Now lastly, I want to take just a quick moment to talk about year-end giving. I shared last month in our home-based update that year-end giving really does make up a significant portion of what our budget ends up being, and it impacts what we can do and cannot do throughout the year. And so I want to let you know that the goal for December is $690,000. And this is actually the first time that the goal has been under $700,000 for several years, due mostly to the budget cuts that we've made over the last few years. And heading into year end, we have some additional ground to make up because in October and November, we missed our giving goals by about $110,000 total. And so you're going to be hearing more about year end giving over the next few weeks. But if Open Door is home for you, and if you are in a place where you can give generously, and we realize that's not everybody right now. Some of us are in places of extreme need, and so we recognize this isn't everybody. But for those of you who can give, we really would ask you to consider giving generously to Open Door. And it's amazing how many of you have said yes over the year. Not just of giving, but in terms of volunteering around Maple Grove and Minneapolis with Kids Ministry and Next Gen. And so we're absolutely thrilled with the kind of life that's coming up in every cracking corner of this place. And so we're just aware that finances play a part in us being able to do those things. And so we wanted to place our need out on the table in front of you. you
