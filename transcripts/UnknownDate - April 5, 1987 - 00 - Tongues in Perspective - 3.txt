Open your Bibles with me to the book of 1 Corinthians, chapter 14, verse 20. 1 Corinthians, chapter 14, verse 20. Our continuing study in the book of Corinthians finds us right in the middle of a study on the gift of tongues. A wonderful time we're having, too. Verse 20, we begin. Brethren, do not be children in your thinking, yet in evil be babes. Be little infants who don't know anything about evil. but in your thinking be mature. Grow up, Corinthians. In the law it is written, by men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers, I will speak to this people, that being Israel. You're going to find that out in a minute. And even so, they will not listen to me, says the Lord. So then, or on the basis of the fact of what we learn in verse 21, tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to unbelievers. But prophecy is for a sign. By the way, that's not in the original. But prophecy could be more literally said, but prophecy is not to unbelievers, but to those who believe. Therefore, if therefore the whole congregation should assemble together and all speak in tongues and an ungifted man or unbelievers enter, will they not say, you are mad? But if all prophesy and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted by all and he is called into account by all. The secretive is harder disclosed and so he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you. As we get into the text, let's look to the Lord again. Father, we have enjoyed this study. It has been one that has been informative. And it is necessary that we get information on an issue like this that is so volatile among us as Christians. We find among us believers who find themselves not just on different sides of an opinion or a doctrine, but on different sides of offense in terms of even caring to fellowship with one another. We see painful kinds of division over this. And God, we pray first of all that you would affect our hearts before you ever begin to work on our heads as we would be infected with love for people who would take a position that would either cause us to be threatened or somehow attack us. And Lord, may we be free from any attacking ourselves in any way. God, give us wisdom, clearness of mind, and openness of heart as we delve again into this text as it relates to tongues. In Jesus' name, amen. It is no secret that we are dealing with tongues. It is also no secret that this is a controversial issue, one that has caused polarization among believers. And it is because of that that we come to the book to find out where the balance is. I was talking with someone just yesterday, and they had heard through the grapevine, they don't go to our church, that we're dealing with tongues right now, and that this is going to be our third week, and we will most assuredly have at least one more week after this, maybe one after that. And they were a little amazed that we would spend four weeks on the topic of tongues. And I kind of thought, well, I guess that's a lot. And yet I realized the fact that this is not just an attempt on our part to tell you everything you ever wanted to know about tongues. Our focus here at this church is different than that. The focus of our study is to go through the text. It just so happens that the text is dealing with tongues. There's a difference between doing a topical thing on tongues and just trying to go through the text. We're going to find out an awful lot of things, but our commitment is to the text, and I believe that's where we find balance. Last week, in the first 19 verses, we began to discuss the place of tongues in worship. And you will remember that I have divided this passage, and what I mean by this passage is the entire chapter, verses 1 through 40, into three particular groups. First of all, verses 1 to 19, the place of tongues in worship. Second of all is the one we're going to deal with today, and that is the purpose of tongues, verses 20 to 25. And then next week, verses 26 to 40, the procedure of tongues. But last week, we identified the fact that quite obviously, the place of tongues in worship is clearly secondary. It is specifically secondary to prophecy. We see that clearly in verse 5 where he says, Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues. Nothing wrong with tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. Prophecy is superior to the gift of tongues in the context of worship. We were also careful to indicate, as we identified the place of tongues, that Paul is not in this passage intending to malign the gift of tongues or eliminate its use. What he is doing here, we have seen, is to say that the gift of tongues in the context of worship needs to have some restrictions on it, and you Corinthians are not having that. Verse 18 and 19, I think, catches the balance of the whole thing. He says, I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all. Nothing wrong with tongues. He affirms its value, but, he says in verse 19, in the church. I would rather hear five words with my mind than 10,000 in a tongue. Again, tongues are secondary. Then we get three reasons why they're secondary. First of all, tongues are secondary because they are limited in their ability to edify. You remember that? The reason for that is starting in verse 1. The reason tongues are limited in their ability to edify is because tongues do not speak to men. They speak to God. And because they do not speak to men, they are limited in their ability to edify. The other thing we need to be mindful of is this. The purpose of our coming together is for edification. Verse 12, we got that. Seek to abound in the edification for the edification of the church. That's what we want to do. Tongues is limited in its ability to do that. However, verse 3, the one who prophesies speaks to men. And it accomplishes a specific task. What does it do? It edifies, it exhorts, and it consoles because there are clear, discernible words being spoken that people can understand and it builds the body. Tongues can't do that. Or at least they're limited in doing that. We would seek after prophecy. There's another reason why it's limited and that is because it's unintelligible, verses 6 through 12. But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you? What good is it going to do you if I do that? The principle that he shared, and then he goes on to a lifeless thing, verse 7, either a flute or a harp, if it produces a sound, but there's no distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played? The principle that he is sharing here, as he again affirms the fact that tongues are limited or they are secondary, is the simple fact that you cannot be built up or edified by what you can't understand. You can't be built up by what you can't understand. And Corinthians, you might be thinking that when you come together and you have this incredible wowie-zowie experience and everybody's speaking in tongues that God really fell, I'm not so sure, he says, because you might feel warm in your innards, but the kind of things that really make people grow is not that. You sound to me like a piano out of tune, verse 7, like a bugle that has an indistinct sound, and it doesn't prepare anybody for battle. You might feel good, but you're really not being equipped. What does equip people? Prophecy. Prophecy. The clear, understandable presentation of God's words. Another reason we went over last time, just right out of the text, that it is limited or secondary is because it hinders worship. Remember verse 16. Otherwise, if you come into the congregation and you bless in the Spirit only, We're speaking here of a prayer language as is indicated in verse 14. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays. Now, if you just do that in the congregation, how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted say the amen? And you remember from last week how important amen was. Remember that? The Jewish rabbis who said things like this, he who says amen shortly, so shall his days be shortened. I loved how you amened. I'm going to give you another chance. He who says amen distinctly and at length, so shall his days be lengthened. Amen? Amen. You know, you guys can do it when your life depends on it. Right? The point is this, that when the prayer language is the focus of the congregation, people who don't understand what's being said without an interpretation, and I'm inferring, by the way, that everybody was doing it all at the same time kind of thing, that the person who doesn't understand can't enter into the worship. And you may be praying, giving thanks well enough, verse 17. You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified. And when we come together, the purpose is for the other's edification. Okay. With that in view, we move on. And as we move on to verse 20, we are continuing, or Paul is continuing, in his attempt to put tongues in perspective. In fact, that's the title of this whole series. These last three weeks going into next week. tongues in perspective. And now he is going to do it by reminding them of the original purpose of tongues anyway. Okay? It's as if to say this, you know, you guys have followed up the whole arena of tongues, and one of the reasons is because you're so selfish. All you care about is edifying yourself, so you come into the church and you just do whatever feels good, not minding at all what someone else might need in that particular time. But another reason you abuse it is because you have not been educated into understanding what the original purpose of it was for anyway. Let's get into it. The purpose of tongues, verse 20. Now, there's a key thing here I want you to see before I even break this down for you, and it's in verse 22. It says this, if you're talking about the purpose and looking for it, it says right there at the beginning, so then tongues are for a sign. That's the purpose of tongues, okay? At least as it's delineated here. Tongues are for a sign. I have a question, what's a sign? A sign is simply an affirmation of something. It affirms the truth about something. It is a proof of something. It points to things. It gives directions. It is an indicator. If I see a sign, or a sign is given from God, it is an indicator that something is true. You probably know that. We've dealt with that before. When we dealt with gifts of miracles, things that we call sign gifts. The next question is this. It says here that tongues are for a sign. My question is, what is it a sign of? Okay, tongues are for a sign. Of what? Well, some people would tell us that tongues are for a sign, and they are a sign of the filling of the Spirit. Okay, have you ever heard that before? Tongues are for a sign. You bet they are. They are a sign of the filling of the Spirit. Some will tell us that they are a sign that the Holy Spirit has come. Some will tell us that they are a sign that you are saved. If you speak in tongues, that is a sign, an affirmation, a proof, that you are saved, that you are filled, that the Holy Spirit has come, on and on. Others will tell us that if you speak in tongues, it is a sign that you've had too much sweet wine. Others will tell us that if you speak in tongues, it is a sign that you're off your rocker. On and on and on. All sorts of different ideas. Well, those might be well and good, but what we want to know is what the text says. And whether we see it there or not, the text tells us what the sign is of. Let's take a look. As we deal with these five verses today, we're going to break it down into three parts. The first part is an exhortation. Look at verse 20. Brethren, do not be children in your thinking, yet in evil be babes, but in your thinking be mature. Now, when I first read this, it felt like a rebuke to me. And I kind of ended our sermon last time together on this particular verse, indicating that the Corinthians were the antithesis of this verse. Remember that? They were not mature in their thinking. Doctrine and theology and understanding what they believed was not one of their priorities. Ecstatic experience was one of their priorities, and they would get that at all costs. Stopping to think was not one of the things they cared much about. Yet, when it came to evil, they were anything but babes. They were graduating at the top of their class. Immorality, divisiveness, hurting a brother or a sister in the body was something they were very, very good at. So there is a sense where we could approach that as being a rebuke. I do not believe that's Paul's intention, however. What I think is this. I think it's an exhortation to the Corinthians to begin to prepare themselves to think because he's going to tell them some things right now that they're going to have to think about. They're going to have to evaluate. And the other reason is he's going to tell them some things right here that they simply do not know. They have never heard this before. Now, why is it that they don't know this? Sometimes there are rebukes in the word of God when there are things that a believer should know and they don't. And Paul tells them things like, you should know these things and why don't you know this after such a long time? This time, what they don't know isn't their fault. The reason they don't know what Paul is about to disclose to them is for the most part, the Corinthian assembly was a Gentile assembly. And what he is going to share with them is something right out of the history of Israel. And he's saying this, Corinthians, don't be children in your thinking. You've got to understand something about tongues that you do not know. And I think if you knew it, some of the abuse would be rectified. Okay, I'm exhorting you. We can't afford to be children in our thinking. Put on your thinker cap. We're going to dig in. First of all, the exhortation. Now we're going to get to the instruction. Here's what I want you. This is what I've exhorted you to know. Look at this strange verse 21. In the law it is written, by men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers, I will speak to this people, even so they will not listen to me. This would be a great verse to stop and open up for discussion. What do you think that means? What do you think that means? Well, I will speak to this people in a strange tongue and in lips of strangers, and even so they will not listen to me. Well, right off the bat, maybe you could look at that verse and go, this whole theme is that tongues are secondary, and they're really not that important. And maybe what he's saying here is this. Even in the Old Testament, if someone spoke in tongues, people didn't listen anyways, so don't bother speaking in tongues. I don't know. That might be, and I'll preach a whole sermon on how that means it. But what do we do if we want to find out what something means? Well, one of the things we need to know is that verse, probably in your Bible, is in italics. What that means is it's a quote from the Old Testament. Got an idea? Let's go back to the Old Testament and find out what it means. Isaiah 28. You have to turn with me. Isaiah 28. One of the principles we have in our Bible teaching all the time is before you apply something, you need to know what it means. If you don't know what it means, you will make inappropriate application. Let's find out what's going on here. As you turn, let me give you some history. As we approach this text, we find ourselves in the southern kingdom of Judah. It is 705 years before Christ. King Hezekiah is the reigning king. It is 15 years after the northern kingdom was judged by God for their sin and apostasy and was overrun by the Assyrians. As we come into chapter 28 of Isaiah, God, through the prophet Isaiah, is giving to the southern kingdom a warning about the same thing. He's saying basically this. The apostasy that is running rampant through your country is going to bring on you the judgment of God. And exactly what happened to the northern kingdom is going to happen to you if you don't repent now. Okay, that's the background. Now let's go to the text. In verse 7 of chapter 28, Isaiah is confronting the prophets and the priests for their behavior. And he's speaking of prophets and priests, the leadership. They reel with wine and stagger from strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink. They are confused by wine. They stagger from strong drink. They reel. The word there means err. They err, make mistakes while having visions. And they totter or stumble. Again, make mistakes when rendering judgments. For all the taberals, this is great, are full of filthy vomit without a clean place. You guys are drunk. Not only are you drunk, you're sick all over the place. It is a total mess. He has confronted them. So it is, in verse 9, the people that he has just confronted respond to his confrontation, not by repentance, but by mocking. Listen to their response, verse 9. Isaiah, who do you think you are? To whom would he teach knowledge? You, Isaiah, to whom would you teach knowledge? And to whom would he interpret the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from the breast? Basically what's being said there is this. Who could teach us? Who do you think you could teach, Isaiah? Do you think you could teach us? Let me think. Who could you teach? Here's the prophets and priests all drunk, figuring out who Isaiah could teach. I know, a little baby. Someone fresh from the breast. That's who you could teach. Why? Because Isaiah, your teaching is simplistic and for little children. Verse 10. For Isaiah says, order on order, order on order, line on line, line on line. a little here, a little there. It's simplistic. It's for children. You couldn't teach us anything. Verse 11. There gets some teeth, and this is where it begins to be significant for us. Indeed, Isaiah is speaking here. He, God, God will speak to this people, only now he is not going to speak to his people through the soft and gentle but very clear and direct word of Isaiah. he is going to speak to this people through stammering lips and a foreign tongue. And he who said to them, that's God, here is rest, give rest to the weary. And he who said, here is repose, but they would not listen. So the word of the Lord will go to them. But again, and it will be simple, it will be order on order, order on order, line on line, line on line, a little here, a little there. But it will not be through the voice of the prophet. The way they're going to hear the message now is by their going back to stumble and their being broken and snared and taken captive. What does all that mean? It is referring to judgment coming. It is referring to judgment coming. And what is being said here is this. Israel, southern kingdom, God's judgment is going to come if you don't repent. And what is going to happen is another country is going to come among you and overrun you, and you need to know that it's not just another invasion. It is a sign from me that the judgment I warned that would come has come. And the sign that you're going to hear that's going to rise something up in the pit of your stomach and make you sick is when you hear the babbling of other foreign languages all around you, something's going to click. And what you're going to know when you hear these foreign tongues is what? the judgment that God said would come has. Okay? That's what it means. Tongues are for a sign. Of what? Well, first of all, of judgment. Now, wait a minute. I don't know how this applies yet. I'm just giving you a lot of teaching here. Okay? Whatever it is that tongues are for a sign of, they are, first of all, a sign of judgment. That what God said would happen has. Okay? Well, I've never heard this kind of thing before as it relates to tongues. Keep hanging with me. History records, by the way, that a group of people referred to by the Israelites as the babbling Babylonians did indeed invade that land. And when they came with their, what the Israelites called, babbling language, when they heard the tongues, what did they know? That God's judgment that he warned would come had. Okay? And what was the sign that the judgment had come? The babbling tongues. Okay? Okay. So as we're trying to answer this question of what is the sign, it is first of all a sign of judgment. That's kind of weird. Not to a Jew. Not to a Jew. All through their history, by the way, Deuteronomy 28, 49. 1,500 years before Christ, Moses was dealing with the people and he was speaking of judgment. And he said this, the sign that judgment has come will be foreign languages, tongues you do not understand. And when you hear that language, all of them have been overrun. A sick feeling is going to come in your stomach. What God warned about has happened. Same thing, Jeremiah 5.15. Listen to this. Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from afar, O house of Israel. It is a mighty nation that will come. It is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you know not, neither understand you what they say. Point. The point is this. The strange tongue, the confused language, is a sign of judgment. What God said would happen has. Next question. In what way does tongues indicate judgment when we come to 1 Corinthians? Get back to 1 Corinthians with me now. Let me tie this in. Having read that by strange tongues and by lips of strangers, I will speak to this people. It used to be Isaiah. Now it's going to be by those tongues. Even so, they will not listen to me. Even then, they won't. So then, therefore, on the basis of tongues being assigned for judgment, then tongues are for a sign now of what? Judgment. I don't get it. I am so confused right now. You know, last week, Dave, you were here and you were telling us that tongues are for praying and tongues are for blessing and tongues are for giving thanks. True. But remember something else we've been saying over the last three weeks, that there are what? Various kinds of tongues, right? And I believe that what Paul is dealing with here is the tongues that the Corinthians did not know the background of as it relates specifically to Pentecost. What happened at Pentecost? What happened at Pentecost? People spoke in tongues, right? right corinthians knew that what the corinthians maybe didn't know however was that the purpose of the tongues at pentecost was for a sign what was the sign for i think the sign at pentecost was what this is dealing with and that is this they are for a sign of judgment judgment of what judgment of what what was it that was being judged how was it assigned to anybody at pentecost it was simply a sign that by the way i need to set the stage for you here interesting to me that at pentecost it took place in jerusalem okay it took place at the passover and what that meant was that place was just crammed with jews just from every corner of the world jews were there and it was to that place that god brought this event that paul i believe is identifying here as a sign to who to I believe, unbelieving Israel, just the way God brought signs to unbelieving Israel all through its history. What is the message of the judgment? I believe the message of the judgment of Pentecost to the Jews there by the bringing of tongues was this. Jews, unbelieving Jews, you need to know something. You have been my chosen people. You have been the channel through which I have spoken to the world. You have been the mouthpiece I have used for all of history, but what you need to know at this particular time in history, judgment has come because you are not going to be the only one anymore. I am opening the door to the Gentiles. This message is not exclusively belonging to yours, to you. Judgment has come. Tongues at Pentecost were foresigned to unbelieving Jews that judgment had come a new era is ushered in a covenant a new covenant is has been introduced and i'm not sure every jew there knew that when they heard the tongue but in the history of a jew when foreign tongues come a sick feeling comes in the stomach and that is this what god said he would do he has done something has been changed there's a second aspect of the sign dimension here however not only it a sign for judgment, I believe it's also a sign of blessing. How is that? The way it's a sign of blessing is not so much for the Jew as it is for the Gentile, because as Christ turned his back on Israel in terms of its exclusive covenant with them, by the way, he did not close the door to the Jews, obviously. We are to bring the gospel to the Jews first and also to the Greeks. But what has happened in terms of that event, that proclamation of tongues at Pentecost, one of the things that is being ushered in here is not only judgment to the Jews, but blessing to the Gentile, because he's basically saying this, you are now also a channel through which I am going to speak. You are also a people to whom I am going to come. You have access to me. Gentiles. By the way, that event opened the possibility for someone like me today to be standing in a pulpit, preaching the gospel, for you to be sitting listening to it. A new era was ushered in. An event. That event of Pentecost brought just as much change, if you will, as the event of the crucifixion, as the event of the resurrection. Something new was brought. Corinthians didn't have any idea that that was true. They were just kind of using tongues all over the place. It's just great. It's just like Pentecost. No, it isn't. By the way, that fact of opening it up to the Gentiles even sheds a kind of a deeper light on Ephesians chapter 2. As we consider what happened at Pentecost, and that being a sign of judgment, Israel, you're no longer the chosen people. Blessing Gentiles, I'm opening this up to you for your blessing. In Ephesians 2, it says this, Therefore, remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision, which is performed in the flesh by human hands, remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, as strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ you've been brought near. All of that was ushered in at Pentecost. So it is. Let me narrow this down. Tongues are for a sign of two things. Of two things. One, they are primarily for a sign of judgment to unbelievers. Specifically, historically, a sign to unbelieving Jews. Okay? and message directly to them, and now I tie that in again. It was at Jerusalem that it happened. Jews from all over the world came to that place specifically for that, and that's where God did that event, if you will. But secondarily, it is also a sign of blessing to believers that affirms the access that we have to God. Now, tie it in with the Corinthian assembly. In the Corinthian assembly, the activity of tongues was doing neither one of those things. They had so abused it that when tongues operated in their assembly, believers were not blessed. Tongues are for a sign of blessing, I believe, to believers. Okay? And unbelievers were not confronted. Tongues are for a sign of judgment that what God said he would do, he would do. Neither one of those things were happening in the church in Corinth because they had so abused it. Why would that happen? Well, one of the things we already know about the church in Corinth was that they didn't understand the purpose of tongues. They didn't realize very possibly that it was for judgment, that it was to communicate that, that it was for blessing, that it was to communicate that to unbelievers. And so when they participated in tongues, it didn't fulfill that purpose. Another reason was that they were all doing it at once. Verse 23. If therefore the whole church should assemble together and all speak in tongues, they were doing it all at the same time, okay? Causing confusion. There was also no interpretation going on. We're going to get into that more next week. But in your assembly, in the Corinthian assembly, verse 24 is what happened. Verse 24 is what happened in the Corinthian assembly. I'm sorry, verse 23. If therefore the whole church should assemble together and all speak in tongues as they do in your church, what happens then? The ungifted men or unbelievers enter. Will they not say that you are mad? Yes, they will say you're mad. Because tongues were not being used appropriately in this particular church. Unbelievers come. You don't understand the purpose of tongues. You're just doing it selfishly to get attention to yourself. It never does fulfill its purpose in the heart of an unbeliever. They come in, they say you're mad. When they leave thinking you're nuts, you kind of feel spiritual, okay? Because, boy, I'll tell you, they just didn't understand. They weren't really let in on how much we know about tongues. They really weren't ready for it. They think you're mad. You think you're spiritual. Paul says, I think you're children. I think you're children. Be not children in your thinking. Tongues are not appropriate for every situation, especially the way you use them, Corinthians. you have no idea even what their purpose is. And so I say all of that, I believe Paul is saying in verses 24 and 25, I say all of that to say again what I have been saying since the first verse of the 14th chapter. And what I've been trying to say from the first verse of the 14th chapter is this, the priority of our come-together time is edification. And the method that is most suited to bring edification to unbelievers and believers in a corporate assembly is what? Everybody speaking in tongues. No, that has a place, but the way to bring edification is prophesy. Speak clearly the words of God, and it builds people. Tongues don't do that. Verse 24, But if I'll prophesy and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, there is something specific that happens because he can understand what is being said. He is convicted by all. He is called into account by all. The secrets of his heart are disclosed and he will fall on his face and worship God declaring that God is certainly among you. Prophecy accomplishes a goal. Tongues don't. And I will add this, they never did. They never did. It was never the intention of tongues, even at Pentecost, to be evangelistic, for instance. Now, we've dealt with that. Do you know that even at Pentecost, the thing that finally clicked and got people saved was not just because people spoke in tongues. That was kind of a pre-evangelistic thing that communicated to those Jews judgment and communicated to the believing Jews blessing. But what caused the change in people's lives was when? It was when Peter took his stand with the eleven and says, Men of Judea, listen to me. This Jesus whom you crucify, he is risen. He is Lord. You need to repent. And they did. Three thousand. And by the way, if you're wondering if this judgment of Israel means that they aren't available, the three thousand who were saved at Pentecost were what? Jews. All of them. So it is that the instruction, I believe, is clear from this. The church of Jesus Christ is to commit itself to the clear, discernible proclamation of the Word of God. And that to a believer in an assembly where the Word of God is being proclaimed, it results specifically in edification in his building, in exhortation, meaning his correction, and in consolation, a bringing of comfort. And to an unbeliever, the clear delineation of God's words in the assembly brings conviction, judgment, and repentance. And tongues by themselves will never do that. However, there is a way in which tongues can indeed function in the body and bring edification and be a working thing. And that has to do with the procedure. Verses 26 through verse 40, we'll deal with that next week. you
