We are entering today the final phase in a series that we have come to know as the pain of pornea. The issue at hand this week and next is that of homosexuality. The primary question relative to this issue that I want to address, on the front end at least, is this. Is homosexuality a viable Christian option? Is homosexuality a lifestyle that in any context can know the blessing of, can receive the endorsement of God? In the vernacular, I would say it this way. Is gay okay or not? Now, the first thing that occurs to me about even bringing up that question is this. That as recently as 25 years ago, the answer to that question, even in our secular culture, would have been a resounding no. No, gay is not okay. What that means is this, that in a very short period of time, we have in our secular culture experienced a radical shift in our thinking. Right or wrong, good or bad, the fact is this, we've experienced a shift. Let me give you some perspective on it, historically. In 1914, E.M. Foster wrote a novel. He entitled Maurice. In that book, he was affirming the value of homosexual love, calling it, among other things, quote, ennobling, end quote. Any perversity, he said, lies not in homosexuality, but in a society that persecutes such behavior. Now, in 1914, he could not get that book published. In 1971, he could. Why? Well, for among other reasons, there was a shift in the thinking of the culture. That's at least part of the reason. In 1967, soon after what has become known as the Wolfenden Report was published, the law of the land was changed in the United States. The Sexual Offenses Act of 1967 read this way, homosexual behavior between consenting adults in private is no longer a criminal offense. Now, whatever it is you think of that law, however it is you feel about it, whether it's a good law or a bad law, what I want to note is this. That marks a shift in our culture's thinking. As recently as 1967, our secular culture, our schools, even our judicial system regarded homosexuality as wrong, indeed illegal. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association dropped homosexuality from its list of recognized mental disorders. was no longer regarded as a pathological condition to be treated, but a natural, normal alternative to sexuality. At that point, treatment no longer was helping people deal with... I'm sorry. Treatment at that time became helping people deal with, adjust to, and accept their homosexuality in a hostile, quote, homophobic society. Now, the 20 years since then, 1973 to 1993, have been marked by a radical acceleration of acceptance of homosexual behavior, empowered by and embodied in what we have come to know as the gay movement or gay liberation, most recently manifested in national and daily debate over gays in the military, over issues like the granting of minority status to gays, our schools beginning more and more to teach our children that homosexuality is a normal, healthy, acceptable variant of human sexual behavior. In our society today, common comparisons of sexual orientation to the color of one's skin, so that now putting a moral value on and making a moral judgment about homosexuality like homosexuality is wrong, is tantamount in our society today to putting a moral value on and making a moral judgment about being black or white or Hispanic. Now, whatever you think of that, right or wrong, what that marks, and I think we need to notice, is this. For certain, we have seen in our culture a shift in thinking. Now, I have never had very high hopes for our culture to begin with. So it does not surprise me, and I don't think it should when things go from bad to worse, that God's people are shocked. My concern is in the church. So what about the church? The fact is this, historically, from the time of Christ till very recently, the vast majority of all theologians have stood against homosexual behavior as, quote, part of the disorder of a fallen world. The only variance historically as it relates to the issue of homosexuality in the church tradition has not been whether homosexuality is sin or not, but rather debate about how serious a sin it was. People like Tertullian, Augustine, Aquinas regarded homosexuality as the worst of all possible sins. And unfortunately, that kind of mentality and theology gave birth to evil things being perpetrated on people who struggle with homosexuality, from people being put to death to the more contemporary style of that vile mentality that is called today gay bashing, a vile evil thing. Others, historically, more in the line of Calvin and Luther, spoke strongly and consistently against homosexual behavior, but saw it as no more or less serious a sin than any other sin. But historically in the church, it was agreed upon that it was sin. No longer is that true. Consistent with the culture we live in and over indeed the same space of time that the shift has taken place in the culture, there has been a shift in the church and in theology as well. It is a shift that many people sitting in the proverbial pews kind of go to church back and forth, are not aware of, but it has happened, and it is, even as I speak, happening nonetheless. Let me give you some perspective on that. In 1968, a minister in San Diego, California named Troy Perry founded the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches. It's come to be known now as the MCC, Metropolitan Community churches. Presently, they have well over 90 congregations around the country, claiming more than 20,000 members in the United States alone. Reverend Perry wrote a book, The Lord is My Shepherd and He Knows I'm Gay. His work, combined with others, most notably in the early days of this movement, a guy by the name of D. Sherman Bailey gave birth to what we've come to know as the gay theology. Now, an interesting thing about what we refer to now as the gay theology is this. Much of it claims, not all of it, but much of it claims to be evangelical. Jesus is their Lord. If you would go to many of their churches, again, not all, but many, you would hear some of the same hymns and choruses that we sing. They suppose and claim to embrace the Word of God as the true Word of God. But as it relates to issues like homosexuality, they communicate very strongly and clearly that we have horribly misinterpreted the Word of God because according to them, nowhere in the Word of God does God speak against homosexuality when it is, and this is the qualification, a loving, caring, consensual, monogamous relationship between a man and a man and a woman and a woman. What they claim is the only thing the Bible speaks again is homosexual rape, prostitution, some sort of abuse or even promiscuity. But loving, monogamous relationships, the Bible is silent about that. Indeed, God blesses that, and you can know the endorsement of God in a homosexual relationship. they take the fact that Jesus is silent specifically on homosexuality as if it were an endorsement of it they do the Greek work as we do the Greek work they work with the Hebrew words and tell you what they mean they deal with the history of the text the context of the text the culture that is around the text all the kinds of things that you hear constantly from this pulpit as well they are no fools. In 1978, the Open Church Group published an article called Christian and Gay, an evangelical case. Their statement of conviction was this, and I quote, that human sexuality in all its richness is a gift from God, gladly to be accepted, enjoyed, and honored as a way of both expressing and growing in love in accordance with the life and teaching of Jesus. That sounds good. Therefore, based on that, this is the conclusion they draw, it is our conviction that it is entirely compatible with Christian faith, not only to love a person of the same sex, but to express that love fully in a personal, sexual relationship. Their statement of purpose is as follows, and again I quote, to encourage fellowship, friendship, support among individual gay Christians through prayer, study, and action, wherever possible in the local church, to help the whole church re-examine its understanding of human sexuality and to work for a positive acceptance of gay relationships so that all homosexuals may live without fear of rejection and that homosexual Christians may contribute fully to the life and ministry of the church. Our purpose is to encourage members to witness to their faith within the gay community and to witness to their conviction about human sexuality within the church. End quote. more than I believe most of us know in places and among people that I believe would surprise you and sadden you that mission of theirs is being successful and whatever it is you think of that mission be it a good one or a bad one know this for certain The fact undeniable is this. There has been in the church a shift in our thinking. And it is to that shift on the front end of dealing with this issue that I am going to deal. What I am calling, if you will, a fight for the truth. What is right and what is wrong. There has been a shift. In their book, Unnatural Affections, The authors George Grant and Mark Horn lament that shift, saying this, the modern church is in trouble. Though its attendance is growing, its influence is diminishing. Though its giving is up, its impact is down. Though its profile is heightened, its vitality is lessened. And that is not the worst of it. The church today is divided against itself, locked into a fierce conflict over the most basic questions of ethics and morality. I am more worried about the evangelical faith in this country than ever, says author and pastor Michael Scott Horton. I wonder if evangelical Christianity can survive another era of being tossed back and forth with every wind and doctrine. And he is not alone. Recently, innumerable voices have joined together in a chorus of concern. Theologian R.C. Sproul characterizes the church as continuing to slide into a morass of theological relativism and subjectivism. Renowned social commentator Charles Colson refers to the American Christian dilemma as a church or the reality as a church in exile. Church historian Martin Marty laments that the church today may be in more difficulty and travail than at any other time in its long history. Evangelist Billy Graham concurred, saying, I am not certain what the future holds for the institutional church, but at the moment it looks grim. Presbyterian leader D. James Kennedy argues that, quote, there is little hope for the world if the church cannot agree on the simplest of things, like what is right and what is wrong. My question is this. How do we decide what is right and what is wrong? I'll be able to decide that better without that. How do we determine when even among people who call themselves Christians, Bible believers, there is division and there is confusion? When using the same text to point out something we would use to prove is wrong, they would use the same text to prove that it is right. When you have that kind of confusion among people who say they believe the Bible, how do you decide? Well, it seems to me we've got some work to do. It is biblical work. It is scriptural work to see if somewhere from the Word of God we can determine, we can decide, relative to this issue anyway, what is right and what is wrong. One of the things I need to do up front relative to this, however, is tell you this. Before we even move into this, this morning, you need to know I have decided. I have determined. And you need to know that. Not usually the way I handle things in a dealing like this. I kind of like to bring you along and then make the conclusions at the end. Up front. I want you to know where I'm at. I believe that homosexuality is sin. The Greek word for sin most often used in the Word of God is hamartia. What that means is to miss the mark. I believe that homosexuality misses the mark. I believe also that the overwhelming weight of Scripture is going to bear that out. I do not believe that homosexuality is any greater sin than any other sin. In fact, one of the things we're going to see as we deal with the variety of texts dealing with the issue of homosexuality is that we will consistently find homosexuality in the context of other behaviors no more or less vile than homosexuality. We want to make homosexuality the worst thing. It comes in the context of other vile things like greed, envy, malice, slander, arrogance. And because you don't struggle with homosexuality, but you are full of deceit, makes you in the same pot as having struggle with things that miss the mark. It's no greater or less. But my energy today is not about trying to convince people that envy is wrong or right, that greed is wrong or right. We would probably have a consensus in the Christian community that those things are wrong. We're fighting today as to whether homosexuality, a man lying with a man, a woman lying with a woman, is okay or not. something else I believe that needs to be said at the outset I believe that the men and women among us in our fellowship who struggle with homosexuality desperately need the same grace and the same safe place that all of us need to deal with all of our sin to face down all of the ways All of us missed the mark in many different ways. There's one more thing that I believe that on the front end you need to know about because it really tempers what I'm doing today. I believe that in the gay theology, we have Ezekiel chapter 22 revisited. We have 2 Timothy 4 and 2 Peter 2 realized. Ezekiel 22 verse 26 says this, Her priests, that is those people who have been set by God to be among the people who can, through the speaking of truth, God's truth, lead people into fullness of life. Her priests, in Ezekiel 22, have done violence to my word. They have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between what is holy and what is profane. They have not taught the difference between what is unclean and what is clean. They have not taught the difference between what is right and what is wrong. And because of that, I am profaned among them. I believe that gay theology is Ezekiel 22 revisited. It's back. 2 Timothy 4.3 says this, The time will come. And, beloved, the time has come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires. They will turn away their ears from the truth, and they will turn aside to myths. I believe that the gay theology that is making powerful inroads into the minds and hearts, even of believers, is 2 Timothy chapter 4. Realize it is here. 2 Peter 2, 1 through 3 speaks of false teachers rising up from among the people of God, introducing destructive heresies, saying many will follow their own sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth is maligned. I believe that gay theology is a major exhibit of the truth of God maligned. 1993. Church our size, I don't always know what we've got. You may or may not agree with what I just said about the gay theology, but don't wonder what I think about it. Okay. That's my introduction. You're in big trouble. Let me tell you where I'm going to be going with this over the next two weeks, and I want you to join with me in prayer about this. I have three things that I am deeply concerned that the Spirit of God, through the speaking of the truth, but beyond that, would accomplish. Number one, I care very deeply that as we process through this issue, we would hear a word of truth, that something would ring true. That is true. That somewhere we would have that experience. That through the din of confusion, there would come that ring. The second thing, however, is this. As important as the first, that through this process we would have a graceful response, especially to those among us who struggle with this issue. I care very deeply that that happens somehow in the middle of dealing with this. The third is this, that in dealing with this process we find in this a time to, a way to heal. Not only as it relates to homosexuality, but this entire issue our church has been going through for several months now, the pain of pornea. but where do we begin the only place i know to start and i think most important given the confusion around this issue of even what is right and wrong is to start by fighting for some truth in fighting for the truth where do we begin i have an idea about that too i think it's a good idea to begin at the beginning. The story of creation, very familiar. In chapter 1, verse 27 of Genesis, it says this, and God created man, that is human, in his own image. In the image of God, he created him. Male and female, he created them, and they were man. Verse 18, then the Lord God said, it is not good for man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him. I don't have time to do a long word study on suitable, but that is significant. I will make a helper suitable for him. Someone that fits him will be, I will make him for her, I will make her for him, and that will be suitable. Verse 22, And the Lord God fashioned into a woman the rib that was taken from the man and brought her to the man. And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man. For this cause, for the cause of a man being made for a woman and a woman for a man, a man shall leave his father and mother, cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. Now, some may hear that creation account and say, so? I mean, Dave, that's a beautiful story, and it might even explain the attraction that men have to women and women to men, But this passage says nothing about homosexual relationships. It doesn't speak to that at all. It doesn't exalt it. It doesn't blow it up. It doesn't do anything. You're not really going to say that this is the God-designed pattern, that this in this kind of poetic almost story of creation, you have the standard of God in sexuality, are you? Yeah. Yeah, I am. And there's a couple of reasons. Number one, in the text itself, in the Genesis account, we have what is called a moral directive, an imperative. An imperative simply means to do something. It's found in verse 24. For this cause. Some of your Bibles say, therefore. On the basis of what I just said, man created for woman, woman created for man. on the basis of that, do this. Leave, cleave, to become one flesh. And in that, you have the divine design, the standard of God for human sexuality. Some would hear that and say, Dave, Dave, okay, but you're not going to build your whole theology around that one little thing, are you? That is not enough. It's kind of weak, not very compelling. I have more. add to this creation account the word of Jesus in Matthew 19 verse 3 and 4 and also in Mark chapter 10. Now before you get to that I want to just give you a little key in interpreting scripture. There are things in the Old Testament that are a puzzle to us. We don't know what they always mean. Some of them we have words that don't even apply anymore. The New Testament is a place that in many, many respects affirms to us what it was that was meant by what we found in the Old Testament. The New Testament in many ways makes it clear to us what no longer applies and what does now apply. It's very compelling, beloved, that in Matthew 19, Jesus resurrects this very account of men being made for women, women for the man. one of the reasons this is important to me as I've been studying this week is this, that an interesting piece of the gay theology, as I said in the introduction, is that they point to Jesus' silence on homosexuality as compelling. And they embrace his silence as if it were an endorsement on monogamous, loving, caring, homosexual relationships. The fact is this, beloved, he never did. They're right. Speak directly to homosexuality in any form. Even homosexual. He didn't... homosexual rape. He didn't speak to that directly. Know this, however, also, he didn't speak directly to incest either or bestiality directly. He never said anything specifically about pedophilia or cross-dressing. He never ever said, don't read pornography and don't go to peep shows. But he did speak to sexuality, clearly and directly. And when he did, here's what he said. One man, one woman, no options. Leave, cleave, one flesh, in that you have the image and the glory of God in creation. From the beginning, Jesus says in Matthew 19. Let me turn to that. Matthew 19, verse 4. Have you not read? Don't you remember? Didn't you read your Bible? That he who created them, that is men and women, from the beginning made them male and female. And for this cause, male and female, a man shall leave his father and mother. The two shall become one flesh. Jesus brings this up himself and affirms it as indeed being the standard against which every other aspect of our sexuality is measured, giving us help knowing whether or not we're missing the mark. Anything other than this standard, one man, one woman, no options, leave, cleave, one flesh, anything other than that misses the mark. Add to the word of Jesus the word of Paul, 1 Corinthians 6, 16, Ephesians 5, 31. Both of those places, he resurrects this word about the two becoming one. He resurrects this word of the creation design as being the standard. And in both of those texts, Paul highlights the spiritual dimensions of our sexuality. And that is why those of you who were with us a few weeks ago became aware that one of the reasons the pain of porneia is so painful is because our sexuality, whether it be heterosexual sex or homosexual sex, involves more than skin rubbing skin. Remember that? Our sexuality has a spiritual dimension. And the reason moving outside of the bounds of what God has given to us as a gift creates pain is because more is touched than skin to skin. Our soul is touched. Something in our spirit is involved. Therefore, moving outside of what God has designed is going to bring pain. Ephesians 5, Paul goes so far with this ultimate design and the standard of God being a man and a woman, one man, one woman, no options, that he compares this union of a man and a woman so sacred to the sanctity and the mystery of the union that Christ has with the church. Ephesians chapter 5. For this cause. Here we go again. The creation account. Man shall leave his father and mother, that shall cleave to his wife, the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is great, But I am speaking not just of man and woman, but that is so incredible. I'm speaking with reference to the church and to Christ. Christ is the groom. The church is the bride. Here is the design, male and female, for each other, one flesh, the design of God for sexuality. Anything other than that misses the mark. Adultery misses the mark. Incest misses the mark. Fornication in general misses the mark. Bestiality misses the mark. Sexuality in the context even of a marriage that is void of intimacy misses the mark. Homosexuality, beloved, misses the mark. David Siemens, in his January 1992 article for Circuit Rider Magazine, which is a magazine for Methodist ministers, says this, quote, the church's historic stand against the practice of homosexuality is not based on the story of Sodom or on the proof texting of selected Bible verses. It is based on the consistent heterosexual track running through all of scripture, which is rooted in God's will expressed in creation. There are texts, and we're going to deal with them, that speak to and against homosexuality, but those texts, even though we're going to deal with them, are not the basis of our understanding of this issue. Our basis is rooted in the design of God, one man, one woman, leave, cleave, one flesh. That's where it starts. But what about these scriptures? What about Sodom? What about 1 Corinthians? and 1 Timothy and Romans chapter 1. Let's begin to deal with that today. The Old Testament today. Next week we'll get into the New Testament as well as some other issues as well. Let's look first of all at this issue of Sodom. What went on there? Does that clarify forever that homosexuality is wrong? Well, it's Genesis 19. Turn to it if you have your Bibles. this is a generally familiar story I say generally because most of us don't know the details of it but we know that Sodom was a bad place God was about to judge this city Abraham's nephew Lot lived in this city and so Abraham came to God and begged that God would hold back on his judgment for the sake of his nephew Lot he struck a deal with God of sorts where God finally said if you can find ten righteous men in the city of Sodom they will not be judged they will be spared with that in mind we read the text verse 1 two angels came they were male we find that out later in the text two men who were angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom when Lot saw them he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground and he said now behold my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise early and go on your way. They said, however, no, we want to spend the night in the square. Bad idea. But he urged them strongly. And so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. Before they lay Now some of your translations say that we might know them. D. Sherman Bailey, who was one of the early theologians of the gay theology, makes a case for the fact that this knowing them is not a Hebrew word to know that speaks of sexual relations. It simply means let them come out, they're new to the neighborhood, and we would like to get to know them. Okay? Okay. Okay. Well, the fact is even most gay theologians are a little embarrassed by that theology and that rendering. Most of them don't even buy that anymore. it was sexual the knowing that they wanted to have of these men verse 6 but Lot went out to them at the doorway and shut the door behind him and said please my brothers do not act wickedly now behold I have two daughters and now Lot is about to do a dastardly thing I have two daughters who have not had relations with man please let me bring them out to you and do to them whatever you like nice guy Lot I think he's got some problems too only do nothing to these men in as much as they have come under the shelter of my roof and they said stand aside furthermore they said this one came in as an alien and already he's acting like a judge now we will treat you worse than them lot so they press hard against lot and came near to break the door but the men now this is the angels reached out their hands and brought lot into the house with them and shut the door they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the doorway, and the family of Lot with these angels eventually escaped. That's the story. Here's the question. What is the sin of Sodom? Well, that depends on who you ask, and if you deal with the gay theology, what you find out is homosexuality is not the sin of Sodom. A number of reasons. Number one, if you look carefully at the text, you'll find out that homosexuality never happened. I mean, they moved on the men, but the angels themselves protected themselves, and Lot protected them, and they escaped. So there was no homosexual activity. Don't you tell me that God is going to judge the people for something that didn't even happen. Okay, they're right. It didn't happen. Okay, they're on to something here. The second reason is this. If it had happened, it would not have been homosexuality that we are trying to present to you. It would not have been the loving, caring, mutual, monogamous relationship of a man with a man. It would have been homosexual rape. And in the gay theology, we'd be against that. So this doesn't say anything about a man lying with a man as innately being wrong. Only homosexual rape is wrong. The sin of hospitality, the sin of Sodom is inhospitality. That's what's wrong here. And while that sends kind of a ripple through here, and it was interesting when I first heard that, that's the sin of Sodom, inhospitality. They didn't give or something. That's what I think of. No, no, this argument has credence. So we can't laugh at this, even though we did. We shouldn't have. You see, this issue of inhospitality and hospitality explains why it is that Lot did something we look at as being absolutely dastardly, offering his daughters. The reason he did that was because of some laws and some cultural things that we, quite frankly, would not understand or embrace. And that is that in this culture, hospitality was of infinite value. And the attitude in the culture was this, that someone who is a guest in my home gets the best of all I have, his safety or her safety is more important than mine or my family's. And as evil as it looks to us, where Lot gives up his daughters, that is consistent with the culture that would have done that. So this argument of theirs is not off the wall. Fools, they are not. As it relates to this theology. The real sin of Sodom was that when strangers came into this city, the city did not care for them. The only one who did was Lot. They were coming to look for ten righteous men. The only one that they would find who would care for them, exercise hospitality toward them, was Lot. And that is why Lot and his family were spared. Now this view of the sin of Sodom not being homosexuality at all, but simply in hospitality, is affirmed in passages like Ezekiel 16, verses 49 and 50. Real specific word. It says this, verse 49, This is the sin of Sodom. Arrogance, abundance of food, careless ease. They did not help the poor and needy. There it is. They did not help the poor and needy. This rendering of this text is not off the wall at all. scripture affirms that their sin was in hospitality. But you have to finish the verse in Ezekiel 49 and 50, because right after that it says this, and they have committed abominations, plural, before me. Okay? Well, what are the abominations, plural? Well, you have to stick with the text. See, I can hear myself saying it. I say it all the time. You got to stick with the text. Gay theology comes to this. You've got to stick with the text. What does the text say? It says, arrogance, abundance of food, did not help the poor and needy. Those are the abominations. Nothing there of a man lying with a man. Homosexuality is not even being spoken of in this text. And then they go on from there and do some very creative things with the word abomination in the Hebrew. bringing it around and turning it around to mean just about anything other than something that would apply to homosexuality, especially a monogamous, caring, loving relationship. But this word abomination, in fact, is interesting, and we need to pick it up out of this pile of thought and look at it, because it shows up in another place related to this very same issue. Leviticus 18.22 and also Leviticus 20.13. Turn to Leviticus, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus 18. It says this, You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female. It is an abomination. There's that word. What is an abomination? For a male to lie with a male as with a female. Well, I don't know about you, but I look at that verse and I go, that looks pretty clear to me. Well, it's not clear. You haven't heard the explanation. A couple of things about this verse that would clear this up and let you know that what it looks like it means, it doesn't mean. One of the more creative renderings of this is this by a guy named Robert Arthur from the MCC in San Diego says this about this. What you need to understand is the culture. Again, this was hard for me to study. I hear myself saying, and you do. You have to understand the culture. And what you need to understand about this particular culture in the time of Leviticus was that the view of women in that culture was very low. They were just a little bit above the animals, significantly lower than men. In that culture, men were viewed as being created in the image of God, but not women. And women were treated as a piece of property to be bought and sold literally to use. You would never in this culture treat a man as a piece of property to buy and sell and use, you would never be that disrespectful. Oh, this culture is opening this verse for me. Now I understand, and here is how it's rendered. You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female. You need to lie with a male with much more respect. You need to lie with a male with a much higher degree of honor than you would lie with a female. And the word of the truth is maligned. Among us. Settle down. There's a more plausible explanation that they use for this. And that is this. That this, in fact, is not a timeless truth. That this is a culturally bound regulation or prohibition. That it is coming in the context of the Israel's holiness code that God gave to those people at a specific time for a specific purpose, and it no longer applies to us. The explanation would go as follows. Israel lived in a pagan land surrounded by Canaan and Egypt, and they were being called by God to be separate from that culture, to provide an alternative to that culture, and they were to be different in every way as possible. part of the culture that they lived in had as its essence a pagan religion that was involved in fertility cults of a sexual nature and given that pagan fertility right culture this prohibition of men lying with men as with a female is not speaking generally to any man with any man but only specifically in the context of this culture and the fertility rites, where in the temple there would be male prostitutes sexually involving themselves with males who came to the temple, that is what, and that is only what, is being prohibited here. So it is culturally understood. It is a ceremonial thing that no longer applies today Because we do not have pagan temples that are doing that anymore. And maybe male prostitution today would be in view here somewhere. But clearly, again, this does not apply, in their view, to monogamous, loving, homosexual relations. It does not apply generally to any man lying with any man. Only if it's at a pagan temple involving prostitution. Then they also go on, by the way, to pull in the broader context of Leviticus in several chapters before and after that speak of women in their menstrual cycle and how during that cycle you are not to approach them sexually, and we don't believe that anymore. And how in another place in Leviticus it speaks of not putting two different kinds of seed into one field, and we don't do that anymore. And how one of the things in the Leviticus code is that you're not supposed to have fabric of mixed fabric, So the fact that some of you have wool polyester blends or cotton polyester blend shirts would be against the law, and we don't do that anymore. And in Leviticus 20, it speaks of the fact that there are certain animals that are clean and unclean, and you don't do that anymore. And they take all of that, put it in one big ball, and say this is all ceremonial, it is all cultural, none of it applies today, making no distinction between what may be cultural and what is a moral, timeless truth. So what do we do with all that? A couple of things. First, there is a distinction, and this distinction needs to be made between ceremonial, culturally bound law and moral law. The Word of God does have, in the Old Testament, things that are indeed culturally bound. They are ceremonial law, And as it relates to our culture and our even understanding of the new covenant, they no longer apply. There is, however, consistently through Scripture, moral law which never changes. And one of the primary places we find help for knowing the difference between what is ceremonial, cultural, and moral never changing is the Word of God itself. The book of Hebrews, for instance, among all the other things that it does, is a wonderful place to look and study about ceremonial law that has been set aside in the bringing of the new covenant and the fulfillment of all that was ceremonially symbolic, fulfilled in the coming of Christ. The ceremony is no longer needed. That was a picture. Now you've got the reality. Let the picture go. All through the book of Hebrews, that's the appeal. The Word of God makes a distinction that there are certain things that are set aside. The other place we have some help in the Word of God is this. When it comes to moral law, never is it obviated. We don't have a place in the Word of God that says, adultery is wrong, but another place where it says, it doesn't matter that much anymore. Incest is really bad, but not anymore. Those kinds of things are consistent. And when you see the consistency, that's one of the tip-offs that we have got, not a ceremonial, not a cultural thing, but a timeless truth. The moral law of God is not obviated. and we are not in the new covenant justified by keeping even the moral law but the moral law does not change thou shalt not thou shalt and those thou shalt not that never change and thou shalt that never change i would make us aware that we need grace because all of us haven't and all of us have or have and haven't. Whatever. A word about the holiness code. See, the thinking here is that this is just the holiness code in Leviticus 18 and obviously that doesn't apply to us. God's design in Leviticus is that Israel, His people living in a pagan culture, would stand in contrast to that culture, but more than just stand in contrast and just kind of sit there being different, they were designed by God to be different in order to provide an alternative to that culture, and then to that culture provide a message of hope and health and healing and sanctity and sanity and safety. The picture I have in my mind is this. In Israel, time of Leviticus, a pile in this culture of smelly refuse, rotting garbage, and enormous human pain. And right into the middle of this smelly garbage heap of humanity, there is something of infinite value, the people of God. I see this diamond right in the middle of it all. But they have not been placed there just to shine and look pretty. They've been placed there by God. To be somewhere for this culture to go, where they could find hope and health and healing, safety, sanity, and sanctity. So he says to them, be different in every way you can think of. Be different. One of the things that got me about the appeal to the text and the gay theology rendering this verse to mean nothing relative to a general word, men don't lie with men, was the context. And what's interesting about the context, Leviticus 18, read it. Verses 1 through 6 speaks of incest. Verse 20 speaks of adultery. Verse 23, the verse after men don't lie with men, speaks of bestiality. You shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it. It is a perversion. You know, when I put those things together and that's the immediate context, that just doesn't, I'm sorry, it doesn't feel to me like a ceremonial thing. It doesn't feel culturally bound. That sounds pretty timeless to me. To be real frank with you, one of the most frightening things that I put together here in verse 22 was connecting it with verse 21 of Leviticus 18. Let me read it for you. Neither shall you give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech, nor shall you pervain the name of your God. I am the Lord. When he says I am the Lord, that means that I'm not kidding. Who is Moloch? Moloch is what I would call the god of this age for them. Moloch was the pagan deity through which the people in Egypt, Canaan, and now some people in Israel, through him they were worshiping the sun. He was the god of fire. In fact, there was a huge furnace that was the embodiment, if you will, of Molech, a huge mouth into which people would throw their brand-new-born babies, sacrificing them to the spirit of the age. Matthew Henry in his commentary indicated that one of the reasons some people sacrifice one of their babies is this. If they had several, they would sacrifice one, believing that in the sacrifice of one, some good would come through the deity upon the ones that were remaining. Ha! This is all ceremonial, folks. None of this applies to us. Archaic is this. Culturally bound. Speaks nothing to us. The God of this age is not Molech. So it doesn't apply. The God of this age is convenience, beloved. And to the God of convenience, thousands upon thousands upon thousands of babies before they are born are being sacrificed in our culture, and the numbers of babies being sacrificed in this culture makes the people sacrificing to Molech look like babes in the woods. Another thing that felt powerful to me, the coupling of these two verses in Leviticus 21, sacrificing babies and men lying with men, that I just want to say and leave with you, is both of those activities, abortion and homosexuality, strike at the core of creation. just let it lie so I'm in my office and all these thoughts are swimming and I'm hearing this is all culturally related and it's ceremonial and I'm hanging on to this theological truth I know that the things that are culturally related need to be distinguished from moral law that's never obviated and where there's confusion the word of God helps us because in the New Testament it's raised up again as the standard So then we know it's not just cultural. But Leviticus is just Israel's holiness code. No bearing whatsoever on us. And this memory came to me of little Bible verses I memorized when I was a kid. 2 Corinthians 6, verse 16 says this. This is Paul now raising this up again as applicable to us, at least to the Corinthians, therefore to us. I will dwell in them, he says, and walk among them, and I will be their God. and they shall be my people. Therefore, because you are my people, and because I am your God, come out from among them and be ye separate, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean. And I will welcome you, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty. Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. And what that is, is the heart of the holiness code that was given to Israel and the part that applies to us is being given back to us. Come apart from that culture and be separate. And to us, I believe, it sounds like this. 1993, Church of the Open Door. And by the way, I believe this word goes far beyond the walls of Church of the Open Door, and it needs to go far beyond the walls of Church of the Open Door. But we're starting here. Church of the Open Door, you are a people born of the Spirit, given new life in Christ, living in a culture that is indeed a pile of smelly refuse, rotting garbage, an enormous human pain. And into that culture, I have placed you not just to sit there and look good and even just be different than building walls around yourself to make sure you stay different. I have placed you there for you in your difference to offer to this rotting culture hope and health and healing, safety, sanity, and sanctity, because they will find it nowhere else. And this will not be done, beloved, with pious phrases, with flashy buildings, with stained glass windows. This will happen. We will be a place where this culture can find sanity and help and health and healing with the Word of God unfettered and unbound and the power of God through the working of the Spirit in the church of Jesus Christ, the real church of Jesus Christ that is aggressively and literally reaching down the throat of Satan himself and pulling people out alive unto God. one of the things that we've been doing recently behind the scenes with the elders and the staff is is just even in light of the rocking year we've had lord lord what's our vision what would you put us here for? I just told you. I just told you what our vision is. I just told you why we're here. We have been called out of this culture to be separate, a holy people, born of the Spirit, on the inside, made brand new. We are the people of God. By grace, we have been saved. But we have not been put here just to look good, but to affect and be a place where at least in one place people who are dying and are ready and are tired can hear the truth of the gospel that is the vision of this place. Homosexuality? Put it in perspective with what I just said. That is only one little thing among many things over which we need to repent. And yes, repentance is the word. You know, some among us, it occurs to me, need to repent of thinking homosexuality is okay. Some of us maybe need to repent of thinking homosexuals are the worst things in the world and never, ever even thinking they'd ever have a relationship with them. Repentance cuts over all of these issues. 2 Chronicles 7, verse 14 says this, If my people who are called by my name, if church of the open door who is called by my name, any people of mine at any time would humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways. Turn from their wicked ways. You know what that means? What we do matters. I will hear from heaven. I will forgive their sin, and I will heal their land. That word land kind of affected me. I will heal the land. You know, I get kind of grandiose. I think of the world. But honestly, in my spirit, the land, the land, I got to tell you the truth, good or bad, I don't have a lot of energy for the land. We're going to save America. Oh, I don't think so. And I don't have a lot of energy to demonstrate, and I don't. And there's gays in the military. Oh, no! They were so pure before. No, it's over. Give me a break. I've never had a lot of hope in the land. But the church, the church, that's where I'll do my work. That's where we'll do our work. And that's what I'm worried about right now. The church. The men and women of God who are themselves believing lies. It's time for the church to arise. Beloved, if the land that we romantically think about changing one day is ever to be affected, it's going to have to start here. It's going to have to start with us. It's going to have to start here. it's going to start with me start with you come apart and be separate why? look good, be right so that by the power of the spirit people can discover the God whom they were made to know I think this is a very important word for our church I believe it is one that will stand I believe it is one that we need to mark It's one that I need to go home and think about some more. One of the ironies of it is I don't know how to close today. With a song, we don't have a song. I want you to stand. What I'm going to ask you to do, just in a brief moment, if you need to leave, please do it quietly. I want us to just be silent for a moment. And just alone with the Spirit, let the weight of this dawn on you a little bit. Just think and let this settle down in your spirit. Let's just be quiet for a moment. I want the altar ministry to come and make their way to the front, those of you who need prayer, for issues related to what I talked about today, or others entirely. The Spirit of God is at work here, and we may be speaking to you about things totally unrelated to what I spoke of. but as it relates to what I spoke of I want to close with this prayer Jesus I pray in your name that here at Open Door you would not just give to me but you would give to us as it relates to fighting for the truth what is right and wrong that you would give to us the spirit of a lion that we would with love be willing to fight for truth but Father I also pray that as we consider the culture in which we live in, that our response would not be to scorn it, but to know that we have in our hand and in our mouth words of life for them. So, Father, as it relates to the people who are being affected by the lies of the evil one, whose lives are being destroyed, give us hearts of shepherds, hearts of love and grace and power to heal. Give your people power to heal. As the people stream from these doors in all three services, power to heal. Power to speak truth. Power to communicate your grace. Raise us up in Jesus' name, starting in this city, for your glory and your honor. we can't get them all but we can find some we pray these things in Jesus name Amen Amen.
