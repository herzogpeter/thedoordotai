When the foundations are shaken, what can the righteous do? Those words found in Psalm 11 are preceded by these words, In the Lord I take refuge. So how can you say to my soul, flee as a bird to your mountain? How can you tell me to just run away? That's bad advice, the psalmist laments. That's the last thing I need to hear right now because it's actually what I want to do, and it's the wrong thing to do at a time like this. For behold, the wicked bend the bow. They make ready their arrow upon the string. In places we do not see, they shoot in darkness. When the foundations are shaken, what can the righteous do? While recognizing on one hand that there is nothing we can do to fix or change or undo the horror we have witnessed this week, there are some things on the other hand, beloved, that we can and must do when the wicked bend the bow. When in places we do not see, they shoot in darkness when the foundations are shaken. In the course of the week, I thought of three. Three things that we can and must do. The first is this. We can and we must remember some things we know for sure. Even when it's difficult to find what we know for sure. Even when, because of the circumstances of this week, we feel at times like we don't know very much. We need to remember some things. rock solid things, so that as the ground moves beneath our feet, we have a place to stand. In other words, we need to affirm some truth, ancient truth, that has stood the test of time, that can't be changed no matter what changes, that can't be toppled no matter what hits it. That's why we began our service today with words that came around, explanation of the centrality of the Word and the symbolism of a candle, of a light that can't be extinguished and the shedding of the blood of Jesus that gives us confidence in death. It's why we began this service today with the reading of Scripture. Psalm 46, Though mountains slip into the sea, though its waters roar and foam, there is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, and God is in the midst of her, the Lord of hosts is with us. That's why in the first service this morning when we had our children in the beginning of the worship time and then dismissed them, we blessed them and spoke words over them of eternal significance. We spoke words of Scripture over them and into their very souls. That's why we have chosen the songs that we have chosen to sing this morning. songs of firm foundations and inviolable truths. As I was experiencing this week, the events of this week, and struggling myself to find those things I know for sure, there were many scriptures that came to mind. Some brought comfort. Some actually raised more questions. But one that came to mind that wouldn't go away. I found a place to stand, a reminder, Revelation chapter 4. You might remember that some time ago we went through the book of Revelation, John's vision. And part of the reason this vision had significance to me, and I hope now to you, was because the context within which John got this vision was much like ours. See, it came to him at a time in his life when it looked like Satan was winning. He was on the island of Patmos, separated by years and experience from Pentecost, separated by about 60 years, but his Patmos experience didn't look anything at all like the Pentecost experience. Pentecost, everything seemed possible. The Spirit had come, people were filled, 3,000 were saved in one day, and there was nothing to indicate that the next day wouldn't be the same way. And the day after that, and the day after that, and the kingdom has come, And we are going to affect the world with this good news of healing and grace and redemption. Sixty years later on the island of Patmos, the kingdom of God, at least in visible ways, was no longer the ascendant power. Now Rome was the ascendant power. Rome was the physical manifestation, quite frankly, of demonic force in the earth at John's time. The powers of darkness seem stronger than the light. when John was by himself on that island. And in the middle of that context, God gave to him a vision of four things that couldn't be changed, no matter what changed. They couldn't be toppled, no matter what hit them. And the pictures he got were for himself, but he wrote them down, so the pictures are for us. He saw four things. One, he saw a door standing open in heaven, which speaks of, on one hand, eternal hope. It speaks, on the other hand, of access we have to that hope through Jesus Christ our Lord. Worst case scenario for me and you, if I die, here's what I know for sure. There is a door in heaven, and it is what? Open. There is a throne in heaven, and one sitting on it. It speaks symbolically of authority and power and sovereignty. The third thing he saw was a lion who had conquered. The fourth thing he saw was a lamb who had been slain. A door, a throne, a lion, and a lamb. Four images, beloved, that speak to unshakable truths around which the people of God throughout history, regardless of the circumstances of their lives, have centered their lives, be it prosperity and opportunity or persecution and calamity. Four things, beloved, we must ever remember. We must never forget. The four things are these. There is a door in heaven and it is open. There is a throne in heaven and it is occupied. There is a lion who has conquered. There is a lamb who has been slain. The accurate words in Revelation about the Lamb who has been slain is that He is standing as if slain, meaning that this Lamb in the image, speaking symbolically of Christ, bore in Himself the marks of death, but He was not dead, for this One who died has risen, and because He is risen, I will rise, I will live. Worst case scenario? Want to know the worst case scenario? Worst case scenario, I die even if I die. I live. You die, even if you die, you live. Because there's a door in heaven, it's open. There's a throne in heaven, it's occupied. When the wicked bend the bow, when in places we do not see, they shoot at us in darkness, we need to remember some things we know for sure, rock solid things. Second thing we need, we need to love some people. This love needs to be extended in a number of directions beyond which I even have time to go into today, but let's just start with each other. Let's just start there. Back to my mind this week as I was even feeling the fray of my own emotions and some shortness developed with people I was around, I heard the words of John, our father John, the apostle who spoke to us as a father for almost a year through 1 John. My little children, my little children love one another. Amazing, isn't it, how things like this remind us of what matters most and what matters most is love one another. How many of you were like me this week when this stuff happened and you didn't know what to do? What you knew you wanted to do was grab the people that you love. Even that person that ten minutes ago you were really mad at because they did something goofy. But I want to be by you. I was in Milwaukee Tuesday morning when the horror of these events began to unfold. And when the news became apparent to me of what was actually happening, the first thing I thought of, it just rose up in my spirit convulsively almost. I've got to get home. I've got to be by my family. I called my wife. We thought of our daughter in Chicago. We tried to get a hold of her. We were hearing rumors of the Sears Tower being evacuated, and Andrea works fairly close to that. So we've got to get Andrea, Bonnie, call Andrea and tell her not to go to work today. And our daughter, our other daughter, had just moved to Atlanta. Let's get a hold of Erica and tell her, Erica, don't go to work today. And our two sons are off at college. And Bonnie called the boys and tell them not to get out of bed. She called. She didn't evidently need to tell them that. They had no intention of getting out of bed. Ha. Ha. I actually did say that to bring some lightness to this. They called us before we called them. Because they needed somebody to grab onto too. As we were trying to decide over the phone, because after I called the family, I immediately began to call staff here, and it felt very strange to be away from here. Should we have a prayer vigil tonight? There's some talk about churches doing that, and we're getting calls at the church, and immediately when I heard the idea, all I could think of, again, was just like the instinct to be with my family. I says, absolutely, we're having a prayer thing tonight because I want to be with my family. I want to be with you. Beloved, as the fullness of all these events over the next few days, weeks and months, continue to be revealed, here is my pastoral father word to you. Again, as emotions get frayed and as fear in your heart sometimes rises up, here's the word, hang on to each other. Love each other. Keep accounts short. Say you're sorry quick. Give each other room. Let me say it this way. I'll be strong for you today. You'll be strong for me tomorrow. Now, what I just said is really important. There's some very significant wisdom in there pastorally. Because what it says is this. There are going to be moments that faith rises in you. And what matters most will matter most to you. And the place to put your feet will be apparent to you. And in those moments, you will put your feet there, and you will walk in faith, and you will have some strength and courage to give to somebody else who that moment doesn't have it. So in those moments that God calls on you to step up to the plate and be strong for somebody else, step up to the plate and be strong for somebody else. But here's the deal about our humanity. Tomorrow, you might not feel like that. And I can even predict, I think, that some of you, as we sing these songs and you hear some of this truth, you're going to feel from this event, this time together, some faith rise up. Some things that you weren't even feeling when you came in. And some fear be replaced with hope. But there will be other times when you wake up. I don't know what time of day it's for you. When you will feel these things encroach. And it doesn't invalidate the time you felt the faith. So here's the deal. I'll be strong for you today. You'll be strong for me tomorrow. That's a way to do your family. Hang on to each other during this time. We're not all going to be strong all the time. When it's your turn to stand up to the plate, do it. When the wicked bend the bow, and in places we do not see, they shoot in darkness. When the foundations are destroyed, we need, first of all, to remember some things we know for sure. We need to hang on to each other in love. And third, finally, we need to pray. let me kind of tell a story as to how this became apparent to me and how it is we're going to pray this morning Thursday morning I was working on this talk believing that God would give me a word for today but on Thursday morning there were no words that worked I continued to search for words that might work for words that might somehow heal this fix this words that might restore some order to my own spirit, establish some perspective in my own mind so I could help you bring order to your spirit and bring perspective to your mind. I was searching for words that might convince us it's not that bad. We've been here before, but everything I saw and everything I heard on the radio and on the television said it is that bad. We've never been here before. Like many of you, there have been times in the course of this week that I have felt overwhelmed, a bit paralyzed. On Thursday morning, the words for this sermon, having to speak before you, were not coming. Turn off the TV, Dave. I said to myself, and advice of other friends was the same, and I think it's good advice. You're overexposed. Get away from it. I did that, and it was a good idea. But guess what happened to me as soon as I did? Maybe what happened to you when you knew you were on overload. Here's what went in my mind. I I immediately thought of all the people who can't turn the TV off, who can't change a channel, who don't have the option to flee as a bird to the mountain because they're right in the middle of it and they can't walk away. And immediately it put me back to this place. David, remember the things you know for sure. Find a place to put your feet. What dawned on me as I was grappling with these things, one moment feeling confident, the next moment feeling weak, What dawned on me was that I wasn't so much doing my talk as my talk was doing me. David, by an act of your will, by an exercise of faith, this Thursday morning, continue in the things you've learned and become convinced of knowing from whom you've learned them and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you wisdom and hope and life. And even that phrase that began to pump some hope into my spirit, causing it to rise, dawned on me. Those words themselves are Holy Scripture, 2 Timothy chapter 4. And out of the memory bank of Scripture that I have had since I have been a child, which, by the way, is why we need to bless our children and be there for our children, so when it's time for them to take the banner, They have a memory bank, not only of rote memory scripture, but the life and power of God at work among people and a church and parents and families and marriages. You know, you don't prepare for the evil day on the evil day. You draw on the bank of the life of God in you and what you know for sure. Well, out of that memory bank rose three truths. And this is not chapter and verse. These truths are the testimony of Scripture. Laced through almost every word of Scripture from beginning to end, the three truths are these. Number one, evil is real. From beginning to end, that is the testimony of Scripture, and it has real power to do real damage. Secondly, however, evil is not from God. From beginning to end of Scripture, the testimony is this, that the evil one is the author of evil, and his entire agenda is to steal, to kill, and to destroy. And while we don't always understand it, and I certainly don't like it, God has ordained it such that men have free will. And what I don't like is that in free will, some men and women have chosen to serve the agenda of the evil one and become instruments of that very evil. Evil is real. Evil is not from God. Third is this. Evil will not, can not win. Never, ever, never, ever, ever. Amen. and one of the neat things you need to know about that as it relates to the testimony of scripture is is is the the truth of scripture and the authenticity of people's pain in scripture is that there is all often a lament about evil in the world and people rise up and cry oh lord how long. And there's lament. You read the Psalms. Because it seems at times like the wicked prosper, God. And not only does history record, but the word of God affirms over and over again. It is true. It is true that at times it looks like wickedness prospers. And sometimes it looks like Satan wins, but he never does in the end. Ever, ever, never. Okay, so how did this get you to prayer thing? And what can you do? What can we do? Well, lots of people were asking that question this week and frustrated that there wasn't much to do, long lines of people formed to give blood because it's all they could think of doing. One man on Tuesday, the day it happened, went to an overpass and began to wave a flag. I heard about him on the radio on the way home from Milwaukee. They got a microphone in his face. What are you doing? He said, I just, I didn't know what else to do. I'm not a flag waver. I didn't know where to go. I just stuck this, started waving the flag. Well, as I continued my struggle and personal frustration over what I could do, I then had a memory of a teaching of Dallas Willard that he brought to our church last year about this time. He spoke in the context of prayer. Now I'm finally back to that. What he called the range of our effective will, identifying two powers of causation. Now you feel like you're in a philosophy class. It's not that hard to understand. First power of causation is what you can do. Use the illustration of a weed in your garden. If you have a weed in your garden, you don't go into your prayer closet and go, Oh, Lord, deliver me from the weed now. You go into the yard and you pick the weed. Because that's within the range of your effective will. The first power of causation is what you are responsible to do. And what I am responsible to do, the rubble I need to move, because it's in the range of my effective will. But there are things, beloved, beyond that range, things that you can't control and cannot fix, requiring the second great power of causation, prayer. Where the people of God invoke the name of God, where the people of God step into the power that belongs only to God. And when I remembered that teaching, the place of prayer and what we plan to do today grew. I began to call people that I trust for confirmation of this idea, what do you think, less talk, shorter message, more prayer, an instant sense among everyone I spoke to of rightness. And so it is. We have this morning identified five categories of prayer that we are going to enter into now. And those I've asked to participate, I'm going to ask to come to the stage now as I explain what we're doing. there you go category number one we are going to invoke the name of God and step into the power that belongs only to God first on behalf of our national leaders we want to pray for our president we want to pray for his cabinet and advisors and congress people who are in critical positions of making decisions that will have incredible effect on our lives and the lives of many people in the world over the next few days. Category number two, spiritual leaders. It was early in the week that Scott Bernstein was able to get through to a woman at the Times Square Church in Times Square. This is a church that is pretty much in the shadow of the World Trade Towers. David Wilkerson is a name that may be familiar to some of you. He is the pastor of that church. Please tell us, Scott said, what you're going through. How can we pray for you, our brothers and sisters there? And by the way, as I give you these, just consider the churches that are meeting in that area this day. They said this, please pray for our protection and the protection of many of our people who are actually part of the rescue teams. Think of the firemen and all the people who are just involved in that. Please pray for the thousands of loved ones who are waiting for word, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, relatives and friends in our church who are still waiting. please pray for our pastoral staff for wisdom and strength and courage that they may be moved by the Spirit to be at the right place at the right time and pray for our body that we would be comforted and at the same time that we need comfort that we would be in this place the hands and the feet of Jesus third category of prayer the rescue workers firemen, policemen, military personnel medical personnel and I was even alerted to the fact we have among us in our church, an FBI, maybe more than I know of, but at least one FBI agent who's been sent to the scene. So people who are in the process of trying to figure out what happened here and who is really to blame for wisdom there. Fourth category is obviously the victims and all of the families and all the people that this touches. And the fifth category was the lifting up of our children, to notice the particular vulnerability of children, not just here in our church, but around the world, but also bringing it down to our church for protection for their hearts. What's so strong in me right now as I prayed for those kids in their first service is that these kids, we need to protect them and love them and help them through this because they have to pick up the banner someday themselves, and we have to be there for them now. I've assigned one person to pray for each category each person will come and identify the category of prayer that they're going to pray around they will begin the prayer with a brief time of silence and then they will pray I would encourage you to and just give you liberty to take take whatever posture you would like you can just sit where you are that's absolutely fine but if you feel some desire to kneel don't hesitate to do that some stood. Just be free. As we today invoke the name of God and step into the power that belongs to God alone. Let's pray. Join with me as we pray for the national leaders. Father, in Jesus' name and in the authority of those sanctified in Christ Jesus, we lift up to you those leaders of our nation that we have chosen. President George W. Bush, Vice President Richard B. Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, all of the other cabinet members and their staff, we lift them up to you, Father. We lift also up to you the leaders of the Pentagon, the diplomatic corps, and our intelligence network. Lord, as you are full of grace and truth, we pray that you would fill them with grace and truth. Let them hear each other, knit them together. Lord, by your Spirit, purify their thoughts and their emotions. Give them wisdom in making decisions and setting direction. Give them favor in the eyes of nations and people around the world. Build cooperation among us for what is true and just. Lord, reveal to them what is unjust. Reveal to them what is a lie. In your mercy, hear our prayer. Bring grace and truth as a core for all leaders around the world. And so for our national leaders, Lord, draw them to you. Lead them in your peace and your righteousness. Protect their families during this time, physically and emotionally. Abide with them. And strengthen them by your spirit to stand against the darkness, to call forth righteousness from us, to stand for justice and truth. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. As we bow for prayer for our spiritual leaders, let's start with a moment of silence. Almighty God, we come to your throne, and we pray for the spiritual leaders that are in the middle of this crisis. God, we pray for your church. We pray for the amazing sense that you are present and real and available and in the middle of this entire thing. God, I ask for wisdom for the church leaders in these locations. that they would have courage to stand in faith boldness to reach out God that you'd give them wisdom as they counsel Lord we ask for you to open the floodgates of the gifts of your spirit that the miraculous could take place that there would be hope God we pray that as they lead they would clearly see you as their leader that as they work the long hours and feel as though they're running on empty God I pray you would supply that you would give them more and more energy and courage and faith I pray that they would get stronger and stronger as the days go on Lord we ask that the world may see your church at this time the way you would desire it to be God we ask for your bride to shine may your bride stand out and glow at this time that people may see that and glorify you. We pray for the spiritual leaders, the pastors, those who are close to the president, Lord, who give him spiritual advice and counsel. Give them the right words to seek you and hear from you. And finally, Lord, we pray for parents who have spiritual authority in their homes, and we ask that you would call them to you and that they would hear your voice to lead in their homes. Father, we ask your kingdom to come upon our leaders. Amen. For the rescue workers, let's have a moment of silence. Thank you. Peter Gansey, Father Michael Judge, two of the public servants who lost their lives in the line of duty, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for the character, the virtue that they displayed, the courage they displayed as they risked their lives to help others. We pray that they would be honored and they would continue to be an example for us and for our young people as to how to live. We pray now, Lord, for those who are still on the job, fighting a very difficult and overwhelming job of responsibility to rescue any survivors. And Lord, we pray for any survivors that still are below the rubble. Lord, visit them with your angels. Comfort them with your presence. Lord, if they aren't going to be rescued, we pray you'd deliver them, bring them home to you quickly. We pray you'd reveal yourself to them, that they might call out to you. And Lord, if they are to be rescued, Lord, grant all those who are working so hard the ability to see and hear the things they need to. And for the recovery process, Lord, a very hazardous situation that they are in as they work five, six, seven stories above the foundation, We ask that you would be with the police and the firefighters, the EMTs and paramedics, the nurses and the doctors, the military personnel, the iron workers, the structural engineers, and the volunteers that are working and risking their own lives and safety. Protect them, keep them, we pray. For those who are working among them, the FBI, CIA, and other intelligence personnel, that you would give them eyes to see the things they need to see. May your spirit heighten those things which are amidst the ashes that the evidence could be accumulated that's needed to bring justice to what has been done and for what has been done. Lord, for all these things to happen, these are beyond our capacity to control. And we ask you to work on their behalf in the mighty name of Jesus, our Lord. Amen. For the victims. Before I pray for the victims, we know that there could be people here that have lost loved ones, work associates, who know rescue workers, who are working, who have given up their lives. And if you are one of these and you feel comfortable with this, we would ask that you would stand and that those who are around you would lay hands or reach out their hands to you. So please stand now. Let's pray. Holy Father, come. Help us. For we need you now so very much. Father, we pray for the victims, for the people, for all of those who've been ravaged by this act of terrorism, especially for the families, friends, work associates, for military personnel, for the rescue workers, pastors, priests, teachers, students, pilots, flight attendants, all those who have died, all who are wounded, and for all of those who must live with this present reality. We ask that you would come by your spirit to bring stability and order to their chaos, the uncertainty of not knowing whether a loved one is dead or alive. Meet them in a supernatural way in this desperate place. Come in their deep pain and sorrow, which is not theirs alone, but it is pain magnified by the masses of people who are going through this incredible loss. Pour out your water of life to heal their physical wounds, and bind up their broken hearts. Lord, also come in the midst of their anger and bring your amazing grace of forgiveness. As you forgive us, we forgive others. Come in the midst of their terrorizing fear and bring a powerful exchange of your courage. In the coming weeks, there will be literally thousands of funerals and memorial services. Thousands of people that have no closure. Come and create venues so that each one may say goodbye. Lord, come into all of the hearts torn with the presence of your passionate love, love without measure, love without end, love that pushes beyond our pain, beyond our fear, beyond death, to life again. Father, may we live out our lives knowing the height of your power, the depth of your wisdom, the width of your love, and the length of your eternity. In the mighty name of Jesus, amen. I will be praying for the children, and as a symbol for both of us and for them, I would like all of the adults who are able to stand on behalf of our children. So if you would rise for my prayer. And we'll begin with the first few minutes or seconds in prayer. Jesus, let our standing be a symbol that we brand on each of our hearts of the mantle that we take up for our children. first of all Lord I would like to pray for the children who perished in the four airplanes and are on the ground that you would draw them unto yourself that you would be with their families and their relatives and their friends Jesus I pray for children across the world whether in countries that are safe or countries that are in danger that you would plant your hope in them. Jesus, I pray for our children here at Open Door. I look to the parents and the grandparents, the relatives, the teachers and the coaches, that they would be a safe place for our children. They would provide a safe harbor. That our children will not look towards despair, but will have hope. And that hope lies in you. And we thank you that you will continually draw their hearts to them. And that you would continually draw their hearts to you. We ask these things in your name. Amen. Remain standing. you
