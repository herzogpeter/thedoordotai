As most of you know, once a month we change the order of things as we focus our attention on the table that we call communion. It is the Lord's table. I want to begin this morning as we prepare ourselves for the table with a question. The question is this. What are you bringing to the table this morning? Fact is, the primary focus of the communion table most often is what we receive from the Lord. The Apostle Paul said before, I received from the Lord that which I also delivered unto you. We come to receive from the Lord as we remember what he gave for us and to us. We receive the bread and we receive the cup. And in the receiving of the bread and cup, we receive some sense of blessing and some sense of hope. But we also bring something to the table of who we are and how we are. Even if it's unconscious, you may not be aware of it. But when we come to the table to receive from the Lord through the bread and the cup, we bring our stuff. We bring our need. So, what are you bringing to the table this morning? I spent the first half of last week at a Centering Prayer retreat center with our entire staff. It's something we do once a year and get away as the fall programming just kicks in. and we kind of get away with the entire staff and spend the week learning how to be quiet in the middle of a lot of activity. And in that retreat, during those few days, all of us were, like you, aware of, but not particularly dialed into hurricanes that were brewing in the Gulf. Hurricanes are always brewing in the Gulf. I'm not going to pay a lot of attention to that, New Orleans, we were told early in the week, was particularly vulnerable. It could be bad. Some said catastrophically so with its below sea level bowl-like topography. The first reports as the hurricane hit, as all of you know by now, was that it wasn't as bad as was feared. At the last minute, it seemed to veer off to the right. And the worst case scenario had been averted until the levies began to give way. The first indication to me that something was up, you know, you're kind of on a retreat, and retreat is just that, it's a retreat, and you kind of aren't aware of other things. I hadn't dialed into much of anything coming back Wednesday. The first thing that made me aware something was up was on my way home, before I stopped, I stopped for gas. Honestly, I remember not even paying attention to the amount until it was all added up. And I looked at that and I said, something's got to be wrong. And immediately, I vividly recall wondering what on earth is going on. When I got home, I began to find out what on earth was going on. As like you, I saw the pictures and have been seeing the pictures. Like you, I heard the stories and have been hearing the stories. A city underwater. Thousands might be dead. I saw a picture today in the paper of a body floating in the water. And just a few feet over was a woman who acted like she didn't notice that body floated. It had become, it's the way it is down there. Multiple thousands without food, water, homes, or jobs. Anger, frustration, fear, and despair. It's bringing out the best in people. It's bringing out the worst in people. Some, you've heard them, seen them on TV or in the paper, weeping with gratitude for a bottle of water, weeping with gratitude for news that a relative had been spared, others picking up guns to protect themselves from looters. More than once I would see pictures, hear reports, a bit overwhelmed like you, thinking this feels apocalyptic. The paper spoke of anarchy. Could this be happening in America? Was a question I heard more than once, you two. Thursday morning, I wonder what I should talk about Sunday. It's communion. And we just began a series on healing. I think I want to talk about healing. But this time when I talk about healing, not just my healing this time. The fact is while I care about your healing, the healing I'm most interested in, I come to church most concerned about is mine. Don't you? My need. My problem. In the second chapter of Mark's gospel, there's a story of a man who was paralyzed. We don't know how he got that way, how long he'd been that way, just that he was that way, paralyzed. And the reality of his paralysis also speaks symbolically to the fact that he couldn't help himself. He was a person who couldn't help himself. He couldn't carry himself. We know nothing of his faith. He might have had great faith. He might have had no faith. There is no mention of whether he believed or not. Or even his desire to be well. I would assume he wanted to be well. But when you're paralyzed, depending on how long, that doesn't feel like a reversible thing, especially if it's been a while. It was his friends who carried him to Jesus. No one, he couldn't carry himself. It was his friends who brought him to the table, as it were. So what are you bringing to the table? this morning? I think a better question, more pointed for our focus of the morning would be this. Who are you bringing to the table this morning? Could you consider the possibility of bringing someone beside yourself? Could you open your heart, expand your heart a little bit more, And think about bringing something besides your stuff to the table this morning. Please, please hear me. There's nothing wrong with bringing your stuff. There's nothing wrong with bringing your need. I want you to minimize that or brush it off to the side. I'm asking you to wonder, could you bring somebody else's too? Could you carry someone with you in your heart to the table, to prayer, to God in worship? One of the things that I felt, I'm sure you did, when this thing started unveiling itself, revealing itself, and I've felt it all week and probably will for weeks to come, is what on earth can we, this is so overwhelming, what do you do? Maybe this is a start. Last month, under Al's leadership, Al Shuck, he preached three sermons. We culminated this three-week series of sermons on what it means to be a bodybuilder and what it means to be a bodybreaker. It was three sermons on community and what it means to be a community of faith here at Open Door. And we culminated those three weeks on the third week with a communion service designed to help us see that it's not just all about me and my need and my stuff. It's about us as a community, which includes my stuff, but it's not just me and it's not just my stuff. And if you were here, I'm sure you remember because we actually set the communion service up a month ago far differently than this with tables in the area here with white tablecloths and we broke the bread and shared the cup with whoever happened to be at our table. And you had to deal with the fact that maybe you were sitting at the table with someone you didn't know and wouldn't have chosen. But the whole point of that exercise was to just have to kind of deal with the fact it's not just all about me. It's about us. I'm part of something bigger than me. Now today, as we go to the table, I'd like us to see and I'd like us to feel that the us is bigger than us. That they include people, this us includes people not very much like us at all. Some of them believers, some of them not, some of them, quite frankly, evil in their polluting and dispensing of fear. But the ones who are in need are maybe a lot like us because from time to time we all need to be carried. So what are you bringing to the table this morning? Better question. Who would you be willing to carry in your heart to God for their healing, for their blessing, for their relief, not just your healing and your blessing and your relief? Would you be willing to open your heart a little wider and carry to the table and carry to prayer someone like this. This woman's face, it's the reason it captured me, was on the front page of the Star Tribune on Thursday morning. I don't remember the headline that said something like despair and chaos. It was captured in her heart. so what do you do? what do you do? there's a verse that comes to mind when I see her face and some people we're going to show you in just a moment as well the verse is this it's one I take to me it's one I take to me and my stuff it's when Jesus said well actually the prophet Isaiah said it of Jesus surely he bore our griefs and carries our sorrows aren't you glad he did that for you? and I'll expand it out expand it out a little bit and I hear all the words and all the exhortations of our life in the kingdom to be like Jesus to be Jesus with skin on now hear that verse I wonder could we somehow in prayer coming to the table somehow allow ourselves to bear her grief so what does that mean? I'm not sure enter into the discipline of opening wide your heart and carry someone's sorrow to the table and to prayer. Or how about this person? Pour our griefs. Carry sorrow. There's a father carrying the sorrow of his son. And he's got sorrow of his own. Holy Spirit, come. How about this one? How about this one? I'm going to pray. We'll leave that slide up there just while I pray. It's not that this one is more than others, but I like the picture of this man carrying this kid, just carrying her. I'd like to pray Spirit of God as we consider the events of this week and look at the faces on the screen my first, we don't know what to do and the things that we can do feel so small but right here as a community of faith as we enter into this discipline of opening wide our hearts and letting ourselves feel and in that allowing of letting these people in to carry them to the table with us, to carry them to you, to pray on their behalf. I wonder, Father, where that might spin off into other things that we can do. But right now, on behalf of these people in this church as the pastor, I pray, we pray, we call on you on their behalf. We pray peace, Joel sang, and we sang together peace, breathe peace. Lord, we cry for peace, and we cry for healing of the land and the healing of people's hearts. we pray protection for families who are afraid, who are despairing. Right now, while we're having church, we don't know where their next meal's coming from, who have no home to return to. And Father, as these days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months, I pray as a church and as individuals, we would be sensitive to the promptings of your Spirit as these movements in our hearts spin out into even more tangible ways to carry people. Show us how. Pray it in Jesus' name. Amen. We're gonna go to the table in just a moment as we participate and receive the elements and what we need from God. I want you to notice in addition to what we normally do with the table and the worship and people being prayed for is there are two additional things. In just a moment, we're gonna remove this and bring the cross out and place it here, which for us has often become, and it is a central symbol for us to come to, but there's gonna be space up here on the floor for you to come and pray. And to come and pray, bringing somebody with you, carrying someone else's stuff. but also there's baskets you might have noticed them one of the questions I had as I've already mentioned when this thing started unveiling itself was what can we do and it feels like a small thing but we can give it's a tangible thing we can do right now we can give and I would encourage you to when the movement is happening and if you're visiting at this church we're very comfortable with movement people will move around to partake in communion They're going to move as they come to pray. And we're going to just encourage you to move and to give, and to give generously. And we just trust us. Steve Hansen is in the process of finding the agency that we're going to go through, the Salvation Army or World Vision. We have some connections, and it will be some people who will get money directly to the greatest point of need. But it's just important for us to give. It's important for us to respond and carry some people to the table and carry some people on our backs, if you will, in our hearts in prayer. One other little note, final word. This is not all about New Orleans. It's weird because that's the big picture and now I'm going to ask you to expand your mind and yet the expansion is going to bring you actually to more something closer to home. See, some of you, undoubtedly, I know some of you have a friend. It's not in New Orleans, it's right here and they're in a hurricane right now. Or maybe they're in a place where they're needing to clean up from a hurricane because last week a hurricane blew through their marriage. And all they have left is rubble. I have a friend who's going through something right now physically, his wife. I just went through real serious surgery. And at the end of the surgery, the news relative to the seriousness of the ailment they were trying to get at was much more grave than they thought. Hope is not lost, but there's a hurricane going on there. I don't think they're here today. I don't think they can be here today. Somebody needs to carry them. As we go to the table, I want you to bring your stuff. I want you to bring you, your fear, your pain, your need for healing. Bring it. Just bring someone else's too. it's not just all about you it's not just all about me bear ye one another's burdens and thus fulfill the law of Christ surely he bore and surely he carried so that we could be bearers and carriers of people let's go to the table communion stewards if you could come forward it is hard to look in the face of suffering it is hard to stay present to those who suffer but we can and we are empowered and we can be filled with compassion because of another. It was on the night our Lord Jesus was betrayed and he looked forward to a place of suffering, of his suffering. That in his suffering he would transform forever all suffering places, all suffering people. And so today as we gather around this table, which is a symbol of hope and a symbol of life and a symbol of God's transformative power, that we can come and that we can, with God's grace, bring another. Whether that person in our imagination is old or young, infirmed, mentally ill, maybe it's a caregiver who is in the place of a storm right now. Whoever that may be, we can come. Knowing the source of life, knowing the source of hope that this table represents. That it can be, that Jesus is a place of transformation for us and for all people. And so we remember that on the night our Lord Jesus was betrayed, he took bread and he gave thanks. And he broke it, saying, This is my body. It is given for you and for all people. Take and eat of this in remembrance of me. And in like manner, after supper, he took the cup. And again, he gave thanks. And he said, This cup is the new covenant in my blood. It is shed for you, for all people, for the forgiveness of sins. Drink of this in remembrance of me. Let's pray. Holy God, we thank you for your great gift of yourself to us. And Jesus, as we come to this table this day, we ask that you would increase in us our capacity to carry, to bear one another's burdens. That in the hope of the place of transformation of where you suffered and died for, that there is hope and transformation possible for all the world, even those who are in the deepest, darkest places of despair. Holy Spirit, rain down your hope and your life as we come this morning to your table. In Jesus' name, amen.
