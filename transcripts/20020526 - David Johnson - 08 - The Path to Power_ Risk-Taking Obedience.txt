Let's pray as we go to the Word. My prayer this morning is that you, Father, by your Spirit, would fill me with your Spirit in order to give away what you put in my heart this week to give. Pray it in your name, amen. I think most of you know that we've been dealing these weeks and even months with the issue of power. in particular, rightly ordered kingdom of God kind of power, and that there is in fact a path to that kind of power. But what we've discovered and been examining over these last several weeks is that the path to power in the kingdom of God is an odd path, an unfamiliar path full of paradox and apparent contradiction, because the path to power in the kingdom of God doesn't always feel or look very powerful at all, especially on the front end. Thus far, we have examined several scriptures that speak to and illustrate that kingdom truth. Today, the scripture I want to examine is found in the book of Joshua. So if you have your Bibles, turn to Joshua chapter 1. Joshua is, as most of you know also, the place this whole series began some months ago. As we began to deal not only with power, but the issue of money and sex and power, to remind you of where we are as we pick up the story. The people of God are on the shores of the Jordan River in Joshua chapter 1, about to enter the land of promise with this promise. Chapter 1, verse 3. Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given it to you. You will have it. From the wilderness in this Lebanon, even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the great sea toward the setting of the sun will be your territory. No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life, just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you, for I will never leave you nor forsake you. But one question remains on the shores of the Jordan River, because they haven't crossed over yet. The question is this, how do we actually cross the river? I like the promise here that Every place we put our feet is going to be ours, but how do we get across the river? The answer to that comes in chapter 3, verse 12, says this. Now then, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe. And it shall come about that when the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, The waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, and the waters which are flowing down from above shall stand in one heap. What God is saying here is, among other things, this and what we need to notice about the story. It's the most prominent feature of the story. That it's not until you put your feet into the water, which is obedience, that you will see the waters begin to part, which is the power. And if you wait for the waters to be parted, before you make your move of obedience, you'll never see the power. And like the generation before you, though they truly were my people, they never entered the land. And if you do not move in obedience the way they never did, neither will you enter the land or experience the life that I have prepared for you. So you're going to have to trust me, says God, to the people of God, and to Joshua in particular. And it's going to involve some risk. We're going to talk this morning about how sometimes the path to power involves the deep water of a risky obedience. Now to really understand what's at stake in this crossing and the risk that's actually involved, I need to tell you a little bit about the Jordan River itself. and what it meant to these people, both in symbol and reality. And when we get that, you're going to understand the risk involved. You're going to understand the dramatic tension and what had to be going on in them and how it applies to us as well. In the ancient world, water was very scarce. Most of you know that. The result of that was that rivers in some of these ancient cultures were seen as sacred, highly valued, sources of life. In Egypt, the river that they worshipped, as it were, was the Nile in India, it was the Ganges. But to Israel, the Jordan was not seen that way. The Jordan in symbol and in reality, in terms of their experiences of people, was not for them a source of life. It was in fact a source of frustration. For the Jordan River had come to symbolically stand as a kind of barrier in their lives. Let that in. Let the symbolism of that Be that, a barrier. Some of you have barriers in your life. That may just be your Jordan. Standing between the people of God and the land that God had promised them, or it seemed he promised them, the life that he had called them to is this barrier called the Jordan. So in a lot of ways, they resented the Jordan. It was a source of frustration. Now, keep in mind, something I'm reasonably confident was in their mind as they stood on the shores of the Jordan about to go across. What I am quite convinced was in their mind was this, that they were about to do something, that they were about to enter into something, that their mothers and their fathers in the faith, their mothers and their fathers even in the flesh, had never entered into, had never done, for their fathers and mothers, the previous generation, never crossed into the kind of life they were about to enter into. Sure, their parents, as it were, the previous generation, were God's people. They had left Egypt. They had crossed the Red Sea, and leaving Egypt and crossing the Red Sea is a symbol of redemption. They belonged now to God and no longer to Pharaoh, no longer to Satan, but because of their stubborn and consistently stubborn refusal to trust and obey God in the living of their lives, to believe that he was sufficient, They wandered in the wilderness for 40 years, grumbling and complaining that God's promises weren't true, that his power wasn't real, and they died that way. This is an incredible picture. Do any of you know any people that, you know, I just know they're believers. I know they've come to life in God. But their whole life was about grumbling and complaining that God's promises weren't true, that his power wasn't real, and they died that way. They never entered into what you would call the sweetness of spirit or the abundance of life. Where was that? Sure, they followed God out of Egypt, as it were. They got saved, in a phrase. They're going to go to heaven when they die, but they never crossed over into what we've been talking about since the beginning of 1 John, the eternal kind of life. They never stepped into what Jesus called abundance. I am come that you might have life and that you might have abundant life. Now, all by itself, this information that I just gave you, that they're about to enter into something that the previous generation never did, brings to this shoreline experience tremendous significance. And it creates a tremendous dramatic tension. You just need to get this. See, while they're standing here on the shores of the Jordan River, they are not just on the shores of some river. They are on the verge of entering into something with God that their fathers and mothers had spoken of. Maybe as little children, they heard their parents speak of it wistfully, of a promised land, and maybe someday, and they yearned for it. And the parallel for you and me would be like, it's the kind of stuff we heard about in Sunday school all our life. And we'd go, yeah, that would be nice. And you almost kind of give up thinking that that kind of life is available now. They are about to enter into what I would call dream come true stuff. Maybe even stuff they quit believing could be. But here it is. They're on the shore. Now, to that dramatic reality, add this. That while the Jordan for Israel was a barrier, an obstacle to the people of Canaan, the inhabitants of the land into which they were going, the Jordan was a very different thing. To them it was protection. From who? Well, think about it. It was protection from the people of God. Now put this together. See, as long as the people of God wandered in the desert, as long as they refused to obey God or trust Him for their future, as long as they grumbled and complained against each other and against God, as long as they never crossed the Jordan, the fortified cities of Canaan and the worship of Baal, are you thinking about the world we live in right now? The worship of Baal was absolutely safe and could function unopposed. All of that in my mind creates a very sobering picture of today, an impotent church in a lost and dying culture dominated by the worship of Baal. And there's the church. Sure, we're saved from Egypt, and we're all going to heaven when we die. But very little impact in the culture for good or for God. Consider now also the river itself, beyond the spiritual symbolism of what it meant as being a barrier, keeping us from entering into what we really wanted in our life with God, is the physical reality of this river. Under normal circumstances, you need to understand something rather surprising. It was kind of a surprise to me that the Jordan really wasn't that difficult to cross at all. Archaeologists, at least the latest findings, indicate that there were as many as 60 places that the people of God could have crossed rather easily. Chapter 13, verse 15, however, indicates that at the particular time that Joshua and the people of God were at the Jordan and about to cross, it was at flood stage, which changes the prospect of crossing dramatically. Let me explain that. Even when the Jordan was within its banks, and even though it was shallow in certain places, it might have been easy to cross. Even then, however, it had a very rapid current originating in Mount Hermon. At an elevation of 7,000 feet, the Jordan River descended from there to the Sea of Galilee. From the Sea of Galilee, it descended to the Dead Sea, which was 1,200 feet below sea level. From 7,000 feet above to 1,200 feet below the Dead Sea being, I think, the lowest lake or sea on the planet. What that did is it meant the Jordan literally was a descending river, creating a relatively significant current made worse by what? The flood. There's a flood going on right now. And every spring, it did that. Every spring, this was not some unusual, horrible, every spring the river swelled. Now, when the River Jordan flooded, because it did it every year, it had kind of cut another path of its own. It had the normal riverbed. But over years, it had cut a place called a gorge that it filled every time it flooded. In fact, there was a name for it, the Zor. A picture, kind of like this. I wish I had a picture of this. You're going to have to look at my hands here. Here's the normal bed of the river, and it would flow there. When flood stage came, it would expand itself out and run into the two banks, if you will, of the gorge that had been cut in for years and years. These banks were 10 to 20 feet deep. So the river would swell and fill up that gorge. Creates a very interesting picture, and part of the reason this entering the water was a risk, I've always had this picture of them entering ankle deep and then knee deep and then waist deep. What's the risk in that? You know, I just go like this and the water parts. Big deal. No big deal. This is not what's going on. The water was probably 10, maybe 20. Let's not say, let's just make it easy for them. 10 feet deep. So when these priests with the Ark of the Covenant, kind of heavy, I don't know, was brought into the water and they went into the water, they went into the water. And I have a feeling that these first guys who went into the water probably got in over their head and might have felt for a few seconds, I think I'm going to die. Now, if I were one of those first guys who got chosen to go into the ark, how would you feel? Like, well, thank you. Me? No, I'd get real spiritual at that time. And I would say, I'm sure this would go through my, you know, I was first last time. It's your turn. We need to share. Jesus hasn't said this yet, but he will one day say, the first shall be last, and I'm fine with that now. Let me poke around at that experience of being the first one into the water. Put this whole thing together with the people of God. Do you think the experience of those first people into the deep water of a risky obedience had a little different experience than the people who were in the middle of the pack? I think it's safe to say that the people in the middle of the pack needed to make a decision about whether they were going to walk across too whether they were going to take advantage of the dry ground that had been made available to them by somebody else's obedience they could say no I ain't going, I ain't going there and like a child of parents who had made a way for them by a lifestyle of obedience they could say you know what I see my parents go there and they have created a path for me to follow I don't want to go that way and not go So there was a requirement of obedience on the people in the middle of the pack. But does anything stir in you about what it would have felt like to be the first one? Think they would have been a little bit more afraid than the people in the middle of the pack? Think they had any more at stake? Yes, you do, don't you? You get it. I call these people first steppers. And first steppers pay a higher price and face much more fear. And here's, I got a theory. I think every single one of us in one way or another are called by God probably more than once in our life to be a first stepper in one way or another. And while some of us had sometimes done of our lives, all of us probably in some way are also middle of the Packers. Where were Packers? I started to bring up the Packers in this church. Most of you didn't even make that connection. But anyway, what is he talking about? Forget it. I just ruined my whole sermon. get last night's tape it was it was better all of us will experience because of someone else's obedience dry ground provided for us we're middle of the packers and we're going to have to make choices about whether they're going to walk that path or not but every single one of us as well are going to be called in one way or another to be a first stepper into the deep water of a risky obedience put this whole thing together and the scene that's coming out symbolically, these people on the shores of the Jordan River provide for us an incredible picture on one hand of the consequences of a previous generation's sin. Why? Well, the very fact that these people were on the shores of the Jordan River and having to cross it was because the previous generation hadn't crossed it. Do you feel the tension there? I mean, I could sit on the shores of the Jordan River and go, you know what? I don't know why we have to do this. If our parents hadn't done their obedience, we wouldn't even have to. They were right. They were right. They could have been off doing some other things in the land. They could have been further down the road of their walk with God, but because of their previous generation, they were having to face something that they didn't have to face, but they had to face it. It's also an incredible picture of the multiple benefits that are available to God's people because of a previous generation's obedience. How many of you know that some of the struggles that you are going through right now in your life, some of the barriers you are facing, some of the things you just don't seem to be able to get through or around, or at least in part about a past generation's unwillingness to deal with their sin, unwillingness to walk into the deep waters of a risky obedience, generations of sin may be in your family. psychologists call this kind of thing family system stuff, where patterns of abuse or dysfunction, patterns of divorce or addiction or abandonment go on literally for generations. And if you're in that kind of system, the truth is this, if that's the Jordan you face, the barrier you face, it's not your fault. It isn't fair, but you got it. We call it baggage. We talk very casually about people that way. I've heard people say that. You know, they really got some baggage. You know what they got? They got a Jordan. And here's the word of the Lord this morning. Until you get across your Jordan, you'll never know the freedom of the life of God and the kingdom of God that he has for you in that particular area wherever your Jordan is. But how many of you also know, while we affirm the barriers we've got, that some of the benefits you enjoy, some of the dry ground you are walking on, and by the way, I think we're far more aware of the barriers we have than we are of the dry ground that's been provided for us, that some of the dry ground we're walking on right now is at least in part due to the risky obedience of some generations who went before. Like the priests carrying the ark, they were the first steppers and they faced fear like you never faced but you will be called to face as you do your Jordan now when I talk like this I just have well up in me memories of my father who by his risky obedience at critical moments of his life and some of them I can identify because I've heard the family story and some of them I can identify just because I know what the result has been has created some dry ground for me and my brothers and my sisters. Family funerals are interesting things. I'll never forget the funeral of my grandmother years and years ago. And one of the things that happened at this funeral, we began to talk about our family. And I don't know if this has ever happened to you, but I began to hear stories about my family I never knew. And they were stunning stories. Grandma was not a happy person. Grandma was not an easy person. She was sometimes a really mean person. And I began to hear stories of things that were nothing short of abuse. And I knew stories of my grandfather on my dad's side. My grandpa on my dad's side was not a happy person. He was not a nice person. He had no idea how to love my father when he was a little boy. He was mean. I was scared to death of my grandpa when I was a little kid. He never told my father once that he loved him, ever. and I look around when I hear these family stories and I and I would cause me for some of the first times in my life to look at my dad and my mom and go where did you come from because you know how to love a 10 year old I'll tell you where I'll tell you where it came from in ways I do not know because he was too far ahead I was in the middle of the pack do you understand this picture he stepped into deep waters of risky obedience to break bondages in our family. Did he, and created for me, dry ground to walk on. But not just for me, for my brothers and for my sisters. And not just for my brothers and sisters, but for our children and for our children's children. And not just for our family, but for the church he pastored. And on it goes for generations. Now you need to tell you about my father. He didn't cross every Jordan he had. He left me some stuff to walk through. He did. I can tell you what those are too but this analogy and you start to connect the dots the first thing I feel about all of this is number one grateful and not just for my father I am grateful for my father and my mother but I'm grateful for many some in this church who because of their courage to step into the deep water of risky obedience have created dry ground for me to stand on and continue my journey and you need to be grateful to. It would be a good discipline to stop and think about the people in your life who've created dry ground for you, and you don't even know the risk they took to do it. But it also stirs in me an awareness that while I'm grateful for the dry ground they created, and I need to walk that path, I have some Jordans of my own, and I need to be faithful like they were faithful to courageously step into the deep water of my Jordan and risky obedience to create dry ground for others to come. This applies to us as individuals. It applies to us as a church as well. Because who we are as a church and the deep water of risky obedience that we're willing to corporately step into will create dry ground for generations to follow. This, by the way, what I'm speaking of is what Deuteronomy 5 verses 9 and 10 is speaking to. That passage, Deuteronomy 5, 9, and 10, is a troubling one if you look at it just on the surface, but it holds a beautiful promise. Let me read it to you quickly. It says this, You shall not make for yourself an idol or any likeness of what is in heaven or on the earth or under the earth. For I, the Lord, your God, am a jealous God. Here's the icky part that we don't get. Visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations to those of those who hate me, but showing loving kindness to thousands of generations to those who love me and keep my commandments. My first response to that passage, especially the part of the third and fourth generations having the iniquity visited on them, is how unfair. I mean, it would be like me saying to my children, lining them up and going, you know what, your grandpa wasn't very nice. He really goofed things up. You never knew him. But because of what he did, you're grounded. pretty much for the rest of your life. And being that you're the third generation, you got one more to go, so your kids are gonna be grounded too. Well, that's not what it's saying. It sounds like that until you realize this is a Hebrew literary technique that utilizes what's called poetic parallelism. I need to teach a little bit here to redeem this passage. Sometimes the purpose of parallelism is for emphasis. Just follow me here. Psalm 19 verse one says, the heavens declare the glory of God. and the skies proclaim the work of his hand. What the parallelism there is, he's saying the same thing a different way for emphasis. Proverbs says the same kind of thing. There are three things that are never satisfied, four that are never enough. There are six things that God hates, seven are an abomination to him. The idea here is not that the writer suddenly thinks of, whoa, there's one more. That's not what's going on. This is a way of giving poetic emphasis to a single point. Now, sometimes the purpose of parallelism is not for emphasis, it's for contrast. Not to emphasize a single point, but to contrast two different things. Example, Genesis 4, 24, Lamech says, If Cain was avenged seven times, I will be avenged 77 times. Which means, if you think it was dangerous to go after Cain, that's nothing compared to you trying to come after me. 1 Samuel 18, 8 says this, Saul has killed his thousands. David has killed his ten thousands. Fact is, nobody counted. Nobody counted. This is a poetic device. And the point of the imagery is this. Saul was a great warrior, but he's nothing compared to David. With that in mind, come back to Deuteronomy. When God says, I will punish sin to the third and fourth generation, He's not counting, going, okay, the fourth, you're still kind of doomed. The fifth, you're free. What he's saying is this, in poetry, generational sin is real. And if it's not dealt with, it can hang around for a long time. It can have effect to the third and the fourth generation. It can do a lot of damage. But hear the heart of God here, beloved, because what the real meaning of this passage is, is this. That's nothing compared to what happens when people, individuals in any generation, will stand up at their Jordan and say, It's going to stop here. Enough of this. And I am going to be willing to step into the deep water of a risky obedience that might involve some painful repentance, not just for me, but for generations in my family. The cycle of sin is stopping here, and the way the cycle is broken is by walking into the deep water of risky obedience. It's by saying, I'm going to trust him, and we're going to obey him and follow him right into my pain and fear, right into the deep water of repentance, even though when you first get into the water, you think you're going to drown. But that's precisely when the waters begin to part, And not only do you begin to walk across on dry ground, but so do your children. Oh. So do it for your children. And some of you have. Some of you have. Back to our story in Joshua. The priests step into their risky obedience. The waters part, the people cross. If I was them and I got a cross after all that risk, I'd go, whew, we're done. Thank you, God. You know, you do that risky obedience thing one time and then you're done. How many of you know that's not true? As soon as they get to the other side, chapter 4, God says, go back. Into the water, go back. 12 men from 12 tribes pick up 12 stones, make an altar from the stones in the river. Why? So when future generations ask mom and dad, grandma, grandpa, what do those stones mean? And you can say, son, daughter, those stones mean that when you enter the deep water of a risky obedience, God will make a way. That's what they mean. And son, daughter, grandson, you are going to have to step into some deep water too. Those stones mean you're going to make it if you do. How many of you know the building in Maple Grove is being built? We're building a building. Did you know that? How many of you know the building in Maple Grove is more than a building? How many of you know that in many ways, beyond what I have words for, the building of that building is a symbol of our journey as a church and the faithfulness of God? How many of you know that it took really a long time for this thing to happen? And there were times when it didn't look like it would. See, I am well aware that a time will come and a generation will follow. In fact, it'll come very quickly because when we move there and new people start to come, there will be people who come there. And when they look at that building in Maple Grove, they will only see a building. I don't think I will ever only see a building. For what that building means, among other things, is this. The very existence of it means to me, as I consider the whole journey, it means this. When the people of God step into the deep water of a risky obedience, when the people of God obey him and believe him and follow him, he will make a way. That's what it means. But it didn't stop there for the people of God. Indeed, most of the rest of the book of Joshua is a series of battle stories centered around a singular pattern, a singular theme, over and over again. It was this. Will the people of God trust God enough again today to do what he says and step into the deep water? And every time they do and obey and say, yes, we will do it, another piece of the land is theirs. And that kind of confirms the promise. Every place you put your foot, I'll give it to you. But you're going to have to put your foot there. You're going to have to take it. Every time they did it, the power, this is all about power, was released. Chapter 5, they've just crossed over. The altar that they were told to build is built. It's time to spread out. That would be my thinking. Jericho is right there. Let's go get it. Let's get big now. Let's spread our wings and exert our influence. When God says, in verse 2 of chapter 5, you're going to do the Jericho thing. Don't worry. but before you go, I want you to make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel. And all God's people, especially the sons of Israel, said, Oh, boy. There's a lot of symbolism and circumcision of covenant and variety of things that I'm not going to go into right now. Just kind of keep it at a real human level. My resistance to this whole thing would go something like this. number one this is going to hurt and see I thought the promised land was painless didn't you? this could make us vulnerable this could slow us down this could take some time in chapter 5 verse 12 they do the circumcision they obey and when they do an amazing thing happens I love this part of the story for the first time in their journey the manna that God had been providing every day stopped. Well, that's a bad thing. No, no, you don't get it. In this obedience, God stopped the manna, verse 12, and for the first time they began to eat from the, here's the key word, abundance of the land. They tasted milk and honey for the very first time. This thing they heard about in Sunday school but quit believing was even possible. They began to taste it. This is dream come true stuff, folks. I would call it the sweet fruit of a risky obedience. Let's connect some dots. In the book of Colossians, the apostle Paul speaks of a circumcision not made with hands, not a physical circumcision, a circumcision of the heart. Circumcision of the heart is an inside job. How many of you know that the inside work of the heart, the inward journey, is the hardest part of the journey? It's one of our core values. You're going to go through this when you go into our membership process, that the inward journey is the hardest journey. It's the most painful. You start doing work of the heart. You start inviting God to circumcise your heart. How many of you know that sometimes that hurts? You do know it because some of you have done it. How many of you know that when you enter into this process, and sometimes it's longer than you wanted it to be, of allowing God to circumcise your heart, It makes you vulnerable, and it slows you down, and it takes some time. A lot of you know that. How many of you also know that when you do it, you begin to taste some things that you'd maybe almost given up believing could be in your marriage or in your life or in your walk with God? You begin to taste the abundance of the kingdom of God. You begin to taste some milk and honey. Dream comes true stuff in your family, in marriage and ministry. I'd call it the sweet fruit of a risky obedience because you allowed God to cut you deep and circumcise your heart. I've been married to Bonnie, my wife, my beloved, for 28 years. A few years ago, for a variety of reasons, noticing some things that just didn't go away for us, barriers, we decided for a variety of reasons that we wanted to walk towards some of those things and wonder if there was more. It wasn't like everything was horrible, but in fact, the analogy I used was, honey, I think we could put this thing in automatic pilot and be okay. We were smelling the empty nest thing, and we were going to have to be alone together now. she with me especially without giving the details because the details don't matter i can just tell you this we plunged into the deep water of a risky obedience and unbeknownst i wasn't ready for this see it it ended up involving some very deep repentance and there were times i thought i was going to drown and there were times i just wondered why in the world did we uncover this because we were we're We were better off before. Stay on the shore. That's a lot of reason to stay on the shore. You never feel like you're going to drown. But I'm here to also tell you. It wasn't like this. But over time, actually quite quickly we began to get glimpses. God began to part the water and give us dry ground to walk on. And I can tell you, and she'll be here in the third service, and she'll be saying yes to this. We're enjoying intimacies. We never dreamt. We read about them in a book. You know what else? We didn't do it for this. We didn't connect all that, but we've created some dry ground for our kids to walk on to. And they're going to have to walk on that dry ground and do some Jordans of their own because we left them some Jordans just so they'd have something to do. Do you get the picture here at all? When I was preparing this and this image came, something else happened in terms of the connection of the dots. It was a memory, and it's about our corporate journey as a church. Ten to 12 years ago, kind of lose track of time. And if you were here, you remember it. We've told the story many times that we as a church sensed God say to us, no, it's not time to do Jericho yet. Don't be getting bigger. Don't be going broader. Jericho will be there when it's time to do Jericho. Right now, you need to go deeper, church. Grow up or die, actually, was the word. You have some inside work to do. My response to that? Oh, God, this could slow us down. This could take some time. We won't be the hottest church in town. This could make us vulnerable, and this could really hurt. Could I tell you something? It slowed us down. It took some time. It took way longer than I thought it would. It made us vulnerable. and it really hurt. But here's the deal, in ways that you know about because they're visible and in ways you don't know about because they're invisible. As best we knew how, we invited God into the circumcision of our heart as a church and an amazing thing is beginning to happen and it is about to happen at an even greater measure, I believe. For I believe in ways we've never known before. We are entering into and beginning to taste the abundance. of the kingdom of God. See, God for years has given us as a church manna. Think about it. Play the movie in your mind of how God has provided for us right down to a building in Robbinsdale High School. Didn't taste very good, but it was what we needed. God provided for us, and we need to be so grateful. But I believe he's about to give us more. a season of abundance a tasting of the milk and the honey dream come true kind of stuff I would call it the sweet fruit of a long obedience I want you to hear how I said that different than the sweet fruit of a long obedience in chapter 6 of Joshua the sons of Israel are all healed up it's time to take Jericho but once again success would be contingent on a risky obedience It's risky this time, not because it's dangerous, but because it's going to feel stupid. Let me ask you a question. Has God ever asked you to do anything that felt goofy? Goofy is not a very good word. Leave it. Let me explain this. Though Jericho was a fortified city, it was really quite small. The latest archaeological findings indicate that Jericho was four to five acres. That's all it was. Some of your yards are bigger than that. which means this, among other things, that the warriors of Israel could probably take these guys all by themselves. Lord, we'll need supernatural intervention on some of the bigger cities in Canaan. Why don't you just let us handle this one? It's on us. We'll pick up the tab on this one. Just pull our sword. We'll knock these guys down. God said this. It's not going to go down that way. I don't want it to go down that way. In fact, I want you to do a goofy thing. And this had to be very frustrating for the warriors who were ready to pull their sword. I want you to walk around the city. Walk around. It sounds so weak. I want you to walk around the city once a day for seven days. And on the seventh day, don't we pull our sword? No, I want you to blow a horn. I really, I think, you know, maybe I'm a soldier. Maybe that's how I'm wired. But that would frustrate me. Let me pull a sword. No, you blow a horn this time. so they did it again they just obeyed god they did this thing that felt weird to them and the walls came down why well in chapter 6 verse 16 it says why here's why so that you and all the people will know that the lord gave this city to you even when you could have gotten it without god i want you to know i did it does it matter to you that our experience of a church involves some stuff where you just know God did it. A couple weeks ago, we had a communion service here. We did a different thing. And the different thing, at least for me, was I barely spoke. Now, I spoke enough to explain what we were going to do that day, but it was really backing off to speaking. And speaking is what I do. That's the sword I kind of wield. Instead, we, and it wasn't just me, it was we, the message team and senior staff felt prompted on that particular Sunday to do a different thing. We just want to explain enough to get to this thing that we do. And what we wanted to do was just invoke the name of God, invite the presence of God, because in the presence of God is the power of God. So let's just see what he does. Felt kind of goofy. Well, there were a lot of stories that came out of that day and walls that came down in people's lives that God brought down. One of my favorites was not the most flamboyant story. In fact, it's very simple. A friend of mine told me a few days after that about how on their ride home from church that day with their family, their 15-year-old son from the back seats said this, Dad, you know that thing Dave said about praying over the chairs and sprinkling them with water? I think that was kind of weird. I don't get that. In fact, I don't even think that's true. But Dad, I felt God today. you know what that means for that 15 year old kid some walls came down on that day nobody preached so we would know god did that so what again quit preaching obviously not in fact if you look at the rest of the book of joshua if you're sticking with this analogy every city after joshua required them taking out the sword i just want you to do it this way this and I want you to obey me. Does it matter that we know God did it? Even the building that we're about to move in, does it matter to you that God did that building? And it wasn't because somebody manipulated you or coerced you or we just forced the issue? The answer to that question is yes, it matters. It matters to me. It matters to you. Could I tell you something else that just moves me more than it ever has in my life? It will matter for generations that God did that and not our force. So that when my grandchildren say to me someday, Grandpa, how come when we come here to this church and see this ministry and look at this building, how come it just looks like a building to us? us, but you get tears in your eyes. What's that about, Grandpa? I can say, let me tell you what this is about. This is about this fact, that this building means that when the people of God step into the deep waters of a risky obedience, God will make a way. See, this building means that God can make the walls come down, and that God can build the walls back up. And every time I look at it, that's what I remember. And now to you, grandson, or you, granddaughter, let it speak this to you, that God's going to call you into some deep water too, and God will make a way for you. Every time you say yes to God, he will make a way for you. And for generations to come. Let me wrap it up with this. Every single person in this room has a Jordan, probably several of some kind to face. Possibly born of someone else's sin or lack of obedience. And maybe if it's a family thing, it's been there in your mind forever. The promise of God to you is this, Joshua chapter one, verse three. that you can cross this river and you can enter into a whole new way of living. Indeed, every place you put your foot, I will give it to you, says the Lord. But you're going to have to take the first step into the deep water of a risky obedience. And that first step, beloved, is always a frightening step. It is a fear-filled step. And generally, when you first take it, you're going to feel like you're about to drown. That's why, by the way, God in Joshua chapter 1 said to Joshua over and over again, be strong and courageous, only be strong and courageous. Did I not say be strong and courageous? He said it three times in like eight or nine verses. Why? Because he knew the first step was going to be a fear-filled step. The sad reality, however, is this. Many people, many churches, many communities of faith spend their entire redeemed lives standing scared on the shores of their Jordan River, grumbling and complaining that the promises of God aren't true and the power of God isn't real, saying on the Jordan River things like this, Lord, I promise, as soon as you part the waters, I will walk across. I'll be the first one saying things like this, Lord, when you give me a lot of money, I will be generous. First day the money, I will. Lord, when you give me a lot of time, I will learn to pray. And when you change the behavior of those people over there that I just despise, when you change their behavior, then I'll learn to love. And when you change the heart of my spouse or my mother or my father and get them to apologize to me for the ways they've hurt me, then I will forgive. Beloved, it just doesn't work that way. Here's the deal. God's power is available to people who are willing to take the first step and follow him into the deep water of a risky obedience. You see, there is a path to power in the kingdom of God, but it's an odd path, an unfamiliar path, full of paradox and what looks like contradiction, For the path to power in the kingdom of God doesn't always look or feel very powerful at all, especially that first step. That first step's a doozy. You'll think you're going to die, but you won't die. In fact, you will come to life. And you will enter in because God will make a way. and he will make a way through you for generations. This is a word from God to us as a church. God is calling you, individual, and us. Has been, will continue to call us into deep waters of risky obedience to create a path for people who are absolutely stuck. to walk into a whole different way of living. And I got to tell you, I don't even know all of what I mean by that. I don't. So here we go. As we continue this journey of faith together. Let's pray. Let's pray. Would you, you know what? Just be quiet and listen to God about your Jordan, about your gratitude. gratitude. just a quick word, especially to those of you who through the word today have had revealed to them, it's just something you've known and you've always, but you really are in the need of making a first step. Just a gentle word as if I was with, it was just you and me and God alone. If you hear the voice of God today, don't harden your heart. Today may be the day you need to take your first step into the deep water of a risky obedience, do it. You can do it in covenant to do it in prayer all by yourself with a friend, come forward for prayer with somebody here. But act on this. I pray, Jesus, that you, on one hand, would make us grateful for those who've gone before. Help us see, in fact, ways that maybe we just take for granted, I think, a lot. or the dry ground we're walking on, that have created advantages for us in terms of what you might even be calling us to next, bigger cities and bigger fortified places that can be brought down because of faithfulness of people in the past. But make us also aware of our need to be faithful to those places and obedient to you and to those places where you're calling us to deep water of risky obedience that we would just go. and then see the power of your spirit released for the healing of the nations. I pray it in your name. Amen. Amen.
