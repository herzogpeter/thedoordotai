Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14. We hear the Apostle Paul saying these very important, and now these words have become very precious words. For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner man. in order that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, in order that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge, in order that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God now to him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we could ask or think according to the power that works within us, to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Let it be. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, I ask that you would this morning anoint your servant. This passage is so crucial. and words do not work and i pray that we would hear this morning as it were the very oracles of god amen we have been learning that this passage is one of the richest and most significant passages in all of the new testament let alone ephesians how to be filled with all the fullness of god how to get the information that we have been spending almost six months on from chapters one through chapter three how to get that information from my head and into my living to take those resources that we have been discovering that are ours as believers and get them moving into a workable living kind of thing this passage i believe is filled with transforming power it has had an effect on me and it's had an impact on me and and changed me i believe and i believe it's had the same kind of thing on many of us many of you it's passages like this that can take what is normally for us and so easily for us stagnant stale but very right truth and bring it alive and turn it on and that's what this whole passage is about it's a turn on it's taking the things we've learned and turning them on, igniting them, getting them on fire. It was about two years ago that I went to a Bethel Founders Week conference, and in this particular conference, the thing that was being stressed all week long through all of the sermons, the main theme was the Word of God. The Word of God and the exhortation to the pastors who were there was this. We need to preach the Word. We need to teach the Word. We need to trust the Word and depend on the Word, and the Word is authority, and we need to go back to our churches and tell to our people, this is what the Word says. And I remember during that week that the Word of God was having a tremendous impact in that place and in people's lives. And one of the last speakers to speak was a dear black pastor. I'll never forget his name. No, his name was S.M. Lockridge, Shadrach Meshach Lockridge. Now, only a black pastor can have a name like that. And he stood up and his presence was real dominating. He just filled the pulpit. And I remember he got up there and he just kind of gave a grin out over that congregation, didn't say a word, got everybody's attention by not talking. It was excellent. And then he said, you know something this week? The Lord has rung my bell. And if your bell hadn't been rung, your clappers broke. many went on to say this week the Lord has lit my fire and if your fire ain't lit your wood is wet what a joy it is to realize that we are dealing with the word of God and I believe and I have seen that if we take the time to study it and if we take the time to break it down, and if we take the time to drink it in, God's going to ring our bell, and he's going to light our fire. And that's what we need as we go to something like this. But the problem for some of us, for many of us, for myself included, all too often, is that when we go to the Word of God to take a drink of the Word, instead of drinking it in to where it can get into my life and affect my life and infect my living, I gargle it, you know, on a Sunday morning. I put it in and I kind of gargle it and then I go out to the parking lot where real living is and I spit it out. We need to drink in the world and that's exactly why Paul in this 14th verse bows his knee before the Father and says, I pray that you people in Ephesus will drink this in. We'll absorb it and not put it off. We'll turn on the resources that we have. In chapters 3, verses 14 through 21, he gave us the sequence for turning on this power. The end result was verse 20. Now to him who was able to do, to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we could ask or think. Abundant living, powerful living. But there's a sequence that leads up to that. We indicated that there's three hina clauses, hina purpose clauses in the Greek. And what it means is simply this. In order that, in order that, and it means that one thing happens, and then when that happens, then that enables another thing to happen, which is followed by another thing, and that is followed by another thing. There's a sequence, and it's very important that we follow the sequence. I cannot get to abundant power without having gone through steps one, two, three, and four. That's why we've taken so much time. We spent two weeks alone on the very first thing in verse 16. Those five steps are this, inner strength, the indwelling Christ, incomprehensible love, infinite fullness, and then, bam, inexhaustible power. But it's a progression. And so we need to go a step at a time. The first in the sequence that we talked about several weeks ago was this infinite, this inner strength, verse 16, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power through his spirit. Where? In the inner man. The inner man is the real you as opposed to the outer you, the physical man. The inner man is the real you. And I can't preach that sermon again because I almost did it last week, twice. But the inner man is strengthened, we discovered. As I simply yield to the Spirit, and as I yield to the Spirit, moment by moment, step by step, every time I yield, every time I obey what the Spirit of God is leading me to do, What that does is it builds up my spiritual muscles little by little, step by step. And as I'm doing that, as I'm yielding to the spirit, that inner man is being what? Is being strengthened step by step, day by day, moment by moment. That inner man is being built. And pretty soon as we're living a lifestyle of yielding to the spirit, the easiest thing in the world for me to do is obey the spirit. Obey the spirit. It's natural because my inner man has been built up. It starts with yielding to the spirit. The second step is the indwelling Christ, verse 17. After the inner man is strengthened, that enables or that results in Christ dwelling in our hearts through faith. And we talked about the fact that on the surface it looks like we've got a theological problem. I always thought that faith in Christ was what brought Christ into my life. That believing on him and his death and resurrection was what brought him into my life, dwelling in my life. And here it says that after I'm strengthened by his spirit in the inner man, that enables Christ to dwell in my life. Now, something's wrong, except we got into the Greek a little bit because the English is deficient here. We discovered the word for dwell is katoikesai, and that's two words put together, the preposition kata and the verb, the Greek verb oikeo, which means to be at home. But when you take the preposition and you take the verb and you put them together into one word, it intensifies that verb, and so it can be read this way. in order that Christ may settle down and really be at home. And what a picture that painted for us as believers as we looked at this sequence of events. And it realized the fact, chapter 2, verse 22, tells us that we are the habitation of God. We already know from Ephesians 1 that we have been sealed in the Spirit and we have the Holy Spirit living in our lives. We are the habitation of God. as paul is praying he is opening the door for the possibility that these believers who have the indwelling christ living in them do not have christ living in them in such a way that he is comfortable living there he's there but he's like a guest he's there but he's like a friend that we ignore and use when we want something because he's got a lot of money So when we want something, we'd be real nice to him. He's there, but we treat him like a pet. He's there, but we treat him like a little ornament. You know, along with all the other nice things I have in my life, I've got Jesus too. Isn't that nice? He's there, and he has brought with him all of the resources and all of the power of God himself, all of the resources and power of heaven itself. But because of the way we're living and the way we're acting and the attitudes we're holding, The Holy Spirit of God living in me is being closed off into a little room where he can't do in my life what he came to do. It's called quenching the Spirit. He can't do in me what he wants to do. I've shut him off. We discovered again, it came back to that very first principle, that as I yield to the Holy Spirit who's in me, who's habitating me, he begins to fill me and he fills every dimension of my life. And after a while, as we, in humility and adoration to him, walk with him into all the different rooms of our life, the living room, the bedroom, the dining room, the library where my mind is going on, and all those hidden places where my hatreds and my jealousies and my envies and all those things are living. And I say, Lord, I want you to fill them, and I want you to fill them, and I want you to fill them. And take all myself out and fill it with yourself. It comes to a point where he so owns us and so controls us and so possesses us that his very personality begins to exude through us the Christ life. The Christ life. That life that we talk about so much, but so many of us are not laying hold of. And as we begin to go through these steps and yield and humbly come to the Lord and say, I want that anointing, I need that filling. 2 Corinthians 3, 18 becomes a reality. That we are being transformed into his same image. Now, after those two steps are understood and we're coming to the Lord with our hearts. And openly opening our lives to him so that he can fill us with himself. The machine begins to rumble. And the power is just about to be ignited as this passage continues. And we go to the third step, the third purpose. The third result, as we begin to yield to the Spirit, the third result is this, incomprehensible love. Verse 17, be in order that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge. This is fabulous. This is fabulous. This text right here we could spend a couple more weeks on. I'm just going to keep it to three, so don't worry. We won't go into next week. I want you to notice again the Hena Clause. I want you to notice again that this is a result of something else. This incomprehensible love that's being exuded through the believer's life is a result of something that happened before, isn't it? I've already explained that to you. It's a result of the strengthening of the inner man. It's a result of Christ settling down in my life and being at home. It's a result of the Spirit's control in my life. The result of those things is love. uncomprehensible love the result of christ's unrestricted access to my heart is love see when christ settles down in my heart his nature dominates and his nature is love and it just begins to manifest itself i'm going to tell you something that maybe some of you have heard before but to some of you this may sound like a radical thought but i am not going to stand up here and exhort you to love each other that's getting the cart before the horse what i'm going to exhort you to do is again in humility and honesty before god ask him to to control your life yield to the spirit the result of that will be love there's no way in the world that you can produce this there's no way in the world that you can produce this love it's a result of yielding to the spirit a strengthened inner man christ settling down and being at home and the result of that is love let's look at the text break it down there's three basic things i want you to understand about this love the first thing i want you to understand is that this love that he's speaking of here is basic to the believer's life it is absolutely at the core of the believer's life it's fundamental verse 17 again b that you would be rooted and grounded in love the word rooted there speaks of a tree that's the picture we get in our mind very quickly we see the roots going deep and fully and and all over the place into this ground being firmly rooted grounded in love it speaks of a building and a building the ground of the building is the foundation so the foundation of that building it's absolutely essential we're getting this picture of love as being the root of the believer's life the foundation of the believer's life it's absolutely basic it's part of our identification it's the foundation of who we are that's at the core jesus great desire for and his message to the disciples as he was leaving was very simple but very profound he said simply this i want you to love each other i want you to love each other in first peter 1 21 and 22 he says this you have demonstrated your obedience to the truth not by making firm commitments and preaching the word he says you have demonstrated your obedience and your commitment to the truth by what? By your fervent love for the brethren. Continue, therefore, to fervently love one another from the heart. That's God's design for the believer, folks. That's God's design. That's at the very root of the believer's life. That is fundamental. That's the foundation. We're all very familiar with the text, 1 Corinthians 13, where it says, listen, I don't care if you speak with the tongues of men and of angels, I couldn't care less because if there's no love, it's nothing. I don't care if you have prophecy. I don't care if you have all knowledge. I don't care if you know all mysteries. I don't care. I don't care if you have enough faith to move mountains. I don't care if you give up your body to be burned if you don't have love. You have nothing. It's at the core. It's at the core. It's fundamental. I don't care if you can preach. I don't care if you can teach. I don't care what you know. If you don't have love, it's zero. Something minus love is nothing. Everything minus love is nothing. You minus love is nothing. Absolutely nothing. You know what? Everything. Everything in terms of what God wants for you and what God wants for me is summed up in one statement. It's beautiful. Listen to it. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and you shall love your neighbor as yourself. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind and you shall love your neighbor as yourself. You know, that covers all relationships. When Jeff was here with his seminar, this was one of the texts that he used. to draw this equation, he called it. God at the top, me down here, and others over here. And the equation is always solid. And if I leave myself out, it isn't solid anymore. If I don't love myself, it isn't solid anymore. And if I don't love you, it isn't complete anymore. If I don't love God with everything I have, it isn't complete anymore. This is what healthy human beings are made of. That's it. It's at the core. It's fundamental. It's at the root. It's the foundation. Romans, I want you to turn to this. Romans chapter 13. Romans chapter 13, verse 8. Keep your finger on Ephesians. Now, I've heard this before, but maybe in the context of the study we're doing now, it came out to me in a new and fresh way. He says this, Oh, nothing to anyone except one thing, to love one another. That's what I want you to do. For he who loves his neighbor, catch this, has fulfilled the law. Incredible. For this, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet. If there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Love, therefore, is the fulfillment of the law. Have you ever in your whole life thought of the Ten Commandments as being principles that were really discussing love? I never did. Have you ever thought of that? Listen to this. If you really love your neighbor, you're not going to steal from him. I don't need to tell you that. I don't need to tell you thou shalt not steal. If you really love each other, you're not going to. If you really love each other, you're not going to kill anybody. If you really love your neighbor, you're not going to bear a lie against them. If you really love God, you're not going to take his name in vain. You'll love him too much to do that. If you really love God with all your heart and soul and mind, you're not going to make any graven images that would cheapen or tarnish his deity and his power and his majesty. You just love him too much to do that. it's really about love love it's basic it is at the root it is at the ground level but i have to come back to verse 16 because this is never going to be real this is never going to be ignited this is never going to be turned on by your sincere efforts by my sincere efforts by my emotional sensitivities this is a lifestyle and it is a byproduct a result of the Spirit's control. Again, it's nothing you can produce. What turns love on in my life is not my desire to be a good Christian. I have a desire to be a good Christian, but I don't care how much I want to be a good Christian. That isn't the thing that ignites the power to do it. The thing that ignites the power is not my desire to be a loving person. I'm a loving person. That's my personality. Sometimes we even say that about other people. Well, he's a loving person. I'm not. I'm just not that way, you know. I think we need to understand, and there's no other way that I can back off this text without continually stressing that this kind of lifestyle is a supernatural thing. It is a work of the Spirit of God in you and in me. And I think that as we are walking and living our lives without love, and if that is not being demonstrated through our lives, Again, the exhortation is trying to love each other. No, it isn't. What you're doing when we're walking not in love is simply telegraphing to the whole world, I'm not walking in the Spirit. If I was walking in the Spirit, that would be evident. Because one of the evidences would be that I'd love. That would be it. Galatians 5, verse 22 says the fruit of the Spirit is what? First of all, love. The beautiful thing about that text, I wish we had time to go study that. Maybe that'll be another year. We'll do Galatians. The beautiful thing about that text is that just before he says what the fruit of the Spirit is, he says the work of the flesh is also evident. When you're in control of yourself, that's obvious. Because there's envy, there's strife, there's anger, there's hostility, there's all those other things. And he even goes, and things like those. He could go on and on. It's obvious when the flesh is in control. It's also obvious when the spirit's in control. Love is one thing. Joy, peace, long self. Can you imagine trying to produce those things yourself? I always thought it was a funny thing to try to think of someone producing peace. You know, I don't have peace. Okay, okay. I'm going to have peace. I'm going to have peace. I'm going to have patience, patience. I will have patience. love joy peace long-suffering gentleness those are indicators those are simply indicators that the spirit of god living in you is controlling you the fruit of the spirit is love they're indicators of who's in control okay but not only are we rooted in love as a result of letting christ settle down and be at home in our life but another result of letting christ settle down and be at home in my life because i'm taking him to all those areas in my life where he needs to control. The other result is this, that now I'm able to comprehend God's love. Verse 18, that you'd be rooted and grounded in love, but you would also be able to comprehend with all the saints. Some of us may say big deal. Let's go into it and look at it. Comprehend means to seize the love of God. Comprehend means to understand the love of God, means to lay hold of it like you've never laid hold of it before. I don't know how some of you have felt as we've gone through this text, and maybe it's not even a good illustration to use this text as to what I want to illustrate, but there are times in my Christian life as I'm walking with the Lord, and I'm sure you've experienced the same kind of thing, that suddenly every day it seems like I'm seeing a little bit more. You know, you just see a little bit more, you understand a little bit more, and you can't really put into words what it is you see it's an experience it's something you're that god is revealing to you as he settles down and is at home in my life i begin to see and appreciate and seize and lay hold of the love of god that's exactly what paul is doing in this text i even feel frustration as he is trying to say that you may be able to comprehend with all the saints with all believers what is the love of god and he tries to describe and so he says what is the height what is the breadth and length and height and depth he can't put it in the words he goes i want you to know you'll be able to comprehend how broad it is how long it is how high it is and how deep it is he doesn't put any words on it you'll just know you'll just know well how do we find out what is what does it mean the breadth of his love what does it mean the height of his love we could look at all of the word of god and find those the answers to those questions one place we could look though would be the book of ephesians the breadth of his love I love this. The breadth of his love, chapter 2, verse 11, his love is broad enough to put his hand on the Jew and then put his hand on the Gentile who were worlds apart. And he put his hand on the Jew and he put his hand on the Gentile and he brought them together and he made one new man. That's the that's the breadth. That's how broad the love of God is. He can go from one end of the world to the other end of the world and bring people together. That's how broad it is. How long? What's the length of his love. Chapter 1, verse 4. His love for me began when he chose me in him. When? Before the foundation of the world. So how long? Where did it begin? Before. In eternity past. How far into the future? Chapter 2, verse 7. He will show the surpassing greatness of his grace and kindness toward us. When? In the ages to come. So how long is his love? From eternity past to eternity future. How deep is his love? Chapter 2, verses 1 through 3, his love is deep enough to reach us when we were dead in our sin. His love was deep enough to reach us when we were walking according to the course of this world, according to the prince and the power of the air. His love was deep enough to reach us when I was a bullseye for God's wrath. That's how deep his love is. How high is it? His love is high enough, chapter 2, verse 6, to raise us up with him and seat us with him in the heavenly places. its breadth it can reach anybody its length from eternity to eternity its depth it can reach into the pit of sin and its height it can take us right into the presence of almighty god that's his love and that's why paul prays that by this as we're strengthened by the spirit and the inner man and that as christ settles down and is at home and that as we are rooted and grounded in love that we may be able to comprehend and appreciate that love that he has shed upon us this is living life with the throttle wide open folks it's just about to be ignited but there's one more and i'll tell you those first two are still just ethereal and to comprehend the love of god is aesthetic you know it's something i experience it's kind of it's something i kind of know it's neat but i can't even put into words what it is for you so in some ways it's not real practical okay this next one is the whole sermon you catch it if you've been sleeping up to now Now wake up and nudge your neighbor. Verse 19. Not only that you, as Christ settles down and is at home, the result is not only that you would be rooted and grounded in love, have the foundation of your life firmly planted in love, but that you'd be able to comprehend or understand it. The third thing is this, to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge. To know there means simply this, literally, to know by experience. It is not an intellectual understanding. This is to know by experience. the only way we're going to know the love of god is to experience the love of god the love of christ that's in our life louie armstrong was asked one day if he could explain jazz and he gave the guy a little bit of a funny look and he says hey friend if i got to explain it you ain't got it and it's something like this it's something we experience the love of christ and again i hate to keep harping on this but i'm gonna this is a suit this is supernatural in nature it is the work of the spirit is a byproduct of my walking in the spirit and being controlled by the spirit i want you to notice something about this it's called the love of christ which surpasses knowledge it surpasses knowledge it's very much like the in philippians the peace of god that surpasses comprehension that passes comprehension it's past my ability to even put it into words or understand it but i know it because i experience the peace of god when there's no reason to have the peace of God. That's a work of the Spirit. This is the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge. Without the Spirit of God filling, there's no way in the world we're ever going to know this. I want to say this flat out. There is no way in the world that a non-believer or a Christian who isn't being controlled by the Spirit can possibly experience or know the love we're talking about. There's no way in the world. Let's look at the world, the love of the world and the love of God. Just look at it very quickly. The world's love says this. You are a nice object. I choose to love you because you're attractive. You are a nice object. You're attractive to me, so I choose to love you. God's love says this. I love by nature. You exist. Therefore, You're going to get it. I like that. The world's love says, I will love you until I find something better. God's love says, You look so perfect in me, in Christ, that I'm going to love you forever. World's love says, I will love you until you offend me. God's love says, You never stop offending me, and I love you, and I never stop. That's his nature. And that sounds awful distant to me. but unless i don't believe the word of god what this is teaching us is this that as he is allowed to settle down and be at home in me as he begins to dominate me and his nature begins to exude through me he can now do in me what he came to do and one of the demonstrations of that control is this kind of love one more thing and this has got to be defined the kind of love we're talking about in this text this love of christ which surpasses knowledge in every every word that is that that translate translates love in this passage is agape love and it's extremely important that we understand this this love that that is a result of the spirit's control is not warm and gooey sentimentality it has nothing to do with warm gooey sentimentality. I want to tell you something, there's no way in the world that I'm going to be able to love everyone with that warm and gooey sentimentality. In fact, that's not a real strong kind of love. Let me explain this. There's no way we're going to magically feel warm and wonderful about everyone. In fact, when Jesus Christ went to the cross and they spit in his face and they were mocking him and scorning him, I do not believe for a minute that he felt warm and gooey and sentimental about the people who were doing that for him and as he hung on the cross i don't believe for a minute that he felt warm and gooey it wasn't sentimental sentimental is much this love of christ which surpasses knowledge which surpasses under which surpasses our own understanding is not an emotion at all get this this love of christ this supernatural love that he's talking about is not an emotion has nothing to do with emotions it's an activity the love of christ is an activity it's a verb if you will john 3 16 and our choir sung about this god so loved the world that he felt well sentimental no no way there's god so loved the world that he gave the best that he had. God so loved the world that he acted. This love is an activity. It's not an emotion. It's not sentimentality. That's the love that the world can't know without the Spirit of God. If a man says he loves me, how does he show it? If a man says he loves me, how does he show it? Feel warm and gooey and sentimental? Absolutely not. He will do what I say. He will keep my word. This love is an activity. It's something I do. Greater love has no man than this, that he feels sentimental. No, that he laid down his life, that he does something. It's an activity. It has nothing to do with what you feel. You may not feel good at all. If Jesus' love was sentimental and gooey, I guarantee he wouldn't have gotten out of the garden. His love was an activity. he said i'm going to do what i came to do it's an activity first john 3 17 says this and i think it says it very very directly basically to the church he says save your pious platitudes and your sentimentality save it because whoever has the world's goods and sees a brother in need and closes his heart against him in other words anyone who has something to give and sees someone in need and doesn't do anything. You tell me, how does the love of God dwell in him? Little children, let us not love in word, sentimental, gooey, and wonderful. Let us not love in word or in tongue, but indeed do something. Save the sentimentality. That's the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge and activity. Think about it for a minute. The kind of responsibility that places on us as a church. You know, somewhere along the line, we've got to justify our existence on this corner, don't we? Somewhere along the line, we have to do that. We have to come to a place where we look at our neighborhood in Crystal, and we have to look and say, you know, I'm going to start sharing with the people in our neighborhood, and I'm going to start sharing with the people at work. When I feel real warm and gooey, when I feel real sentimental, when you get me worked up real good on a Sunday morning, I get all lathered, and I go out Sunday morning because I'm feeling real warm and gooey. Somewhere along the line, we've got to see that the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, and the love of Christ that sent him to the cross was not sentimental. I had nothing to do with things I feel. It was something people did. It was something they do. listen if there is a group of people in all the world who ought to be involved in people's pain it ought to be disturbed and it doesn't always feel good and you're not always going to feel sentimental about what we're doing but we we operate that way don't we when we want someone to support something we work it up so everybody feels good about it. There's any group of people who ought to be involved in people's pain. It ought to be the church. I could say that a different way. I could say if there's a group of people in the whole world who ought to care about people's... I think we care about people's pain. I think too often we're not involved in people's pain. Because love to us is sentimental. Love to Christ was active. It was something he did. we think world hunger sometimes isn't our issue we think drugs and alcohol isn't our issue we say we love it's time we do the things that indicate we know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge I thank God that our church is beginning to be more and more known as a church that cares about people's pain and we're not afraid to touch it and it isn't always fun and it isn't always easy and i don't always feel sentimental about it and sometimes our rugs are going to get dirty and our windows might get broken something might even get ripped off here and there what a gift what a gift to know the love of christ to experience the love of christ that surpasses knowledge. It isn't available to an unbeliever. It isn't even available to a believer who doesn't understand these steps of yielding to the Spirit and saying, I want that power. I want that supernatural kind of thing. I want even a sensitivity to know when I should do something. Listen, if there's a family, if there are families in all the world who ought to know how to talk to each other, who ought to know how to be real, who ought to know how to be honest and open, who ought to be able to, over a breakfast table or any time, look each other in the eye and be able to see inside. If there's ever a family that ought to be like that, it ought to be a Christian family. And then we say as our little rationalizations come, oh, Dave, that's true, but you don't know my dad. He's a jerk. You don't know my mom. She doesn't love me. There's nothing in return. You don't know my sister. You don't know my brother. How can you tell me to have that kind of relationship? You don't know my kids. You don't know my sister, my brother, on and on. You don't know my wife. You don't know my husband. I can't love them. You know, nobody would want to admit it, but I know this. Not because I know of anyone. I'm not betraying a confidence, but because I know people are people. I know there are people here, some of you, who in your hearts have someone in your family who you could say honestly, I can't love them. Maybe it's your wife, your husband, your kid, your mother, whoever. I just don't feel it. You know what? I'm not going to ask you to feel anything today. I'm going to ask you to act on it. I'm going to give an invitation in a couple minutes. And I think that some people, if the Holy Spirit is convicting them in this area, instead of coming forward, need to turn sideward or walk across the congregation or come from the front to the back or the back to the front. And don't come here to the altar. Don't come here to the Lord. Don't bring yourself here until you've gone to your mom or your dad or your sister or your brother or your husband or your wife and confessed your sin. Broke down the barriers and acted. You may not feel a thing. And then together come and lay your tension and your hatred and your anger at the feet of Jesus. Love is an activity, folks. Love is something you do. But you know what? And I believe this is so scriptural it just reeks of the word of God because it's right. You know what happens after we act? And sometimes acting without the feeling. After we act. And do that thing that I don't want to be crude, but sometimes that move to your mom, that move to your dad, is something like throwing up. You just hold it in, you hold it in, you hold it in, you know it's got to come sometime, and then finally, bam, I've got to get rid of it. I believe that after we act, agape love, that kind of love, after we act, then the feelings begin to flow. And I think that's scriptural, because I think that's exactly what Jesus went through when he went to the cross. He didn't feel warm. He didn't feel gooey. He didn't feel sentimental. They nailed him to a cross. But Hebrews 12 says, for the joy set before him. He adored it. He did it. And then the joy came, and the joy is you, and the joy is me, and we're part of this family, and it's forgiveness, and bound together. That's crazy. No, this is the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge. look at that sequence again I yield I give up in order that I may be strengthened in the inner man in order that Christ may settle down and be at home in order that I may be rooted and grounded in love in order that I would comprehend the breadth and length and height and depth of this love in order that I may experience the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge in order that I may be, this is great, filled up for the fullness of God. Plerao is the Greek word, filled up, dominated by the fullness of God. Verse 20, now, now, after that, now to him who is able. Is it possible for my family to be mended? He is able. More than that, He is able to do. More than that, He is able to do what I ask. He is able to do what I ask or think. He is able to do all that I ask or think. He is able to do beyond all that I ask or think. He is able to do exceeding, abundantly, beyond all that I could ask or think. That's grandiose. But what about me? What about our church? What about my family? He's able. But you know, with all that power, we pull the trigger, don't we? We say, okay. Okay. Thank you.
