I think most of you know that this is a series that began a few weeks ago when we were going through 1 Corinthians and we came upon 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and one of the things we became aware of was the fact that we really needed to do some more study. It was a real dumpster load of information that Sunday morning and in order to do it and handle it in a way that I think is manageable I wanted to put it into the evening here and do it in this kind of context with some notes to follow and in a seminar type of atmosphere. We are now not only studying the teaching of the Apostle Paul on divorce and remarriage and marriage as well, but we have gone back from Paul's teaching to Jesus' teaching. And what we're going to do next week is we're going to dovetail to both of them. It's breaking down into three sections, our study, in the last three weeks. Last week, we talked about Jesus' teaching on marriage in Matthew 19, 1 through 6. Today, we're going to be covering Jesus' teaching on divorce in Matthew 19, 7 through 9. And then next week, it's going to be Matthew 19, 7 through 12, and also 1 Corinthians 7, as we're going to be talking about Jesus and Paul's teaching on not only divorce, but on divorce and remarriage, and where it's applicable, where it's appropriate, where it's legitimate, and where it isn't. Last week, let me just run through the review with you. If you weren't here last week, this will be helpful. And if you were, I think it'll also be a good reminder as to where we've been and where we're going. This review is pretty well covered in the outline, so you can follow right along. First of all, the setting, verse 1 and 2. And it came about that when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. The region of Judea beyond the Jordan is a place called Perea, the Perean area. It was a place that was ruled, you remember, by Herod Antipas. He's the same guy who beheaded John the Baptist for calling him an adulterer, and being involved in an incestuous kind of marriage. So this was kind of a hotbed. And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. Also in Mark 10, 1, it has the same parallel thing. It says people not only followed him, and he not only healed them, but he was teaching all the time. You remember last week that this is a real turning point in Jesus' ministry. The Galilean ministry is over for him, and everything that that represented is done. He is now turning a corner and everything in his life is now escalating toward the cross. And he has a sense of that. The crowds are big. The anticipation is there. Lots of excitement. Lots of activity. But the cross is looming very, very big in his mind. So the teaching at this time becomes even more important and more crucial. In verse 3, we see that he meets some old friends, the Pharisees. Some Pharisees came to him and were testing him. The test and the question they were asking him was not a test. It was not a question that they were going to ask him because they wanted information. It was a test that was designed to destroy him and to discredit him. They were going to come with a question that he couldn't possibly answer and look good when he did it. The two ways that they wanted to get him were, first of all, to discredit him with the people. You remember last week we discovered that most of the people in that day believed and followed the Hillel group of the Pharisees who said that you could indeed divorce for any cause. It was no big deal. The Pharisees themselves were leading in this. They were getting married and divorced on a whim whenever they wanted to do it. So if they could come to him with a question about divorce and get him to take a strong stand, he would maybe lose his following because the people would be upset with him. The second thing they wanted to do would be simply to destroy him, that he would not only lose his following, but he would lose his life. Again, referring to this whole thing with Herod Antipas being the leader of that area, he beheaded John the Baptist for calling him an adulterer. if they could somehow get Jesus to publicly infer that the leader of that territory was an adulterer involved in an incestuous, unholy kind of union, they could possibly get him to lose his life as well. That was the intent of what they said. And they asked him this, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause at all? The fact was this, that they did indeed teach that, that you can divorce your wife for any cause at all. We talked about burning your bagels. That's a good enough reason. Okay. Verse four, we have, after the confrontation, we have the counterpunch. The counterpunch is just a way of saying, this is where Jesus' answer comes in, verses four through six. And Jesus answered and said, have you not read? He is here turning the tables on them. They are coming to him with a question that's designed to destroy him and discredit him. And he is turning the tables on them and coming to them with some sarcasm. He is going to quote God. Have you not read? He who created them from the beginning made them male and female. He's going all the way back to the creation account and kind of sarcastically confronting them with the fact that possibly they need to go back to the beginning and do some reading on their own. There were four reasons that he gave that divorce is unlawful at that point. The first reason was in verse 4. End of verse 4. He who created them from the beginning made them male and female. No option, no alternative, one man, one woman. That was the design from the very beginning. That was the principle he was teaching. The second reason that divorce is not lawful, according to Christ here, is in verse 5, for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife. So the second reason was a strong bond, the whole issue of cleaving, okay, being stuck to that person. You're stuck to them, however, because you pursue them, you love them, okay? We talked about that a this morning as well. The third reason is the whole one flesh principle, again in verse 5, and then on down into verse 6. They shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. Consequently, they are no longer two, but they are one flesh. One flesh is the indivisible number. Remember, you can't divide one. If you divide one, you don't get two wholes, you get two halves, and that's the whole thing he's dealing with there. And then in verse 6, it is a God-created union. God has joined whatever, therefore God has joined together. Let no man separate. Let no man divorce. One of the other things very quickly we dealt with last week, just to catch you up, was as we got to his teaching, we backed off a little bit and considered some of the biblical reasons for the degeneration of marriage. We could probably come up with all sorts of psychological and sociological explanations for why marriages are falling apart in record numbers, but there is a biblical explanation as well. And we talked about three basic things. God's design in marriage, God's intended design is in Genesis 1, 27 and 28. And that's where we got a picture in the garden before the fall of man and woman living together in harmony, co-regency, co-ruling. There was a mutuality. There was a mutual submission, if you will. There was indeed headship and that principle was very real, but it was not a dominating kind of fighting back and forth, vying for power issue. what we do however come to as in the fall in genesis chapter 3 that design is destroyed and we saw things like the curse being described and it says things like this and what's going to happen in the curse is that his desire will be her desire will be for her husband and desire did not mean a wonderful attraction and wanting to love him very much the desire was out to get him it was out to get him and we saw that when we flipped over to luke or matthew chapter 4 verse 7 just the page over and talked about Cain and his sin and it said the sin was crouching at the door and his desire was for him. The whole point was the woman's place now is no longer that one of co-regency and mutuality and harmony. Now she looks at the man and wants to usurp his authority. But one of the reasons he wants to do that, she wants to do that, is because man is no longer, the man is no longer in this role of mutuality either. Because Genesis 3 account talks about this ruling he now has, and it's a dominating, crushing, despotic thing. Chauvinism is what is fundamentally being dealt with there. The point of that whole thing, and I want to go deeply into that because we spent so much time last week, but the point of that when we got to Genesis 3 was that that is not God's ordained pattern for marriage. That is the pattern after the fall, and it is no more God's design for marriage than our fall from intimacy with him is his design for our relationship with him. When we look at our relationship with God, we see before the fall, intimacy, reality, relationship. When sin came, there was a break in that relationship. What did the cross do? It brought us back into relationship, okay? When we look at marriage, we see the same thing. We see a harmonious relationship, mutuality, co-regency, co-ruling, no vying for power. We see sin come and that relationship is destroyed. You see the man pounding down on the woman and the woman trying to usurp and manipulate and all that kind of stuff. And in that we see a picture of most marriages. But then when we see in Ephesians 5, we see the reversal of the fall, the control of the Holy Spirit in a woman's life and in a man's life in a marriage brings that co-regency again. The woman submitting to the husband, the husband loving the wife. Nobody's a loser. And there is indeed, in verse 21, a mutual submission. Again, I'm giving you a lot of stuff. If you weren't here last week, some of that stuff will be clicking if you were. So paradise is regained there. This week, Matthew 19, verses 7 through 9. Now I want to slow down. The review is over. Need to go slow. Point number one. Confrontation number two. After Jesus has brought his answer to them, they come back with an argument. The argument is in verse 7. The Pharisees said to him, Why then did Moses command to give her a certificate of divorce? Okay, Jesus, if that's true, if what God has joined together no man can separate, and you're saying that divorce is not appropriate, why then did Moses command to give her a certificate and divorce her? It's an amazing thing here, just a footnote. I don't know if you want to take notes on this or not, but it's an amazing thing that they are not at all interested in the divine ideals that Jesus has just presented. They are constantly looking for the exception to the rule. They're constantly looking for a loophole to get out of what they don't want to do. One of the reasons for that is that legalists are always that way. I think you ought to have a little tip-off about that. Legalistic people, super pious people who have no reality in their living are constantly doing that. That's the pattern of their life. They're looking for the exception. They love to appear spiritual, but they almost always miss the heart of the matter. But there's another reason that they come back with this particular argument. the other reason is that they're still trying to trip him up think about this they've already tried to discredit him in the view of the people by trying to get him to make a strong stand on divorce they've already tried to get him in trouble with herod by asking him that kind of question to get him in trouble with him and now if that hasn't worked in fact if he's turned the tables on them and made them look stupid because they don't even know the bible now if he can turn things on jesus again and get him to disagree with Moses, that will be it. In the mind of the Jew, in the mind of the Pharisee, what Moses said is not to be disputed. So if he can, they've got a pretty tough argument right here. If they can get him to disagree with Moses, they've really got him. There's a problem with their argument. There's a problem with their argument. The problem with their argument about Moses commanding to give a certificate of divorce is simply this. He never did make that commandment. He never did command that they give, that people give a writ of divorce. How do we know that? The reason we know that he never did make that commandment and never did do that is because what this statement is, is a statement that is coming from Deuteronomy 24, 1 through 4. In order for us to understand what Deuteronomy 24 verses 1 through 4 means, we need to turn there. Let's do the study. Turn with me. Near the beginning of your Bible, Where the white pages are, yeah. Deuteronomy 24, 1 through 4. They took this passage and said, Aha, see, this proves that Moses demanded or commanded that people give a writ of divorce. I'm going to have to show you some things too with the King James. We've got some problems with that. Verses 1 through 2. When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it happens that she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand, I believe the king who has a King James version there was a command there it says this and let her give let him give a da da da da da there's a problem with that I'm going to teach a little bit later hang on to that it does not say that the direct translation from the Hebrew does not give an imperative at that point it reads this way and this is the accurate rendering because he's found some indecency in her and he writes her a certificate of divorce there is no imperative there It is stating a fact. He has found an indecency in her, and because he found an indecency in her, we're even going to discover what that was later on, he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house. And she leaves his house and goes and becomes another man's wife. Okay, stop right there. What do we have? What we have right here is nothing but a statement of a situation. We've got a guy who marries a lady, okay? He doesn't like the lady. There is some indecency in this lady. We don't know what the indecency is yet. Because there is some indecency in her. He writes her a certificate of divorce. She leaves, and when she leaves, she becomes then another man's wife. I want you to note this. If you're taking notes, write it down. At this point, we do not have an editorial comment. We do not have an editorial comment. We do not have a command. There is no imperative in there, in a right translation. There is no condemnation of divorce. There is no commending of divorce. Again, I want to say that again. He isn't even condemning divorce here. There is nothing like that. It is just a statement of something that happened. A guy married a gal, found an indecency in her, told her to leave. She left. She married somebody else. Verses three and four. Let's read that. And if the latter husband turns against her and writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies who took her to be his wife, then her former husband who sent her away is not allowed to take her again to be his wife since she has been defiled, for that is an abomination. Lots of questions here. What does it mean she was defiled? Why is it that he sent her away, she got married, now she wants to come back, and it looks like it's all her fault? On and on. What do we have here? Let's just look very slowly. She leaves the first husband, she goes to husband number two. This lady evidently is some kind of loser, I guess, because husband number two doesn't like her either. Gets to husband number two. He says, get lost. In the meantime, husband number one figures that burned bagels are better than no bagels. And so he says, okay, honey, you know, it was really bad with you here, but I found out it's worse when you're gone. Come on back. God says no. You can't do that. Why? She's been defiled. Again, I'm going to study that a little bit later. I'm going to tell you what it is already. When that man sent that woman away, not commanded to do it, when that man sent that woman away for an indecency, that indecency was not adultery, it was something less than adultery. We're going to study that in a minute. And sent her out of that house for an illegitimate divorce, is what that fundamentally was, and she married someone else, what he did to his wife, when he sent her away for an illegitimate cause for divorce, He caused her or forced her to become an adulterer. That's what the defilement was. She became an adulterer when she married that other man. Now, I'm giving you an awful lot. I don't know if you can even follow this puzzle. I hope it's going to come because we're going to go over this. The point is this. There is a command in these four verses. The command is not to divorce. The command is in relation to remarriage. It is not related to divorce. It is related to remarriage. This person, having left this marriage for an illegitimate cause, even though they were pushed out, that man divorced his wife illegitimately, married someone else. When they did that, they committed adultery. But let me give you the rabbi's interpretation of that. I believe your notes follow that. The Jewish rabbi's interpretation of those four verses. It goes like this. That when husband number one found an indecency in his wife, he had to divorce her. Let him divorce her. Okay? What you've got in the King James Version, I'm not into cutting down the King James Version. I don't have time to do that. But what you have there is instead of the translators of that particular Bible taking the manuscripts and just translating it word for word, in this particular place, we see the translators of the King James Version picking up on the same rabbinical traditional interpretation that the rabbis had made mistakenly and interpreting it in that way. By the way, you find that from time to time. One of the things, here's my advertisement. One of the things I like about the New American Standard, personally, I don't think anybody's weird because they read another Bible, is because it's so literal. It's word for word. Sometimes it's confusing because of that. But it gives you the word for word translation. Sometimes even if the wording is clumsy, it gives you that. I like that. Here you have an interpretation and it ends up being a wrong one. You're going to have to trust me on the Hebrew. I don't have the time to go into all of it. But fundamentally, the accurate reading is that there is no command on divorce. The only command is that you can't remarry if you've been illegitimately divorced. That's the command. Because you've been defiled. Adultery. But it was this passage, these four verses, that the Pharisees built their whole theology of divorce on. Now you may remember last week that we talked about the fact that the Pharisees began to teach. In fact, the Hillel school of Pharisees taught that you could get a divorce for any cause. And they would build their whole theology on this thing. First of all, Moses gave a command for divorce. They came up with that by misinterpreting these four verses. Moses gave a command. He did not give a command. They decided that he did. Then they would take things like the indecency and they could define that any way you want. If someone commits an indecency and then Moses said, let them give a writ of divorce, then let's decide what an indecency is. And every time she commits an indecency, then we can give a divorce. You get it? Does that follow? What I know for sure is the interpretation of this passage is designed to teach us that if illegitimate divorce happens, in fact, I'm going to nail this down in a few minutes. If illegitimate marriage happens, remarriage is not appropriate. That's the point of this thing. What happens to her, I'm not real sure. I had a struggle with that myself. Okay, getting back to this. Again, this is the passage that the Pharisees built their whole theology around, and the fact is that they would say, when, now getting back to Matthew 19, so when those Pharisees came to Jesus and said, Jesus, why then did Moses command that they give a divorce and command to serve that certificate and get a divorce? The fact is, Moses never did command it. And their whole theology is based on a misinterpretation of Deuteronomy 24. But, hear this now, and I think this follows in the outline as well. But these two people did indeed get a divorce. And what my question is, I want to consider why. Well, what we know why and whether it was legitimate. Now, here's why I want to discuss this indecency. What was the indecency? Does that follow along? Look at the cause of this divorce. Was it legitimate? Verse 1, some indecency. Let's look at that. Why did he send her away? Why did he serve her a divorce because of some indecency he found. Literally, that means the nakedness of the thing. Write it down. Literally, indecency means the nakedness of the thing. It was some naked thing. It was some shameful thing. To the Jew and to the Pharisee who would take this now, this indecency that obviously is grounds for divorce if you believe that he commanded divorce in this point, then the the jewish pharisee would say what is an indecency well remember well how they how bad it got an indecency is if i see a girl who's prettier than my wife okay that makes her look indecent to me because she's prettier and i look back at my wife and she's not as pretty so she looks indecent now so now you just got all sorts of open doors to get divorced for what any cause that's exactly what they did all started from this thing let's get a scriptural use of the term indecent Deuteronomy 23. We'll stay right in the same book here. Deuteronomy 23 verse 12. This is a little crude, but we get a feel for it. Deuteronomy 23 verse 12. Just to see another use of the word indecent. You shall also have a place outside the camp and go out there, and you shall have a spade among your tools, and it shall be when you sit down outside, you shall dig with it, and you shall turn to cover up your excrement. Let's move right on. Verse 14. Since, why do you do that and cover up your excrement? Since the Lord your God walks in your midst, along with several other people, walks in your midst of your camp to deliver you and to defeat your enemies before you, therefore your camp must be holy. He must not see anything, what? Indecent among you, lest he turn away. What is indecent here? What is indecent? It's something vile, okay? That's, I think, it's excremental. It's something dirty. It's something sinful, embarrassing, okay? Embarrassing, gross. It is something, whatever the behavior of this wife was that was indecent, was something that you'd like to bury. It's something you wouldn't want anybody to know about. That's what we have in Deuteronomy 24. We have a wife who's acting shamefully. She is maybe, some, there is conjecture. Some of the commentaries we're talking about, she had terrible hygiene. I know that sounds bizarre. I knew a guy when I was just a young boy. I knew of a couple in the church I was growing up in where the woman divorced the man because his hygiene was so bad that she couldn't stand to be in the same room with him. He smelled bad. I mean, I know that's a little far-fetched, a little bizarre. But that was an indecent thing. That could have been part of the indecency, some sort of vile thing. Maybe she paraded herself. There is also some conjecture that that indecency was not adultery. And I'll tell you why I know it wasn't adultery in a minute. But it was some sort of parading of herself. A following in the neighborhood and maybe flirting with other men short of adultery. Whatever this behavior that was indecent was, we could call it vile. We could call it dirty, embarrassing, gross. It was not adultery. Whatever it was, it was short of adultery. How do we know that? The reason we know that is Deuteronomy 22. What does Deuteronomy 22 say? Deuteronomy 22 says this. If a man is found lying with a married woman, what would that be? Adultery, right? What do you do? You serve her a writ of divorce. No, you don't. Then both of them shall die. They die. That's the penalty for divorce in the Old Testament. Not for divorce, for adultery. The man who lay with the woman, and the woman, thus you shall purge the evil from Israel. If there is a girl who is virgin engaged to a man, and another man finds her in the city and lies with her, then you shall bring them both into the gate and they'll stone them. Okay. The results, adultery, in the Old Testament, Deuteronomy 22, at least as far as Deuteronomy 22, we believe there was a transition in God's dealing with people who committed adultery, but as far as Deuteronomy 22, when adultery committed, that marriage was dissolved. How was it dissolved? One of them died. And when one of them dies, you don't have a marriage anymore, and that person who is left is free to remarry. How do we know that? 1 Corinthians 7 says, you're bound to that woman, you're bound to that man until he, what? Dies. And then what? You're free. Okay? So in adultery, what would happen is they would die. They would get killed, and then that innocent party who wasn't involved in adultery would be free. Okay, we don't really know what this indecent behavior was, but we do know that it wasn't adultery. Why? Because if it was adultery, what? She would have died. They would have killed her. That's why we know the indecent behavior, whatever it was, wasn't adultery. We do know this, though. That whatever it was that she did, no matter how vile it was, it was not a legitimate grounds for divorce. That's another thing we know. How do we know that? Is this following along in the outline? It should be. Okay. It wasn't adultery because if it was adultery, she'd be dead. The other thing we know is that though she was divorced, it was not a legitimate grounds for divorce. How do we know that? Can you figure that out? Anybody? Because when she remarried, what happened? She was defiled. When she remarried, it became adultery. She didn't commit adultery. They didn't commit adultery until she divorced, until he divorced her. And then she went away and started another relationship. And that became adultery. And that's the defilement. No death penalty. No death penalty. Just wait. I'm going to talk about that in a minute, too. When she remarried, she became defiled. Now that adultery is committed. But the problem is, and this is the question, he dumped her. That doesn't seem fair. I don't think it does either. It's kind of troubling to me. And that is right. But what it really does is it really makes it worse for him. Because he is the cause. He literally made her an adulteress. And he's accountable to God for that. Now I want you to know something. What I'm just sharing with you here, there might be some troubling dimensions of this. We're going to wade through this. But this is what this principle that Deuteronomy 24 is bringing. Not a command of divorce at all. But a command about remarriage, if that divorce was illegitimate, is exactly what Jesus says in Matthew 5.32. Matthew 5.32, where he says this. Anyone who divorces his wife, except for what? Except for the cause of unchastity or immorality or adultery, he makes her an adulterer. He makes her an adulterer. That's exactly what happened in Deuteronomy 24. The point of Deuteronomy 24, 1 through 4, is this. That if you divorce a wife for any cause short of adultery, you cause her to what? Become an adulterer. And if you cause whoever marries her to become what? An adulterer. And if you remarry, you are committing what? Adultery. For any cause short of adultery. So, far from Deuteronomy 24, again, this is the whole point. I'm bringing you back to why I'm teaching this. Far from Deuteronomy 24 being a command to divorce if the wife commits some indecency, it is about 180 degrees from that is what Deuteronomy 24 is teaching. It is making the consequence of divorce short of adultery so severe that you'll stay married. Get it? That's the point of Deuteronomy 24. He's saying this. Be careful about hanging on to that wife and making that union work. Why? Because there aren't any good options. There aren't any good options. By the way, a little side note, in the light of this teaching, the Pharisees, we already know, were not only involved in adultery, but they were, by their teaching on divorce and remarriage, promoting it. Why? Because you could get a divorce for any cause and remarriage, no big deal. Any old thing you wanted to do. So they'd be promoting it. Counterpunch number two, the affirmation. Counterpunch number two, back to Matthew 19. And I'm going to get down to that thing about why adultery didn't cause death later, okay? The affirmation, verse 8 and 9. And Jesus said to them, Because of your hardness of heart, Moses permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not that way. That's interesting. He says here that Moses did permit you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning that was never God's design. simply means this. It was never God's design for divorce. Why? Because what he put together, what he created, no man should put apart. And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality and marries another woman, commits adultery. That's exactly what we just got in what? Deuteronomy 24. Same lesson. Okay, I called this the affirmation. Counterpunch number two, the affirmation. What is it an affirmation of? It is an affirmation that Moses did indeed allow divorce under certain circumstances. Okay, what circumstances? Moses did allow divorce. He never did command it, never did command it as the Pharisees pretend, but he did allow it under certain circumstances. On what basis did he allow it? That's question number one. Again, I'm moving on here, right? Yeah, question number one, on what basis did he allow it? The fact is this, we don't know from any Old Testament accounts where Moses said, I allow divorce. We don't have any quotes from Moses on that. It doesn't say. Jesus here in this verse, however, affirms the fact that Moses did allow divorce under certain circumstances. But it wasn't for anything less than adultery. It wasn't for anything less than adultery. How do we know that? Because he didn't allow it for the indecency of Deuteronomy 24. It wasn't allowed for the indecency of Deuteronomy 24. So whatever that indecency was, again, no matter how vile it needed to be dealt with, it shouldn't be ignored, but it wasn't a legitimate cause for divorce, even if it was that kind of vile thing. Question number two, on what basis did he allow it for something we know that he did? The question number two, was it allowed in the case of adultery? Was it allowed in the case of adultery? As far as Deuteronomy 22, in terms of history, divorce was not the option. Death is what happened. That's what dissolved. I suppose people did indeed break their marriage vows and things like that, but what happened up to that point was that death was the verdict. If they found them lying together and they were married, there was death. That's what dissolved the marriage. Somewhere along the line, however, God showed mercy and began to deal graciously with people and allowed divorce and not death. In the part of the guilty party, he allowed that man or that woman who committed adultery, he spared that person death, but allowed divorce. Let me keep going here. Question number three, what happened to the death penalty? What happened to the death penalty? We don't know for sure. We only know that some kind of transition was made that we don't understand fully. Maybe it was the kind of thing where God did indeed. Maybe it's never been removed. Maybe it's never been removed. What do you mean by that? Remember when Ananias and Sapphira came to God and they were lying to the Holy Spirit and they were struck dead right there and they died? But not everybody who's ever done that has died. Not everybody who's ever done that has died. There's been people along the way who have. It might, however, be that God, in his judicial action, even today, would do something like that. I know of a man in my former church, who at one time in his life was an elder of the church. I know for a fact that he's a Christian. He knows the word of God backwards and forwards. He got involved with a woman who was not his wife. she was indeed another man's wife. And I remember fearing for that person, not so much because of what he did, that was bad, but because of what he knew, and he was doing it anyway. And how far he had come with God, and the relationship he had with God, and the way God had used him, and he was doing it anyway. And after he was confronted once, twice, three times before the church, disciplined out of the church, I remember having an overwhelming sense that his life isn't worth a nickel. Now, this isn't coming out of a Bible study that said you die if you do this. But because of his hard-heartedness in this adulterous situation, to this day he's with her, I remember feeling like his life is not worth a nickel. And kind of what I meant, I didn't think any death thing about that, but kind of what I meant in terms of joy, in terms of fullness, in terms of ever being happy and really enjoying this relationship, not worth a nickel. The fact is right now he's got a brain tumor and he's dying. Now, I don't want to get weird about this or anything like that. But there are ways in which God, I believe, still does deal judiciously with people, especially people of God, I think, who know the Word of God, who have the Spirit of God within them, and they develop a hardness of heart. But in terms of the death penalty, I had David as an example of somebody who committed adultery. Yes, he committed adultery. Did he die? No, he didn't die. Why? God was gracious. Solomon. Did he commit adultery? Only heaven knows how many times. Did he die? No. But somewhere along the line, in terms of the death penalty every time for adultery, that began to be moving into a transition time. The point, by the way, by the way, I need to make a note here. In Matthew 19, Jesus mentions hardness of heart. There was in them not only a hardness of heart toward relationships, but it is dealing also with a hardness of heart in terms of adultery, in terms of divorce. There was a hardness of heart. The point is that when you have an adulterous situation, an adulterer who is unrepentant and irreconcilable, God will allow or actively sever that marriage. How might he do that? One, he might bring death. That would sever the marriage. The other is divorce. That would sever the marriage. Divorce, at best, from what I'm able to understand in a biblical understanding, divorce is a concession at best. It is a concession on account of sin to make life bearable for the innocent party. Get that. Okay? Get that. And only in the case of hard-hearted adultery. Divorce is a concession on account of sin to make life bearable for the innocent party, but only in the case of hard-hearted adultery. Not even adultery. We talked about that when we went through 1 Corinthians 7, that adultery does not dissolve a marriage. Remember that? We talked about that last Sunday night, too. Adultery, just a one-time thing, or maybe several times, does not dissolve a marriage. Hard-hearted adultery does become cause as a concession for the protection of that innocent party. If God is being gracious, then, to the guilty, by not taking his life, would you agree that that's grace? That that's mercy? Maybe it's mercy. Okay, it's not grace, it's mercy. That he is being merciful to the guilty by not taking his life, which would free that innocent party. He is not then going to punish the innocent party. I believe that that innocent one who has been, who's had adultery committed to them, hard-hearted adultery, divorce has resulted, rather than death, I believe that that person then is free to remarry. We're going to go into that more next week. B, an Old Testament survey affirms the consequences of adultery, that they are either death or divorce. And some of these pictures aren't even in terms of marriage, they're in terms of relationship. But the concept is what I want to communicate. Turn first to Isaiah 50, verse 1. A concession on the account of sin. It is at best a concession on the account of sin to make life bearable for the innocent party. The only two options, divorce or death, one or the other. Old Testament survey affirms the consequences of adultery. as being death or divorce. Isaiah 50 verse 1. Thus says the Lord. Now, what we have here is God describing himself as the husband of Israel. That's the relationship he's using. Thus says the Lord to Israel. Where is the certificate of divorce by which I have sent your mother away? Or to whom of my creditors did I sell you? Behold, you were sold for your iniquities and for your transgressions. Your mother was sent away. The point is this. where is your certificate of divorce they were becoming idolatrous they were adulterous spiritually okay Israel was and he is saying to them where is your certificate of divorce how would they get a certificate of divorce for some indecency only one way what was it adultery spiritual adultery and he's saying I have never committed adultery to you I have never left you I have never moved away from you I have been faithful to you God is speaking to Israel where is your certificate of divorce? That's the only way you'd get it. Okay, let's move on. There's a little one in Jeremiah a little more clear than this, than that. Jeremiah 3, 8. In fact, let's start in verse 6. Then the Lord said to me, in the days of Josiah the king, have you seen what faithless Israel did? She went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and she was a harlot there. And I thought, after she had done all these things, she will return to me. Again, the same picture of God the husband to Israel the wife. She will return to me, but she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. And I saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel, I had sent her away and given her a writ of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she went and was a harlot also. I sent her away and gave her a writ of divorce. For what? For adultery. What kind of adultery? Spiritual adultery. Consistent, hard-hearted, spiritual adultery. In a relationship with God, he's using to describe as a husband and wife, there was a divorce given. He could have killed him. He could have wiped him out. Divorce instead. For 700 years, you need to understand, God has been calling to his wife Israel. For 700 years, Israel has been consistently joining herself with other gods, with other husbands, if you will. And in verse 8, who divorces here? God why adultery this is important this is important the reason it's important is because I don't think that God does things that aren't right and the second thing is I don't think that he gives us living illustrations of his own behavior that we can't follow okay Jeremiah 31 33 31 to 32 simply just affirms the fact that he did indeed divorce Israel he's talking about the possibility of reconciling here, but it's talking about the fact that it did indeed happen. Verse 31 and 32, behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day he's talking about here of reconciliation, but I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them, declares the Lord. What does that say? Although I was a husband to them. At one time we were married, I am no longer that way. We're talking now of reconciliation, but there was divorce. Okay. Matthew 1, 18 and 19. Turn to that quick. Matthew 1, 18 and 19. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. And Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, because it was a righteous name, man and not wanting to disgrace her, decided to put her away secretly. Verse 19, not wanting to embarrass her, he decided to put her away secretly. Why? Because as far as he knew at that point, he had committed, she had committed adultery. Okay. Again, the point for the putting away would be what? Would be adultery. He found out later that that was not the case. But one of the things I wanted to point out was that because he was a righteous man, his response to adultery was that. Initial response was to put away. Although the word of God, I think, firmly would teach that that would be hard-hearted adultery. Again, those things are just to affirm the fact that divorce because of adultery was a biblical concept. That is what happened. Death or divorce. Synopsis. Let me put it together. The only legitimate basis for divorce in the Old Testament was adultery. Okay? Write that down. Synopsis. The only legitimate basis for divorce in the Old Testament was adultery. Adultery would break that relationship two ways. One, up to Deuteronomy 22, was death. And that would dissolve the marriage. Two, God dealt mercifully. In the case of hard-hearted adultery, he would allow divorce. Important question. Again, we've already dealt with this, but why did divorce replace death? What he already suggested is that his dealing with them mercifully, graciously. The other possibility, one other possibility, is that it's very possible that there was no one bold enough anymore to inflict it, to carry it out, the punishment. There was maybe no one left pure enough to deal with this anymore. And it had become so rampant. Who knows? John 8, interesting story where the woman was caught in adultery. You remember that? She was caught right in the act. And they were going to stone her. And Jesus stopped and said, Let him who is without sin cast the first stone. and they all left. Why? Well, one of the reasons was every one of them, most of them themselves, were guilty of adultery at one point or another, at one time or another. That's when he began even to bring all these other kinds of teachings about, you say, adultery is this, I say, if you even think about it, da-da-da-da. Okay, moving on. Back to Matthew 19, verse 9. God never intended divorce for any reason. In fact, that's why he says, That's what I'm getting that from, is that Moses permitted you to divorce your wives. Why? Because of adultery. But from the beginning, it has not been that way. This has never been God's design. In fact, that is God's design so strong that if one did break a marriage with adultery, it brought death. But God was gracious and merciful, and where there was hard, except for pornea. And Mary's another woman commits adultery. and marries another woman, commits adultery. The key phrase there is except for porneia. Now, we don't want to approach this legalistically and look for the exception and jump all over that and go, okay, great, I can find a way to get out of this. The fact is that that is the exception. The fact is that that is the legitimate cause for divorce. Porneia is used many, many times in the word of God to refer to immorality, fornication, adultery, and when you get a divorce for anything other than adultery, you proliferate more adultery. This is not a new truth. This is not a new truth. If you get divorced and remarried for any other cause than adultery, you just proliferate adultery. That's in Deuteronomy 24, 1 through 4. We saw that. In Matthew 5, 22, we saw it there too. In 1 Corinthians 7, 10, when we're in 1 Corinthians 7, 10, it says it there as well. Pornea, the word there, is the commonly used term for adultery. So we've seen Jesus uphold God's ideal. We have seen him silence the Pharisees. In fact, he has made it clear that they are adulterers. Why? Because their doctrine, which says you can divorce for any cause, has put people in a position when they get divorced for any cause and they remarry. That's when adultery just begins to flow like crazy. So he's exposed them as adulterers. And while they tried to discredit him, he has turned the tables on them and turned this whole thing around. Now let me draw this to a conclusion. Point number three. Let's say for some of you it's too late. Let's say that you're already divorced. Maybe the problem was adultery. Maybe the problem wasn't adultery. Maybe the problem was that there was a point in your life when you were in a place where you were so carnal or out of touch with what God wanted for you. Maybe you weren't a believer. maybe it was before you were a Christian, maybe it wasn't before you were a Christian. When a man is beating his wife up, I tell you what, we're going to talk about that next week, because that's what I'm leading to right here. I think there are some things, and I don't want to just jump into that with two minutes and saying what I think about that, because I want to go into that deeply next week. There's some strong things I feel about that. Okay? Okay. But what if we have something like that? What if a man is beating his wife? Do you mean you just say, no, stay together, be a submissive wife, okay? But what if, I want to get back to what I was talking about, what if it's too late and you're already divorced and you feel like you've blown it? We're going to hit this hard next week, but some things are clear. There are some cases where remarriage is appropriate. Romans 7.3, what is it? When the husband dies, okay? So if somebody dies, then it is appropriate. 1 Timothy 5.14 talks about the same thing. I don't have time to look it up. You can look it up if you want, but it's talking about widows, and if widow, they're talking about young widows specifically, and if the woman is a young widow, the encouragement is to remarry, so that they don't run into other kinds of problems, so the encouragement is if they die, remarriage is obvious, now that's obvious to all of us, okay, but what about the situation where I'm a victim of hard-hearted adultery, or what about the situation where maybe I was, wasn't even a believer, now I'm a believer, and I'm, I, I, the possibilities of going back. Maybe I should go back to that other relationship. What should I do? What this does, and the questions I'm bringing up right now, opens the door to our whole study now, having done all this background stuff on divorce and adultery and death and all these other things, opens the door of what I think now will be a real clear understanding of 1 Corinthians 7, which we're going to get into next week. As he, as Paul, begins to take the teaching of Jesus, which has been like walking through, just plowing through hard ground here, and next week applies it to practical situations where people were just like that. Remember? What was their situation? They were being saved out of all sorts of problems. Some of them were married two or three times and coming to Paul saying, what do we do now? What's our situation now? Can we remarry? Should we go back and reconcile all that stuff? And all of that stuff we're going to open up next week. That's where, see where we get into 1 Corinthians 7, which is so interesting to me, is because he does indeed deal differently with different kinds of situations. I would say right off the top of my head, if we're dealing with hard-hearted adultery, if it's hard-hearted adultery and the track record is clear, I know of situations, for instance, where, okay, I can give you one. The woman, in fact, I knew this couple because they went to Bethel. And the woman in this situation got married and we knew of this couple at Bethel. And while we were at Bethel and knew them, not everybody at Bethel does this, by the way. She got involved in adulterous situations. Okay? And we knew of that. And I knew the guy. And he forgave her and brought her back. And that was, the reconciliation was there. And it happened again. And it happened again. And it happened again. Okay? And every time there was reconciliation. And I believe there's reconciliation. Again, that's getting back to the thing adultery does not dissolve a marriage. Okay? What finally happened was this. She committed adultery again, only this time she said, I've had it this time. I really want out of this. And she got the divorce. And now he's there. What do we do? Well, he's free to remarry, as far as I'm concerned, and as we study this thing. That's hard-hearted adultery. I'm sure there's other definitions of hard-hearted adultery as well. But that's where I'd be at with that. So it would depend. But again, if it was an adulterous situation where I committed adultery against my wife, and I was repentant, I don't think she would have grounds for divorce. That wouldn't be. I mean, and I'd slug her if she did. No, I would not. Okay, we're going to get into some of the meaty, practical things next week, so I encourage you to be back with us. Let's stand and be dismissed.
