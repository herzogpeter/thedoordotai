Church of the Open Door is located in Maple Grove, Minnesota. We are a large community of followers of Jesus who care about truth, grace, and lives transformed. For more information, visit us online at www.thedoor.org. Well, before we get to the ministry of the Word this morning, we have something I think very exciting and also very important in the life of our church to deal with. And to do it, I'm going to ask the Board of Elders, whoever's here from the Board of Elders, to join me up here along with the executive team. And one thing I'd even add, any former elders, any men or women who are here who used to be elders or on our Board of Elders to come and join me on the stage in order to publicly do two things. First of all, to publicly acknowledge and to bless a very significant transition of authority. In all my years, these transitions of authority have happened before, but I don't remember ever doing it publicly, and it feels like it's very important to do it this very way. The transition of authority is from Judy Haugen, who has served on our Board of Elders for the last eight years. This is Judy here. She has served as a chairperson of our Elder Board for the last six years. To Kristen Evenson, the shift of authority to Kristen, who's right there, who gave the announcement just a moment ago. who in the course of the past year, in ways unseen to most of you, but seen to me and to us as other elders, has shown herself to us to be the person that we believe is called by God for such a time as this to now take on the responsibility of that role as a chairperson of our elder board that is being vacated by Judy. A word about Judy. Word to Judy. Thank you For things Yeah There's something funny about church leadership Because leadership are people who are out front You know you should You know everything But the truth is The truth is There's a lot of leadership in the church That no one sees And in ways unseen For your faithfulness Steadfastness For your wisdom your courage, and quite frankly, as I reflected on my time with you, how when waters were the most turbulent, you were at your best. Thank you. And secondly, publicly acknowledge that transition, but also to publicly acknowledge and bless the confirmation of four new elders. Now, four new elders is a big thing. And it even speaks to, I think, a kind of healing in our church, a kind of healing even on our elder board. Again, not all of you are kind of tracking with our leadership here, but even a year ago, we talked about the fact that there was a depletion on our elder board. One of our elders actually died. There was a sense of even being under something. And there's been in this last year a sense of God breathing life back into some things and helping us identify who are the elders who are the men and women who've been called by God to carry this this thing with us and the four new elders are are these Paul Smythe where are you raise your hand there you are Paul Smythe Nancy Abbott Wayne Theron Kristen Evenson and Nina Barnes is not a new elder but she is returning to us and that's even symbolic of of kind of the the stuff we were in that Nina had to leave the board for her dealing with cancer, and we thought we were going to lose her as well, but didn't, and here she is. And, yeah. But all these men and women, after an extensive discernment process, which included congregational approval some weeks ago, have given their consent to carry this responsibility, to wear this mantle of an elder for such a time as this, and I personally am very grateful. And whether you know it or not, we, you, are very fortunate to have leaders like this. I'll just bring a word real quickly to you as elders. The word I want to give to you is from Acts chapter 20. And as I told you last night, this is from the Apostle Paul who is speaking to the Ephesian elders. And it's a real significant time because Paul has been with this church for a very long time. And he loves these elders, as I do you. but he's leaving in this story and so these are kind of the last words he's going to say to them and last words are always really significant words and he says to them and again with this energy of you guys this is it I'm going to see in fact at the end of this talk it says that Paul and the elders they wept together they embrace each other and they wept but here's the final word he says to them and it's my word to you be on guard be on guard for yourselves first of all watch your life and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. You got elected, you got voted in. No, no, no, no. The Holy Spirit has done this, has called you and identified you. Our work was to see what the Holy Spirit was doing in you, to say, yeah, that's one, and yeah, there's one. The Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God, and this is where the stakes go up and the heat gets a little higher, to shepherd the church of God, which he, that is Jesus, purchased with his own blood. And if you don't take a deep breath there, you didn't hear that. Because the church over which God has called us to oversee was purchased with his blood, a very high price. And among other things, what that means is this church, it isn't ours. It isn't ours. We are overseers. We are under shepherds of the chief shepherd and our faithfulness is to be faithful to that chief shepherd. And as we are, we will give good leadership. And I know you will. God bless you. And Judy, I almost called you Vicki. It's an inside joke. As our most recent chairperson of the elder board, I've asked you to just pray a prayer of blessing and confirmation. All right. Yeah, why don't we pray when we have the elders, new elders in the middle. And I would just invite you as a congregation, if you feel comfortable, all just even extend your hand as we lay our hands on these new elders. Just invite you to do that. Oh God, we are grateful that you have raised up these leaders from our midst and it was you. And we do extend our hand of blessing, our hand of affirmation on them as they serve us. And we pray that you would protect them as they serve, protect their homes, protect, we pray, their families. Give them, we pray, every spiritual gift needed, a deep sense of discernment, of godly discernment, a sense of wisdom, and a sensitivity in their hearts to your voice. And we pray in particular for Kristen, that she would have a deep filling of your spirit and a knowledge, a deep knowledge of your nearness to her as she wears that mantle of head elder. Jesus, we pray that they would have the vision to move toward all that you have in mind for this place at this time, that through them and the working of your Holy Spirit, that your kingdom would come and that your will would be done in their lives, but also we pray in the life of our being together as Church of the Open Door. And we pray these things, Jesus, in your marvelous name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And now God, by your spirit, breathe life into this. I'm going to invite you to open your Bibles to the book of Ephesians, actually. Today, the fifth chapter, the 18th verse, which is probably a surprise to some of you, maybe most of you, because most of you know that we have been dealing with the book of Colossians for the last decade or so. Most recently, I think, you know, we've been in Colossians chapter 3, verse 16, where for the last several weeks, Steve Weins and I have been doing our best to unpack and kind of examine what it means to let the word of Christ, to let Christ himself, this is Colossians 3, verse 16, richly dwell within you, with all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. So why now, Ephesians 5? Here's why. Because Ephesians 5, particularly verse 18 and following, is actually a parallel passage to Colossians 3. The Apostle Paul is saying to the Ephesian church pretty much the same thing that he's saying to the Colossian church, but he's saying it from a slightly different angle, using a slightly different metaphor, bringing us in a slightly different direction. But it's a direction that when I noticed it, I decided I want to go in that direction. So we can talk about, probably for the next couple of weeks, the Holy Spirit. Because in Ephesians 5.18, Paul says it this way, not just the words of Christ richly dwelling, but the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit of God, completely filling. So be not drunk with wine, it says in Ephesians 5.18, for that is dissipation, but be filled with or under the influence of the Holy Spirit. So in Colossians 3.16, he says, let the word of Christ, let Christ himself richly dwell. In Ephesians 5.18, he says, let the Spirit of Christ, or the Holy Spirit of God, completely fill you, be filled with the Holy Spirit, with all wisdom speaking to one another. It says in Ephesians 5, 19, Colossians 3, it says, teaching one another, and there you see the parallel, with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to God, always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even to the Father. So these two texts are saying pretty much the same thing in a slightly different way, using a slightly different metaphor, bringing us in a slightly different direction, and it's a direction I want to go. Because I want to talk about the Holy Spirit, about the filling of the Holy Spirit, first of all. But also, I want to talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the power of the Holy Spirit, maybe even the gifts of the Holy Spirit. We might talk about that next week. So be not drunk with wine. He says in verse 18 of Ephesians 5, for that is dissipation. Life doesn't come. There is no energy. Things get siphoned off from you, but be filled with, under the influence of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit. Who in John 16, verse 7, is being described by Jesus to the disciples as a reason for hope. The reason for hope is coming in the context of the fact that Jesus is going to be leaving them. So it's after the resurrection that John 16 kind of unfolds, just prior to the ascension, that Jesus makes this announcement in John 16, verse 5, that I am going now to him who sent me. I'm going now to the Father, and in my going there, I am leaving here, I'm leaving you, to which they responded with great sorrow. And sorrow, it says in verse 6, filled their hearts, which is understandable because he's going to leave them. But I tell you the truth, he says in verse 7, look at this, that it is to your advantage, actually, that I go away. For if I do not go away, the helper shall not come to you. But if I go away, I will send him to you. And he is speaking here. The helper is the Holy Spirit, who in Luke's gospel, Jesus calls the promise from the Father. And the promise of the Father is described as a clothing with power by Jesus, this spirit is going to clothe you with power, and it's a clothing with power that provides ordinary people like you and like me, ordinary people like this ragtag group of people to whom he's originally saying these things, the disciples, provides for them the capacity to live and to love and to do the works of the kingdom and to be the people of the kingdom that they could not do and It could not be were it not for power, as it were, from on high, to be clothed with some kind of energy or power that is beyond themselves. But dial back into the scene of Jesus telling them it's to their advantage that he leaves. And put yourself in that place, if you can. Hearing these words, be one of those disciples. Because there was a time, you see, not long ago before they had met Jesus, when their lives were just fine. though they weren't really going anywhere in their lives. They were going to live and die as fishermen or tax collectors. And while there's nothing wrong with those professions, they had no particular sense of purpose or passion in their lives. And then one day, one day, their life was kind of turned upside down. To say it was interrupted would be kind of an understatement by a man named Jesus who came from Nazareth. And when they met him, nothing was ever the same again. For three years, they had been so captivated by the things that he was saying and the things that he was doing that they had rearranged their entire lives around one thing, one single thing, just to be with him. Because I want to hear what he's going to say next, and I want to see what he's going to do next. But now he's telling us he's leaving us. And then it's to our advantage that he does that. One question. Who are you kidding? I don't believe that. I mean, maybe as I'm listening to this, looking at Jesus, maybe in my heart it's good for you, Jesus, to return to the one who sent you, to return back to the Father. I get all that. But for us, for me, to never hear that voice again, speak of the Father's love or the nature of the kingdom to never see those hands again perform another miracle or cast out another demon or live a different way all the while encouraging us that we could actually do the same. So this all sounds like a cruel joke that it could be to our advantage that you leave. Except, except that that's there's this one little thing of hope in your mind because you know Jesus well enough to know that he wouldn't say something this important if it wasn't true. What he said was this, that it is better, that it is more advantageous to you to live in the era of the Spirit than to live in the days when Jesus physically walked the earth. But even now, 2,000 years later, I kind of go, really? Because I'm not sure I always believed that either. Again, he called it the promise of the Father. In Luke 24, verse 49, the promise of the Father being the Holy Spirit. It's a promise that God the Father will give, he says in Luke 11, 13, to anyone who asks. Remember that? That was that passage a little over a year ago. if we as human fathers know how to give good gifts to our children, how much more will our Father in Heaven give to us the good gift of the Holy Spirit, which makes this Holy Spirit thing sound kind of simple, actually, because He'll give this thing to anyone who asks. So all you have to do is ask, but it raises a question, and it's a question that we've grappled with before on more than one occasion here at Open Door. The question is this, what exactly are we asking for? when we're asking for the Holy Spirit. In other words, who or what is the Holy Spirit? Well, the simplest and quickest answer at a theological level, like if you're going to some Bible school and you want to answer that question, he is the third person of the Trinity. Ding, ding, ding, ding. You got it right. There is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. According to John's gospel, can and needs to be received in some way. he said receive ye the Holy Spirit in John 20 22 it says that when he breathed on them he said receive the Holy Spirit so the Holy Spirit is received in some way not always sure how and then and then in Ephesians 5 this text we're kind of looking at today or at least it's kind of the catalyst for our thinking today Paul talks about the filling of the Spirit Acts 1 he talks about the baptism of the Spirit to be baptized into the Spirit specifically for power to do the works of the kingdom. So it's not just the presence of the Spirit that you get when you receive the Spirit. It's the power of the Spirit to do what you couldn't ordinarily do and to become who you couldn't ordinarily become. But even with that language, it all still sounds a little mystical and vague. In part because the language around the Holy Spirit is mystical and vague, embodied as it is in the language of metaphor. But here's the deal about metaphor. And you see this all through the scriptures, when you're dealing with something transcendent, quite often metaphor is the only word you can, or the only thing that you can use to try to get a picture of it. So always when speaking of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is like this, or he's like that. The baptism of Jesus, for instance. The Holy Spirit descended on him like a dove. It wasn't a dove. There probably wasn't a dove in sight. I hate to disappoint you, all these movies where we see an actual dove. It was like a dove. It's a metaphor. At Pentecost, in Acts 2, verse 1, it says that when the Holy Spirit came, this is the initial beginning of the church, there came from heaven a noise, and it was like a mighty rushing wind. It wasn't necessarily a mighty rushing wind. It was like that. Their attempt to describe what they felt, and maybe there was some physical sensation around it, but it was like a mighty rushing wind. And in various other places, at various other times, the Holy Spirit is seen and understood and described and experienced to be like fire and water, or wine, or wind, or oil, or rain. And I don't know if those metaphors or those pictures do anything for you, but they stir things in me. Very evocative for me. Indeed, they stir memories for me. I was thinking about this yesterday as I was kind of putting the final touches on this talk, and this memory came to me of early days of ministries. A young, just a young man, even here, 27, 28 years old, and I would, in those days, talk to this buddy of mine named Dave Busby, and we would talk, we would dream stuff. We would just dream stuff, and we would kind of talk like this. Wouldn't it be something? Wouldn't it be something? And the church was kind of small in those days, but wouldn't it be something if we could be part of a church, and it could happen here at Open Door, where where the real reason people came to church wasn't just because we had a slick program or a fancy building or contemporary music or really cool sermons. What if the reason people really came to church was because they heard that there was a mighty rushing wind? Which is, this is what young people think because they're naive and they don't know, you know. They're too stupid not to dream things like that. I remember being in seminary and being taught things about church growth. And I'll never forget this because one of the principles of church growth was the top three necessities of growing your church is location, location, location. So where you physically are is how the church grows. And something in my heart relative to those things would just sink. And I began to think, what if, what if, you know, the Bible, Jesus said, in that same place around the glowing wind, Jesus said, a city that's set on a hill cannot be hid. So location matters most. But what if, what made you visible? What if what put you on a hill for people to see, what if that was a metaphor too? What if what made you visible in a community was the power of God? Was the moving of God? Was the wind of God blowing? In those stupid early days, it opened. We met in a gym. There wasn't a sign. Sometimes we would get kicked out of the gym, wouldn't be able to tell people where church was next week. Do any of you remember those days? But people came and they found it. Why? Because the wind was blowing and wine was flowing. but by far the most primary image of the Holy Spirit in all of scripture and this is an image that we're very familiar with here at Open Door because we talk about this a lot is the image of breath that the Holy Spirit of God is like the breath of God and when we talk about it this way we're kind of going back to the beginning of the story if you will indeed in both biblical languages in Old Testament Hebrew and New Testament Greek the same word is used for spirit as the word for breath first example again comes early Genesis chapter one chapter two rather verse seven in creation this spirit breath thing is there says this that the Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and when man took that in man became He breathed in the breath of life. He became a living soul. So there the Holy Spirit is, actually in creation, doing what the Holy Spirit does, what the breath of God does. And what it does is bring life. But even there at the beginning, in creation, it was a certain kind of life because God did not fill man's lungs and woman's lungs, Adam's lungs, with oxygen, just with oxygen. more was happening than his lungs being filled with oxygen. The text doesn't say that man became animated tissue. It says that man became a living soul, a spiritual being, filled with more than oxygen, filled with the breath of God. So there's a way in which, this is weird, because I think of the filling of the Spirit being in the New Testament, there's a way in which that at creation, man, humans, were full of the Holy Spirit. To be full of the Holy Spirit is to be full of life. And so this is our constant prayer. And if you're around Open Door, we pray this a lot around here. You may not always know why we do. Here's why we do. And I'm telling you today why we do. But here's the prayer of the Holy Spirit. Come and fill us. Richly dwell, Colossians 3.16, within us. So we can do what we couldn't do any other way. Come to life. And more and more and more to life. We still have dead places within us that need come to life. So Holy Spirit, come. One writer put it this way. Whenever the Old Testament refers to the Spirit of God, life is intended. Because vitality and aliveness is the essence of the Spirit. Psalm 104, 29. speaking of all living things says this that that that when you take away their breath any living thing they die and they are put to dust they return to dust but when you send your spirit in any environment they are created to come to life it's who the holy spirit is it's what the holy spirit does and it's part of what we're asking for when we're asking the holy spirit to come and to fill us to richly dwell within us in romans 8 verse 2 he's called the spirit of life in 2 Corinthians 3 verse 6 it says that the law kills but the spirit wherever it is gives life John 7 38 Jesus says that whoever puts confidence in me out of him will begin to flow rivers of living water and by this he meant the Holy Spirit whose primary function is to make dead things come alive inside of you inside of me in a church in a community and so we pray Holy Spirit come and fill us, richly dwell within us. This breath thing and wind thing continues. It's all over the scriptures. At Pentecost again, I already mentioned this. The mighty wind began to blow and fill the room. Could we argue that that mighty wind was the breath of God, that he was breathing in an unusually significant way upon the people and 3,000 came to life in one day because the breath of God, the wind of God was blowing. John 20, 21 again, he breathed on them and said, receive the Holy Spirit. Genesis 2, verse 7, again in creation, he breathed into their nostrils and man became a living soul. Bottom line is this. From the beginning of the story of God, we human beings were created by God and filled with the breath of God and were designed by God to live in communion with God, alive to God. not just behaving ourselves, but alive spiritually to God. For a while, that's exactly what happened. The dream of God started out that very way. As Adam and Eve walked with God in the cool of the day, picture the Garden of Eden, and they didn't hardly have to think about it. This communion with God, it was just kind of like, well, breathing in. Thinking in God and breathing it out. And then sin came and we forgot, in metaphor, how to breathe. And the whole human race has been gasping for air ever since. What was once so natural and easy is now labored and foreign, marked by starts and stops and gasping. And that's a description of your life and mine. Stops and starts and gasping for air. But the good news is this. That the breath of God, still around, still available. Not just for creating, as he did in Genesis 2, but for recreating like he did in Acts chapter 2, and not just for recreating, but for renewing, for restoring. And it's why whenever or wherever a fresh wind of God's Spirit begins to blow through a church or a city or a marriage or a family, it's called revival, for we are being, from a dead or dying place, revived. The breath came back. to the Holy Spirit is. It's what the Holy Spirit does. Because the Holy Spirit of God just never gives up for continually. Throughout history, not just at Pentecost, God by His Spirit has been looking for people who might be receptive enough, who might even be desperate enough for the breath of God. And to be desperate for this, what I'm describing, is a very good thing. And I'm going to come back to that at the end and explain why that's true. This amazing picture of what I'm trying to describe here in the Old Testament. We've talked about this before. I love this story. And whenever I talk about this, I bring up this picture. It's in Ezekiel 37 where God is giving to the prophet, the prophet Ezekiel, a vision for the spiritual condition of the people. And it's an interesting thing because the people are all physically alive, but the vision that God gives him of their spiritual condition is of bones, which speaks to death. There's something dead among the people, God says to the prophet. Ezekiel 37, verse 1, here's how it kind of unfolds. The hand of the Lord was upon me, says Ezekiel, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord, and he set me down in the middle of the valley, and it was full of bones. And at the end of verse 2, it says, and they were very dry, which is evocative. It speaks symbolically to this, that not only were these people dead, that's bones, but they were very dry, which means they'd been dead for a very long time, which speaks to hopelessness. Not only are they dead, but they've been dead a long, long time. And out of that vision, there comes this question. And again, you know, this is not a literal thing. This is a picture, and the prophet who loves the people is wondering, is there any hope? And so the question is, God, can these bones live? Is there any hope? for this thing or these people who are not only dead, but they've been dead for a very long time. So is there any hope for my marriage? It's not like that. It's been dead for a long time or for my heart. It's so dry, I've just kind of gotten used to it and I've even kind of forgotten that there's anything else. Is there any hope for this person who I love or for the church or for our church or for the way things are in the world or for actually experiencing the reality of things that we've been studying for so long in the book of Colossians where things like sexual immorality, impurity, loss, evil desire, and greed really would be put to death. Is there any hope for that? Can these bones live? Where things like anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive speech really are being laid aside and things like compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, and love really are being put on. Can these bones live? Is it possible? Is there hope? Verse 4, then the Spirit of the Lord answered and said, Verse 4, prophesy over these bones. And say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Which seems a little weird. Every time I talk about this, I kind of bring this up because it does seem a little weird to actually talk to something that if you actually saw someone doing that, you'd think they were very strange. but the picture I have is so vivid because it really is no more strange than preachers maybe all across America right now preaching to rooms full of people physically alive but spiritually desert. So he says speak to these dead bones which is another thing that's weird about that is talk, talk, what? Speaking, what is that going to do? But they're dead and they've been dead for a long time because all they ever really got was religion. They never got baptized into the spirits. They never got filled with his breath. So here's what I want you to do. Deliver the word. Tell them that I, verse 5, will cause breath to enter them and they will come to life, verse 6, and I will put sinews on you. I will make flesh to grow back on you and cover you with skin and put breath in you that you may come to life and you will know, not because you heard it in a sermon, or you sang the song you like the best, you will know because you were touched by me that I am the Lord your God, verse 14, and I will put my spirit in you, my breath. And you will come to life. And that is why we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Breath of God, come, wind of God, blow, O Spirit of God, fill us with your life. But with that picture, now fast forward it to Acts chapter 2 again. I've gotten in creation, we got the prophecy, and Ezekiel now come to Acts chapter 2, where when the Spirit is poured out again, they heard a noise like the sound of rushing when it was the breath of God. And Peter, it says, under the influence of the Spirit, he was filled with the Spirit. the Spirit was richly dwelling in him, began to explain and proclaim, verse 17, that this is what the prophet Joel was speaking of when he said in Joel 2.28 that in the latter days God would pour forth his Spirit on all men, on all flesh. This is very significant. The Spirit of God is going to be poured out on all flesh. The significance is this. Till now, the power of God seemed to be resident in And then the people were therefore dependent on kind of superstars like Moses and Jeremiah and Ezekiel. So now it's going to be poured out on all flesh, not just people like Moses and David and Ezekiel and Jeremiah, not just the superstars, because the gifts of the Holy Spirit are now going by the breath of God to be dispersed among the people, distributed among ordinary people, because now your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Young men will see visions. Old men will dream dreams. All flesh, not just a few, not just Jew even, but Gentiles too. Not just old, but young. Not just men, but women. In other words, anyone who asks for the life of the Spirit, the Father will give it. Indeed, his promise is clear. If you ask me for bread, I won't give you a stone. With all of that, hope begins to rise. at least it does for me maybe just maybe these dead bones can live these dry and barren places in our hearts in your heart could come to life these dry and barren places in our spirits in our community and even in our church could come to life and so we pray come breath of God blow a wind of God fill spirit of God because we're desperate for this kind of life. It can't be generated any other way but by the breath of God. And ironically, this often is when and where, this place of desperation, I talked about this, I said I was going to end with this here. It's often when and where we feel this desperation that the power of the Spirit is first experienced. It's in places of desperation where many of you, for the first time in your life, tasted the wine of the Spirit, and some of you can even reflect on your life. It wasn't a place of desperation that you began to ask in ways you'd never asked before because all of your resources to do anything were absolutely gone, and if there wasn't the life or the Spirit or the power of God, you had absolutely no hope. It comes when we're desperate. Remember the Beatitudes? I mean, if there's a teaching that is kind of embedded in the DNA of our church, it's the teaching of the Beatitudes, and some of you have heard them, and some of you haven't, but to really understand the Beatitudes, you've got to start in Matthew chapter 4, not Matthew chapter 5. 5 is where the Beatitudes are, but it really starts in chapter 4, where Jesus in Matthew 4 verse 12 begins his ministry. John the Baptist was taken into custody, and that was like the divine start of history went off. When he was taken into custody, Jesus withdrew into Galilee, and he began to gather his disciples to himself, and he said, follow me, and the disciples began to follow him. Something's going on here, and he began to do two things. began to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom, the good news of the kingdom, saying that the kingdom of heaven is within your reach. It's been far off for most of you. I am here to tell you that the reign of God is within your reach. It's something you can experience. And then he began to do the works of the kingdom, healing every kind of disease. Read Matthew 4, 12 to the end of the chapter, healing every kind of disease and sickness and illness among the people, casting out demons, and the response to that was predictable. Crowds began to come. Multitudes began to show up from Decapolis and from Galilee and from beyond even the Jordan. They began to come. Something's going on. The wind is beginning to blow and people were coming. And then it says in Matthew 5, we get the Beatitudes. Jesus, seeing the multitudes, did this bizarre thing. He withdrew from them. And bringing his disciples to himself, he gathered them around him on the side of a mountain and began to teach them, saying, and this is kind of my paraphrase, I got some good news and I got some bad news. The good news is this. All that power and authority and kingdom reality, healing, deliverance, all of that stuff is real. That's the good news. And the other good news is it's all for you. But here's the bad news. None of that power and effectiveness, none of that is going to come to who you think. None of it is going to flow through who you think. Because it's not going to come to the brightest and the best, necessarily. And there's nothing wrong with being the brightest and the best. But this power isn't going to come necessarily through them, to those who look good and know how, like the Pharisees, who were able to crank it out perfectly. No, no, here's the key to that kingdom life and power. Actually, in my kingdom, the blessed ones who are accessing this are the broken ones. Blessed are the poor in spirit, which is totally counterintuitive to all of us, but it's what he meant, and this was what was blessed about being poor in spirit and about being broken, because broken people are desperate people. Desperate people are way past thinking they can do it themselves, and people who are way past thinking they can do it themselves come up hungry for more, for the kingdom and for power. They come up hungry for filling. Blessed are those who recognize they can't save themselves. This is fundamental gospel here, because people who recognize they can't save themselves by doing it all perfectly come up hungry for grace. Blessed are those who recognize they can't sanctify themselves, hard as they try to be the perfect Christian. Desperate people come up realizing they can't, and out of that desperation they can either give up they can come up hungry for power and for filling. And Jesus says in the Beatitudes, the people who come that way get it. Because if you ask, I'll give it to you. But it most always comes from this sense of need. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. Through our dead places and our dying places and our desperate places. And as I close this morning, I just have to wonder, going back to that Ezekiel prophecy, and I just kind of even want to dial it down. I'm yelling and screaming here. I want to get quiet. I want you to get quiet. Anybody here asking that question in your own spirit? Can these bones live? And you know what that applies to in your particular life. And I just have to wonder, what is that dead place for you? That stuck place for you, that addicted place that you can't get free from, that confused and afraid place. And I wonder if in some quiet place right now, we could invite the Holy Spirit into that place. And so we pray, Holy Spirit, come. A couple weeks ago, a few weeks ago, I did a talk on worship, and we called worship the work of the people. And, you know, I'm up here working, you know. But I want to invite you into some work. It's not hard work. It's more quiet work. Would you just get quiet right now? In fact, there's kind of a discipline around this. I want you to get yourself in a comfortable position. Put your feet on the ground. Just kind of put your hands and just become comfortable in your chair. and I don't, this isn't a big thing, but I like to put my hands out like this. It's kind of a symbolic sign of surrender and that as a child, I need to receive something from the Father. And I just do some work. Where are those dead places? Where are the dry bones? As weird as the way the Spirit works and talks, He could be revealing some things to you right now because a lot of dry places in our life, we just got so used to it, we didn't even know that it was that dead. So just sit in this quiet and listen to the Spirit. Holy Spirit, come. Thank you. while you were praying I just lit a candle up here and you can look up here now if you want symbols are good for us they help us kind of in our humanness and the limitations of our humanity to grasp the unseen the transcendent symbols are good and I talked a lot about symbols of the spirit but this candle is kind of symbolic of the spirit looks pretty harmless but if it got released it would burn a lot of stuff down that speaks of destruction and that's not what the spirit does so I just ruined that analogy but I just wonder if where some of you are right now and what the spirit has just given to you when you think of this flame the Holy Spirit being present in this simple form that you're drawn to the flame and if you are it's weird and awkward but I'm going to ask you to come. In fact, all of us, why don't we just stand up? In this place of dryness, of need, the Spirit of God is here. He's not in this candle, but it's a symbolic, it's symbol, and it helps us. I just want you to come. I'm drawn to the flame of the Spirit. I want more that you just come from wherever you are just right now, come on. We're going to pray. It's good. Holy Spirit come to dry places and dead places you don't even know why you're coming you're just drawn sometimes to the flame to the life and the spirit and every time we do this and if you're new to open door we do this kind of thing a lot so it's a little weird but it's not weird for us. So you know, it matters sometimes to move. It helps us. But the work of the Spirit is not just up here. It's out there as well. Some of you are here to receive and some of you, I would just pray that some of you would be activated in the Spirit right now to pray. And it's weird because I know you know who you are. It's weird to talk like that. I know you know who you are. Some of you are being called by the Spirit right now to be activated in prayer. And so you join me as we pray. Holy Spirit, come. For people up in the balcony, sitting in the congregation, those who have come, Holy Spirit, come. Wind of God, blow. Breath of God, blow. Wine of God, flow. Fill us with your Spirit, with your life. to dry and barren places, come. To hopeless places, come. To stuck places, come. To desperate places, come with your life and with your breath. and fill this room and fill these people with your spirit so we can come to life. To more and more and more life. And I pray, Jesus, that this would for us continue to be a way of life. Not just this thing on Sunday, but a way of life to which we have been called in the spirit and all God's people said, Amen. Thank you.
